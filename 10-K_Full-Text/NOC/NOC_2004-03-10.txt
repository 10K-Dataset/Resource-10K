NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

PART I

Item 1.

Business

Northrop Grumman Corporation (Northrop
Grumman or the company) provides technologically advanced, innovative products, services, and solutions in defense and commercial electronics, nuclear and non-nuclear shipbuilding, information technology, mission systems, systems integration, and
space technology. As prime contractor, principal subcontractor, partner, or preferred supplier, Northrop Grumman participates in many high-priority defense and commercial technology programs in the United States and abroad. The majority of the
company’s products and services are ultimately sold to the U.S. Government, which accounted for 86.7 percent of total revenue in 2003, and the company is therefore affected by, among other things, the federal budget process.

History

Originally formed in California in 1939, Northrop Corporation was reincorporated in Delaware in 1985. In 1994 the
company purchased the outstanding common stock of Grumman Corporation and, effective May 18, 1994, Northrop Corporation was renamed Northrop Grumman Corporation. On April 2, 2001, NNG, Inc., a newly formed Delaware holding company, exchanged its
common shares for all of the outstanding Northrop Grumman Corporation common shares on a one-for-one basis, through a merger in which Northrop Grumman Corporation became a subsidiary of NNG, Inc. In connection with this merger, NNG, Inc. changed its
name to Northrop Grumman Corporation and the former Northrop Grumman Corporation changed its name to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (Northrop Systems).

In April 2001, the company purchased approximately 97 percent of the common stock and approximately 59 percent of the preferred stock of Litton Industries, Inc. (Litton).
The company issued 13 million shares of its common stock and 3.5 million shares of its preferred stock and paid cash for the balance of the Litton shares. In May and June 2001, the company acquired all of the remaining shares of Litton common and
preferred stock for cash.

In November 2001, pursuant to a tender offer that
expired on November 29, 2001, the company purchased approximately 80.7 percent of the outstanding shares of Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. (Newport News). For the year ended December 31, 2001, the company accounted for the remaining 19.3 percent of
Newport News common shares as minority interest. On January 18, 2002, the company acquired the remaining 19.3 percent of Newport News shares not purchased in the tender offer.

On December 11, 2002, the company issued 69.4 million shares in exchange for all outstanding shares of TRW Inc. (TRW) which consisted of two
defense related businesses and an automotive business (Auto). On February 28, 2003, the company sold Auto to The Blackstone Group for $3.3 billion in cash, a $600 million face value payment-in-kind note, initially valued at $455 million, and a 19.6
percent interest in the new enterprise, initially valued at $170 million. The acquirer also assumed debt of approximately $200 million. The cash received from the sale of Auto was adjusted from the sale agreement amount by cash sold with the
business, preliminary purchase price adjustments, and an asset retained. Cash proceeds from the sale were primarily used to reduce debt. The payment-in-kind note matures in 2018 and bears interest at an effective yield of 11.7 percent per annum. In
January 2004, the restrictions on the investment in Auto were amended to provide the company more flexibility in monetization. In February 2004, the company’s investment in Auto was diluted to 17.2 percent as a result of Auto’s initial
public offering. In connection with the acquisition of TRW, the company entered into a formal stipulation and consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice that was filed in the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia on December 11,
2002. Key provisions of the consent decree are intended to assure that the merger will not impede fair and open competition related to certain electronic satellite payloads. The consent decree does not require the divestiture of any businesses, and
permits the company to operate its businesses and those of TRW as planned. The retained portions of TRW represent the Mission Systems and Space Technology sectors discussed more fully herein. Additional information describing the aforementioned
mergers and acquisitions is contained in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.

-1-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

In 2002, the company decided to sell the majority of the businesses comprising its Component Technologies (CT) operating sector and sold two
businesses in its Electronic Systems sector; Ruggedized Displays and Electron Devices. These businesses and Auto are reported as discontinued operations. Additional information is contained in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part
II, Item 8.

Summary Segment Financial Data

In the following table of segment and major customer data, revenue from the U.S. Government
includes revenue from contracts on which Northrop Grumman is the prime contractor as well as those on which the company is a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is the U.S. Government. The company’s discontinued operations are excluded from
all of the data elements in this table, except for assets designated as held for sale. The 2002 income statement does not include TRW’s post-acquisition results as they were not material. TRW backlog acquired and assets at December 31, 2002,
are included in the following table. The following are certain factors to be considered when analyzing the segment financial data presented below:

Foreign Sales

– Foreign sales amounted to approximately $1.6 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.3 billion or 6.1 percent, 7.6 percent, and 10 percent of total
revenue for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. All of the company’s segments engage in international business, for which the company retains a large number of sales representatives and consultants who are not
employees of the company. Foreign sales by their very nature are subject to greater variability in risk than the company’s domestic sales, particularly to the U.S. Government. International sales and services subject the company to numerous
stringent U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to import-export control, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the
U.S. Export Administration Act. Failure by the company or its sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could in the extreme case result in
suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of the company’s export privileges, which could have material adverse consequences.

Unallocated Expenses

– The reconciling item captioned “Unallocated expenses” includes the portion of corporate, legal, environmental, state income
tax, other retiree benefits, and other expenses not considered allowable under Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) and not allocated to the segments.

Pension

– Pension expense is included in the sectors’ cost of sales to the extent that these costs are currently recognized under CAS. In order to
reconcile from segment operating margin to total company operating margin, these amounts are reported under the caption “Reversal of CAS pension expense included above.” Total pension (expense) income, determined in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, is reported separately as a reconciling item under the caption “Pension (expense) income.”

Goodwill

– During the second quarter of 2002, the company completed the first step of the required initial test for potential
impairment of goodwill as of January 1, 2002. The company used a discounted cash flow approach, corroborated by comparative market multiples, where appropriate, to determine the fair value of its reporting units. The results indicated potential
impairment only in the reporting units of the Component Technologies sector due to unfavorable market conditions. Accordingly, the company recorded a non-cash charge of $432 million, or $3.67 per diluted share, which is reported as “Cumulative
effect of accounting change.” For additional information see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8.

Realignment

– Effective January 1, 2004, the company realigned businesses among three of its operating segments that possess similar customers, expertise, and
capabilities. The realignment more fully leverages existing capabilities and enhances development and delivery of highly integrated information systems and services. Mission Systems’ Global Information Technology, Civil Systems, and Mission
Systems Europe businesses were transferred to the

-2-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Information Technology segment. Prior to January 1, 2004, the three business areas comprised Mission Systems’ Federal & Civil
Information Systems business. The Defense Mission Systems (DMS) business within the Information Technology segment was transferred to the Mission Systems segment. Prior to January 1, 2004, DMS is contained within Information Technology’s
Government Information Technology business. The Command, Control & Intelligence (C2I) Systems business area of the Missions Systems segment transferred its Unmanned Air Vehicle business to the Air Combat Systems (ACS) business area within the
Integrated Systems segment. Had the realignment taken place on January 1, 2003, 2003 sales would have been approximately $104 million lower than reported for the Information Technology sector, $57 million higher than reported for the Mission Systems
sector, and $47 million higher than reported for the Integrated Systems sector. Subsequent to December 31, 2003, all financial information will be presented reflecting the above realignment. The realignment is not reflected in any historical
financial information contained within this Form 10-K.

Reclassifications

– Certain amounts for 2002 and 2001 have been reclassified to conform to the 2003 presentation.

expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2004. It is not expected that these negotiations will either individually or collectively cause a material adverse effect on the operations of the company.

Environmental Matters

Federal, state, and local laws relating to the protection of the environment affect the company’s
manufacturing operations. The company has provided for the estimated cost to complete remediation where the company has determined that it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future to address environmental impact at current or
formerly owned operating facilities or at sites where it has been named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) by the Environmental Protection Agency or similarly designated by other environmental agencies. It

-7-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

is difficult to estimate the timing and ultimate amount of environmental cleanup costs to be incurred in the future due to the uncertainties
regarding the extent of the required cleanup and the status of the law, regulations, and their interpretations.

In order to assess the potential impact on the company’s financial statements, management estimates the possible remediation costs that reasonably could be incurred
by the company. Such estimates take into consideration the professional judgment of the company’s environmental engineers and, when necessary, consultation with outside environmental specialists. In most instances, only a range of reasonably
possible costs can be estimated. However, in the determination of accruals, the most probable amount is used when determinable and the minimum is used when no single amount is more probable. The company records accruals for environmental cleanup
costs in the accounting period in which the company’s responsibility is established and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The company does not anticipate and record insurance recoveries before collection is probable.

Management estimates that at December 31, 2003, the range of reasonably possible future costs
for environmental remediation is $251 million to $366 million, of which $271 million has been accrued, including $25 million recorded in liabilities of businesses held for sale. Environmental reserves are recorded on an undiscounted basis. At sites
involving multiple parties, the company provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability, taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties. Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized
as appropriate. Capitalized expenditures relate to long-lived improvements in currently operating facilities. In addition, should other PRP’s not pay their allocable share of remediation costs, the company may have to incur costs in addition to
those already estimated and accrued. Management does not believe that it will be required to assume a share of the liability of other PRP’s in an amount that would have a material effect on the company’s financial position or results of
operations. The company makes the investments it believes will be necessary in order to comply with environmental laws.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

Various claims and legal
proceedings arise in the ordinary course of business and are pending against the company and its properties. The company is a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos integrated into its premises and certain
historical products. Many of these claims have been dismissed with no payment and the remaining resolved claims have involved amounts that were not material either individually or in the aggregate. Based upon the information available, the company
does not believe that the resolution of any of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect upon its operations or financial condition.

-9-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Departments and agencies of the U.S. Government have the authority to investigate various transactions and operations of the company, and
the results of such investigations may lead to administrative, civil, or criminal proceedings, the ultimate outcome of which could be fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory or treble damages. U.S. Government regulations provide that certain
findings against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from future U.S. Government contracts or the loss of export privileges for a company or an operating division or subdivision. Suspension or debarment could have a material adverse
effect on the company because of its reliance on government contracts. Based on available information, the company does not believe, but can give no assurance, that any matter resulting from a U.S. Government investigation would have a material
adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition.

In August
1992, in U.S. ex rel. Rex Robinson v. Northrop Grumman Corporation, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois unsealed a complaint brought by four individuals in the name of the United States of America. The action was
filed on August 10, 1989, seeking damages under the

qui tam

provision of the civil False Claims Act. On July 28, 1992, the government declined to intervene in this action. Plaintiffs amended their damage claim and now seek compensatory
damages of approximately $369 million, which could be trebled under the False Claims Act, together with statutory penalties of up to $39 million, pre-judgment interest, loss of use of money and other unspecified damages for expenses, attorney fees,
and costs. The individual relators also seek damages in their individual capacities for alleged retaliation. In 2001, the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office filed a motion to intervene in the action, which motion was granted on
October 12, 2001. The company denies the allegations and continues to vigorously defend the action.

Environmental Matters

On July 10, 2003, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) issued a notice of
violation (NOV) to the Space Technology facility in Redondo Beach, California alleging sixty-four deviations from the operating conditions of an air permit. The SCAQMD and the company settled all counts alleged in the NOV by agreement dated December
19, 2003. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, on January 12, 2004, the company paid a monetary penalty of $15,000. The company is negotiating with the SCAQMD on other matters. Additional penalties, if any, are not expected to be
significant.

On April 24, 2003, Lucas Western Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the company upon the acquisition of TRW) entered into an Administrative Consent Order (Order) with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) for the alleged unpermitted discharge of pollutants into the waters of the State.
Lucas Western, Inc. agreed to eliminate discharges and pay a civil penalty of $100,000, of which $50,000 was paid, with the remainder suspended, but subject to assessment at DEC discretion in the event of a violation of the Order or applicable State
laws. The elimination of all unpermitted discharge of pollutants has been effected. It is anticipated that the Order will be terminated, thereby extinguishing the $50,000 penalty, in the first half of 2004.

Other Matters

In the event of termination for the government’s convenience, contractors are normally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred subsequent to termination. The company received a
termination for convenience notice on the Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile (TSSAM) program in 1995. In December 1996, the company filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims seeking the recovery of
approximately $750 million for uncompensated performance costs, investments, and a reasonable profit on the program. In prior years, the company had charged to operations in excess of $600 million related to this program. Northrop Grumman is unable
to predict whether it will realize some or all of its claims, none of which are recorded on its balance sheet, from the U.S. Government related to the TSSAM contract.

Item 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW

Northrop Grumman provides
technologically advanced, innovative products, services, and solutions in defense and commercial electronics, nuclear and non-nuclear shipbuilding, information technology, mission systems, systems integration, and space technology. As a prime
contractor, principal subcontractor, partner, or preferred supplier, Northrop Grumman participates in many high-priority defense and commercial technology programs in the United States and abroad. Northrop Grumman conducts most of its business with
the U.S. Government, principally the Department of Defense (DOD). The company also conducts business with foreign governments and makes domestic and international commercial sales.

2003 Results

The 2003 financial
statements include TRW Inc. (TRW), which was acquired on December 11, 2002. This acquisition had a significant effect on the company’s operations and is an important factor to be considered in comparing 2003 results with 2002 results. Selected
financial highlights are presented in the table below.

Sales increased in 2003 over 2002 by
$9 billion, or 52 percent, due to the $6.7 billion of sales contributed by the newly acquired TRW business segments (Space Technology and Mission Systems) and the $2.3 billion, or 13 percent, growth in the company’s heritage segments
(Electronic Systems, Ships, Information Technology, and Integrated Systems). Operating margin for 2003 increased by $147 million, or 11 percent, over 2002, reflecting $451 million from the new segments and an increase of $225 million, or 17 percent,
from the heritage segments, offset by increased pension cost. Total operating margin in 2003 includes pension expense of $568 million compared with pension income of $90 million in 2002. Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) pension expense increased to
$265 million in 2003 from $100 million for 2002.

Net income for 2002 included
a $432 million charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change on January 1, 2002, to recognize the impairment of goodwill in the company’s Component Technologies reporting units, and an additional goodwill impairment loss of $186
million reported in loss from discontinued operations.

Earnings per share are
based on weighted-average diluted shares outstanding of 184.2 million for 2003 and 117.4 million for 2002. The significant increase in shares outstanding is primarily the result of the acquisition of TRW in exchange for stock.

Cash provided by operating activities was $891 million lower in 2003 compared with 2002. In
2003, cash provided by operating activities was reduced by approximately $1 billion for taxes paid related to the completion of the B-2 Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

In February 2003, the company sold the automotive business (Auto), a component of TRW, for $3.3 billion in cash, a payment-in-kind note, and
an interest in the new enterprise. The cash received was used primarily to reduce debt. In 2003, the company also implemented a share repurchase program of up to $700 million of its outstanding common stock, purchasing over 2.2 million shares for
approximately $200 million as of December 31, 2003.

Outlook

Through sixteen acquisitions over the past decade the company has evolved from an aircraft manufacturer into a global enterprise focused on providing a broad range of
products and services needed to meet the nation’s defense and homeland security challenges. The company believes that its portfolio of technologically advanced, innovative products, services, and solutions in systems integration, defense
electronics, information technology, advanced aircraft, shipbuilding, and space technology will generate revenue growth in 2004 and beyond. In 2004, based on its current total backlog (funded and unfunded) of $58 billion and its opportunity to win
future programs, the company expects revenue of approximately $28 billion and improvements in net income and cash provided by operations over 2003. The major industry and economic factors that will affect the company’s future performance are
described in the following paragraphs.

Industry Factors

While Northrop Grumman is subject to the usual vagaries of the marketplace, it is also affected by the unique characteristics of the defense industry and by certain
elements peculiar to its own business mix. Lockheed Martin Corporation, The Boeing Company, Raytheon Company, and General Dynamics Corporation are among the largest companies in the defense industry at this time. Northrop Grumman competes against
these and other companies for a number of programs, both large and small. Intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of Northrop Grumman’s business and the defense industry. It is common in this industry for work
on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract, turn out to be a subcontractor. It is not uncommon to compete with a peer company and, simultaneously
on other contracts, to be either a supplier to or a customer of such competitor. The nature of major defense programs, conducted under binding contracts, allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity unknown in
many industries.

An individual company’s success in the competitive
defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products, as well as its ability to provide the people, facilities, equipment, and financial capacity needed to deliver those products with maximum efficiency. It is necessary to
maintain, as the company has, sources for raw materials, fabricated parts, electronic components, and major subassemblies. In this manufacturing and systems integration environment, effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to
success as managing internal operations. Northrop Grumman’s operating policies are designed to achieve these objectives.

Economic Opportunities, Challenges, and Risks

The defense of the
United States and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries requires the ability to respond to one or more regional conflicts, terrorist acts, homeland security, and proactive threat identification. Such engagements may require
unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from passive surveillance to active engagement, deterrence, policing, or peacekeeping. In addition, the DOD’s strategy continues to be affected by the general public’s concern for placing
military or civilian personnel at risk. As a result of these trends, both the United States and other NATO countries are increasingly relying on sophisticated weapon systems that provide long-range surveillance and intelligence, battle management,
and precision strike capabilities combined with the ability to rapidly deploy complete defensive platforms around the world. Accordingly, defense procurement spending is expected to be weighted towards the development and procurement of advanced
electronics and software that enhance the capabilities of individual weapons systems and provide for the real-time integration of individual surveillance, information management, strike, and battle management platforms.

-14-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

United States defense contractors have benefited from the upward trend in overall defense spending over recent years. Defense spending in
NATO countries has stabilized, while those countries continue to increase their focus upon the development and procurement of advanced electronics and information systems capabilities. Although the ultimate size of future defense budgets remains
uncertain, current indications are that the defense budget will increase over the next five years. Looking forward, based on the 2004 budget submitted by the President of the United States, the company continues to plan for steady, sustainable
growth in national security spending. The Future Year Defense Program (FYDP) shows an increase to the DOD investment accounts of about 3 percent for 2005, with double-digit increases in areas like missile defense. The remainder of the FYDP shows
approximately 6 percent annual growth through 2009. The company believes that spending on recapitalization and transformation of our homeland security and defense assets will continue to be a national priority, with particular emphasis on areas like
national missile defense.

Substantial new competitive opportunities for the
company include space based radar, aerial common sensor, transformational communication system, the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (J-UCAS), and several international and homeland security programs. The company continues to focus on operational
and financial performance for continued growth in 2004 and beyond.

U.S.
Government programs in which Northrop Grumman either participates, or strives to participate, must compete with other programs for consideration during our nation’s budget formulation and appropriation processes. Budget decisions made in this
environment will have long-term consequences for the size and structure of Northrop Grumman and the entire defense industry.

Northrop Grumman has historically concentrated its efforts in high technology areas such as stealth, airborne surveillance, battle management, precision weapons, systems
integration, defense electronics, and information technology. Through its acquisitions of Litton Industries, Inc. (Litton), Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. (Newport News), and TRW, the company now has a significant presence in space technology,
Command, Control & Intelligence (C2I), federal and civil information systems, missile systems, and the manufacture of a broad range of ships including aircraft carriers and submarines. The company believes that its programs are a high priority
for national defense, but there remains the possibility that one or more of them may be reduced, extended, or terminated.

The company provides certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of non-conforming items for a specified period of time. Most of the company’s
product warranties are provided under government contracts, the costs of which are generally recoverable from the customer.

Prime contracts with various agencies of the U.S. Government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations, including the
False Claims Act, and The International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in fines, penalties, debarment, or suspension from receiving additional
contracts with all U.S. Government agencies. Given the company’s dependence on U.S. Government business, suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company’s future.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

BUSINESSES ACQUIRED

The current composition of
Northrop Grumman Corporation is the result of a series of strategic acquisitions, mergers, and divestitures.

In 2001, the company purchased Litton, the Electronics and Information Systems Group of Aerojet-General Corporation (EIS), and 80.7 percent of Newport News. On January 18, 2002, the company acquired the remaining
shares of Newport News. The Litton business units’ operating results are included from the acquisition date in the company’s segment data as follows: Litton’s advanced electronics business is included in Electronic Systems;
Litton’s information systems business is included in Information Technology; Litton’s ship business is included in Ships. Litton’s electronic components and materials business, Component Technologies (CT), is classified as
discontinued operations. EIS was integrated into Electronic Systems, and Newport News is included in the Ships segment.

In December 2002, the company purchased 100 percent of the common stock of TRW valued at approximately $12.5 billion, including the assumption of TRW’s debt of $4.8
billion. The company issued approximately 69.4 million shares of its common stock at an exchange ratio of .5357 for each TRW share, with cash paid in lieu of any fractional share of the company’s stock, which otherwise would be issued to the
TRW shareholders. These shares were valued at $107.31 per share for purchase accounting purposes. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, this value was determined based on the average closing stock price of the company’s
common stock from October 15, 2002, through October 21, 2002. In connection with the acquisition of TRW, the company entered into a formal stipulation and consent decree with the United States Department of Justice that was filed in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Columbia on December 11, 2002. Key provisions of the consent decree are intended to assure that the merger will not impede fair and open competition related to certain electronic satellite payloads. The consent
decree does not require the divestiture of any businesses and permits the company to operate its business and those of TRW as planned. TRW’s defense business units are operated as two separate sectors, Mission Systems and Space Technology.

The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2002, reflect
preliminary estimates of the fair market value for purchased intangibles, retiree benefits assets and liabilities, and debt as well as preliminary estimates of adjustments necessary to conform TRW to the company’s accounting policies. Auto was
included in the total TRW valuation and was valued and recorded at its sale price which represents its fair market value. As of December 31, 2003, the company completed the fair market value and accounting conformance evaluation process for TRW and
recorded an aggregate increase to goodwill of $1.6 billion.

BUSINESSES SOLD AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On
February 28, 2003, the company sold Auto to The Blackstone Group for $3.3 billion in cash, a $600 million face value payment-in-kind note, initially valued at $455 million, and a 19.6 percent interest in the new enterprise, initially valued at
$170 million. The cash received from the sale of Auto was adjusted from the sale agreement amount by cash sold with the business, preliminary purchase price adjustments, and an asset retained. The acquirer also assumed debt of approximately $200
million. Cash proceeds from the sale were primarily used to reduce debt. The payment-in-kind note matures in 2018 and bears interest at an effective yield of 11.7 percent per annum. In January 2004, the restrictions on the investment in Auto were
amended to provide the company more flexibility in monetization. In February 2004, the company’s investment in Auto was diluted to 17.2 percent as a result of Auto’s initial public offering.

The company has retained certain liabilities associated with the Auto business as well as the
Aeronautical Systems business that TRW divested in 2002. Subsequent adjustment to or resolution of accruals recorded as of December 31, 2003, in connection with the divestitures of TRW’s Auto and Aeronautical Systems businesses, will be charged
to discontinued operations. There can be no assurance that such adjustments will not be material.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

During the third quarter of 2002, the company concluded that the CT businesses, which were acquired as part of the 2001 Litton acquisition,
did not fit with the company’s long-term plan and decided to sell the businesses. In October 2002, Northrop Grumman completed the sale of two Electronic Systems sector businesses, Electron Devices and Ruggedized Displays, for $135 million.
During 2003, the company sold several of the CT businesses: the VEAM business in the first quarter, Life Support during the third quarter, and Poly-Scientific during the fourth quarter. The company also sold its 51 percent interest in the operations
of TRW Koyo Steering Systems Company in the fourth quarter of 2003. None of these sales, either individually or in the aggregate, had a material impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations.

As of December 31, 2003, three CT businesses remain to be sold whose assets and liabilities
have been classified as held for sale. One of these businesses, Kester, was sold in February 2004. The sale of the remaining businesses classified as discontinued operations is not expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
material impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144

– Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

, the results of operations of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations, net of applicable income taxes, for all
periods presented. As such, discontinued operations includes the operating results for all sold companies up to the date of sale.

MANAGEMENT FINANCIAL MEASURES

The company
manages and assesses the performance of its business primarily through measures of acquisitions, sales, segment operating margin, and backlog.

Acquisitions –

Contract acquisitions represent orders received during the period for which funding has been contractually obligated by the customer. Contract
acquisitions tend to fluctuate from year to year and are determined by the size and timing of new and follow-on orders. In the year that a business is purchased, its existing funded order backlog as of the purchase date is reported as contract
acquisitions.

Sales –

Year-to-year sales vary less than contract
acquisitions and reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts.

Segment Operating Margin

– Segment operating margin reflects the performance of the segments on their contracts and programs. Excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance,
including the portion of pension expense/income that is not currently recognized under CAS, as well as the portion of corporate, legal, environmental, state income tax, other retiree benefits, and other expenses not considered allowable costs under
CAS and not allocated to the segments.

Effective January 1, 2002, the company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 -

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,

which changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment-only approach and eliminates amortization of
goodwill. The segment operating results for 2001 have not been adjusted to exclude amortization of goodwill. A reconciliation of previously reported 2001 financial information adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization is presented in Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.

Backlog

–
Funded backlog represents unfilled orders for which funding has been contractually obligated by the customer. Unfunded backlog represents firm orders for which funding is not contractually obligated by the customer.

SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS

Certain prior year
amounts in the tables within this section have been reclassified to conform to current year reporting.

Electronic Systems

Contract Acquisitions


– Electronic Systems segment acquisitions increased by $88 million or 2 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002. Principal acquisitions
during 2003 include $224 million for the SBIRS High program by the Space Systems business area; $187 million for the MESA 737 Turkey acquisition by the Aerospace Systems business area; $181 million and $144 million for the Trident SSGN and
Virginia-class submarine programs, respectively, by the C4ISR & Naval Systems business area; and $145 million for the MP-RTIP program included in the Other business area.


– Electronic Systems segment acquisitions in 2002 were 8 percent higher than in 2001. Aerospace Systems acquisitions
include funding in 2002 of $116 million for the F-35, $83 million for the Longbow missile multiyear contract, and $82 million for the Brilliant Anti-Armor Tank (BAT) program. C4ISR & Naval Systems acquisitions reflect increased awards for
international air defense systems and $150 million of funding for the Trident program. Defensive Systems acquisitions include a $165 million award for ALQ-135 electronic countermeasures for the Korea F-15. Space Systems acquisitions include $335
million of additional funding on the SBIRS High program. Acquisitions reported in 2001 include opening backlog acquired in the Litton purchase of $1.3 billion, comprised of $820 million in Navigation Systems, $210 million in C4ISR & Naval
System, $189 million in Defense Systems and $118 million in Aerospace Systems.

Sales and Service Revenue


– Electronics Systems segment sales increased by $713 million or 13 percent in 2003 as compared
with 2002. The increase is primarily attributable to the $208 million growth at Aerospace Systems due to increased volume on

-24-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

the F-35, F-16 Block 60, F/A-22, and avionics classified programs. Defensive Systems sales increased $139 million in 2003 over 2002
primarily due to higher volume on the ALQ-135, Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM), MH-53, and Lightning programs. The 2003 increase of $118 million in the Other business area primarily reflects higher volume on the MP-RTIP program. In
2004, Electronic Systems sales are expected to increase at close to a double-digit percentage pace over 2003 sales.


– Electronics Systems segment sales increased by $750 million or 16 percent in 2002 as compared with 2001. Growth in 2002 principally reflects a $181
million increase at Aerospace Systems due to increased volume on the F-22, F-35, BAT, Firefinder, and Longbow missile programs. C4ISR & Naval Systems sales increased by $174 million in 2002 principally due to higher volume on international
programs. The Space Systems business area contributed an additional $192 million of sales as a result of increased volume from SBIRS High.

Segment Operating Margin


– Electronic Systems
segment operating margin increased by $156 million or 36 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002. The increase in operating margin in 2003 reflects increased sales volume in Aerospace Systems’ F/A-22, F-35, and several classified programs as well
as increased volume in the C4ISR & Naval Systems marine systems business. The Defensive Systems and Navigation Systems business areas also reported higher sales and improved operating performance. Operating margin for 2003 includes a $40 million
pre-tax charge for the F-16 Block 60 fixed-price development combat avionics program due to cost growth associated with developing and acquiring the advanced microelectronics necessary to meet production specifications and delivery rates. The
contract, which is currently in the EMD and transition-to-production phases, is expected to be completed in 2007. Development work inherently has more uncertainty as to future events than production work and therefore more variability in estimates
of costs to complete the work. As work progresses through the development stage into production, the risks associated with estimating the costs of development are reduced. In addition, successful performance of fixed-price development programs is
subject to the company’s ability to control cost growth in meeting production specifications and delivery rates. While management has used its best judgment to estimate costs, future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments
to those estimates. For 2004, management expects operating margin of approximately 10 percent of segment revenue.


– Electronic Systems segment operating margin in 2002 was $434 million compared with $349 million in 2001. Operating margin for 2002 includes a $65
million pre-tax charge for the F-16 Block 60 fixed-price development combat avionics program, offsetting margin improvements across the sector. The charge reflects increased projected costs, primarily for the program’s electronic warfare suite.
Operating margin for 2001 included goodwill amortization of $80 million.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Ships

Contract Acquisitions


– Ships segment acquisitions decreased by $447 million or 8 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily due to lower incremental
funding received in 2003 for aircraft carrier refueling work. The principal acquisitions in 2003 are $1.2 billion for the LPD program in the Amphibious and Auxiliary business area, and $877 million and $531 million related to the DD(X) and DDG
programs, respectively, in the Surface Combatants business area.


– Ships segment acquisitions in 2002 include $875 million of funding for the DD(X) program, included in the Surface Combatants business area, and $590 million for LHD, included in the Amphibious and Auxiliary business area. Newport News
acquisitions included $1.6 billion of aircraft carrier funding and $828 million of funding for the submarine program. The Commercial and International business area reflects a reduction in previous funding levels for the Polar Tanker program. Ships
segment acquisitions in 2001 include backlog acquired in the Litton and Newport News transactions of $10.5 billion.

Sales and Service Revenue


– Ships segment sales
increased by $754 million or 16 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002. This growth reflects a $719 million increase for the Surface Combatants business area, which is primarily related to the DD(X) and Deepwater programs. Amphibious and Auxiliary
experienced an increase in sales during 2003 of $224 million due to production ramp-up on LPD 18, LPD 19, and LHD. The $154 million decrease in 2003 for Aircraft Carriers as compared to 2002 is largely due to the completion and delivery of the

USS

Ronald Reagan

. In 2004,

the Ships segment expects low single-digit sales percentage growth over 2003 sales, reflecting the deferral of
the

USS

Carl Vinson

refueling and overhaul from 2004 to 2005.


– Ships segment sales increased substantially in 2002 as compared with 2001, principally due to inclusion for the full year 2002 of the Newport News and Ship Systems businesses acquired in 2001.

-26-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Segment Operating Margin


– Ships segment operating margin decreased by $11 million or 4 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002. The decrease reflects both a changing mix from production to development programs as well as a $68 million pre-tax charge for the Polar Tanker
program due to unusual weather delays and rework on the third tanker delivered in July 2003. The charge also includes increased estimates to complete the final two ships to reflect more modest improvements in labor productivity and higher overhead
costs than previously expected. The fourth ship is approximately 91 percent complete as of December 31, 2003, and is scheduled for delivery in the second half of 2004. The fifth and last ship is approximately 46 percent complete as of December 31,
2003, and is scheduled for delivery in late 2005. For 2004, management expects operating margin as a percent of sales of between 6 and 6.5 percent.


– Ships segment operating margin was $306 million in 2002 compared with $19 million in 2001. The increase is principally due to the Newport News and
Litton acquisitions. Results in 2002 include a third-quarter pre-tax charge of $87 million recorded upon completion of a comprehensive review of the estimated costs to complete the three remaining Polar Tanker ships. The increased
estimate-to-complete reflects a reduced learning curve experience ship to ship as well as one-time schedule penalties. Also during the year, the company reached an agreement to sell the partially complete structures and material associated with its
cancelled commercial cruise ship program to Norwegian Cruise Line and successfully concluded negotiations on the majority of the program’s vendor terminations resulting in a favorable pre-tax adjustment of $69 million recorded to reverse
previously established reserves. Following American Classic Voyages Co.’s (AMCV) bankruptcy filing on October 19, 2001, Ships stopped work on Project America, an AMCV cruise ship program to build two 1,900-passenger cruise ships. This decision
followed negotiations with the U.S. Maritime Administration, which had decided not to continue the guaranteed funding necessary to complete the construction of the ships. As a result, Ships recorded a pre-tax charge to operating margin totaling $60
million in 2001. Ships also reported a downward operating margin adjustment of $13 million for the Polar Tanker program in 2001. Operating margin for 2001 included goodwill amortization of $31 million.

Information Technology

-27-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Contract Acquisitions


– Information Technology segment acquisitions increased by $924 million or 21 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002, largely due to strong growth in the Government Information Technology business area. Principal acquisitions in 2003 in the
Government Information Technology business area are $104 million for Information Technology Support Services (ITSS), $98 million for Voyager, and $92 million for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) Technology Enterprise Automation
Management Support (TEAMS) program. The Technology Services business area received funding of $255 million for the Joint Base Operations Support Contract (J-BOSC). The Commercial Information Technology business area recorded funding of $120 million
in connection with Vought.


– Information Technology
acquisitions increased by 3 percent in 2002 over 2001. Government Information Technology secured a major contract with the INS to provide information technology infrastructure and support services, key elements in assisting the border enforcement
and immigration benefits missions of the agency. The $228 million INS contract positions the company to assist the new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with its information technology needs. In 2002, Technology Services funding for the J-BOSC
contract of $268 million was received. Technology Services also received a $100 million contract to provide electronic benefits transfer services to the state of Illinois, which positions the company as a key provider to state government.
Information Technology acquisitions in 2001 include Litton opening backlog acquired of $585 million.

Sales and Service Revenue

2003 –

Information Technology segment sales increased by $504 million or 12
percent in 2003 as compared with 2002. The higher sales are primarily attributable to a $338 million increase at the Government Information Technology business area due to increased volume on the INS TEAMS, Global Transportation Network for the 21st
Century (GTN 21), and Land Information Warfare Activity (LIWA) programs. Enterprise Information Technology sales were $107 million higher than 2002 due, in part, to increased DHS purchases. For 2004, the company expects high single-digit percentage
growth on comparative realigned 2003 sales. (See Realignment discussion contained in the “Summary Segment Financial Data” section contained in Part I, Item 1.)


– Information Technology sales increased by 12 percent in 2002 as compared with 2001. This increase principally results
from inclusion of a full year of Litton operations in 2002.

Segment
Operating Margin


– Information Technology segment operating margin increased by $31 million or 12 percent in 2003 as compared with
2002. The increase is primarily attributable to higher sales volume in the Government Information Technology business area. For 2004, management expects segment operating margin as a percent of segment sales, on a comparative realigned basis, to be
nearly 6 percent.


– Information Technology segment operating
margin in 2002 was $250 million compared with $174 million in 2001. Operating margin for 2002 includes a $20 million favorable pre-tax adjustment resulting from the restructuring of a Technology Services contract and a $16 million charge recorded
for a contract with Oracle. Operating margin for 2001 included goodwill amortization of $58 million.

-28-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Mission Systems

Contract Acquisitions


– Mission Systems acquisitions during 2003 reflect several new business awards for restricted programs in the Command, Control &
Intelligence Systems business area and the Kinetic Energy Interceptor contract awarded to the Missile Systems business area. Acquisitions for these two business areas accounted for over $3.2 billion or 71 percent of total 2003 acquisitions.


– Acquisitions for 2002 represent backlog acquired as of the
acquisition date of TRW.

Sales and Service Revenue


– Approximately $2.6 billion or 64 percent of 2003 sales were derived from the Command, Control & Intelligence Systems and Missile Systems business
areas. The principal programs in these business areas during 2003 were restricted. Missile Systems sales for 2003 are principally due to such programs as Ground-based Midcourse and Joint National Integration Center. For 2004, management expects high
single-digit percentage growth on comparative realigned 2003 sales. (See Realignment discussion contained in the “Summary Segment Financial Data” section contained in Part I, Item 1.)

Segment Operating Margin

2003 –

Approximately $175 million or 68 percent of 2003 operating margin was derived from the Command, Control & Intelligence Systems and Missile Systems business areas. For 2004, management expects
operating margin as a percent of sales, on a comparative realigned basis, to be in the mid-6 percent range.

-29-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Integrated Systems

Contract Acquisitions


– Integrated Systems segment acquisitions increased by $791 million or 23 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002. The increase is
mainly due to higher acquisitions for the F-35 and Global Hawk programs, both included in the Air Combat Systems business area. The principal acquisitions for Air Combat Systems during 2003 are $777 million, $697 million, and $613 million for
the F/A-18, Unmanned Systems, and F-35 programs, respectively. The principal acquisitions in the AEW/EW and AGS/BM business areas during 2003 are $576 million and $406 million for the E-2C and Joint STARS programs, respectively.


– Integrated Systems acquisitions in 2002 were 56 percent higher than 2001.
Funding in 2002 reflects $784 million of funding for the F/A-18 contracts and $271 million for the F-35 SDD contract. Air Combat Systems continued to record incremental B-2 bomber funding, which increased to $388 million in 2002 from $346
million in 2001, and included ongoing development work, spares, and other customer support for the operational aircraft program.

Sales and Service Revenue

2003 –

Integrated Systems
segment sales increased by $527 million or 16 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002. Growth in 2003 principally reflects a $506 million increase at Air Combat Systems due to increased volume on the F-35, Global Hawk and MP-RTIP programs, and $82
million at AEW/EW related to the Advanced Hawkeye program. The sales decrease in 2003 of $59 million at the AGS/BM business area is mainly due to fewer Joint STARS aircraft in production. For 2004, the company expects 15 to 20 percent growth on
comparative realigned 2003 sales. (See Realignment discussion contained in the “Summary Segment Financial Data” section contained in Part I, Item 1.)


– Integrated Systems segment sales increased 9 percent in 2002 over 2001 principally from a $143 million and $145 million increase in F-35 and Global
Hawk sales, respectively.

Segment Operating Margin

2003 –

Integrated Systems segment operating margin increased by $49 million or 15 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002. The increase in operating margin in
2003 reflects increased sales volume on the F-35 and Global Hawk

-30-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

programs and improved operating margin rate on the E-2C program, partially offset by lower sales volume on the Joint STARS program. For
2004, operating margin as a percent of sales is expected to be in the mid-8 percent range reflecting a trend of continued ramp-up on lower margin development programs including F-35, Unmanned Vehicles, Advanced Hawkeye, and E-10.


– Integrated Systems segment operating margin in 2002 was $331 million
compared with $265 million in 2001. The 2002 results reflect improved performance on the B-2 and E-2C programs, as well as higher F-35 sales. Operating margin for 2001 included goodwill amortization of $32 million.

Space Technology

Contract Acquisitions


– Space Technology segment acquisitions during 2003 primarily reflect $724 million in restricted programs in the Intelligence,
Surveillance & Reconnaissance business area, $502 million related to additional funding for the AEHF satellite in the Satellite Communications area, $475 million related to NPOESS in the Civil Space business area, and $195 million related to the
F-22 program in the Software Defined Radios business area.


–
Acquisitions for 2002 represent backlog acquired as of the acquisition date of TRW.

Sales and Service Revenue


– Restricted program sales totaled $711 million or 85 percent of 2003 Intelligence,
Surveillance & Reconnaissance sales. Approximately $412 million or 79 percent of the 2003 Civil Space sales were due to the NPOESS program. Approximately $440 million or 94 percent of the 2003 Satellite Communications sales
was due to the AEHF program. Missile & Space Defense sales for 2003 include $234 million and $122 million related to the STSS Cycle I and ABL programs, respectively. The 2003 sales for the Software Defined Radios business area
include $135 million and $127 million related to the F-35 and F-22 programs, respectively. For 2004, management expects mid-single digit percentage sales growth over 2003 sales.

-31-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Segment Operating Margin

2003 –

Operating margin for the business areas within the Space Technology segment in 2003 ranged from 6.6 percent for Civil Space to 9.7 percent for Software Defined Radios. For 2004, management expects operating margin as a percent of sales
to be in the high 6 percent range.

NON-SEGMENT FACTORS AFFECTING OPERATING MARGIN

The company’s operations substantially changed as a result of the TRW acquisition on December 11, 2002. The company’s 2002 income statement does not include TRW’s post-acquisition results because they were not material. The
2002 results reflect the first full year of operations of Litton, EIS, and Newport News, which were acquired in 2001. These acquisitions have significantly increased the size of the company and produced one of the largest defense contractors in the
nation.

The components of operating margin are as follows:

Operating margin as a percentage of
total revenue was 5.9 percent, 8.1 percent, and 7.9 percent for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The primary factors affecting operating margin during these periods were the business acquisitions and changes in pension amounts.

Unallocated Expenses


– Unallocated expenses increased $36 million in 2003, net of a $17 million gain on the settlement of legal matters. The increase is due primarily to
higher legal costs and increased estimates of unrecoverable costs. In 2003, the company settled two previously reserved civil False Claims Act cases, U.S. v. Newport News Shipbuilding, Inc. and U.S. Ex rel. Jordan, and recorded loss provisions for
settlement offers on other legal matters, resulting in a net gain of $17 million. The two settled cases required payments by the company of approximately $80 million.

The $60 million settlement amount allocated by the plaintiff to the Newport News Shipbuilding case was charged to an existing accrual
established for the government’s claim that Newport News had improperly charged certain independent research and development costs to its government contracts with respect to the years 1994 through 1999. The government filed a civil False
Claims Act case against the company in February 2003 seeking single damages in excess of $72 million, plus penalties, costs, and interest. The company accrued an amount for this matter determined in accordance with SFAS No. 5 –

Accounting
for Contingencies

, after considering the facts and circumstances known to management at the time, including the potential for treble damages and penalties as

-32-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

provided in the False Claims Act. The accrual, when established, had no effect on the company’s net income, as it was recorded as a
liability on the balance sheet as part of the purchase accounting for Newport News, which was acquired in December 2001. The unused portion of the accrual of approximately $120 million was reversed and, together with the loss provisions recorded for
other legal matters, is included in the $17 million net gain reported in “Unallocated expenses.”

Pension (Expense) Income

2003 –

Operating margin in 2003 includes pension expense of $568 million as
compared with pension income in 2002 of $90 million. The decrease reflects a higher number of plan participants from the acquisition of TRW as well as negative returns on plan assets of 10 percent and 4.9 percent in 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Based on expected long-term returns available in the capital markets and lower long-term interest rates, the 2004 pension plan assumptions have been changed from the 2003 assumptions. The 2004 assumptions include an expected long-term rate of return
on plan assets of 8.75 percent and a discount rate of 6.25 percent compared with the 2003 assumptions of 9 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively. In accordance with SFAS No. 87 –

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions

, the balance
sheet was adjusted at December 31, 2003, to reverse a significant portion of the additional minimum pension liability due to actual returns on pension plan assets in 2003 of over 20 percent. This nearly $1 billion non-cash, after-tax increase in
shareholders’ equity did not impact earnings.

Beginning in July 2003, the
pension benefits for most employees, principally those participating in Northrop Grumman and Litton heritage plans, were based upon new criteria, whereby employees earn age and service points over the employment period. Subsequent to the 2003
initial phase-in, other exempt and non-exempt plans will be conformed to the new model. No settlement or curtailments arose as a result of these changes. Union plans were not affected by these plan modifications.

Pension expense is included in the sectors’ cost of sales to the extent that these costs
are currently recognized under CAS. In order to reconcile from segment operating margin to total company operating margin, these amounts are reported under the caption “Reversal of CAS pension expense included above.”

For 2004, subject to refinements for participant census data and pay-as-you-go plans,
management expects pension expense determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of approximately $330 million. Pension expense recognized under CAS, which is generally recoverable under government contracts, is estimated to
be $305 million for 2004.


– Operating margin in 2002 includes
pension income of $90 million compared with $335 million in 2001. The lower pension income in 2002 is principally the result of negative asset returns in 2001 and 2000.

OTHER INCOME STATEMENT COMPONENTS

Interest
Income

2003 –

Interest income increased $49 million in 2003 as compared to 2002. The increase principally reflects earnings from the note
received in connection with the sale of Auto, interest earned on a tax refund, and interest earned on the temporary investment of excess cash.


– Interest income in 2002 declined to $11 million compared with $33 million in 2001. Interest income in 2001 included interest earned on the note
received in partial payment for the sale of Aerostructures. The note was collected in 2001. Interest income in 2002 and 2001 includes interest earned on the temporary investment of excess cash.

-33-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Interest Expense


–
Interest expense increased by $75 million or 18 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002. The increase is principally the result of higher debt levels arising from the acquisition of TRW, net of the effect of the company’s debt reduction plan,
which was substantially completed in the second quarter of 2003. Dividends payable on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock are also treated as interest expense resulting from adoption of SFAS No. 150

– Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity

, which became effective for periods ending after June 15, 2003.


– Interest expense for 2002 was $422 million as compared with $373 million in 2001. The 2002 increase as compared with 2001 reflects higher average debt
levels resulting from the acquisitions completed in 2001.

Income Taxes

2003 –

The company’s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for 2003 was 29 percent compared to 31 percent during
2002. The lower rate in 2003 is primarily due to higher research tax credits. The effective tax rate for 2004 is expected to be between 34 and 35 percent.


– The company’s effective federal income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 31 percent in 2002 and 37 percent in 2001. The lower rate
in 2002 reflects the elimination of goodwill amortization, most of which is non-deductible, upon adoption of SFAS No. 142

– Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Discontinued Operations


– The company reported after-tax income from discontinued operations of $35 million, net of a goodwill impairment charge of $47 million, during 2003. The $23 million after-tax gain from disposal of discontinued operations is primarily
attributable to the sale of Life Support and Poly Scientific. The gain (loss) on disposal of discontinued operations includes any gain or loss from completed dispositions, as well as the estimated loss from those businesses expected to be sold at a
loss, where the sale has not yet been completed. Gains realized on the sale of any discontinued businesses are reported in the period in which the divestiture is complete.


– Income (loss) from discontinued operations in 2002 and 2001 includes the results of operations of the Electron Devices
and Ruggedized Displays businesses, which were sold in 2002, and the Component Technologies businesses. Loss from discontinued operations in 2002 includes a goodwill impairment loss of $186 million after tax.

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change

Effective January 1, 2002, the company adopted SFAS No. 142

– Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,

which implemented required disclosure provisions and
eliminated the amortization of goodwill. During the second quarter of 2002, the company completed the first step of the required initial test for potential impairment of goodwill as of January 1, 2002. The company used a discounted cash flow
approach, corroborated by comparative market multiples, where appropriate, to determine the fair value of its reporting units. The results indicated potential impairment only in the reporting units of the Component Technologies sector due to
unfavorable market conditions. During the third quarter of 2002, the company completed the measurement of the Component Technologies goodwill impairment as of January 1, 2002, and recorded a noncash, after-tax charge of $432 million, or $3.67
per diluted share, which is reported as “Cumulative effect of accounting change.” For additional information see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8.

BACKLOG

Total backlog at December 31, 2003, was
approximately $58.2 billion. Total backlog includes both funded backlog (unfilled orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by
the customer). Unfunded backlog excludes

-34-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

unexercised contract options and unfunded Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) orders. Major awards in unfunded backlog include
the Virginia-class submarines 2

nd

flight and DD(X) programs in the Ships segment, the Kinetic Energy Interceptor
program in the Mission Systems segment, the F-35 and E-2 Advanced Hawkeye programs in the Integrated Systems segment, and the NPOESS program in the Space Technology segment.

The following table presents funded and unfunded backlog by segment at December 31, 2003.

Backlog is converted into the
following years’ sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made. Approximately 65 percent of the 2003 year-end funded backlog is expected to be converted into sales in 2004. Total U.S. Government orders, including those made on
behalf of foreign governments (FMS), comprised 87 percent, 84 percent, and 82 percent of the funded backlog at the end of 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Total foreign customer orders, including FMS, accounted for 9 percent,
13 percent, and 13 percent of the funded backlog at the end of 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Domestic commercial backlog represented 6 percent, 5 percent, and 7 percent of funded backlog at the end of 2003, 2002, and
2001, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Contractual
Obligations

The following table presents the company’s contractual
obligations as of December 31, 2003, and the estimated timing of future cash payments:

(1)

A “purchase obligation” is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specifies all significant
terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. These amounts are primarily comprised of open purchase order commitments to vendors and
subcontractors pertaining to funded contracts.

(2)

Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of accrued workers’ compensation, deferred compensation, and other miscellaneous liabilities.

The table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retiree benefit plans as
set forth by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), totaling approximately $3.3 billion over the next five years: $500 million in 2004, $1.5 billion in 2005 and 2006, and $1.3 billion in 2007 and 2008. The company
also has payments due under plans that are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay-as-you-go. See further discussion contained in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.

Contractual obligations of discontinued operations have also been excluded from the table
above. A discussion of discontinued operations can be found in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.

Further details regarding long-term debt and operating leases can be found in Notes 12 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Sources and Uses of Cash

The following table provides an overview of the company’s sources and uses of cash. The amounts from which the percentages are derived are reported in the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as follows: cash from customers and cash to employees and suppliers of services and materials are reported in “Operating Activities”; cash from buyers of assets, cash to sellers of assets, and cash to
suppliers of facilities are reported in “Investing Activities”; and cash from and cash to lenders and shareholders are reported in “Financing Activities.”

Operating Activities


– In 2003, cash provided by operating activities was $798 million as compared with $1.7 billion generated in 2002. In 2003, cash
used in operations reflects $1 billion of taxes paid upon completion of the B-2 EMD contract. The IRS is presently completing its audits of the B-2 program for the tax years ended December 31, 1997, through December 31, 2000. Upon completion of
these audits, the IRS may adopt a position that the B-2 program was completed for tax purposes in a year prior to 2002, which would create the potential for additional interest expense. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the tax
audits at this time, management believes that its tax accounting for the B-2 program reflects the appropriate timing of contract completion. Presently, the IRS has not commenced its audits for the three tax years ended December 31, 2003.

During 2003, the company also received $178 million of federal and state tax refunds and
made litigation settlement payments totaling $206 million. At December 31, 2003, net working capital deficit (current assets less current liabilities) was $616 million reflecting a lower cash balance, an increased current portion of long-term debt,
and increased customer advances.

Cash provided by operations for 2004 is
expected to total approximately $1.5 billion. For 2004, cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities are expected to be sufficient to service debt and contract obligations, finance capital expenditures, and
continue paying dividends to the company’s shareholders.


– In 2002, cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion as compared with $817 million generated in 2001. The increased level of cash provided in 2002 principally results from inclusion of the Litton and Newport News acquisitions for a
full year, increased operating margin over 2001, and accelerated cash collections. Net working capital at December 31, 2002, includes amounts reported as assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale

-38-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

which encompasses the assets and liabilities of the Component Technologies sector and Auto. Excluding these items, net adjusted working
capital deficit at December 31, 2002, was $566 million, primarily due to increased current taxes payable and customer advances.


– The lower level of cash provided by operating activities in 2001 primarily reflected nonrecurring cash payments of approximately $700 million related
to the Litton, Newport News, and EIS acquisitions, including change in control payments to employees and funding of pension plans. In addition, the company reached a settlement agreement for antitrust and patent infringement lawsuits filed by Litton
against Honeywell, Inc. Under the agreement, Honeywell agreed to pay the company equal cash payments of $220 million in each of 2001 and 2002. The entire $440 million balance due was recorded as a fair value purchase accounting adjustment to
accounts receivable in connection with the accounting for the acquisition of Litton.

Investing Activities


– Cash provided by investing activities was $2.9 billion in 2003. On February 28, 2003, the
company sold Auto to The Blackstone Group for $3.3 billion in cash, a $600 million face value payment-in-kind note, initially valued at $455 million, and a 19.6 percent interest in the new enterprise, valued at $170 million. The cash received from
the sale of Auto was adjusted from the sale agreement amount by cash sold with the business, preliminary purchase price adjustments, and an asset retained. Cash proceeds from the sale of Auto were primarily used to reduce debt. In January 2004,
restrictions on the investment in Auto were amended to provide the company more flexibility in monetization.

The company has retained certain liabilities associated with the Auto business as well as the Aeronautical Systems business that TRW divested in 2002. The settlement of these liabilities is not expected to have a
material effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations.

Capital expenditures in 2003 were $635 million, including $47 million for capitalized software costs. Capital expenditure commitments at December 31, 2003, were approximately $580 million, including $2 million for environmental control and
compliance purposes. Capital expenditures for 2004 are expected to be approximately $800 million.


– Cash used in investing activities was $118 million in 2002. In 2002, the company sold two businesses for cash of $135 million, incurred $55 million for transaction costs pertaining to the
acquisition of TRW, and spent approximately $166 million in cash to complete the Newport News acquisition. In 2002, the company acquired TRW in an all stock transaction. Capital expenditures in 2002 were $521 million, including $30 million for
capitalized software costs.


– Cash used in investing
activities was $3.2 billion in 2001. In 2001, three businesses were acquired, two for cash and stock and one for cash, for a total cash expenditure of $3.1 billion. Capital expenditures in 2001 were $367 million, including $47 million for
capitalized software costs. In 2001, the company received $148 million upon collection in full of the note received from the sale of Aerostructures.

Financing Activities

2003 –

Cash used in financing
activities was $4.7 billion in 2003. In March 2003, the company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems Corp. (formerly TRW Inc.), commenced offers to purchase any or all of certain designated outstanding
Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems Corp. debt securities in a debt reduction plan substantially completed in the second quarter of 2003. In the first phase, approximately $2.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt
securities was tendered and accepted for purchase, for a total purchase price of approximately $2.9 billion (including accrued and unpaid interest on the securities). In the second phase, the company purchased on the open market $658 million in
aggregate principal

-39-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

amount for a total purchase price of $795 million (including accrued and unpaid interest on the securities) of Northrop Grumman Space &
Mission Systems Corp. debt securities. Cash proceeds from the sale of Auto were used to complete these transactions, which contributed to the reduction of long-term debt to $5.9 billion at December 31, 2003, from the $9.6 billion reported at
December 31, 2002.

In the third quarter of 2003, the company approved a share
repurchase program of up to $700 million of its outstanding common stock. Share purchases will take place at management’s discretion from time to time, depending on market conditions, in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions
through the end of 2004. As of December 31, 2003, the company had repurchased over 2.2 million shares for approximately $200 million. The company expects a portion of its 2004 cash flow will be focused on completing the repurchase program.

The company redeemed all outstanding shares of TRW Automotive Inc. Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock for $117 million in 2003.


– Cash of $623 million was used in financing activities in 2002. The use of cash in 2002 results from principal payments of long-term debt of $500 million and dividends paid to shareholders of $205 million.


– Cash provided by financing activities was $2.5 billion in 2001. In
February 2001, Northrop Systems issued $1.5 billion of indebtedness pursuant to its senior debt indenture consisting of $750 million of 7.125 percent notes due 2011 and $750 million of 7.75 percent debentures due 2031. In 2001, the company also
issued 9.2 million shares of common stock and 6.9 million equity security units, generating cash proceeds of $1.45 billion. The cash proceeds were used primarily to reduce existing debt.

Credit Facilities

– In connection with the closing of the Litton acquisition, the company entered into unsecured senior credit
facilities with lenders which initially provided for borrowings of up to $5 billion (the “Credit Facilities”) and replaced the company’s previous credit agreement. The Credit Facilities consisted of a $2.5 billion 364-day revolving
credit facility and a $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility. The 364-day facility was terminated by the company in December 2001. At December 31, 2003, $2.5 billion was available under the five-year revolving credit facility. Borrowings
under the Credit Facilities, together with the proceeds of the February 2001 issuance of notes and debentures, were used to finance the Litton acquisition and to pay related expenses, to retire and refinance a portion of the Litton debt, and to
finance continuing operations. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at various rates, including adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or an alternate base rate plus, in each case, an incremental margin based on the
company’s credit rating. The Credit Facilities also provide for a facility fee on the daily aggregate amount of commitments under the revolving facilities (whether or not utilized). The facility fee is also based on the company’s credit
rating level

.

Mandatorily Redeemable Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock

– In connection with the Litton acquisition, the company issued 3.5 million shares of mandatorily redeemable Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in April 2001. Each share of Series B preferred stock has a liquidation value of $100
per share. The liquidation value, plus accrued but unpaid dividends, is payable on April 4, 2021, the mandatory redemption date. The company has the option to redeem all, but not less than all, of the shares of Series B preferred stock at any time
after seven years from the date of issuance for a number of shares of the company’s common stock equal to the liquidation value plus accrued and unpaid dividends divided by the current market price of common stock determined in relation to the
date of redemption. Each share of preferred stock is convertible, at any time, at the option of the holder into the right to receive shares of the company’s common stock. Initially, each share is convertible into .911 shares of common stock,
subject to adjustment. Holders of preferred stock are entitled to cumulative annual cash dividends of $7 per share, payable quarterly. In any liquidation of the company, each share of preferred stock is entitled to a liquidation preference before
any distribution may be made on the company’s common stock or any series of

-40-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

capital stock that is junior to the Series B preferred stock. In the event of a fundamental change in control of the company, holders of
Series B preferred stock also have specified exchange rights into common stock of the company or into specified securities or property of another entity participating in the change in control transaction.

Equity Security Units

– In November 2001, the company issued 6.9 million equity
security units. Each equity security unit, issued at $100 per unit, initially consists of a contract to purchase shares of Northrop Grumman common stock on November 16, 2004, and a $100 senior note due 2006. The senior notes due 2006 are reported as
long-term debt. The senior notes initially bear interest at 5.25 percent per annum, and each equity security unit also pays a contract adjustment payment of 2.0 percent per annum, for a combined yield on the equity security unit of 7.25 percent per
annum. Each purchase contract, which is part of the equity security units, will obligate the holder thereof to purchase on November 16, 2004, for $100, the following number of shares of the company’s common stock based on the average closing
price of the company’s common stock over the 20 day trading period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding November 16, 2004: (i) 0.9262 shares if the average closing price equals or exceeds $107.97, (ii) a number of shares having
a value equal to $100.00 if the average closing price is less than $107.97 but greater than $88.50 and (iii) 1.1299 shares if the average closing price is less than or equal to $88.50. Prior to November 16, 2004, holders of equity security units
have the opportunity to participate in a remarketing of the senior note component.

Other Sources and Uses of Capital

Additional Capital

– To provide for long-term liquidity, the company believes it can
obtain additional capital from such sources as: the public or private capital markets, the further sale of assets, sale and leaseback of operating assets, and leasing rather than purchasing new assets. Cash on hand at the beginning of the year plus
cash generated from operations and cash available under credit lines are expected to be sufficient in 2004 to service debt, finance capital expansion projects, pay federal income taxes, and continue paying dividends to shareholders. The company will
continue to provide the productive capacity to perform its existing contracts, prepare for future contracts, and conduct R&D in the pursuit of developing opportunities. While these expenditures tend to limit short-term liquidity, they are made
with the intention of improving the long-term growth and profitability of the company.

Financial Arrangements

– In the ordinary course of business, the company uses standby letters of credit issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued by insurance companies principally to guarantee performance on certain
contracts and to support the company’s self-insured workers’ compensation plans. At December 31, 2003, there were $619 million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding and $584 million of surety bonds outstanding.

Other Agreements

– In July and August of 2003, Ship Systems executed agreements
with the states of Mississippi and Louisiana, respectively, wherein Ship Systems will lease facility improvements and equipment from these states in exchange for certain commitments by Ship Systems. Under the Mississippi agreement, Ship Systems is
required to match the state’s funding with expenditures in the amount of $121 million and create 667 new full time jobs in Mississippi by December 2007. Under the Louisiana agreement, Ship Systems is required to match the state’s funding
with expenditures in the amount of $56 million by December 2007, and employ a minimum of 5,200 full-time employees in 16 of the 32 fiscal quarters beginning January 1, 2003, and ending December 31, 2010. Failure by Ship Systems to meet these
commitments would result in reimbursement by Ship Systems to Mississippi and Louisiana in accordance with the respective agreements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS

The company’s established policies are outlined in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses as well as the

-41-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. As part of its oversight responsibilities, management evaluates the propriety of its
estimates, judgments, and accounting methods as new events occur. Management believes that its policies, judgments, and assessments have been consistently applied in a manner that provides the reader of the company’s financial statements a
current, accurate, and complete presentation of information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management periodically reviews the company’s critical accounting estimates with the audit committee
of its board of directors.

Principal accounting practices that involve a
higher degree of judgment or complexity are outlined below:

Revenue
Recognition

As a defense contractor engaging in long-term contracts, the company extensively utilizes the cost-to-cost and the units-of-delivery
measures of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Application of this accounting method requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the design, manufacture, and delivery of aircraft carriers, submarines, aircraft and
subassemblies, radars, intricate components and systems for space communications, as well as the engineering, development, and integration of software systems and other highly technical products. Such costs are typically incurred over a period of
several years, and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment. The cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company’s engineers, program managers, and financial professionals. Factors
that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of
materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could
have a material effect on the company’s results of operations. Contract cost estimates are updated at least annually and more frequently in certain circumstances. Cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract are reviewed and
reassessed quarterly. Sales under cost-reimbursement contracts are recorded as costs are incurred. Certain contracts contain profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery
of the product. Incentives that can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentives that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded. Certain contracts contain provisions for the
redetermination of price based upon future economic conditions. Contract change orders and claims are included in sales when they can be reasonably estimated and realization is probable.

Purchase Accounting and Goodwill

The
purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Such fair market value
assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time that may cause final amounts to differ from original estimates.

The company evaluates the recovery of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. In order to test
for potential impairment, the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis, corroborated by comparative market multiples, where appropriate. The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the weighted average
cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions. Differences in these assumptions, within a range considered by management to be reasonable, applied to the 2003 annual impairment test, would not have had a significant impact to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The company has established certain
accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies arising from its acquisitions and divestitures. These accruals and subsequent adjustments have been recorded during the

-42-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

purchase price allocation period. The accruals were determined based upon the terms of the purchase agreements and, in most cases, involve a
significant degree of judgment. Management has recorded these accruals in accordance with its interpretation of the terms of the purchase agreements, known facts, and an estimation of probable future events based on management’s experience and
consultation with outside experts. Changes in facts and interpretation or anticipated future events may have a significant impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Litigation, Commitments, and Contingencies

The company is subject to a range of claims, lawsuits, environmental and income tax matters, and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.
Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel. In accordance with SFAS No. 5

– Accounting for
Contingencies

, amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management, after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter, including any settlement offers, has determined that it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known.

The company is subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in
which it conducts operations. The company records an accrual to provide for the costs of expected environmental obligations when management becomes aware that an expenditure will be required. Factors which could result in changes to the
company’s environmental accruals and reasonably possible range of loss include: modification of planned remedial actions, increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate, discovery of more extensive contamination than
anticipated, changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements, and improvements in remediation technology. The company believes it complies with environmental laws applicable to its operations. The company does not believe that
continued compliance with these environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. However, a significant change in laws, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, and other factors
could result in expenditures that are materially greater than currently estimated.

Retirement Benefits

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s
pension plans and other post-retirement benefits plans are regularly evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries who are relied upon as experts. In the event that the company determines that changes in the assumptions are
warranted, future pension and post-retirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease. The principal assumptions that have a significant impact on the financial condition and operating results of the company are the discount rate, the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets, and the health care cost trend rates.

The discount rate represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and post-retirement benefit obligations. The discount rate is
generally based on the yield on high-quality corporate fixed-income investments. At the end of each year, the appropriate discount rate is determined based on consultation with outside actuaries, consideration of survey results, the Moody’s Aa
corporate bond rate, and the results of a hypothetical long-term bond portfolio matching the expected cash inflows with the expected benefit payments. Taking into consideration the factors noted above, the company lowered the discount rate to 6.25
percent at December 31, 2003, from 6.5 percent at December 31, 2002.

The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for anticipated benefit payments. For 2003, the company assumed an expected long-term rate

-43-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

of return on plan assets of 9 percent. On average, the actual return on plan assets over the long-term has exceeded 9 percent; however, for
2004, the expected long-term rate of return assumption was lowered from 9 percent to 8.75 percent, reflecting the generally expected moderation of long-term rates of return in the financial markets.

The health care cost trend rates represent the annual rate of change in the cost of health
care benefits based on estimates of health care inflation, changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns, technological advances, and changes in the health status of the plan participants.

Differences in the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and the
health care cost trend rates within reasonably likely ranges would have had the following impact on 2003 results:

OTHER MATTERS

New Accounting Pronouncements

Several new accounting pronouncements were issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which became effective during the periods
presented.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141

– Business
Combinations

and SFAS No. 142

– Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. SFAS No. 141 requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, and eliminates the pooling-of-interests method.
Adoption of SFAS No. 141 did not have a significant effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. SFAS No. 142 changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment-only approach.
Upon adoption of this statement, amortization of goodwill, including goodwill recorded in past business combinations, ceased and an initial impairment assessment of goodwill was performed. Annual impairment tests are required thereafter. The company
adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002, and recorded an initial goodwill impairment charge of $432 million, which is reported under the income statement caption “Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change.”

No other new pronouncement effective during the periods presented had a significant effect on
the company’s financial position or results of operations. Other new pronouncements issued by the FASB and not effective until after December 31, 2003, are not expected to have a significant effect on the company’s financial position or
results of operations. Further details are contained in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements located in Part II, Item 8.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2003, the company
had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND IMPORTANT FACTORS

Certain statements and assumptions throughout this report contain or are based on “forward-looking” information (that Northrop Grumman believes to be within the definition in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995)
and involve risks and uncertainties, and include, among others, statements in the future tense, and all statements accompanied by terms such as “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “estimate,” “assume,”
“intend,” “anticipate,” and variations thereof and similar terms. This information reflects the company’s best estimates when made, but the company expressly disclaims any duty to update this information if new data becomes
available or estimates change after the date of this report. These forward-looking statements should, therefore, be considered in light of various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections
including, without limitation:

§

The company depends on a limited number of customers. The company is heavily dependent on government contracts, many of which are only partially funded. The termination or failure
to fund one or more significant contracts could have a negative impact on operations. The company is a supplier, either directly or as a subcontractor or team member, to the U.S. Government and its agencies as well as foreign governments and
agencies. These contracts are subject to each customer’s political and budgetary constraints, changes in short-range and long-range plans, the timing of contract awards, the congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes, the
government’s ability to terminate contracts for convenience or for default, as well as other risks such as contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal and regulatory requirements.

§

Many of the company’s contracts are fixed-price contracts. While firm, fixed-price contracts allow the company to benefit from cost savings, they also expose the company to the
risk of cost overruns. If the company’s initial estimates used for calculating contract prices are incorrect, the company can incur losses on those contracts. In addition, some of the company’s contracts have provisions relating to cost
controls and audit rights, and if the company fails to meet the terms specified in those contracts, then the company may not realize their full benefits. The company’s ability to manage costs on these contracts may affect its financial
condition. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns would have an adverse effect on the company’s financial results. In addition, in those instances where the company has entered into contracts for fixed-price development programs, the
company’s successful performance of such programs is subject to its ability to control cost growth in meeting production specifications and delivery rates.

§

The company is subject to significant competition. The company’s markets include defense and commercial areas where it competes with companies of substantial size and
resources. The company’s success or failure in winning new contracts or follow-on orders for its existing or future products may cause material fluctuations in the company’s future revenues and operating results.

§

The company’s operations may be subject to events that cause adverse effects on its ability to meet contract obligations within anticipated cost and time constraints. The
company may encounter internal problems and delays in delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, or materials and components that prevent the company from achieving contract requirements.
The company may be affected by delivery or performance issues with key suppliers and subcontractors, as well as other factors inherent in the company’s businesses that may cause operating results to be adversely affected. Operating results are
also dependent on successful negotiation of collective bargaining agreements. Changes in inventory requirements or other production cost increases may also have a negative impact on the company’s operating results.

§

If the company does not perform its plans as intended, or if the company encounters unforeseen problems, or problems subsequently develop, the company’s operating results may
be adversely affected. Among the factors that may be involved would be unforeseen costs and expenses, and diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen liabilities.

-45-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

§

The company relies on continuous innovation. The company is dependent upon its ability to anticipate changing needs for defense products, military and civilian electronic systems
and support, naval vessels, space technologies, and information technology. The company’s success is dependent on designing new products that will respond to such requirements within customers’ price limitations.

§

The company faces significant challenges in the international marketplace. The company’s international business is subject to changes in import and export policies, technology
transfer restrictions, limitations imposed by United States law that are not applicable to foreign competitors, and other legal, financial, and governmental risks.

§

The company assumes that any divestiture of non-core businesses and assets will be completed successfully. The company’s performance may be affected by its inability to
successfully dispose of assets and businesses that do not fit with, or are no longer appropriate to, the company’s strategic plan. If any sales of such businesses or assets can be made only at a loss, the company’s earnings will be
reduced.

§

The company is subject to environmental litigation and other litigation, which, if not resolved within the company’s expectation, could reduce future operating results.

§

The company’s pension (expense) income may fluctuate significantly. Pension (expense) income is based on assumptions of future market performance, and actual performance may
differ. If an event requires the company to reestimate its pension (expense) income during the year, its reported earnings could vary significantly.

§

The company’s tax filings are regularly examined by federal and state taxing authorities. Results of these examinations can result in tax deficiencies, cumulative interest

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rates

- The company is exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term
debt obligations, variable-rate short-term debt outstanding under the credit agreement, short-term investments, and long-term notes receivable. At December 31, 2003, substantially all borrowings were fixed-rate long-term debt obligations of which a
significant portion are not callable until maturity. The company’s sensitivity to a 1 percent change in interest rates is tied to its $2.5 billion credit agreement, which has no balance outstanding at December 31, 2003. The company may
enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2003, no interest rate swap agreements were in effect.

Foreign Currency

- The company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related
to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. At December 31, 2003, the amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was not material. The company does not consider the market risk exposure
relating to foreign currency exchange to be material.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Derivatives

- The company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Standby letters of credit are
sometimes used by the company to guarantee future performance on its contracts. All letters of credit are short-term and denominated in U.S. dollars to avoid market risk exposures.

RFMD and Celera

- In connection with the TRW acquisition, the company acquired investments in RF Micro Devices, Inc. (RFMD) and
Applera Corporation-Celera Genomics Group (Celera), two publicly traded companies. These investments had been monetized through the execution of forward share sale agreements. The company also acquired certain hedges designed to protect the
forecasted cash flows resulting from the future sale of shares in these investments. These hedges also mitigate any downside risk of loss and provide for additional gain depending on market conditions at maturity.

The investments in RFMD and Celera and the related hedge portion of the forward share sale
agreements are carried at their respective fair market values. As of December 31, 2003, all but 1.3 million RFMD shares have been delivered and all Celera shares have been delivered. As the value of the investments and the hedge were equivalent
during the period that the shares were held by the company, no gain or loss was realized. The fair value of the remaining RFMD shares at December 31, 2003, excluding the effect of the forward share sale agreements, was approximately $13 million. In
February 2004, the remaining RFMD shares were delivered and no gain or loss was realized.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation and Significant Accounting Estimates

– The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts, transactions, and profits are
eliminated in consolidation.

The unaudited quarterly information in Note 18 is
labeled using a calendar convention; that is, first quarter is consistently labeled as ended on March 31, second quarter as ended on June 30, and third quarter as ended on September 30. It is our long-standing practice to establish actual interim
closing dates using a “fiscal” calendar, which requires our businesses to close their books on a Friday, in order to normalize the potentially disruptive effects of quarterly closings on business processes. The effects of this practice
only exist within a reporting year. The fiscal closing calendar from 1998 through 2008 is available on our website,

www.northropgrumman.com

on the investor relations page under Financial Reports.

The company’s financial statements are in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. The preparation thereof requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial
statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates have been prepared on the basis of the most current and best available information and actual results could differ materially from those
estimates.

Nature of Operations –

Northrop Grumman provides
technologically advanced, innovative products, services and solutions in defense and commercial electronics, nuclear and non-nuclear shipbuilding, information technology, mission systems, systems integration, and space technology. As prime
contractor, principal subcontractor, partner, or preferred supplier, Northrop Grumman participates in many high-priority defense and commercial technology programs in the United States and abroad. The majority of the company’s products and
services are ultimately sold to the U. S. Government, and the company is therefore affected by, among other things, the federal budget process.

Revenue Recognition

– As a defense contractor engaging in long-term contracts, the company extensively utilizes the cost-to-cost and the units-of-delivery
measures of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Sales under cost-reimbursement contracts and construction-type contracts that provide for delivery at a low volume per year or a small number of units after a lengthy period of time over
which a significant amount of costs have been incurred are accounted for using the cost-to-cost measure of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under this method, sales, including estimated earned fees or profits, are recorded as costs
are incurred. For most contracts, sales are calculated based on the percentage that total costs incurred bear to total estimated costs. For certain contracts with large up-front purchases of material, sales are calculated based on the percentage
that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs. Sales under construction-type contracts that provide for delivery at a high volume per year are accounted for using the units-of-delivery measure of the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under this method, sales are recognized as deliveries are made and are computed on the basis of the estimated final average unit cost plus profit. Revenue on service contracts is recognized as the
services are performed.

Certain contracts contain provisions for price
redetermination or for cost and/or performance incentives. Such redetermined amounts or incentives are included in sales when the amounts can reasonably be determined. Amounts representing contract change orders, claims, or limitations in funding
are included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable. In the period in which it is determined that a loss will result from the performance of a contract, the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is
charged against income. Loss provisions are first offset against costs that are included in assets, with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities. Other changes in estimates of sales, costs, and profits are recognized using the cumulative
catch-up

-55-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

method of accounting. This method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods. Hence,
the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimates had been the original estimates. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the
company’s results of operations.

Research and Development –

Research and development expense totaled $3.1 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.2 billion during 2003, 2002, and 2001 of which $2.7 billion, $922 million, and $847 million were sponsored by the customer, respectively. Customer-sponsored research and
development costs (direct and indirect costs incurred pursuant to contractual arrangements) are accounted for like other contracts.

Noncontract Research and Development –

This category includes independent research and development costs and company-sponsored research and development costs
(direct and indirect costs not recoverable under contractual arrangements). Independent research and development (IR&D) costs are included in administrative and general expenses (indirect costs allocable to U. S. Government contracts) whereas
company-sponsored research and development costs are not allocable to U. S. Government contracts and are therefore charged against income as incurred.

Product Warranty Costs –

The company provides certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of non-conforming items for a specified period of
time. Most of the company’s product warranties are provided under government contracts, the costs of which are generally recoverable from the customer.

Environmental Costs –

Environmental liabilities are accrued when the company determines it is responsible for remediation costs and such amounts are
reasonably estimable. When only a range of amounts is established and no amount within the range is more probable than another, the minimum amount in the range is recorded. Environmental liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis. At sites
involving multiple parties, the company accrues environmental liabilities based upon its expected share of liability, taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties. Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized
as appropriate. Capitalized expenditures relate to long-lived improvements in currently operating facilities. The company does not anticipate and record insurance recoveries before collection is probable. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the company
did not accrue any assets related to insurance reimbursements or recoveries.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts

–

The company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exchange risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign
currencies. Gains and losses from such transactions are included as contract costs. At December 31, 2003, the amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was not material.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements –

The company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to offset the variable-rate
characteristic of certain variable-rate term loans which may be outstanding from time to time under the company’s Credit Facilities (see Note 12). The company may also enter into interest rate swap agreements to benefit from floating interest
rates as an offset to the fixed-rate characteristic of certain of its long-term debt. No interest rate swap agreements were in effect during 2003, 2002, or 2001.

Income Taxes –

Provisions for federal, foreign, state, and local income taxes are calculated on reported financial statement
pre-tax income based on current tax law and also include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently payable
because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. The company accounts for certain contracts in process using different methods of accounting for
financial reporting purposes and for tax reporting and thus provides deferred taxes on the difference between the financial and taxable income reported during the performance of such contracts. State and local income and franchise tax provisions are
included in administrative and general expenses.

-56-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Cash and Cash Equivalents

–

Cash and cash equivalents include interest-earning debt instruments that mature in three
months or less from the date purchased.

Accounts Receivable –

Accounts receivable include amounts billed and currently due from customers, amounts currently due but unbilled (primarily related to contracts accounted for under the cost-to-cost measure of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting),
certain estimated contract changes, claims in negotiation that are probable of recovery, and amounts retained by the customer pending contract completion.

Inventoried Costs –

Inventoried costs primarily relate to work in process under fixed-price contracts (excluding those included in unbilled accounts
receivable as previously described). They represent accumulated contract costs less the portion of such costs allocated to delivered items. Accumulated contract costs include direct production costs, factory and engineering overhead, production
tooling costs, and, for government contracts, allowable administrative and general expenses. General corporate expenses and IR&D allocable to commercial contracts are charged against income as incurred. Inventoried costs are classified as a
current asset and include amounts related to contracts having production cycles longer than one year. Product inventory primarily consists of raw materials and is stated at the lower of cost or market, generally using the average cost method.

Depreciable Properties

– Property, plant, and equipment owned by
the company are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of individual assets. Capital leases are amortized over the estimated useful lives of individual assets. Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are
capitalized and classified in machinery and other equipment. Capitalized software costs are amortized over no more than three years. Most of these assets are depreciated using declining-balance methods, with the remainder using the straight-line
method, with the following lives:

Goodwill and Other Purchased
Intangible Assets –

Effective January 1, 2002, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 –

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, which changed the accounting for goodwill and “indefinite
lived” intangibles from an amortization method to an impairment-only approach. Accordingly, amortization of goodwill, including goodwill recorded in past business combinations, ceased on December 31, 2001. Following is a reconciliation of
previously reported 2001 financial information adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization:

Beginning in 2002, impairment tests
are performed at least annually, and more often as circumstances require. When it is determined that an impairment has occurred, an appropriate charge to operations is recorded.

-57-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Goodwill and other purchased intangible assets balances are included in the identifiable assets of the business segment to which they have
been assigned. Any goodwill impairment, as well as the amortization of other purchased intangible assets, is charged against the respective business segment operating margin.

Forward Share Sale Agreements –

The company hedges certain equity investments in publicly traded companies. These instruments
protect the forecasted cash flows resulting from the contractual sale of shares in certain of the company’s investments in unconsolidated affiliates. These instruments are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133 –

Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, as amended. The investments and the related hedge instruments are carried at fair market value. Changes in fair market value of the investments, including the shares monetized, are recorded in the
other comprehensive income (loss) component of shareholders’ equity. Any gains or losses reported in other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to income at the maturity of these agreements.

Foreign Currency Translation –

For operations outside the U. S. that prepare
financial statements in currencies other than the U. S. dollar, results of operations and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates during the period, and assets and liabilities are generally translated at end-of-period exchange rates.
Translation adjustments are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.

Preferred Share Purchase Rights

– In the third quarter of 2003, the company amended its Preferred Share Purchase Rights Plan. The Plan expired on December 31,
2003.

Stock Compensation Plans –

The company applies Accounting
Principles Board Opinion 25 –

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

and related interpretations in accounting for awards made under stock compensation plans. When stock options are exercised, the cash proceeds received by the company
are recorded as an increase to paid-in capital. No compensation expense is recognized in connection with the stock options. Compensation expense for restricted performance stock rights and restricted stock rights is estimated and accrued over the
vesting period.

Had compensation expense been determined based on the fair
value at the grant dates for stock option awards, consistent with the method of SFAS No. 123

– Accounting for Stock Based Compensation

, net income, basic earnings per share, and diluted earnings per share would have been as shown in the
table below. These amounts were determined using weighted-average per share fair values for market options granted in 2003, 2002, and 2001 of $32, $39, and $26, respectively. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on an expected life of six years and for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively, the following additional assumptions – dividend yield: 1.7 percent, 1.4 percent, and 2.0 percent; expected
volatility: 35 percent, 35 percent, and 33 percent; and risk-free interest rate: 3.6 percent, 3.5 percent, and 4.7 percent.

Financial Statement Reclassification –

Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements and related notes have been
reclassified to conform to the 2003 presentation.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In December 2003, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised SFAS No. 132 –

Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

. The revisions to SFAS No. 132 retain the disclosure requirements contained in the original
SFAS No. 132 but require additional disclosures describing the types of plan assets, investment strategy, measurement dates, plan obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit
postretirement plans. The required disclosures have been included in Note 15.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150

–

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.

It requires an issuer to classify certain financial instruments as liabilities
and assets in defined circumstances. The provisions of SFAS No. 150, which also include a number of new disclosure requirements, are effective for instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and pre-existing instruments as of the
beginning of the first interim period that commenced after June 15, 2003. This statement was adopted July 1, 2003, and did not have a significant effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations.

In May 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) clarified certain provisions of EITF Issue
00-21 –

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

, which provides guidance on revenue recognition in certain arrangements with multiple deliverables. The guidance in this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in
fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. Adoption of EITF 00-21 did not have a significant effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149

– Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, which
clarifies and amends certain definitions and characteristics of derivative instruments contained in SFAS No. 133 –

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, FASB Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

and other existing pronouncements. This statement is primarily effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and for
hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. Adoption of this statement did not have a significant effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 46 –

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

(FIN 46). In
December 2003, FIN 46 was replaced by FASB interpretation No. 46(R)

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

. FIN 46(R) clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 –

Consolidated Financial Statements

,
to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support
from other parties. FIN 46(R) requires an enterprise to consolidate a variable interest entity if that enterprise will absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses, is entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual
returns, or both. FIN 46(R) is effective for entities being evaluated under FIN 46(R) for consolidation no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after March 15, 2004. Management does not believe the adoption of FIN 46(R) will
have a material impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN 45

– Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

. This interpretation elaborates on
the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee,
a liability for the

-59-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

fair value of the obligation undertaken by issuing the guarantee. This interpretation was adopted on January 1, 2003, and did not have a
significant effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 –

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,

which requires a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity to be recognized and measured at
its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. This statement was adopted January 1, 2003, and did not have a significant effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143 –

Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations.

SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. This statement became effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. This statement was adopted January 1, 2003, and did not have a significant effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations.

BUSINESSES ACQUIRED

In December 2002, the
company purchased 100 percent of the common stock of TRW Inc. (TRW). The company issued 69.4 million shares of its common stock at an exchange ratio of .5357 for each TRW share, with cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares of the company’s
stock, which otherwise would be issued to the TRW shareholders. These shares were valued at $107.31 per share for purchase accounting purposes. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, this value was determined based on the
average closing stock price of the company’s common stock from October 15, 2002, through October 21, 2002. In connection with the acquisition of TRW, the company entered into a formal stipulation and consent decree with the United States
Department of Justice that was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on December 11, 2002. Key provisions of the consent decree are intended to assure that the merger will not impede fair and open competition related to
certain electronic satellite payloads. The consent decree does not require the divestiture of any businesses and will permit the company to operate its businesses and those of TRW as planned. TRW’s defense business units are operated as two
separate sectors, Mission Systems and Space Technology.

The acquisition of
TRW, which was valued at approximately $12.5 billion, including the assumption of TRW’s debt of $4.8 billion, was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price is allocated to
the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair market values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. The financial statements as of December 31, 2002, reflect preliminary estimates of the
fair market value for purchased intangibles, retiree benefits assets and liabilities, and debt as well as preliminary estimates of adjustments necessary to conform TRW to the company’s accounting policies. TRW’s automotive operations
(Auto) were included in the total TRW valuation and were valued and recorded at its sale price which represents its fair market value. As of December 31, 2003, the company completed the fair market value and accounting conformance evaluation process
for TRW and recorded an aggregate increase to goodwill of $1.6 billion.

In
2001, the company purchased Litton Industries, Inc. (Litton), the Electronics and Information Systems Group of Aerojet-General Corporation (EIS), and 80.7 percent of Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. (Newport News). On January 18, 2002, the company
acquired the remaining shares of Newport News. The Litton business units operating results are included from the acquisition date in the company’s segment data as follows: Litton’s advanced electronics business is included in Electronic
Systems; Litton’s information systems business is included in Information Technology; and Litton’s ship business is included in Ships. Litton’s electronic components and materials business, Component Technologies, is classified as
discontinued operations. EIS was integrated into Electronic Systems and Newport News is included in the Ships segment.

-60-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

In 2001, the company accrued $119 million in restructuring costs related to the acquisition of Litton. These costs included $29 million to
exit a business, $31 million to close down redundant facilities, and $59 million to terminate and relocate employees. Of the total amount accrued, $5 million was charged to expense and $114 million was accounted for as purchase accounting
adjustments related to the acquisition of Litton. For the period from April 2, 2001, to December 31, 2001, the company utilized $25 million of the balance sheet accrual. In 2002, the company accrued an additional $13 million of costs to close down
redundant facilities related to this acquisition, utilized $57 million, and reversed $1 million to income as it was no longer required. During 2003, the company utilized $17 million of the balance sheet accrual, accrued an additional $1 million, and
reversed $5 million to income as it was no longer required. At December 31, 2003, $28 million of accrued restructuring costs remained, including $17 million in other current liabilities and $11 million in other long-term liabilities.

4.

BUSINESSES SOLD AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On
February 28, 2003, the company sold Auto to The Blackstone Group for $3.3 billion in cash, a $600 million face value payment-in-kind note, initially valued at $455 million, and a 19.6 percent interest in the new enterprise, initially
valued at $170 million. The cash received from the sale of Auto was adjusted from the sale agreement amount by cash sold with the business, preliminary purchase price adjustments, and an asset retained. The acquirer also assumed debt of
approximately $200 million. Cash proceeds from the sale were primarily used to reduce debt. The payment-in-kind note matures in 2018 and bears interest at an effective yield of 11.7 percent per annum. In January 2004, restrictions on the
investment in Auto were amended to provide the company more flexibility in monetization. In February 2004, the company’s investment in Auto was diluted to 17.2 percent as a result of Auto’s initial public offering.

During the third quarter of 2002, the company concluded that the Component Technologies (CT)
businesses, which were acquired as part of the 2001 Litton acquisition, did not fit with the company’s long-term plan and decided to sell the businesses. During 2003, the company sold several of the CT business units: the VEAM business units;
Life Support; and Poly-Scientific. The company also sold its 51 percent interest in the operations of TRW Koyo Steering Systems Company. None of these sales, either individually or in the aggregate, had a material impact on the company’s
financial condition or results of operations.

As of December 31, 2003,
three CT businesses remained to be sold whose assets and liabilities have been classified as held for sale. One of these businesses, Kester, was sold in February 2004. The sale of Kester and the remaining businesses classified as discontinued
operations is not expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations.

In October 2002, Northrop Grumman completed the sale of two Electronic Systems sector businesses, Electron Devices and Ruggedized Displays,
for $135 million.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144

– Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

, the results of operations of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations, net of applicable income taxes, for all periods presented. As such, discontinued operations includes the
operating results for all sold companies up to the date of sale.

Summary Segment Financial Information

In the following table of segment and major customer data, revenue from the
United States Government includes revenue from contracts for which Northrop Grumman is the prime contractor as well as those for which the company is a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is the U.S. Government. The company’s discontinued
operations are excluded from all of the data elements in this table, except for assets by segment. The 2002 income statement does not include TRW’s post-acquisition results as they were not material.

Adjustments to reconcile to total operating margin –

Pension expense is included
in the segments’ cost of sales to the extent that these costs are currently recognized under government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). In order to reconcile from segment operating margin to total company operating margin, these amounts are
reported under the caption “Reversal of CAS pension expense included above.” Total pension income or expense accounted for under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States is reported separately as a reconciling item
under the caption “Pension (expense) income.” The reconciling item captioned “Unallocated expenses” includes the portion of corporate, legal, environmental, state income tax, other retiree benefits expenses, and other expenses
not considered allowable under CAS and not allocated to the segments.

Foreign Sales –

Foreign sales amounted to approximately $1.6 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.3 billion during 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. All of the company’s segments engage in international business, for which the
company retains a large number of sales representatives and consultants who are not employees of the company. Foreign sales by their very nature are subject to greater variability in risk than the company’s domestic sales, particularly to the
U.S. Government. International sales and services subject the company to numerous stringent U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to import-export control, repatriation of earnings, exchange
controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Failure by the company or its sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in
administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could in the extreme case result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of the company’s export privileges, which could have material adverse consequences.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic Earnings Per
Share

– Basic earnings per share from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change are calculated by dividing income available to common shareholders from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting
change by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.

Diluted Earnings Per Share

– Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change reflect the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock awards granted
to employees under stock-based compensation plans and the dilutive effect of the equity security units, as applicable. Shares issuable pursuant to mandatorily redeemable preferred stock are not included in the diluted earnings per share calculations
because their effect is anti-dilutive for all periods presented.

Effects of
SFAS No. 150 –

Through June 30, 2003, income available to common shareholders from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change is calculated by reducing income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of
accounting change by the amount of dividends accrued on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. Effective July 1, 2003, the company adopted SFAS No. 150 –

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities
and Equity

. Following adoption of this standard, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock is reported as a long-term liability in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. In addition, the $12 million of dividends accrued on
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock for the second half of 2003 are recorded as interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore already deducted from income from continuing operations before cumulative
effect of accounting change. This change has had no effect on the earnings per share calculation. This standard is required to be adopted on a prospective basis, and accordingly, no restatement of prior periods has been made.

Share Repurchase Program

– In the third quarter of 2003 the company approved a
share repurchase program of up to $700 million of its outstanding common stock. Share purchases will take place at management’s discretion from time to time, depending on market conditions, in the open market, and in privately negotiated
transactions through the end of 2004. As of December 31, 2003, the company had repurchased over 2.2 million shares for approximately $200 million.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change are calculated as follows for
the years ended December 31:

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET

Unbilled amounts
represent sales for which billings have not been presented to customers at year-end, including differences between actual and estimated overhead and margin rates. These amounts are usually billed and collected within one year. Progress payments are
received on a number of fixed-price contracts accounted for using the cost-to-cost measure of the percentage-of-completion method.

Accounts receivable at December 31, 2003, are expected to be collected in 2004 except for approximately $145 million due in 2005 and $58 million due in 2006 and later.

Allowances for doubtful amounts mainly represent estimates of overhead type
costs which may not be successfully negotiated and collected.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Accounts receivable were composed of the following at December 31:

INVENTORIED COSTS

Inventoried costs relate to
long-term contracts in process and include expenditures for raw materials and work in process. The ratio of inventoried administrative and general expenses to total inventoried costs is estimated to be the same as the ratio of total administrative
and general expenses incurred to total contract costs incurred. According to the provisions of U. S. Government contracts, the customer asserts title to, or a security interest in, substantially all inventories related to such contracts. Product
inventory primarily consists of raw materials and is stated at the lower of cost or market, generally using the average cost method.

Inventoried costs were composed of the following at December 31:

GOODWILL AND OTHER PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill

Effective January 1, 2002, the company adopted SFAS No. 142 –

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, which changes the
accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment-only approach. In accordance with the statement, amortization of goodwill, including goodwill recorded in past business combinations, ceased December 31, 2001. Impairment tests are
performed at least annually and more often as circumstances require. Goodwill and other purchased intangible assets balances are included in the identifiable assets of the segment to which they have been assigned. Any goodwill impairment, as well as
the amortization of other purchased intangible assets, is charged against the respective segment’s operating margin. The annual impairment test for all sectors except Mission Systems and Space Technology was performed as of April 30, 2003, with
no indication of impairment. The impairment test for Mission Systems and Space Technology was performed as of November 30, 2003, with no indication of impairment. A goodwill impairment charge of $47 million related to the Component Technologies
businesses was recorded in 2003 and is included in “Income (loss) from discontinued operations” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In performing the goodwill impairment tests, the company uses a discounted cash flow approach
corroborated by comparative market multiples, where appropriate, to determine the fair value of reporting units.

The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, are summarized below.

The results of the initial impairment
test as of January 1, 2002, indicated potential impairment in the reporting units of the Component Technologies sector due to unfavorable market conditions. As a result, the company recorded a non-cash charge of $432 million in 2002 reported under
the caption “Cumulative effect of accounting change,” in the Consolidated Statements of Income in addition to an impairment charge included in loss from discontinued operations of $186 million.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Purchased Intangible Assets

During the
second quarter of 2002, the company completed its evaluation of the fair value of the purchased intangible assets associated with the acquisition of Newport News in 2001, which resulted in a value of $768 million and a weighted-average useful life
of 47 years. In connection with the acquisition of TRW, the company allocated $416 million of the purchase price as purchased intangible assets with a weighted-average life of 8 years. The table below summarizes the company’s aggregate
purchased intangible assets as of December 31, 2003 and 2002.

All of the company’s purchased
intangible assets are subject to amortization and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over an aggregate weighted-average period of 22 years. Aggregate amortization expense during 2003, 2002, and 2001 was $239 million, $178
million, and $139 million, including amortization expense reported in discontinued operations of $12 million, $14 million, and $11 million, respectively.

The table below shows expected amortization for purchased intangibles as of December 31, 2003, for the next five years:

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Carrying
amounts and the related estimated fair values of the company’s financial instruments at December 31 are as follows:

-72-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Short-Term Instruments –

For cash and cash equivalents and amounts borrowed under the company’s short-term credit lines,
the carrying amounts approximate fair value, due to the short-term nature of these items.

Investment in Auto –

The company’s investment in Auto represents the company’s equity interest in TRW Automotive Holdings, Inc., received upon the completion of the sale of Auto, and is carried
at cost in “Other assets” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. It is not practical to determine a fair value of this equity interest as of December 31, 2003, as the common stock did not trade publicly at that
time. On February 2, 2004, TRW Automotive Holdings, Inc., completed its initial public offering, and the stock began trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange (trading symbol TRW) on February 3, 2004. Using the February 3, 2004,
closing price of $27.10, the fair market value of the company’s 17 million shares, if the shares were not restricted, was approximately $461 million. The company’s equity ownership position following the initial public offering was
17.2 percent.

Note Receivable –

The note receivable, which is
classified in “Other assets” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, is the payment-in-kind note issued by TRW Automotive Intermediate Holdings, Inc., received upon the completion of the sale of Auto. The note
matures in 2018 and bears interest at an effective yield of 11.7 percent per annum. Terms of the note preclude resale prior to February 28, 2004, and allow for resale under certain conditions subsequent to that date. Since there is no quoted market
price available for this note, the fair value was assessed taking into consideration the market price of the public debt of the issuer’s operating subsidiary, structural characteristics of the note, and potential redemption dates.

Long-Term Debt

– The fair value of the long-term debt was calculated based on
interest rates available for debt with terms and due dates similar to the company’s existing debt arrangements.

Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock

– The fair value of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock was calculated based on the closing market price quoted
on the New York Stock Exchange (trading symbol NOC-pb) at December 31, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Forward Share Sale Agreements –

In connection with the TRW acquisition, the company acquired investments in RF Micro Devices, Inc. (RFMD) and Applera Corporation-Celera Genomics Group (Celera), two
publicly traded companies. These investments had been monetized through the execution of forward share sale agreements. The company also acquired certain hedges designed to protect the forecasted cash flows resulting from the future sale of shares
in these investments. These hedges also mitigate any downside risk of loss and provide for additional gain depending on market conditions at maturity. The investments in RFMD and Celera and the related hedge portion of the forward share sale
agreements were carried at their respective fair market values. As of December 31, 2003, all but 1.3 million RFMD shares have been delivered and all Celera shares have been delivered. As the value of the investments and the hedge were equivalent
during the period that the shares were held by the company, no gain or loss was realized. The fair value of the remaining RFMD shares at December 31, 2003, excluding the effect of the forward share sale agreements, was approximately $13 million. In
February 2004, the remaining RFMD shares were delivered and no gain or loss was realized.

Derivatives –

The company makes limited use of derivative financial instruments and does not hold or issue them for trading purposes. The company has from time to time entered into interest rate swap
agreements to mitigate interest rate risk. No interest rate swap agreements were in effect at December 31, 2003 and 2002.

Foreign Currency –

The company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exchange risk related to receipts from customers and
payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. Gains and losses from such transactions are included as contract costs. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was not material.

INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense, both federal
and foreign, consisted of the following for the years ended December 31:

Income tax expense differs from the
amount computed by multiplying the statutory federal income tax rate times the income from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change due to the following for the years ended December 31:

Deferred income taxes

–
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax purposes. Such amounts are classified as current or noncurrent assets or
liabilities based upon the balance sheet classification of the related assets and liabilities. The company’s principal temporary differences arise from the recognition of income from long-term contracts and retiree benefit plan income/expense
under different methods for financial reporting purposes and tax purposes.

-74-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

The tax effects of significant temporary differences and carryforwards that gave rise to year-end deferred federal and state tax balances,
as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, are as follows at December 31:

Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)
as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position are as follows at December 31:

The company intends to reinvest
undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, thereby indefinitely postponing their remittance. Accordingly, deferred income taxes have not been provided for accumulated undistributed earnings of $80 million at December 31, 2003. Should
these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, the distributions would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the statutory rate of 35 percent, less foreign tax credits applicable to distributions, if any. In addition, such
distributions would be subject to withholding taxes in the various tax jurisdictions.

Tax Carryforwards –

The company has foreign income tax credit carryforward items of $214 million at December 31, 2003, to offset future federal income tax liabilities, against which a valuation allowance of $207

-75-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

million has been recorded. Of the foreign income tax credit carryforward, $207 million arose from the sale of discontinued operations and
will expire in 2004 through 2008. In addition, the company has a capital loss carryforward of $1.2 billion (tax effected) at December 31, 2003, against which a full valuation allowance of $1.2 billion has been recorded. The capital loss carryforward
arose from the sale of discontinued operations and will expire in 2008. Future reductions to the valuation allowance resulting from the recognition of tax benefits, if any, will reduce goodwill. The company has a $9 million research and development
tax credit carryforward item at December 31, 2003, which will expire in 2017 through 2022.

12.

NOTES PAYABLE TO BANKS AND LONG-TERM DEBT

The
company has available short-term credit lines in the form of money market facilities with several banks. The amount and conditions for borrowing under these credit lines depend on the availability and terms prevailing in the marketplace. No fees or
compensating balances are required for these credit facilities.

TRW Debt
Reduction –

In connection with the acquisition of TRW, the company assumed various notes and debentures amounting to approximately $4.8 billion. In March 2003, the company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Northrop Grumman Space & Mission
Systems Corp. (formerly TRW Inc.), commenced offers to purchase any or all of certain designated outstanding debt securities in a debt reduction plan substantially completed in the second quarter of 2003. In the first phase, approximately $2.4
billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities were tendered and accepted for purchase, for a total purchase price of approximately $2.9 billion (including accrued and unpaid interest on the securities). In the second phase,
the company purchased on the open market $658 million in aggregate principal amount for a total purchase price of $795 million (including accrued and unpaid interest on the securities). Cash proceeds from the sale of Auto were used to complete these
transactions, which contributed to the reduction of total long-term debt to $5.9 billion at December 31, 2003, from $9.6 billion at December 31, 2002.

Notes and Debentures

– In February 2001, Northrop Systems issued $1.5 billion of indebtedness pursuant to its senior debt indenture consisting of $750 million
of 7.125 percent notes due 2011 and $750 million of 7.75 percent debentures due 2031.

Credit Facilities

– In connection with the closing of the Litton acquisition, the company entered into unsecured senior credit facilities with lenders, which initially provided for borrowings of up to $5 billion (Credit
Facilities) and replaced the company’s previous credit agreement. The Credit Facilities consisted of a $2.5 billion 364-day revolving credit facility and a $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility. The 364-day revolving credit facility
was terminated by the company in December 2001. At December 31, 2003, $2.5 billion was available under the five-year revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities, together with the proceeds of the February 2001 issuance of notes
and debentures, were used to finance the Litton acquisition and to pay related expenses, to retire and refinance a portion of the Litton debt, and to finance continuing operations. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at various
rates, including adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or an alternate base rate plus, in each case, an incremental margin based on the company’s credit rating. The Credit Facilities also provide for a facility fee on the daily
aggregate amount of commitments under the revolving facilities (whether or not utilized). The facility fee is also based on the company’s credit rating level. The company’s credit agreements contain various restrictive covenants relating
to the payment of dividends, acquisition of the company’s stock, minimum fixed charges, aggregate indebtedness for borrowed money, interest coverage, as well as customary covenants, representations and warranties, funding conditions and events
of default. Under the most restrictive provisions of the Credit Facilities, the estimated amount available for common stock dividends, while maintaining financial agreement covenant compliance, was $208 million at December 31, 2003.

Equity Security Units –

In November 2001, the company issued 6.9 million equity
security units. Each equity security unit, issued at $100 per unit, initially consists of a contract to purchase shares of Northrop Grumman

-76-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

common stock on November 16, 2004, and a $100 senior note due 2006. The senior notes due 2006 are reported as long-term debt. The senior
notes initially bear interest at 5.25 percent per annum, and each equity security unit also pays a contract adjustment payment of 2.0 percent per annum, for a combined yield on the equity security unit of 7.25 percent per annum. Each purchase
contract, which is part of the equity security units, will obligate the holder thereof to purchase on November 16, 2004, for $100, the following number of shares of the company’s common stock based on the average closing price of the
company’s common stock over the 20-day trading period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding November 16, 2004: (i) 0.9262 shares if the average closing price equals or exceeds $107.97, (ii) a number of shares having a value
equal to $100 if the average closing price is less than $107.97 but greater than $88.50 and (iii) 1.1299 shares if the average closing price is less than or equal to $88.50. Prior to November 16, 2004, holders of equity security units have the
opportunity to participate in a remarketing of the senior note component.

Long-term debt at December 31 consisted of the following:

Indentures underlying long-term debt
issued by the company or its subsidiaries contain various restrictions with respect to the issuer, including one or more restrictions relating to limitations on liens, sale and leaseback arrangements, and funded debt of subsidiaries.

Maturities of long-term debt as of December 31, 2003, are as follows:

The premium on long-term debt
primarily represents non-cash fair market value adjustments resulting from the acquisitions of Litton and TRW.

13.

MINORITY INTEREST

Upon the acquisition of TRW on
December 11, 2002, TRW Automotive Inc. (TAI) became a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman Corporation. As of December 31, 2002, TAI had outstanding 100,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (TAI Series A) and 30,000 shares of Series B
Preferred Stock (TAI Series B), of which

-77-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

14,000 shares were owned by Northrop Grumman. All of the outstanding TAI Series A and TAI Series B shares were redeemed in 2003 for $117
million.

14.

MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

The company issued 3.5 million shares of mandatorily redeemable Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in April 2001. Each share of Series B preferred stock has a liquidation value of $100 per share. The liquidation
value, plus accrued but unpaid dividends, is payable on April 4, 2021, the mandatory redemption date. The company has the option to redeem all but not less than all of the shares of Series B preferred stock at any time after seven years from the
date of issuance for a number of shares of the company’s common stock equal to the liquidation value plus accrued and unpaid dividends divided by the current market price of common stock determined in relation to the date of redemption. Under
this option, were the redemption to have taken place at December 31, 2003, each share would have been converted into 1.064 shares of common stock. Each share of preferred stock is convertible, at any time, at the option of the holder into the right
to receive shares of the company’s common stock. Initially, each share was convertible into .911 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment in the event of certain dividends and distributions, a merger, consolidation or sale of substantially
all of the company’s assets, a liquidation or distribution, and certain other events. Were the conversion to have taken place at December 31, 2003, each share would have been converted into .911 shares of common stock. Holders of preferred
stock are entitled to cumulative annual cash dividends of $7 per share, payable quarterly. In any liquidation of the company, each share of preferred stock is entitled to a liquidation preference before any distribution may be made on the
company’s common stock or any series of capital stock that is junior to the Series B preferred stock. In the event of a change in control of the company, holders of Series B preferred stock also have specified exchange rights into common stock
of the company or into specified securities or property of another entity participating in the change in control transaction.

Effective July 1, 2003, the company adopted SFAS No. 150 –

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity

.
Following adoption of the standard, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock is reported as a long-term liability in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. As of December 31, 2003, 10 million preferred stock shares are authorized and 3.5
million shares are issued and outstanding.

15.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS

Plan Descriptions

Pension Benefits

– The company sponsors several defined benefit pension plans covering over 90 percent of its employees. Pension benefits
for most employees are based on the employee’s years of service and compensation. It is the policy of the company to fund at least the minimum amount required for all qualified plans, using actuarial cost methods and assumptions acceptable
under U. S. Government regulations, by making payments into benefit trusts separate from the company. Starting in July 2003, the pension benefit for most employees is based upon new criteria, whereby employees earn age and service points over their
employment period. Subsequent to the 2003 initial phase-in, other exempt and non-exempt plans will be conformed to the new model. No settlement or curtailments arose as a result of these changes. Union plans will not be affected by these plan
modifications. Nine of the company’s 21 qualified plans, which cover approximately 60 percent of all employees, were in a legally defined full-funding limitation status at December 31, 2003.

The company and subsidiaries also sponsor defined contribution plans in which most employees
are eligible to participate. Company contributions for most plans are based on a cash matching of employee contributions up to 4 percent of compensation.

-78-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Medical and Life Benefits

– The company and its subsidiaries provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired
employees. Certain employees achieve eligibility to participate in these contributory plans upon retirement from active service and if they meet specified age and years of service requirements. Election to participate must be made at the date of
retirement. Qualifying dependents are also eligible for medical coverage. Approximately 60 percent of the company’s current retirees participate in the medical plans. The company reserves the right to amend or terminate the plans at any time.
Premiums charged retirees for medical coverage are based on years of service and are adjusted annually for changes in the cost of the plans as determined by an independent actuary. In addition to this medical inflation cost-sharing feature, the
plans also have provisions for deductibles, copayments, coinsurance percentages, out-of-pocket limits, schedule of reasonable fees, managed care providers, maintenance of benefits with other plans, Medicare carve-out, and a maximum lifetime benefit
of from $250,000 to $1,000,000 per covered individual. It is the policy of the company to fund the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes utilizing the Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust established for the
Northrop Retiree Health Care Plan for Retired Employees for payment of benefits.

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 expanded Medicare by introducing a prescription drug benefit as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans. The company sponsors
retiree health care benefit plans for certain of its locations and expects that this legislation may eventually reduce the company’s costs for some of these programs under the federal subsidy. Because of various uncertainties related to this
legislation, the company has elected to defer financial recognition of this legislation until the FASB issues final accounting guidance, as permitted under FASB Staff Position (FSP) 106-1

– Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to
the New Medicare Prescription Drug Law,

which was issued by the FASB on January 12, 2004.

Summary Plan Results

The cost to the company of these plans in each of the last three years is shown in the
following table.

-79-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

The following tables set forth the funded status and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position for the
company’s defined-benefit pension and retiree health care and life insurance benefit plans. Pension benefits data includes the qualified plans as well as 24 unfunded non-qualified plans for benefits provided to directors, officers, and
employees either beyond those provided by, or payable under, the company’s qualified plans. The company uses a December 31 measurement date for most of its plans.

-80-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $15.4 billion and $19.8 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Amounts for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations
in excess of plan assets are as follows at December 31:

Plan Assumptions

On a weighted-average basis, the following assumptions were used to determine the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost:

These assumptions also were used in
retiree health care and life insurance benefit calculations with one modification. Since, unlike the pension trust, the earnings of the VEBA trust are taxable, the above long-term rate of return on plan assets was reduced accordingly to an after-tax
rate.

Through consultation with investment advisors, expected long-term
returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset classes were developed. Several factors were considered, including survey of investment managers’ expectations, current market data such as yields/price-earnings ratios, and historical market
returns over long periods. Using policy target allocation percentages and the asset class expected returns, a weighted-average expected return was calculated.

Health care cost trend rate assumptions used to determine the expected cost of retiree health care plans are as follows:

-81-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Assumed health care trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change
in health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

Plan Assets and Investment Policy

Weighted-average asset allocations at December 31 by asset category are as follows:

Plan assets are invested in various
asset classes that are expected to produce a sufficient level of diversification and investment return over the long term. The investment goals are (1) to exceed the assumed actuarial rate of return over the long term within reasonable and prudent
levels of risk, and (2) to preserve the real purchasing power of assets to meet future obligations. Liability studies are conducted on a regular basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an objective to balance risk. Risk targets
are established and monitored against acceptable ranges.

All investment
policies and procedures are designed to ensure that the plans’ investments are in compliance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Guidelines are established defining permitted investments within each asset class. Derivatives are
used for transitioning assets, asset class rebalancing, managing currency risk, and for fixed income management. Other uses of derivatives, including for speculation, are prohibited.

Equity securities held by pension plans include Northrop Grumman Corporation common stock in the amounts of $664 million (4 percent of total
plan assets) and $1,052 million (8 percent of total plan assets) at December 31, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Equity securities in the VEBA trust include Northrop Grumman Corporation common stock in the amounts of $9.7 million (2 percent of total
plan assets) at December 31, 2003, and none in 2002.

In 2004, the company
expects to contribute approximately $345 million to its pension plans and approximately $176 million to its other postretirement benefit plans.

Benefit Payments

The following table
reflects estimated benefit payments, based upon the same assumptions used to measure the benefit obligation, and include expected future employee service, as of December 31, 2003:

16.

LITIGATION, COMMITMENTS, AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation

– The company is subject to a range of claims, lawsuits, environmental and income tax matters, and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Estimating liabilities and costs associated
with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its internal and external legal counsel. In accordance with SFAS No. 5 –

Accounting for Contingencies

, amounts are
recorded as charges to earnings when management, after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter, including any settlement offers, has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known. Based upon available information, it is the company’s expectation that
known legal actions are either without merit or will have no material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position. For newly acquired businesses, management applies judgment in estimating the fair value of
liabilities assumed, including those related to claims, lawsuits, environmental matters, and administrative proceedings, as part of its purchase accounting determinations. While the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters,
resolution of one or more of these matters individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations, but resolution of these matters may have a material effect on
cash flows.

The company, as a government contractor, is from time to time
subject to U. S. Government investigations relating to its operations. Government contractors that are found to have violated the False Claims Act, or are indicted or convicted for violations of other federal laws, or are considered not to be
responsible contractors may be suspended or debarred from government contracting for some period of time. Such convictions could also result in fines. Given the company’s dependence on government contracting, suspension or debarment could have
a material adverse effect on the company.

In 2003, the company settled two
previously reserved civil False Claims Act cases, U.S. v. Newport News Shipbuilding, Inc. and U.S. ex rel. Jordan, and recorded loss provisions for settlement offers on other legal matters, resulting in a net gain of $17 million. The two settled
cases required payments by the company of approximately $80 million.

In August
1992, in U.S. ex rel. Rex Robinson v. Northrop Grumman Corporation, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois unsealed a complaint brought by four individuals in the name of the United States of America. The action was
filed on August 10, 1989, seeking damages under the qui tam provision of the civil False Claims Act. On July 28, 1992, the government declined to intervene in this action. Plaintiffs amended their damage claim and now seek compensatory
damages of approximately $369 million, which could be

-83-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

trebled under the False Claims Act, together with statutory penalties of up to $39 million, pre-judgment interest, loss of use of money
and other unspecified damages for expenses, attorney fees, and costs. The individual relators also seek damages in their individual capacities for alleged retaliation. In 2001, the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office filed a
motion to intervene in the action, which motion was granted on October 12, 2001. The company denies the allegations and continues to vigorously defend the action.

The IRS is presently completing its audits of the B-2 program for the tax years ended December 31, 1997, to December 31, 2000.
Upon completion of these audits, the IRS may adopt a position that the B-2 program was completed in a year prior to 2002, which would create the potential for additional interest expense. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of
the tax audits at this time, management believes that its tax accounting for the B-2 program reflects the appropriate timing of contract completion.

Environmental Matters

– In accordance with company policy on environmental remediation, the estimated cost to complete remediation has been accrued where it
is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future, to address environmental impacts of current or formerly owned operating facilities or at sites it has been named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) by the Environmental Protection
Agency or similarly designated by other environmental agencies. To assess the potential impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements, management estimates the total reasonably possible remediation costs that could be incurred by
the company, taking into account currently available facts on each site as well as the current state of technology and prior experience in remediating contaminated sites. These estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect changes in
facts and technical and legal circumstances. Management estimates that at December 31, 2003, the range of reasonably possible future costs for environmental remediation is $251 million to $366 million, of which $271 million has been
accrued. Factors which could result in changes to the company’s environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss include: modification of planned remedial actions, increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate,
discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated, changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements, and improvements in remediation technology. Should other PRP’s not pay their allocable share of remediation costs,
the company may have to incur costs in addition to those already estimated and accrued. Although management cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will materially affect the estimated liability accrued, management does
not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Indemnifications

– The company has retained certain liabilities associated with the Auto business as well as the Aeronautical
Systems business that TRW divested in 2002. Subsequent adjustments to accruals recorded as of December 31, 2003, in connection with the divestitures of TRW’s Auto and Aeronautical Systems businesses, if any, will be charged to discontinued
operations. There can be no assurance that such adjustments will not be material.

Other agreements

– In July and August of 2003, Ship Systems executed agreements with the states of Mississippi and Louisiana, respectively, wherein Ship Systems will lease facility improvements and equipment from these states in
exchange for certain commitments by Ship Systems. Under the Mississippi agreement, Ship Systems is required to match the state’s funding with expenditures in the amount of $121 million and create 667 new full-time jobs in Mississippi by
December 2007. Under the Louisiana agreement, Ship Systems is required to match the state’s funding with expenditures in the amount of $56 million by December 2007, and employ a minimum of 5,200 full-time employees in 16 of the
32 fiscal quarters beginning January 1, 2003, and ending December 31, 2010. Failure by Ship Systems to meet these commitments would result in reimbursement by Ship Systems to Mississippi and Louisiana in accordance with the respective
agreements.

Financial Arrangements –

In the ordinary course of
business, the company uses standby letters of credit issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued by insurance companies principally to guarantee the performance on

-84-


NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

certain contracts and to support the company’s self-insured workers’ compensation plans. At December 31, 2003, there were
$619 million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding and $584 million of surety bonds outstanding. For all years presented, the company had no material related party transactions.

Operating Leases

– Rental expense for operating leases, excluding discontinued operations, was $463 million in 2003, $303
million in 2002, and $214 million in 2001. These amounts are net of sublease rental income of $8 million in 2003, $5 million in 2002, and $3 million in 2001. Minimum rental commitments under long-term noncancellable operating leases as of
December 31, 2003, total $1.8 billion, which are payable as follows: 2004 - $347 million; 2005 - $297 million; 2006 - $232 million; 2007 - $196 million; 2008 - $159 million; and thereafter - $530 million. In addition, the company has
contracts for future sublease income totaling $18 million.

17.

STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS

At December 31, 2003,
Northrop Grumman had three stock-based compensation plans: the 2001 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan (2001 LTISP), and the 1993 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan (1993 LTISP), both applicable to employees, and the 1995 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee
Directors (SOPND). All of these plans are approved by the company’s shareholders.

Employee Plans

– The 2001 LTISP and the 1993 LTISP permit grants to key employees of three general types of stock incentive awards: stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), and stock awards. Each stock option grant is
made with an exercise price either at the closing price of the stock on the date of grant (market options) or at a premium over the closing price of the stock on the date of grant (premium options). Options generally vest in 25 percent
increments one, two, three, and four years from the grant date under the 2001 LTISP and two, three, four, and five years from the grant date under the 1993 LTISP. Under both plans, options expire ten years after the grant date. No SARs have
been granted under either of the LTISP’s. Stock awards, in the form of restricted performance stock rights and restricted stock rights, are granted to key employees without payment to the company. Under the 2001 LTISP, recipients of restricted
performance stock rights earn shares of stock based on an economic value added (EVA) metric over a three-year performance period with distributions made entirely at the end of the third year. Under the 1993 LTISP, recipients of restricted
performance stock rights earn shares of stock based on a total-shareholder-return measure of performance over a five-year performance period with interim distributions three and four years after grant. If at the end of the applicable performance
period objectives have not been met, unearned rights up to 100 percent of the original grant for five elected officers and the three next highest compensated employees, and up to 70 percent of the original grant for all other recipients, will be
forfeited. Restricted stock rights issued under either plan vest annually, generally over three years. Termination of employment can result in forfeiture of some or all of the benefits extended under the plan. At December 31, 2003,
approximately 16 million shares were available for future grants under the 2001 LTISP.

Nonemployee Plan

– The SOPND permits grants of stock options to nonemployee directors. Each grant of a stock option is made at the closing market price on the date of the grant, is immediately exercisable,
and expires ten years after the grant date. At December 31, 2003, 189,000 shares were available for future grants under the SOPND.

Stock Awards

– Compensation expense for restricted performance stock rights is estimated and recognized over the vesting period. The fixed 30 percent
minimum distribution portion is measured at the grant date fair value and the variable portion is adjusted to the fair value at the end of each accounting period. Compensation expense for restricted stock rights is measured at the grant date fair
value and recognized over the vesting period. Restricted performance stock rights and restricted stock rights were granted with weighted-average grant-date fair values per share as follows: 2003 - 1,147,300 at $94; 2002 - 846,145 at $114; and 2001 -
812,730 at $81.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Option Conversions

– In connection with the acquisition of Litton, the company converted Litton stock options to company stock
options. For Litton options only, a reduction of shareholders’ equity was recorded and is being amortized as compensation expense through 2005. Acquired TRW options were converted to the company’s options and fully vested on the date of
acquisition.

Compensation Expense

– Total stock-based compensation
expense was $99 million in 2003, $69 million in 2002, and $27 million in 2001.

Stock option activity for the last three years is summarized below:

At December 31, 2003, the following
stock options were outstanding:

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

Board of
Directors and Shareholders of

Northrop Grumman Corporation

Los Angeles, California

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
statements of financial position of Northrop Grumman Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and the financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Northrop Grumman Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
