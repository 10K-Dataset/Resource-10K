HISTORY
    AND ORGANIZATION

History

Northrop Grumman Corporation (“Northrop Grumman” or
    the “company”) is an integrated enterprise consisting
    of many formerly separate businesses that cover the entire
    defense spectrum, from undersea to outer space and into
    cyberspace. The companies that have become part of today’s
    Northrop Grumman achieved historic accomplishments, from
    transporting Charles Lindbergh across the Atlantic to carrying
    astronauts to the moon’s surface and back.

The company was originally formed in California in 1939 and was
    reincorporated in Delaware in 1985. From 1994 through 2002, the
    company entered a period of significant expansion through
    acquisitions of other businesses, most notably:

n

In 1994, Northrop Corporation acquired Grumman Corporation
    (Grumman) and was renamed Northrop Grumman. Grumman was a
    premier military aircraft systems integrator and builder of the
    Lunar Module that first delivered men to the surface of the moon.

n

In 1996, the company acquired the defense and electronics
    businesses of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, a world leader
    in the development and production of sophisticated radar and
    other electronic systems for the nation’s defense, civil
    aviation, and other international and domestic applications.

n

In 1997, the company acquired Logicon, a provider of military
    and commercial information systems and services that met the
    needs of its national defense, civil and industrial customers.

n

In 1999, the company acquired Teledyne Ryan (Ryan), a business
    unit of Allegheny-Teledyne, a world leader in the design,
    development and manufacture of unmanned airborne reconnaissance,
    surveillance, deception and target systems. In 1927, Ryan
    produced the

Spirit of St. Louis

, which Charles
    Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic. Ryan was also a pioneer in
    the development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).

n

In 2001, the company acquired Litton Industries (Litton), a
    global electronics and information technology enterprise, and
    one of the nation’s leading full-service design,
    engineering, construction, and life cycle supporters of major
    surface ships for the United States (U.S.) Navy, U.S. Coast
    Guard, and international navies.

n

Also in 2001, Newport News Shipbuilding (Newport News) was added
    to the company. Newport News is the nation’s sole designer,
    builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and
    one of only two companies capable of designing and building
    nuclear-powered submarines.

n

In 2002, Northrop Grumman acquired the space and mission systems
    businesses of TRW, a leading developer of military and civil
    space systems and satellite payloads, as well as a leading
    global integrator of complex, mission-enabling systems and
    services.

The acquisition of these and other businesses have shaped the
    company into its present position as a premier provider of
    technologically advanced, innovative products, services and
    solutions in information and services, aerospace, electronics
    and shipbuilding. As prime contractor, principal subcontractor,
    partner, or preferred supplier, Northrop Grumman participates in
    many high-priority defense and commercial technology programs in
    the U.S. and abroad. The company conducts most of its
    business with the U.S. Government, principally the
    Department of Defense (DoD). The company also conducts business
    with local, state, and foreign governments and domestic and
    international commercial customers. For a description of the
    company’s foreign operations, see Risk Factors in
    Part I, Item 1A.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Organization

The company is aligned into seven reportable segments
    categorized into four primary businesses. The Mission Systems,
    Information Technology, and Technical Services segments are
    presented as Information & Services. The Integrated
    Systems and Space Technology segments are presented as
    Aerospace. The Electronics and Ships segments are each presented
    as separate businesses. Newport News and Ship Systems are
    aggregated and reported as the Ships business in accordance with
    the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 131 –

Disclosures about Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information.

The company, from time to time, acquires or disposes of
    businesses, and realigns contracts, programs or business areas
    among and within its operating segments that possess similar
    customers, expertise, and capabilities. These realignments are
    designed to more fully leverage existing capabilities and
    enhance development and delivery of products and services. For a
    description of material business dispositions that occurred
    during 2007, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8. In January 2007,
    certain programs and business areas were transferred among
    Information Technology, Mission Systems, Space Technology, and
    Technical Services. The business descriptions below and
    operating results for all periods presented have been revised to
    reflect these changes made through December 31, 2007.

Subsequent Realignments

– In January 2008, the
    Newport News and Ship Systems sectors were realigned into a
    single segment called Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding to enable
    the company to more effectively utilize its shipbuilding assets
    and deploy its talented shipbuilders, processes, technologies,
    production facilities and planned capital investment to meet
    customer needs. This realignment had no impact on the
    company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations, cash flows, or segment reporting.

Also in January 2008, the company announced the transfer of
    certain programs and assets from the Mission Systems segment to
    the Space Technology segment, effective July 1, 2008. This
    transfer will allow Mission Systems to focus on the rapidly
    growing command, control, communications, computers,
    intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) business,
    and the missiles business will be an integrated element of the
    company’s Aerospace business growth strategy. In addition,
    certain Electronics businesses were transferred to Mission
    Systems effective January 2008. The transfer of these businesses
    is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows.

These subsequent realignments have not been reflected in any of
    the accompanying financial information.

    Aircraft Carriers; Expeditionary Warfare; Surface Combatants;
    Submarines; Coast Guard & Coastal Defense; Fleet
    Support; and Services, Commercial & Other.

Aircraft Carriers

– Ships is the nation’s
    sole industrial designer, builder, and refueler of
    nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. The U.S. Navy’s
    newest carrier, the

USS Ronald Reagan

, was delivered to
    the fleet in May 2004. Construction on the last carrier in the
    Nimitz class, the

George H. W. Bush

, continues. The

Bush

christening occurred in the fall of 2006 and
    delivery to the U.S. Navy is expected in late 2008.
    Advanced design and preparation continues for the new generation
    carrier, Ford class, which will incorporate transformational
    technologies that will result in manning reductions, improved
    war fighting capability, and a new nuclear propulsion plant
    design. The construction award for the first ship of the Ford
    class, the

Gerald R. Ford

, is

-7-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

expected in mid 2008. The company also provides ongoing
    maintenance for the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier fleet
    through overhaul, refueling, and repair work. Ships is currently
    performing the refueling and complex overhaul of the

USS Carl
    Vinson

with redelivery to the U.S. Navy anticipated in
    early 2009. Planning for the

USS Theodore Roosevelt

refueling and complex overhaul began in the fall of 2006 and
    the ship is expected to arrive at Newport News, Virginia in the
    fall of 2009.

Expeditionary Warfare

– Expeditionary Warfare
    programs include the design and construction of amphibious
    assault ships for the U.S. Navy, including the WASP LHD 1
    class and the San Antonio LPD 17 class. Ships is the sole
    provider for the LHD class of large-deck, 40,500-ton
    multipurpose amphibious assault ships, which serve as the
    centerpiece of an Amphibious Ready Group. Currently, the LHD 8
    is under construction and is a significant upgrade from the
    preceding seven ships of its class. The design and production of
    the LHD 8 is a $1.9 billion program with delivery scheduled
    for late 2008. In 2007, the construction contract for LHA 6, the
    first in a new class of enhanced amphibious assault ships, was
    awarded. The ship is scheduled for delivery in 2012. Ships is
    also the sole provider of the LPD 17 class of ships, which
    function as amphibious transports. The initial three ships were
    delivered in 2005, 2006, and 2007, and five LPD 17 ships are
    currently under construction. In December 2007, the construction
    award for the ninth ship was received.

Surface Combatants

– Surface Combatants
    includes the design and construction of the Arleigh Burke DDG 51
    class Aegis guided missile destroyers, and the design of
    DDG 1000 (previously DD(X)), the Navy’s future
    transformational surface combatant class. Ships is one of two
    prime contractors designing and building DDG 51 class
    destroyers, which provide primary anti-aircraft and anti-missile
    ship protection for the U.S. Navy fleet. Four Arleigh Burke
    class destroyers are currently under construction. In 2006,
    Ships was awarded Phase IV detail design & long
    lead construction funding for the initial DDG 1000. The contract
    calls for an equal split of ship detail design efforts between
    the company and Bath Iron Works, a wholly owned subsidiary of
    General Dynamics Corporation. The construction award for the
    initial ship is anticipated in the first half of 2008. The
    advanced technologies developed on DD(X) Phase III are
    being incorporated into DDG 1000 and are anticipated to be
    incorporated into the next generation guided missile cruiser
    CG(X).

Submarines

– Northrop Grumman is one of only
    two U.S. companies capable of designing and building
    nuclear-powered submarines. In February 1997, the company and
    Electric Boat, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Dynamics
    Corporation, reached an agreement to cooperatively build

Virginia

Class nuclear attack submarines. The lead ship,

USS Virginia

, was delivered by Electric Boat to the
    U.S. Navy and commissioned into the fleet in October 2004.
    The

USS Texas

was delivered by Ships in the spring of
    2006. The

USS Hawaii

was delivered by Electric Boat in
    December 2006, and

North Carolina

, the final block one
    ship, is expected to be delivered by Ships in early 2008.
    Electric Boat and Ships were awarded a construction contract in
    August 2003, which was subsequently modified in January 2004,
    for the second block of six

Virginia

Class submarines.
    Planning and long lead material procurement is underway on all
    six boats of the second block; construction has begun on the
    first four. The construction award for the third block is
    expected in late 2008.

Coast Guard & Coastal Defense

– Ships
    is a joint venture partner along with Lockheed Martin for the
    Coast Guard’s Deepwater Modernization Program. Ships has
    design and production responsibility for surface ships. In 2006,
    the Ships/Lockheed Martin joint venture was awarded a
    43 month contract extension for the Deepwater program.
    Currently, the first three National Security Cutters (NSC) are
    in construction. The initial NSC will be delivered in early 2008.

Fleet Support

– Ships provides after-market
    services, including on-going maintenance and repair work, for a
    wide array of naval and commercial vessels. The company has ship
    repair facilities in the U.S. Navy’s largest homeports
    of Norfolk, Virginia, and San Diego, California.

Services, Commercial & Other

– Under
    the Polar Tanker program, Ships was under contract to produce
    five double-hulled tankers. These tankers each transport one
    million barrels of crude oil from Alaska to west coast
    refineries and are fully compliant with the Oil Pollution Act of
    1990. The last ship under this program was delivered in mid-2006.

SUMMARY
    SEGMENT FINANCIAL DATA

For a more complete understanding of the company’s segment
    financial information, see Segment Operating Results in
    Part II, Item 7, and Note 6 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8.

CUSTOMERS
    AND REVENUE CONCENTRATION

The company’s primary customer is the U.S. Government.
    Revenue from the U.S. Government accounted for
    approximately 90 percent of total revenues in 2007, 2006,
    and 2005. No other customer accounted for more than
    10 percent of total revenue during any period presented. No
    single product or service accounted for more than
    10 percent of total revenue during any period presented.
    See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

PATENTS

The following table summarizes the number of patents the company
    owns or has pending as of December 31, 2007:

Owned

Pending

Total

U.S. patents

3,572


4,280

Foreign patents

2,464

1,767

4,231

Total

6,036

2,475

8,511

Patents developed while under contract with the
    U.S. Government may be subject to use by the
    U.S. Government. In addition the company licenses
    intellectual property to, and from, third parties. Management
    believes the company’s ability to conduct its operations
    would not be materially affected by the loss of any particular
    intellectual property right.

SEASONALITY

No material portion of the company’s business is considered
    to be seasonal. The timing of revenue recognition is based on
    several factors including the timing of contract awards, the
    incurrence of contract costs, cost estimation, and unit
    deliveries. See Revenue Recognition in Part II, Item 7.

RAW
    MATERIALS

The most significant raw material required by the company is
    steel, used primarily for shipbuilding. The company has
    mitigated supply risk by negotiating long-term agreements with a
    number of steel suppliers. In addition, the company has
    mitigated price risk related to its steel purchases through
    certain contractual arrangements with the U.S. Government.
    While the company has generally been able to obtain key raw
    materials required in its production processes in a timely
    manner, a significant delay in receipt of these supplies by the
    company could have a material effect on the company’s
    consolidated results of operations. See Risk Factors in
    Part I, Item 1A.

GOVERNMENT
    REGULATION

The company’s business is affected by numerous laws and
    regulations relating to the award, administration and
    performance of U.S. Government contracts. See Risk Factors
    in Part I, Item 1A.

Certain programs with the U.S. Government that are
    prohibited by the customer from being publicly discussed in
    detail are referred to as “restricted” in this

Form 10-K.

The consolidated financial statements and financial

-9-

    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

information contained within this

Form 10-K

reflect the operating results of restricted programs under
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (GAAP). See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

RESEARCH
    AND DEVELOPMENT

Company-sponsored research and development activities primarily
    include independent research and development (IR&D) efforts
    related to government programs. IR&D expenses are included
    in general and administrative expenses and are allocated to
    U.S. Government contracts. Company-sponsored research and
    development expenses totaled $537 million,
    $572 million, and $536 million in 2007, 2006, and
    2005, respectively. Expenses for research and development
    sponsored by the customer are charged directly to the related
    contracts.

EMPLOYEE
    RELATIONS

The company believes that it maintains good relations with its
    122,600 employees, of which approximately 17 percent
    are covered by 32 collective bargaining agreements. The company
    expects to re-negotiate nine of its collective bargaining
    agreements in 2008. It is not expected that the results of these
    negotiations will, either individually or in the aggregate, have
    a material adverse effect on the company’s results of
    operations. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    MATTERS

Federal, state, and local laws relating to the protection of the
    environment affect the company’s manufacturing operations.
    The company has provided for the estimated cost to complete
    environmental remediation where the company has determined it is
    probable that the company will incur such costs in the future to
    address environmental impacts at currently or formerly owned or
    leased operating facilities, or at sites where it has been named
    a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) by the Environmental
    Protection Agency or similarly designated by other environmental
    agencies. These estimates may change given the inherent
    difficulty in estimating environmental cleanup costs to be
    incurred in the future due to the uncertainties regarding the
    extent of the required cleanup, determination of legally
    responsible parties, and the status of laws, regulations, and
    their interpretations.

In order to assess the potential impact on the company’s
    financial statements, management estimates the possible
    remediation costs that reasonably could be incurred by the
    company on a

site-by-site

basis. Such estimates take into consideration the professional
    judgment of the company’s environmental engineers and, when
    necessary, consultation with outside environmental specialists.
    In most instances, only a range of reasonably possible costs can
    be estimated. However, in the determination of accruals, the
    most probable amount is used when determinable, and the minimum
    is used when no single amount is more probable. The company
    records accruals for environmental cleanup costs in the
    accounting period in which the company’s responsibility is
    established and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The
    company does not anticipate and record insurance recoveries
    before it has determined that collection is probable.

Management estimates that at December 31, 2007, the range
    of reasonably possible future costs for environmental
    remediation sites is $186 million to $285 million, of
    which $223 million is accrued in other current liabilities
    in the consolidated statements of financial position.
    Environmental accruals are recorded on an undiscounted basis. At
    sites involving multiple parties, the company provides
    environmental accruals based upon its expected share of
    liability, taking into account the financial viability of other
    jointly liable parties. Environmental expenditures are expensed
    or capitalized as appropriate. Capitalized expenditures relate
    to long-lived improvements in currently operating facilities. In
    addition, should other PRPs not pay their allocable share of
    remediation costs, the company may have to incur costs in
    addition to those already estimated and accrued, which could
    have a material effect on the company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The
    company has made the investments it believes necessary in order
    to comply with environmental laws.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

COMPETITIVE
    CONDITIONS

Northrop Grumman, along with Lockheed Martin Corporation, The
    Boeing Company, Raytheon Company, and General Dynamics
    Corporation are among the largest companies in the
    U.S. defense industry at this time. Northrop Grumman
    competes against these and other companies for a number of
    programs, both large and small. Intense competition and long
    operating cycles are both key characteristics of Northrop
    Grumman’s business and the defense industry. It is common
    in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a
    number of companies. A company competing to be a prime
    contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to another
    party, turn out to be a subcontractor for the ultimate prime
    contracting party. It is not uncommon to compete for a contract
    award with a peer company and, simultaneously, perform as a
    supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts.
    The nature of major defense programs, conducted under binding
    contracts, allows companies that perform well to benefit from a
    level of program continuity not common in many industries.

The company’s success in the competitive defense industry
    depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and
    services, as well as its ability to provide the people,
    technologies, facilities, equipment, and financial capacity
    needed to deliver those products and services with maximum
    efficiency. It is necessary to maintain, as the company has,
    sources for raw materials, fabricated parts, electronic
    components, and major subassemblies. In this manufacturing and
    systems integration environment, effective oversight of
    subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing
    internal operations.

Similarly, there is intense competition among many companies in
    the information and services markets which is generally more
    labor intensive with competitive margin rates over contract
    periods of shorter duration. Competitors in the information and
    services markets include the defense industry participants
    mentioned above as well as many other large and small entities
    with expertise in various specialized areas. The company’s
    ability to successfully compete in the information and services
    markets depends on a number of factors; most important is the
    capability to deploy skilled professionals, many requiring
    security clearances, at competitive prices across the diverse
    spectrum of these markets. Accordingly, various workforce
    initiatives are in place to ensure the company is successful in
    attracting, developing and retaining sufficient resources to
    maintain or improve its competitive position within these
    markets. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Item 1A. Risk Factors

The company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of
    which are not exclusively within the company’s control,
    that may cause actual performance to differ materially from
    historical or projected future performance. Information
    contained within this

Form 10-K

should be carefully considered by investors in light of the risk
    factors described below.

n

The Company Depends Heavily on a Single Customer, the
    U.S. Government, for a Substantial Portion of the
    Company’s Business, Including Programs Subject to Security
    Classification Restrictions on Information. Changes Affecting
    this Customer’s Capacity to Do Business with the Company or
    the Effects of Competition in the Defense Industry Could Have a
    Material Adverse Effect On the Company or Its Prospects.

Approximately 90 percent of the company’s revenues
    during 2007 were derived from products and services ultimately
    sold to the U.S. Government and are therefore affected by,
    among other things, the federal budget process. The company is a
    supplier, either directly or as a subcontractor or team member,
    to the U.S. Government and its agencies as well as foreign
    governments and agencies. These contracts are subject to the
    respective customers’ political and budgetary constraints
    and processes, changes in customers’ short-range and
    long-range strategic plans, the timing of contract awards, and
    in the case of contracts with the U.S. Government, the
    congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes,
    the U.S. Government’s ability to terminate contracts
    for convenience or for default, as well as other risks such as
    contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain
    violations of legal and regulatory requirements. The termination
    or failure to fund one or more significant contracts by the
    U.S. Government could have a material adverse effect on the
    company’s results of operations or prospects.

In the event of termination for the government’s
    convenience, contractors are normally protected by provisions
    covering reimbursement for costs incurred. The company is
    involved as a plaintiff in a lawsuit concerning a contract
    terminated for convenience. See Other Matters in Part I,
    Item 3. Termination resulting from the company’s
    default could expose the company to liability and have a
    material adverse effect on its ability to compete for contracts.

In addition, a material amount of the company’s revenues
    and profits is derived from programs that are subject to
    security classification restrictions (restricted business),
    which could limit the company’s ability to discuss details
    about these programs, their risks or any disputes or claims
    relating to such programs. As a result, investors might have
    less insight into the company’s restricted business than
    other businesses of the company or could experience less ability
    to evaluate fully the risks, disputes or claims associated with
    restricted business.

The company’s success in the competitive defense industry
    depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and
    services, as well as its ability to provide the people,
    technologies, facilities, equipment, and financial capacity
    needed to deliver those products and services with maximum
    efficiency. A loss of business to the company’s competitors
    could have a material adverse affect on the company’s
    ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain
    market share.

n

Many of the Company’s Contracts Contain Performance
    Obligations That Require Innovative Design Capabilities, Are
    Technologically Complex, Require State-Of-The-Art Manufacturing
    Expertise or Are Dependent Upon Factors Not Wholly Within the
    Company’s Control. Failure to Meet These Obligations Could
    Adversely Affect the Company’s Profitability and Future
    Prospects.

The company designs, develops and manufactures technologically
    advanced and innovative products and services applied by its
    customers in a variety of environments. Problems and delays in
    development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to
    design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning
    curve assumptions, or materials and components could prevent the
    company from achieving contractual requirements.

-12-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

In addition, the company’s products cannot be tested and
    proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen
    problems. Examples of unforeseen problems which could negatively
    affect revenue and profitability include loss on launch of
    spacecraft, premature failure, problems with quality, country of
    origin, delivery of subcontractor components or services, and
    unplanned degradation of product performance. These failures
    could result, either directly or indirectly, in loss of life or
    property. Among the factors that may affect revenue and profits
    could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance
    or indemnification from the customer, diversion of management
    focus in responding to unforeseen problems, loss of follow-on
    work, and, in the case of certain contracts, repayment to the
    government customer of contract cost and fee payments previously
    received by the company.

Certain contracts, primarily involving space satellite systems,
    contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in
    the event of partial or complete failure of the system upon
    launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period
    of time. Under such terms, the company could be required to
    forfeit fees previously recognized

and/or

collected. The company has not experienced any material losses
    in the last decade in connection with such contract performance
    incentive provisions. However, if the company were to experience
    launch failures or complete satellite system failures in the
    future, such events could have a material adverse impact on the
    company’s consolidated financial position or results of
    operations.

Contract Cost Growth on Fixed-Price and Other Contracts
    That Cannot Be Justified as an Increase In Contract Value Due
    From Customers Exposes The Company to Reduced Profitability and
    the Potential Loss of Future Business.

Operating margin is adversely affected when contract costs that
    cannot be billed to customers are incurred. This cost growth can
    occur if estimates to complete increase due to technical
    challenges or if initial estimates used for calculating the
    contract price were incorrect. The cost estimation process
    requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost
    growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the
    nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of
    change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any
    delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from
    the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover
    any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant
    change in cost estimates on one or more programs could have a
    material effect on the company’s consolidated financial
    position or results of operations.

Due to their nature, fixed-price contracts inherently have more
    risk than flexibly priced contracts and therefore generally
    carry higher profit margins. Approximately 30 percent of
    the company’s annual revenues are derived from fixed-price
    contracts – see Contracts in Part II,
    Item 7. Flexibly priced contracts may carry risk to the
    extent of their specific contract terms and conditions relating
    to performance award fees, including cost sharing agreements,
    and negative performance incentives. The company typically
    enters into fixed-price contracts where costs can be reasonably
    estimated based on experience. In addition, certain contracts
    other than fixed-price contracts have provisions relating to
    cost controls and audit rights. Should the terms specified in
    those contracts not be met, then profitability may be reduced.
    Fixed-price development work comprises a small portion of the
    company’s fixed-price contracts and inherently has more
    uncertainty as to future events than production contracts and
    therefore more variability in estimates of the costs to complete
    the development stage. As work progresses through the
    development stage into production, the risks associated with
    estimating the total costs of the contract are generally
    reduced. In addition, successful performance of fixed-price
    development contracts which include production units is subject
    to the company’s ability to control cost growth in meeting
    production specifications and delivery rates. While management
    uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with
    fixed-price development contracts, future events could result in
    either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates.
    Examples of the company’s significant fixed-price
    development contracts include the F-16 Block 60 combat
    avionics program and the MESA radar system program for the
    Wedgetail and Peace Eagle contracts, both of which are performed
    by the Electronics segment. It is also not unusual in the Ships
    business for the company to negotiate fixed-price

production follow-on contracts before the development effort has
    been completed and learning curves fully realized on existing
    flexibly priced development contracts.

n

The Company Uses Estimates When Accounting for Contracts.
    Changes In Estimates Could Affect The Company’s
    Profitability and Its Overall Financial Position.

Contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing
    risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making
    assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size
    and nature of many of the company’s contracts, the
    estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is
    complicated and subject to many variables. For example,
    assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to
    complete the contract because costs also include expected
    increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly,
    assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of
    efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives,
    awards, or penalties related to performance on contracts are
    considered in estimating revenue and profit rates, and are
    recorded when there is sufficient information to assess
    anticipated performance.

Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation
    processes described above, it is possible that materially
    different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions
    were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change.
    Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates
    may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial
    reporting and performance. See Critical Accounting Policies,
    Estimates, and Judgments in Part II, Item 7.

n

The Company’s Operations Are Subject to Numerous
    Domestic and International Laws, Regulations and Restrictions,
    and Noncompliance With These Laws, Regulations and Restrictions
    Could Expose the Company to Fines, Penalties, Suspension or
    Debarment, Which Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the
    Company’s Profitability and Its Overall Financial
    Position.

The company has thousands of contracts and operations in many
    parts of the world subject to U.S. and foreign laws and
    regulations. Prime contracts with various agencies of the
    U.S. Government and subcontracts with other prime
    contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations,
    including the False Claims Act and the International Traffic in
    Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act,
    with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in
    fines, penalties, debarment, or suspension from receiving
    additional contracts with all U.S. Government agencies.
    Given the company’s dependence on U.S. Government
    business, suspension or debarment could have a material adverse
    effect on the company.

In addition, international business subjects the company to
    numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including,
    without limitation, regulations relating to import-export
    control, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of
    earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,
    and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export
    Administration Act. Failure by the company or its sales
    representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and
    regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal
    liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension
    or debarment from government contracts or suspension of the
    company’s export privileges, which could have a material
    adverse effect on the company. Changes in regulation or
    political environment may affect the company’s ability to
    conduct business in foreign markets including investment,
    procurement, and repatriation of earnings.

The company operates in a highly regulated environment and is
    routinely audited by the U.S. Government and others. On a
    regular basis, the company monitors its policies and procedures
    with respect to its contracts to ensure consistent application
    under similar terms and conditions and to assess compliance with
    all applicable government regulations. Negative audit findings
    could result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of
    profits, or suspension of payments. From time to time the
    company is subject to U.S. Government investigations
    relating to its operations. Government contractors that are
    found to have violated the law such as the False Claims Act or
    the Arms Export Control Act, or are indicted or convicted for
    violations of other federal laws, or are found not to have acted
    responsibly as defined by the law, may be subject to significant
    fines. Such convictions could also result in suspension or
    debarment from government

-14-

    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

contracting for some period of time. Given the company’s
    dependence on government contracting, suspension or debarment
    could have a material adverse effect on the company.

n

The Company’s Business Is Subject to Disruption
    Caused By Issues With Its Suppliers, Subcontractors, Workforce,
    Natural Disasters and Other Factors That Could Adversely Affect
    the Company’s Profitability and Its Overall Financial
    Position.

The company may be affected by delivery or performance issues
    with key suppliers and subcontractors, as well as other factors
    that may cause operating results to be adversely affected.
    Changes in inventory requirements or other production cost
    increases may also have a negative effect on the company’s
    consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Performance failures by a subcontractor of the company or
    difficulty in maintaining complete alignment of the
    subcontractor’s obligations with the company’s prime
    contract obligations may adversely affect the company’s
    ability to perform its obligations on the prime contract, which
    could reduce the company’s profitability due to damages or
    other costs that may not be fully recoverable from the
    subcontractor or from the customer and could result in a
    termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on
    the company’s ability to compete for future contracts.

Operating results are heavily dependent upon the company’s
    ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with
    requisite skill sets

and/or

security clearances. The successful negotiation of collective
    bargaining agreements and avoidance of organized work stoppages
    are also critical to the ongoing operations of the company.

The company has significant operations located in regions of the
    U.S. that may be exposed to damaging storms and other
    natural disasters. While preventative measures typically help to
    minimize harm to the company, the damage and disruption
    resulting from certain storms or other natural disasters may be
    significant. Although no assurances can be made, the company
    believes it can recover costs associated with natural disasters
    through insurance or its contracts.

Natural disasters such as storms and earthquakes can disrupt
    electrical and other power distribution networks and cause
    adverse effects on profitability and performance, including
    computer and internet operation and accessibility. Computer
    viruses and similar harmful software programs, as well as
    network outages, disruptions and attacks also may have a
    material adverse effect on the company’s profitability and
    performance unless quarantined or otherwise prevented.

n

Changes In Future Business Conditions Could Cause Business
    Investments

and/or

Recorded Goodwill to Become Impaired, Resulting In Substantial
    Losses and Write-Downs That Would Reduce the Company’s
    Operating Income.

As part of its overall strategy, the company will, from time to
    time, acquire a minority or majority interest in a business.
    These investments are made upon careful target analysis and due
    diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or
    strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain
    assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price. After
    acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely
    affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not
    recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after
    careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary
    significantly from initial estimates. Goodwill accounts for
    approximately half of the company’s recorded total assets.
    The company evaluates goodwill amounts for impairment annually,
    or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual
    impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment.
    Principally, a significant decrease in expected reporting unit
    cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate
    potential impairment of recorded goodwill. See Critical
    Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments in Part II,
    Item 7.

The Company Is Subject to Various Claims and Litigation
    That Could Ultimately Be Resolved Against The Company Requiring
    Material Future Cash Payments

and/or

Future Material Charges Against the Company’s Operating
    Income and Materially Impairing the Company’s Financial
    Position.

The size and complexity of the company’s business make it
    highly susceptible to claims and litigation. The company is
    subject to environmental claims, income tax matters and other
    litigation, which, if not resolved within established accruals,
    could have a material adverse effect on the company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows. See Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3, and
    Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments in
    Part II, Item 7.

n

Pension and Medical Expense Associated with the
    Company’s Retirement Benefit Plans May Fluctuate
    Significantly Depending Upon Changes in Actuarial Assumptions
    and Future Market Performance of Plan Assets.

A substantial portion of the company’s current and retired
    employee population is covered by pension and post-retirement
    benefit plans, the costs of which are dependent upon the
    company’s various assumptions, including estimates of rates
    of return on benefit related assets, discount rates for future
    payment obligations, rates of future cost growth and trends for
    future costs. Variances from these estimates could have a
    material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

n

The Company’s Insurance Coverage May Be Inadequate to
    Cover All of Its Significant Risks or Its Insurers May Deny
    Coverage of Material Losses Incurred By the Company, Which Could
    Adversely Affect The Company’s Profitability and Overall
    Financial Position.

The company endeavors to identify and obtain in established
    markets insurance agreements to cover significant risks and
    liabilities (including, among others, natural disasters, product
    liability and business interruption). Not every risk or
    liability can be protected against by insurance, and, for
    insurable risks, the limits of coverage reasonably obtainable in
    the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or
    liabilities incurred. In some, but not all, circumstances the
    company may receive indemnification from the
    U.S. Government. Because of the limitations in overall
    available coverage referred to above, the company may have to
    bear substantial costs for uninsured losses that could have an
    adverse effect upon its consolidated results of operations and
    its overall consolidated financial position. Additionally,
    disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the
    timing of cash flows and, where litigation with the carrier
    becomes necessary, an outcome unfavorable to the company may
    have a material adverse effect on the company’s
    consolidated results of operations. See Note 15 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8.

n

Current Trends in U.S. Government Procurement May
    Adversely Affect Cash Flows or Program Profitability.

The company, like others in the defense industry, is aware of a
    potential problem presented by strict compliance with the
    Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement
    preference for enumerated specialty metals sourced domestically
    or from certain foreign countries. Subcontractors and lower-tier
    suppliers have made disclosures indicating inability to comply
    with the rule as written. Subject to limitations, inability to
    certify that all enumerated specialty metals in a product comply
    with sourcing requirements can lead to U.S. Government
    customers withholding a portion of a payment on delivery or may
    prevent delivery altogether of materiel and products critical to
    national defense.

Legal
    Proceedings

U.S. Government Investigations and
    Claims

– Departments and agencies of the
    U.S. Government have the authority to investigate various
    transactions and operations of the company, and the results of
    such investigations may lead to administrative, civil or
    criminal proceedings, the ultimate outcome of which could be
    fines, penalties, repayments or compensatory or treble damages.
    U.S. Government regulations provide that certain findings
    against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from
    future U.S. Government contracts or the loss of export
    privileges for a company or an operating division or
    subdivision. Suspension or debarment could have a material
    adverse effect on the company because of its reliance on
    government contracts.

As previously disclosed, in October 2005, the
    U.S. Department of Justice and a restricted
    U.S. Government customer apprised the company of potential
    substantial claims relating to certain microelectronic parts
    produced by the Space and Electronics Sector of former TRW Inc.,
    now a component of the company. The relationship, if any,
    between the potential claims and a civil False Claims Act case
    that remains under seal in the U.S. District Court for the
    Central District of California remains unclear to the company.
    In the third quarter of 2006, the parties commenced settlement
    discussions. While the company continues to believe that it did
    not breach the contracts in question and that it acted
    appropriately in this matter, the company proposed to settle the
    claims and any associated matters and recognized a pre-tax
    charge of $112.5 million in the third quarter of 2006 to
    cover the cost of the settlement proposal and associated
    investigative costs. The company extended the offer in an effort
    to avoid litigation and in recognition of the value of the
    relationship with this customer. The U.S. Government has
    not accepted the settlement offer and has advised the company
    that if settlement is not reached it will pursue its claims
    through litigation. Because of the highly technical nature of
    the issues involved and their restricted status and because of
    the significant disagreement between the company and the
    U.S. Government as to the U.S. Government’s
    theories of liability and damages (including a material
    difference between the U.S. Government’s damage
    theories and the company’s offer), final resolution of this
    matter could take a considerable amount of time, particularly if
    litigation should ensue. If the U.S. Government were to
    pursue litigation and were to be ultimately successful on its
    theories of liability and damages, which could be trebled under
    the Federal False Claims Act, the effect upon the company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash
    flows would materially exceed the amount provided by the
    company. Based upon the information available to the company to
    date, the company believes that it has substantive defenses but
    can give no assurance that its views will prevail. Accordingly,
    the ultimate disposition of this matter cannot presently be
    determined.

As previously disclosed, on May 17, 2007, the
    U.S. Coast Guard issued a revocation of acceptance under
    the Deepwater Program for eight converted 123-foot patrol boats
    (the vessels) based on alleged “hull buckling and shaft
    alignment problems”. By letter dated June 5, 2007, the
    Coast Guard stated that the revocation of acceptance also was
    based on alleged “nonconforming topside equipment” on
    the vessels. On August 13, 2007, the company submitted a
    response to the Coast Guard, maintaining that the revocation of
    acceptance was improper. In late December 2007, the Coast Guard
    responded to the company’s August submittal and advised
    Integrated Coast Guard Systems (the contractors’ joint
    venture for performing the Deepwater Program) that the Coast
    Guard is seeking $96.1 million from the Joint Venture as a
    result of the revocation of acceptance of the eight vessels
    delivered under the 123-foot conversion program. The majority of
    the costs associated with the 123-foot conversion effort are
    associated with the alleged structural deficiencies of the
    vessels which were converted under contracts with the company
    and with a subcontractor to the company. The letter is not a
    contracting officer’s final decision and the company and
    its joint venture partner and subcontractor are preparing a
    response. Based upon the information available to the company to
    date, the company believes that it has substantive defenses but
    can give no assurance that its views will prevail.

Based upon the available information regarding matters that are
    subject to U.S. Government investigations, other than as
    set out above, the company believes, but can give no assurance,
    that the outcome of any such matters would not have a material
    adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results
    of operations, or cash flows.

Litigation

– Various claims and legal
    proceedings arise in the ordinary course of business and are
    pending against the company and its properties. Based upon the
    information available, the company believes that the resolution
    of any of these various claims and legal proceedings would not
    have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows.

As previously disclosed, the company was a defendant in
    litigation brought by Cogent Systems, Inc. (Cogent) in Los
    Angeles Superior Court in California on April 20, 2005, for
    unspecified damages for alleged unauthorized use of Cogent
    technology relating to fingerprint recognition. On
    September 10, 2007, the company and Cogent announced that
    they had reached an agreement to settle the litigation and the
    settlement documents were executed in the fourth quarter of
    2007. Under the terms of the agreement, the company agreed to
    pay Cogent $25 million to settle the litigation and
    $15 million for a non-exclusive license to use specified
    Cogent state-of- the-art automated fingerprint identification
    software in certain existing programs. Substantially all these
    amounts were charged to expense in 2007. The company and Cogent
    also agreed to enter into a five-year research and development,
    service and products agreement, under which the company must
    purchase from Cogent $20 million in new products and
    services over the term of the agreement.

As previously disclosed, the U.S. District Court for the
    Central District of California consolidated two separately filed
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) lawsuits, which
    the plaintiffs seek to have certified as class actions, into the
    In Re Northrop Grumman Corporation ERISA Litigation. On
    August 7, 2007, the Court denied plaintiffs’ motion
    for class certification, and the plaintiffs appealed the
    Court’s decision on class certification to the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On
    October 11, 2007, the Ninth Circuit granted appellate
    review, which delayed the commencement of trial previously
    scheduled to begin January 22, 2008. The company believes,
    but can give no assurance, that the outcome of these matters
    would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Other
    Matters

In the event of contract termination for the government’s
    convenience, contractors are normally protected by provisions
    covering reimbursement for costs incurred under the contract. As
    previously disclosed, the company received a termination for
    convenience notice on the Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile
    (TSSAM) program in 1995. In December 1996, the company filed a
    lawsuit against the U.S. Government in the U.S. Court
    of Federal Claims seeking the recovery of approximately
    $750 million for uncompensated performance costs,
    investments and a reasonable profit on the program. Prior to
    1996, the company had charged to operations in excess of
    $600 million related to this program. The company is unable
    to predict whether it will realize some or all of its claims,
    none of which are recorded on its consolidated statement of
    financial position, from the U.S. Government related to the
    TSSAM program.

As previously disclosed, the company is pursuing legal action
    against an insurance provider arising out of a disagreement
    concerning the coverage of certain losses related to Hurricane
    Katrina (see Notes 15 and 17 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8). The company commenced
    the action against Factory Mutual Insurance Company (FM Global)
    on November 4, 2005, which is now pending in the
    U.S. District Court for the Central District of California,
    Western Division. In August 2007, the district court issued an
    order finding that the excess insurance policy provided coverage
    for the company’s Katrina-related loss. In November 2007,
    FM Global filed a notice of appeal of the district court’s
    order. Based on the current status of the assessment and claim
    process, no assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome of
    this matter.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

OVERVIEW

Business

Northrop Grumman provides technologically advanced, innovative
    products, services, and integrated solutions in information and
    services, aerospace, electronics, and shipbuilding to its global
    customers. As a prime contractor, principal subcontractor,
    partner, or preferred supplier, Northrop Grumman participates in
    many high-priority defense and commercial technology programs in
    the U.S. and abroad. Northrop Grumman conducts most of its
    business with the U.S. Government, principally the DoD. The
    company also conducts business with local, state, and foreign
    governments and has domestic and international commercial sales.

    uncertain tax positions – see Note 12 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8.

Outlook

U.S. defense contractors have benefited from the upward
    trend in overall defense spending over recent years. Certain
    programs in which the company participates may be subject to
    potential reductions due to a slower rate of growth in the
    U.S. Defense Budget forecasts and funds being utilized to
    support the on-going Global War on Terrorism. Despite the trend
    of slower growth rates in the U.S. defense budget, the
    company believes that its portfolio of technologically advanced,
    innovative products, services, and integrated solutions will
    generate revenue growth in 2008 and beyond. Based on total
    backlog (funded and unfunded) of approximately $64 billion
    as of December 31, 2007, the company expects sales in 2008
    of approximately $33 billion and forecasts improvement in
    net income over 2007. The major industry and economic factors
    that may affect the company’s future performance are
    described in the following paragraphs.

Industry
    Factors

Northrop Grumman is subject to the unique characteristics of the
    U.S. defense industry as a monopsony, and by certain
    elements peculiar to its own business mix. Northrop Grumman,
    along with Lockheed Martin Corporation, The Boeing Company,
    Raytheon Company, and General Dynamics Corporation are among the
    largest companies in the U.S. defense industry at this
    time. Northrop Grumman competes against these and other
    companies for a number of programs, both large and small.
    Intense competition and long operating cycles are both key
    characteristics of Northrop Grumman’s business and the
    defense industry. It is common in this industry for work on
    major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A
    company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate
    award of the contract to another party, turn out to be a
    subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting party. It is
    not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company
    and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of
    such competitor on other contracts. The nature of

-25-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

major defense programs, conducted under binding contracts,
    allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of
    program continuity not common in many industries.

The company’s success in the competitive defense industry
    depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and
    services, as well as its ability to provide the people,
    technologies, facilities, equipment, and financial capacity
    needed to deliver those products and services with maximum
    efficiency. It is necessary to maintain, as the company has,
    sources for raw materials, fabricated parts, electronic
    components, and major subassemblies. In this manufacturing and
    systems integration environment, effective oversight of
    subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing
    internal operations.

Similarly, there is intense competition among many companies in
    the information and services markets which is generally more
    labor intensive with competitive margin rates over contract
    periods of shorter duration. Competitors in the information and
    services markets include the defense industry participants
    mentioned above as well as many other large and small entities
    with expertise in various specialized areas. The company’s
    ability to successfully compete in the information and services
    markets depends on a number of factors; most important is the
    capability to deploy skilled professionals, many requiring
    security clearances, at competitive prices across the diverse
    spectrum of these markets. Accordingly, various workforce
    initiatives are in place to ensure the company is successful in
    attracting, developing and retaining sufficient resources to
    maintain or improve its competitive position within these
    markets.

Economic
    Opportunities, Challenges, and Risks

The defense of the U.S. and its allies requires the ability
    to respond to one or more regional conflicts, terrorist acts, or
    threats to homeland security and is increasingly dependent upon
    early threat identification. National responses to those threats
    may require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from
    dissuasion, deterrence, active defense, security and stability
    operations, or peacekeeping. The U.S. Government continues
    to place a high priority on the protection of its engaged forces
    and citizenry and in minimizing collateral damage when force
    must be applied in pursuit of national objectives. As a result,
    the U.S. and its military coalitions increasingly rely on
    sophisticated systems providing long-range surveillance and
    intelligence, battle management, and precision strike
    capabilities combined with the ability to rapidly deploy
    effective force to any region. Accordingly, defense procurement
    spending is expected to be weighted toward the development and
    procurement of military platforms and systems demonstrating the
    stealth, long-range, survivability, persistence and standoff
    capabilities that can overcome such obstacles to access.
    Additionally, advanced electronics and software that enhance the
    capabilities of individual systems and provide for the real-time
    integration of individual surveillance, information management,
    strike, and battle management platforms will also be required.

While the upward trend in overall defense spending may slow,
    defense requirements are not expected to change significantly in
    the foreseeable future. Many allied countries are focusing their
    development and procurement efforts on advanced electronics and
    information systems capabilities to enhance their
    interoperability with U.S. forces. The size of future
    U.S. and international defense budgets is expected to
    remain responsive to the international security environment. The
    proposed 2009 budget provides $515.4 billion in
    discretionary authority for the DoD base budget, representing a
    $35.9 billion or 7.5 percent increase over the enacted
    level for fiscal 2008. This proposed budget includes reductions
    in certain programs in which the company participates or for
    which the company expects to compete, however the company
    believes that spending on recapitalization and modernization of
    homeland security and defense assets will continue to be a
    national priority, with particular emphasis on areas involving
    intelligence, persistent surveillance, cyber space and
    non-conventional warfare capabilities.

U.S. Government programs in which the company either
    participates, or strives to participate, must compete with other
    programs for consideration during the U.S. budget
    formulation and appropriation processes. Budget decisions made
    in this environment will have long-term consequences for the
    size and structure of the company and the entire defense
    industry.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Substantial new competitive opportunities for the company
    include a new aerial refueling tanker, the next-generation
    long-range bomber, space radar, unmanned vehicles, satellite
    communications systems, restricted programs, technical services
    and information technology contracts, and several international
    and homeland security programs. In pursuit of these
    opportunities, Northrop Grumman continues to focus on
    operational and financial performance for continued growth in
    2008 and beyond.

Northrop Grumman has historically concentrated its efforts in
    high technology areas such as stealth, airborne and space
    surveillance, battle management, systems integration, defense
    electronics, and information technology. The company has a
    significant presence in federal and civil information systems;
    the manufacture of combatant ships including aircraft carriers
    and submarines; space technology; command, control,
    communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and
    reconnaissance (C4ISR); and missile systems. The company
    believes that its programs are a high priority for national
    defense. Nevertheless, under budgetary pressures, there remains
    the possibility that one or more of them may be reduced,
    extended, or terminated by the company’s
    U.S. Government customers.

The company provides certain product warranties that require
    repair or replacement of non-conforming items for a specified
    period of time. Most of the company’s product warranties
    are provided under government contracts, the costs of which are
    generally incorporated into contract pricing.

Prime contracts with various agencies of the
    U.S. Government and subcontracts with other prime
    contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations,
    including the False Claims Act and The International Traffic in
    Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act,
    with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in
    fines, penalties, debarment, or suspension from receiving
    additional contracts with all U.S. Government agencies.
    Given the company’s dependence on U.S. Government
    business, suspension or debarment could have a material adverse
    effect on the company.

See Risk Factors located in Part I, Item 1A for a more
    complete description of risks faced by the company and the
    defense industry.

BUSINESS
    ACQUISITIONS


– In January 2007, the company acquired
    Essex Corporation (Essex) for approximately $590 million in
    cash, including estimated transaction costs of $15 million,
    and the assumption of debt totaling $23 million. Essex
    provides signal processing services and products, and advanced
    optoelectronic imaging for U.S. government intelligence and
    defense customers. The operating results of Essex are reported
    in the Mission Systems segment.

In July 2007, the company and Science Applications International
    Corporation (SAIC) reorganized their joint venture AMSEC, LLC
    (AMSEC), by dividing AMSEC along customer and product lines.
    AMSEC is a full-service supplier that provides engineering,
    logistics and technical support services primarily to Navy ship
    and aviation programs. Under the reorganization plan, the
    company retained the ship engineering, logistics and technical
    service businesses under the AMSEC name (the AMSEC Businesses)
    and, in exchange, SAIC received the aviation, combat systems and
    strike force integration services businesses from AMSEC (the
    Divested Businesses). This reorganization was treated as a step
    acquisition for the acquisition of SAIC’s interests in the
    AMSEC Businesses, with the company recognizing a pre-tax gain of
    $23 million for the effective sale of its interests in the
    Divested Businesses. The operating results of the AMSEC
    Businesses and transaction gain have been reported in the Ships
    segment. Prior to the reorganization, the company accounted for
    AMSEC, LLC under the equity method. The consolidated financial
    statements reflect preliminary estimates of the fair value of
    the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the related
    allocation of the purchase price for the entities acquired.
    Management does not expect adjustments to these estimates, if
    any, to have a material effect on the company’s
    consolidated financial position or results of operations.

During the third quarter of 2007, the company acquired Xinetics
    Inc., reported in the Space Technology segment, and the
    remaining 61 percent of Scaled Composites, LLC, reported in
    the Integrated Systems segment, for an aggregate amount of
    approximately $100 million in cash. The consolidated
    financial statements reflect

-27-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

preliminary estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed and the related allocation of the
    purchase price for the entities acquired. Management does not
    expect adjustments to these estimates, if any, to have a
    material effect on the company’s consolidated financial
    position or results of operations.


– There were no significant acquisitions
    during 2006.


– The company acquired Confluent RF
    Systems Corporation (Confluent), reported in the Integrated
    Systems segment, for $42 million in cash, which included
    transaction costs of $2 million, and Integic Corporation
    (Integic), reported in the Information Technology segment, for
    $319 million in cash, which included transaction costs of
    $6 million.

BUSINESS
    DISPOSITIONS


– During the second quarter of 2007,
    management announced its decision to exit the remaining
    Interconnect Technologies (ITD) business reported within the
    Electronics segment. Sales for this business for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, were $14 million,
    $35 million, and $89 million, respectively. The
    shut-down was completed during the third quarter of 2007 and
    costs associated with the shutdown were not material. The
    results of this business are reported as discontinued operations
    in the consolidated statements of income, net of applicable
    income taxes, for all periods presented.


– The company sold the assembly business
    unit of ITD during the first quarter of 2006 and Winchester
    Electronics (Winchester) during the second quarter of 2006 for
    net cash proceeds of $26 million and $17 million,
    respectively, and recognized after-tax gains of $4 million
    and $2 million, respectively, in discontinued operations.
    The results of operations of the assembly business unit of ITD
    are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated
    statements of income, net of applicable income taxes. The
    results of operations of Winchester, reported in the Electronics
    segment, were not material to any of the periods presented and
    have therefore not been reclassified as discontinued operations.

During the second quarter of 2006, the Enterprise Information
    Technology (EIT) business, formerly reported in the Information
    Technology segment, was shut down and costs associated with the
    exit activities were not material. The results of operations of
    this business are reported as discontinued operations in the
    consolidated statements of income, net of applicable income
    taxes.

2005 –

The company sold Teldix GmbH (Teldix)
    for $57 million in cash and recognized an after-tax gain of
    $14 million in discontinued operations. The results of
    operations of Teldix, reported in the Electronics segment, were
    not material to any of the periods presented and have therefore
    not been reclassified as discontinued operations.

CONTRACTS

The majority of the company’s business is generated from
    long-term government contracts for development, production, and
    service activities. Government contracts typically include the
    following cost elements: direct material, labor and
    subcontracting costs, and certain indirect costs including
    allowable general and administrative costs. Unless otherwise
    specified in a contract, costs billed to contracts with the
    U.S. Government are determined under the requirements of
    the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Cost Accounting
    Standards (CAS) regulations as allowable and allocable costs.
    Examples of costs incurred by the company and not billed to the
    U.S. Government in accordance with the requirements of the
    FAR and CAS regulations include, but are not limited to, certain
    legal costs, lobbying costs, charitable donations, and
    advertising costs.

The company’s long-term contracts typically fall into one
    of two broad categories:

Flexibly Priced Contracts

– Includes both
    cost-type and fixed-price incentive contracts. Cost-type
    contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s
    allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit.
    Cost-type contracts generally require that the contractor use
    its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some
    specified time and some stated dollar limitation. Fixed-price
    incentive contracts also provide for

-28-

    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs, but are
    subject to a cost-share limit which affects profitability.
    Fixed-price incentive contracts effectively become firm
    fixed-price contracts once the cost-share limit is reached.

Firm Fixed-Price Contracts

– A firm fixed-price
    contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is
    agreed to for a price that is a pre-determined, negotiated
    amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of
    costs incurred by the contractor.

Contract Fees

– Negotiated contract fee
    structures, for both flexibly priced and fixed-price contracts
    include, but are not limited to: fixed-fee amounts, cost sharing
    arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost
    target performance, positive award fees, and negative penalty
    arrangements. Profit margins may vary materially depending on
    the negotiated contract fee arrangements,
    percentage-of-completion of the contract, the achievement of
    performance objectives, and the stage of performance at which
    the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and
    award fee contracts, is finally determined.

Positive Award Fees

– Certain contracts contain
    provisions consisting of award fees based on performance
    criteria such as: cost, schedule, quality, and technical
    performance. Award fees are determined and earned based on an
    evaluation by the customer of the company’s performance
    against such negotiated criteria. Award fee contracts are widely
    used throughout the company’s operating segments. Examples
    of significant long-term contracts with substantial negotiated
    award fee amounts are the KEI, SDD,

E-2D

SDD,
    LPD, and DDG-1000 programs.

Compliance and Monitoring

– On a regular basis,
    the company monitors its policies and procedures with respect to
    its contracts to ensure consistent application under similar
    terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable
    government regulations. In addition, costs incurred and
    allocated to contracts with the U.S. Government are
    routinely audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS

Revenue
    Recognition

Overview

– The majority of the company’s
    business is derived from long-term contracts for the
    construction of facilities, production of goods, and services
    provided to the federal government, which are accounted for
    under the provisions of Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 45 –

Accounting for
    Long-Term Construction-Type Contracts

, American Institute of
    Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP)

No. 81-1 –

Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain
    Production-Type Contracts

, and the AICPA Audit and
    Accounting Guide,

Audits of Federal Government
    Contractors

. The company classifies contract revenues as
    product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant
    attributes of the relevant underlying contracts. The company
    also enters into contracts that are not associated with the
    federal government, such as contracts to provide certain
    services to non-federal government customers. The company
    accounts for those contracts in accordance with the Securities
    and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

, and
    other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature.

The company considers the nature of these contracts and the
    types of products and services provided when it determines the
    proper accounting method for a particular contract.

Percentage-of-Completion Accounting

– The
    company generally recognizes revenues from its long-term
    contracts under the cost-to-cost and the units-of-delivery
    measures of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.
    The percentage-of-completion method recognizes income as work on
    a contract progresses. For

-29-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

most contracts, sales are calculated based on the percentage of
    total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at
    completion of the contract. For certain contracts with large
    up-front purchases of material, primarily in the Ships segment,
    sales are generally calculated based on the percentage that
    direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor
    costs. The units-of-delivery measure is a modification of the
    percentage-of-completion method, which recognizes revenues as
    deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales
    values in accordance with the contract terms. The company
    estimates profit as the difference between total estimated
    revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes
    that profit over the life of the contract based on deliveries.

The use of the percentage-of-completion method depends on the
    ability of the company to make reasonably dependable cost
    estimates for the design, manufacture, and delivery of its
    products and services. Such costs are typically incurred over a
    period of several years, and estimation of these costs requires
    the use of judgment. Sales under cost-type contracts are
    recorded as costs are incurred.

Many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives
    based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that
    may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product. These
    incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be
    earned or penalties to be incurred. Incentives and award fees
    that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are
    recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentives
    and award fees that cannot be reasonably assured and reasonably
    estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a
    reasonable estimate can be made.

Other changes in estimates of contract sales, costs, and profits
    are recognized using the cumulative

catch-up

method of accounting. This method recognizes in the current
    period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior
    periods. Hence, the effect of the changes on future periods of
    contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimates
    had been the original estimates. A significant change in an
    estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect
    on the company’s consolidated financial position or results
    of operations.

Certain Service Contracts

– Revenue under
    contracts to provide services to non-federal government
    customers are generally recognized when services are performed.
    Service contracts include operations and maintenance contracts,
    and outsourcing-type arrangements, primarily in the Information
    and Services business. Revenue under such contracts is generally
    recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of contract
    performance, unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned
    or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Costs
    incurred under these service contracts are expensed as incurred,
    except that direct and incremental

set-up

costs
    are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement.
    Operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate
    from period to period, particularly in the earlier phases of the
    contract.

Service contracts that include more than one type of product or
    service are accounted for under the provisions of Emerging
    Issues Task Force Issue

No. 00-21 –

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

.
    Accordingly, for applicable arrangements, revenue recognition
    includes the proper identification of separate units of
    accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements
    based on relative fair values.

Cost Estimation

– The cost estimation process
    requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional
    knowledge and experience of the company’s engineers,
    program managers, and financial professionals. Factors that are
    considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate
    contract recovery include the availability and productivity of
    labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed,
    the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the
    effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of
    funding from the customer, and the recoverability of any claims
    included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in
    an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect
    on the company’s consolidated financial position or results
    of operations. Contract cost estimates are updated at least
    annually and more frequently as determined by events or
    circumstances. Cost and revenue estimates for each significant
    contract are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly.

-30-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract
    exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned, a provision for
    the entire loss on the contract is recorded to cost of sales in
    the period the loss is determined. Loss provisions are first
    offset against costs that are included in inventoried assets,
    with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities.

Purchase
    Accounting and Goodwill

Overview

– The purchase price of an acquired
    business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their
    respective fair market values, with the excess recorded as
    goodwill. Such fair market value assessments require judgments
    and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and
    other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ
    materially from original estimates. Adjustments to fair value
    assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price
    allocation period (typically not exceeding twelve months) with
    the exception of certain adjustments related to income tax
    uncertainties, the resolution of which may extend beyond the
    purchase price allocation period.

Acquisition Accruals

– The company has
    established certain accruals in connection with indemnities and
    other contingencies from its acquisitions and divestitures.
    These accruals and subsequent adjustments have been recorded
    during the purchase price allocation period for acquisitions and
    as events occur for divestitures. The accruals were determined
    based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and, in
    most cases, involve a significant degree of judgment. Management
    has recorded these accruals in accordance with its
    interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements,
    known facts, and an estimation of probable future events based
    on management’s experience.

Goodwill

– The company performs impairment
    tests for goodwill as of November 30th of each year, or
    when evidence of potential impairment exists. In order to test
    for potential impairment, the company uses a discounted cash
    flow analysis, corroborated by comparative market multiples
    where appropriate.

The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis
    requiring judgment are the projected results of operations,
    weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and terminal value
    assumptions. The WACC takes into account the relative weights of
    each component of the company’s consolidated capital
    structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of
    new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk
    profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to
    market entry. The terminal value assumptions are applied to the
    final year of the discounted cash flow model.

Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a
    reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of the
    company’s recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions may
    have a material effect on the results of the company’s
    impairment analysis.

Litigation,
    Commitments, and Contingencies

Overview

– The company is subject to a range of
    claims, lawsuits, environmental and income tax matters, and
    administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these
    matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional
    knowledge and experience of management and its internal and
    external legal counsel. In accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies,

amounts are recorded as
    charges to earnings when management, after taking into
    consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter,
    including any settlement offers, has determined that it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate resolution of
    any such exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates
    as further facts and circumstances become known.

Environmental Accruals

– The company is subject
    to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions
    in which it conducts operations. The company records an accrual
    to provide for the costs of expected environmental obligations
    when management becomes aware that an expenditure will be
    incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably
    estimated. Factors which could result in changes to the
    company’s assessment of probability, range of loss, and
    environmental accruals include: modification of planned remedial
    actions, increase or decrease in the estimated time required to
    remediate, discovery of more extensive

-31-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

contamination than anticipated, results of efforts to determine
    legally responsible parties, changes in laws and regulations or
    contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements, and
    improvements in remediation technology. Although management
    cannot predict whether new information gained as projects
    progress will materially affect the estimated liability accrued,
    management does not anticipate that future remediation
    expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the
    company’s financial position, results of operation, or cash
    flows.

Litigation Accruals

– Litigation accruals are
    recorded as charges to earnings when management, after taking
    into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter,
    including any settlement offers, has determined that it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate resolution of
    any exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as
    further facts and circumstances become known. Based upon the
    information available, the company believes that the resolution
    of any of these various claims and legal proceedings would not
    have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Uncertain Tax Positions –

Effective
    January 1, 2007, the company measures and records uncertain
    tax positions in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 48 –

Accounting for Uncertainty in income Taxes – an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.

FIN 48
    prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition
    and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
    in a tax return. Only tax positions meeting the
    more-likely-than-not recognition threshold may be recognized or
    continue to be recognized in the financial statements. The
    timing and amount of accrued interest is determined by the
    applicable tax law associated with an underpayment of income
    taxes. If a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory
    threshold to avoid payment of penalties, the company recognizes
    an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax
    position is claimed in the tax return of the company. The
    company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax
    benefits in income tax expense. Penalties, if probable and
    reasonably estimable, are recognized as a component of income
    tax expense. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8. Prior to 2007, the
    company recorded accruals for tax contingencies and related
    interest when it determined that it was probable that a
    liability had been incurred and the amount of the contingency
    could be reasonably estimated based on specific events such as
    an audit or inquiry by a taxing authority. Under existing GAAP,
    changes in accruals associated with uncertainties arising from
    the resolution of pre-acquisition contingencies of acquired
    businesses are charged or credited to goodwill. Adjustments to
    other tax accruals are generally recorded in earnings in the
    period they are determined.

Retirement
    Benefits

Overview

– Assumptions used in determining
    projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets
    for the company’s pension plans and other postretirement
    benefits plans are evaluated annually by management in
    consultation with its outside actuaries. In the event that the
    company determines that plan amendments or changes in the
    assumptions are warranted, future pension and postretirement
    benefit expenses could increase or decrease.

Assumptions

– The principal assumptions that
    have a significant effect on the company’s consolidated
    financial position and results of operations are the discount
    rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and
    the health care cost trend rates. For certain plan assets where
    the fair market value is not readily determinable, such as real
    estate, private equity investments and hedge funds, estimates of
    fair value are determined using the best information available.

Discount Rate

– The discount rate represents
    the interest rate that should be used to determine the present
    value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to
    settle the pension and postretirement benefit obligations. The
    discount rate is generally based on the yield on high-quality
    corporate fixed-income investments. At the end of each year, the
    discount rate is primarily determined based on the results of a
    hypothetical long-term bond portfolio matching the expected cash
    inflows with the expected benefit payments

-32-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

for each benefit plan. Taking into consideration the factors
    noted above, the company’s weighted-average pension
    composite discount rate was 6.22 percent at
    December 31, 2007, and 5.97 percent at
    December 31, 2006.

Expected Long-Term Rate of Return –

The
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets represents the
    average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to
    provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations. For
    2007 and 2006, the company assumed an expected long-term rate of
    return on plan assets of 8.5 percent.

Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of
    return on plan assets within the range indicated below would
    have had the following impacts on 2007 pension and other
    postretirement benefits results:

Health Care Cost Trend Rates

– The health care
    cost trend rates represent the annual rates of change in the
    cost of health care benefits based on estimates of health care
    inflation, changes in health care utilization or delivery
    patterns, technological advances, and changes in the health
    status of the plan participants. For 2007, the company assumed
    an expected initial health care cost trend rate of
    8 percent and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of
    5 percent. In 2006, the company assumed an expected initial
    health care cost trend rate of 8.75 percent and an ultimate
    health care cost trend rate of 5 percent.

– Revenues for principal product
    businesses in Aerospace, Electronics, and Ships during 2007 grew
    at a combined rate of approximately 3 percent over 2006,
    reflecting sales growth in Electronics and Ships, partially
    offset by reduced sales in Aerospace. The sales growth at
    Electronics and Ships was due to volume improvements across most
    business areas, while the sales reduction in Aerospace was
    anticipated as a number of contracts transitioned from
    development to production in 2007. Revenue for principal
    services businesses in Information & Services during
    2007 grew approximately 11 percent over 2006 due largely to
    double digit growth at Information Technology and Technical
    Services segments, resulting from increased volume on contracts
    that were newly awarded in 2006 and growth across the board on
    other contracts.


– Revenues for the principal product
    segments of Integrated Systems, Space Technology and Electronics
    were relatively flat in 2006 as compared to 2005, and revenues
    for the Ships segment declined approximately $500 million
    due primarily to the effects of the damage to the Gulf Coast
    shipyards caused by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. Service
    revenues for the principal services businesses grew principally
    in the Information Technology and Technical Services segments,
    which each had revenue increases in excess of $225 million
    in 2006. Revenues for Mission Systems, the company’s other
    mainly services business, were relatively flat on a year over
    year basis.

    decreasing 90 basis points as a percentage of product sales
    over the same period. Cost of service sales during 2007
    increased $1.1 billion, or 11 percent, over 2006 while
    decreasing 214 basis points as a percentage of service
    sales over the same period. Cost of product sales in 2007
    increased over 2006 due largely to the sales volume increase
    described above, partially offset by improved program
    performance at Integrated Systems, Space Technology and Ships.
    Cost of service revenues in 2007 increased over 2006 due
    primarily to higher sales volume at Information &
    Services. The margin rate improvement was primarily driven by
    improved margin rate performance on service revenues by segments
    principally in the product businesses.


– Cost of product sales during 2006
    decreased $1.2 billion, or 7 percent, over 2005 while
    decreasing 160 basis points as a percentage of product
    sales over the same period. Cost of service sales during 2006
    increased

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

$887 million, or 9 percent, over 2005 while decreasing
    164 basis points as a percentage of service sales over the
    same period. Cost of product sales in 2006 declined over 2005
    due largely to the sales volume decreases described above,
    improved program performance across all of the principal product
    segments and the absence of contract charges from Hurricane
    Katrina. Cost of product sales in 2005 included charges of
    $165 million due to the impacts of Hurricane Katrina on
    ship construction contracts in process when the hurricane
    occurred in August 2005. Cost of service revenues increased in
    2006 due to higher volume at Information Technology and
    Technical Services, partially offset by improved cost
    performance at Mission Systems & Technical Services.

General and Administrative Expenses

– In
    accordance with industry practice and the regulations that
    govern the cost accounting requirements for government
    contracts, most general corporate expenses incurred at both the
    segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and
    allocable costs on government contracts and such costs, for most
    components of the company, are allocated to contracts in
    progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors
    include this cost component as an element of cost. General and
    administrative expenses primarily relate to segment operations.
    General and administrative expenses remained at a constant rate
    of approximately 10 percent of sales in 2007 and 2006.
    General and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales
    increased from 9.6 percent in 2005 to 10.1 percent in
    2006. The increase in 2006 is due primarily to higher property
    insurance, litigation, and bid and proposal costs, partially
    offset by lower IR&D.

Operating
    Margin

The company considers operating margin to be an important
    measure for evaluating its operating performance and, as is
    typical in the industry, defines operating margin as revenues
    less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and
    administrative expenses. Operating margin for the company is
    further evaluated for each of the business segments in which the
    company operates, and “segment operating margin” is
    one of the key metrics used by management of the company to
    internally manage its operations.

Operating margin represents segment operating margin (see
    section entitled Segment Operating Results) adjusted for a
    number of factors that do not affect the segments as follows:

    years ended December 31, 2007, and 2006, respectively. See
    the Segment Operating Results section below for further
    information.


– Segment operating margin for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 increased $386 million, or
    16 percent, as compared to the same period in 2005. Total
    segment operating margin was 9.3 percent and
    8.1 percent of total sales and service revenues for the
    years ended December 31, 2006, and 2005, respectively. See
    the Segment Operating Results section below for further
    information.

Unallocated Expenses –

Unallocated expenses for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased
    $82 million, or 27 percent, as compared with the same
    period in 2006. The decrease was primarily due to
    $98 million in lower post-retirement benefit costs
    determined under GAAP as a result of a plan design change in
    2006 and $36 million lower legal and investigative
    provisions, partially offset by an increase in other costs
    including $18 million in higher litigation expenses. During
    the third quarter 2006, the company recorded a
    $112.5 million pre-tax provision for its settlement offer
    to the U.S. Department of Justice and a restricted customer.

Net Pension Adjustment –

The net pension
    adjustment reflects the excess pension expense determined in
    accordance with GAAP over the pension expense allocated to the
    operating segments under CAS. The net pension adjustment
    increased income by $127 million in 2007, as compared with
    an expense of $37 million and $21 million in 2006 and
    2005, respectively. The reduction in 2007 GAAP pension cost
    primarily results from higher returns on plan assets and a
    voluntary pre-funding in the fourth quarter of 2006.

Interest
    Expense, net

Interest expense, net for 2007 was comparable to 2006. Interest
    expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2006, was
    $303 million, a decrease of $31 million, or
    9 percent, in 2006 as compared with 2005. The decrease was
    primarily due to a lower average debt balance in 2006 resulting
    from debt maturities totaling $1.2 billion in 2006.

Other,
    net

2007 –

Other, net for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 was $12 million expense, a decrease
    of $137 million, as compared with 2006. During 2006, the
    company sold its remaining 9.7 million TRW Automotive (TRW
    Auto) shares, generating pre-tax gains of $111 million.

2006 –

Other, net for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 was $125 million income, a decrease
    of $74 million, or 37 percent, from 2005 income of
    $199 million. During 2005, the company sold
    7.3 million TRW Auto shares and approximately
    3.4 million Endwave shares, which generated pre-tax gains
    of $70 million and $95 million, respectively, as
    compared to the $111 million pre-tax gain in 2006 resulting
    from the sale of the remaining TRW Auto stock.

Federal
    and Foreign Income Taxes

2007 –

The company’s effective tax rate on
    income from continuing operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, was 33 percent compared with
    31 percent in 2006. During 2007, the company reached a
    partial settlement agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue
    Service (IRS) regarding its audit of the company’s tax
    years ended 2001 – 2003 resulting in a tax benefit of
    $22 million.

2006 –

The company’s effective tax rate on
    income from continuing operations for 2006 and 2005 was
    31 percent and 32 percent, respectively. During 2006,
    the company received final approval from the U.S. Congress
    Joint Committee on Taxation for the agreement previously reached
    with the IRS regarding its audits of the company’s B-2
    program for the years ended December 31, 1997 through
    December 31, 2000. As a result of the agreement the company
    recognized tax benefits of $48 million, due to the reversal
    of previously established expense provisions. The company also
    recognized a net tax benefit of $18 million in 2006 related
    to tax credits associated with qualified wages paid to employees
    affected by Hurricane Katrina.

Diluted
    Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations


– Diluted earnings per share from
    continuing operations for 2007 was $5.16 per share, an increase
    of 16 percent from $4.46 per share in 2006. Earnings per
    share are based on weighted-average diluted shares outstanding
    of 354.3 million for 2007 and 358.6 million for 2006.
    The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used to
    calculate earnings per share includes the dilutive impact of the
    mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.


– Diluted earnings per share from
    continuing operations for 2006 was $4.46 per share, an increase
    of 16 percent from $3.84 per share in 2005. Earnings per
    share are based on weighted-average diluted shares outstanding
    of 358.6 million for 2006 and 363.2 million for 2005.
    For 2006, weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used to
    calculate earnings per share includes the dilutive impact of the
    mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.

Net Cash
    Provided by Operating Activities


– Net cash provided by operating
    activities in 2007 increased $1.1 billion as compared with
    2006, and reflects lower pension contributions, higher net
    income, and continued trade working capital reductions. Pension
    plan contributions totaled $342 million in 2007, of which
    $200 million was voluntarily pre-funded compared

    $800 million was voluntarily pre-funded. Cash collected
    from customers increased by $2 billion, and cash paid to
    suppliers and employees increased by $635 million in 2007
    as compared with 2006.

Net cash provided by operating activities for 2007 included the
    receipt of $125 million of insurance proceeds related to
    Hurricane Katrina, $52 million of federal and state income
    tax refunds, and $21 million of interest.


– Net cash provided by operating
    activities in 2006 decreased $871 million as compared with
    2005, primarily due to contributions to the company’s
    pension plans. Cash collected from customers decreased by
    $166 million, and cash paid to suppliers and employees
    increased by $361 million in 2006 as compared with 2005.
    Net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 included the
    receipt of $100 million of insurance proceeds related to
    Hurricane Katrina, $60 million of federal and state income
    tax refunds, and $45 million of interest. Net cash provided
    by operating activities in 2006 includes contributions to the
    company’s pension plans totaling $1.2 billion, of
    which $800 million was voluntarily pre-funded as compared
    to contributions of $415 million in 2005, of which
    $203 million was voluntarily pre-funded.

Realignments

– The company, from time to time,
    will realign contracts, programs or business areas among or
    within its operating segments that possess similar customers,
    expertise, and capabilities. These realignments are designed to
    more fully leverage existing capabilities and enhance
    development and delivery of products and services. In January
    2007, certain programs and business areas were transferred among
    Information Technology, Mission Systems, Space Technology, and
    Technical Services. The operating results for all periods
    presented have been revised to reflect these changes. See a
    description of the segment business areas and specific
    realignments located in Part I, Item 1.

-37-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Subsequent Realignments –

In January 2008, the
    Newport News and Ship Systems sectors were realigned into a
    single segment called Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding to enable
    the company to more effectively utilize its shipbuilding assets
    and deploy its talented shipbuilders, processes, technologies,
    production facilities and planned capital investment to meet
    customer needs. This realignment had no impact on the
    company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations, cash flows, or segment reporting.

Also in January 2008, the company announced the transfer of
    certain programs and assets from the Mission Systems segment to
    the Space Technology segment, effective July 1, 2008. This
    transfer will allow Mission Systems to focus on the rapidly
    growing command, control, communications, computers,
    intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance business, and the
    missiles business will be an integrated element of the
    company’s Aerospace business growth strategy. In addition,
    certain Electronics businesses were transferred to Mission
    Systems effective January 2008. The transfer of these businesses
    is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows.

These subsequent realignments have not been reflected in any of
    the accompanying financial information.

KEY
    SEGMENT FINANCIAL MEASURES

Operating
    Performance Assessment and Reporting

The company manages and assesses the performance of its
    businesses based on its performance on individual contracts and
    programs obtained generally from government organizations using
    the financial measures referred to below, with consideration
    given to the Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and
    Judgments described on page 29. Based on this approach and
    the nature of the company’s operations, the discussion of
    consolidated results of operations generally focuses around the
    company’s seven reportable segments versus distinguishing
    between products and services. Product sales are predominantly
    generated in the Electronics, Integrated Systems, Space
    Technology and Ships segments, while the majority of the
    company’s service revenues are generated by the Information
    Technology, Mission Systems and Technical Services segments.

Funded
    Contract Acquisitions

Funded contract acquisitions represent amounts funded during the
    period on customer contractually obligated orders. Funded
    contract acquisitions tend to fluctuate from period to period
    and are determined by the size and timing of new and follow-on
    orders and by obligations of funding on previously awarded
    unfunded orders. In the period that a business is purchased, its
    existing funded order backlog as of the date of purchase is
    reported as funded contract acquisitions. In the period that a
    business is sold, its existing funded order backlog as of the
    divestiture date is deducted from funded contract acquisitions.

Sales and
    Service Revenues

Period-to-period sales generally vary less than funded contract
    acquisitions and reflect performance under new and ongoing
    contracts. Changes in sales and service revenues are typically
    expressed in terms of volume. Unless otherwise described, volume
    generally refers to increases (or decreases) in revenues
    incurred due to varying production activity levels, delivery
    rates, or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes
    will typically carry a corresponding margin change based on the
    margin rate for a particular contract.

Segment
    Operating Margin

Segment operating margin reflects the performance of segment
    contracts. Excluded from this measure are certain costs not
    directly associated with contract performance, including the
    portion of corporate expenses such as management and
    administration, legal, environmental, certain compensation and
    other retiree benefits, and other expenses not considered
    allowable or allocable under applicable CAS regulations and the
    FAR, and therefore not allocated to the segments. Changes in
    segment operating margin are typically expressed in terms of
    volume, as discussed above, or performance. Performance refers
    to changes in contract margin rates. These changes typically
    relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total
    estimated costs at completion of the contract (EAC) that reflect
    improved (or deteriorated) operating performance on a particular
    contract. Operating margin changes are accounted for on a
    cumulative to date basis at the time an EAC change is recorded.

-38-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Operating margin may also be affected by, among other things,
    the effects of workforce stoppages, the effects of natural
    disasters (such as hurricanes and earthquakes), resolution of
    disputed items with the customer, recovery of insurance
    proceeds, and other discrete events. At the completion of a
    long-term contract, any originally estimated costs not incurred
    or reserves not fully utilized (such as warranty reserves) could
    also impact contract earnings. Where such items have occurred,
    and the effects are material, a separate description is provided.

Funded
    Contract Acquisitions


– Mission Systems funded contract
    acquisitions decreased $76 million, or 1 percent, in
    2007 as compared with 2006, primarily due to $626 million
    lower funded contract acquisitions in Missile Systems, partially
    offset by $401 million higher funded contract acquisitions
    in ISR and $164 million higher funded contract acquisitions
    in C3. The decrease in Missile Systems is due to timing of
    funding on the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) and
    Kinetic Energy Interceptors (KEI) programs and receipt of
    delayed funding upon approval of the federal defense budget
    during the first quarter of 2006. The increase in ISR is related
    to the acquisition of Essex. The increase in C3 is due to higher
    funding across various programs. Significant funded contract
    acquisitions in 2007 included $603 million for the ICBM
    program, $223 million for the Joint National Integration
    Center Research and Development (JRDC) program,
    $188 million for the

F-22

program, $169 million for the KEI program,
    $137 million for the Ground-Based Midcourse Fire Control
    and Communications (GFC/C) program and $118 million
    for the Force XXI Battle Brigade and Below (FBCB2) Installation
    Kits

(I-Kits)

program.


– Mission Systems funded contract
    acquisitions increased $1.2 billion, or 25 percent, in
    2006 as compared with 2005, primarily due to the receipt of
    delayed funding upon approval of the fiscal year 2006 federal
    defense budget, the timing of funding received in the KEI
    program and the timing of a production award in the ICBM
    program. Significant acquisitions in 2006 included
    $1 billion for the ICBM program, $348 million for the
    KEI program, $217 million for the JRDC program,
    $176 million for the

F-22

program, $164 million for the

F-35

program, $155 million for the Space Based Space
    Surveillance (SBSS) program, and $118 million for the
    Command Post Platform (CPP) program.

Sales and
    Service Revenues


– Mission Systems revenue increased
    $437 million, or 8 percent, as compared with 2006. The
    increase was due to $279 million in higher sales in ISR,
    $131 million in higher sales in Missile Systems and
    $52 million in higher sales in C3. The increase in ISR is
    principally due to the acquisition of Essex. The increase in
    Missile Systems is primarily due to increased scope and funding
    levels in the KEI, JRDC, ICBM and National Team Battle
    Management Command and Control (BMC2) programs. The increase in
    C3 is due to higher volume in several programs, including the
    FBCB2

I-Kits

program, partially offset by lower volume in the

F-35

development

program as hardware development in 2006 winds down in 2007 and
    reduced scope and deliveries accelerated into 2006 in the

F-22

program.


– Mission Systems revenue remained
    unchanged in 2006 when compared with 2005. The higher sales
    volume across multiple programs including SBSS, CPP, FBCB2
    Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) and GFC/C were
    offset by lower sales volume in a restricted program and reduced
    production volume in the ICBM program.

Segment
    Operating Margin


– Mission Systems operating margin
    increased $47 million, or 9 percent, in 2007 as
    compared with 2006. The increase includes net performance
    improvements of $22 million driven by cost improvements
    achieved based on increases in customer order quantities in the
    FBCB2 I-Kits program, final negotiation of award fee earned on
    the National Team BMC2 program, lower labor costs and favorable
    pricing of supplier procured materials in the CPP program and
    elimination of risk associated with hardware obsolescence in the
    GFC/C program. Net performance improvements were partially
    offset by $12 million in higher amortization of purchased
    intangibles. Volume changes contributed to the 2007 operating
    margin increase primarily due to the acquisition of Essex.


– Mission Systems operating margin
    increased $95 million, or 22 percent, in 2006 as
    compared with 2005. The increase includes net performance
    improvements across multiple programs including a successful
    flight test and favorable award fee scores on the GFC/C program,
    successful cost and risk management in the fixed price
    development portion of the Global Combat Support System
    Army/Tactical program, continued success in fielding
    Communication, Navigation and Identification (CNI) systems in
    the F-22 production program and a decrease of $26 million
    in amortization of purchased intangibles. The increase in
    operating margin as a percentage of segment sales over 2005 is
    due to the net performance improvements mentioned above.

Funded
    Contract Acquisitions


– Information Technology funded contract
    acquisitions decreased $213 million, or 5 percent, in
    2007 as compared to 2006, primarily reflecting decreases of
    $203 million in Intelligence and $98 million in
    CS&L, partially offset by an increase of $109 million
    in Defense. A significant amount of the Intelligence funded
    contract acquisitions decrease was related to the early funding
    of contracts in 2006. Significant non-restricted funded
    acquisitions in 2007 included $214 million for the Virginia
    IT outsourcing program, $146 million for the Network
    Centric Solutions program, $140 million for the Systems and
    Software Engineering Services program, and $139 million for
    the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Enterprise
    Engineering program.


– Information Technology funded contract
    acquisitions increased $913 million, or 25 percent, in
    2006 as compared to 2005, primarily reflecting increases of
    $527 million in Intelligence, $322 million in
    CS&L, and $226 million in Defense, partially offset by
    a decrease of $160 million in Civilian Agencies. The
    increase in Intelligence was primarily related to the early
    funding of contracts. Significant non-restricted funded contract
    acquisitions in 2006 included $319 million for the New York
    City Wireless program, $231 million for the

National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Enterprise Engineering
    program, $130 million for the Systems and Software
    Engineering Services program, and $100 million for the
    Defense Threat Reduction Agency program.

Sales and
    Service Revenues


– Information Technology revenue increased
    $524 million, or 13 percent, in 2007 as compared with
    2006. The increase was primarily due to $275 million in
    higher sales volume in CS&L, $222 million in higher
    sales in Intelligence, and $133 million in higher sales in
    Defense, partially offset by $73 million in lower sales in
    Civilian Agencies. The increase in CS&L is associated with
    the effect of a full year of sales from new programs awarded in
    2006, including the New York City Wireless, Virginia IT
    outsourcing, and San Diego County IT outsourcing programs.
    The increase in Intelligence is due to new restricted program
    wins and higher volume on existing programs. The increase in
    Defense is due to increased volume on various existing programs
    and new business wins. The decrease in Civilian Agencies is
    primarily due to customer program budget reductions, and program
    completions.


– Information Technology revenue increased
    $226 million, or 6 percent, in 2006 as compared with
    2005. The increase was primarily due to $105 million in
    higher sales volume in Intelligence, $101 million in higher
    sales volume in Defense, and $57 million in higher sales
    volume in CS&L, partially offset by $36 million in
    lower sales in Civilian Agencies. The increase in Intelligence
    is due to new restricted program wins and higher volume on
    various existing programs. The increase in Defense is due to
    increased volume on various existing programs. The increase in
    CS&L is due to higher volume associated with new programs
    awarded in 2006, including the Virginia IT outsourcing,
    San Diego County IT outsourcing, and New York City Wireless
    programs. The decrease in Civilian Agencies is primarily due to
    customer program budget reductions and program completions.

Segment
    Operating Margin


– Information Technology operating margin
    decreased $13 million, or 4 percent, in 2007 as
    compared to 2006. The decrease in operating margin was driven by
    $28 million in increased amortization of deferred and other
    outsourcing costs on large IT outsourcing programs compared to
    the prior period, partially offset by margin on new business
    wins and the effects of increased volume on several
    Intelligence, CS&L, and Defense programs. The operating
    margin decrease also reflects $22 million in discretionary
    spending for internal information systems infrastructure
    expected to yield future cost improvements. The decrease in
    operating margin as a percentage of segment sales is primarily
    due to the timing of service contract costs and amortization of
    deferred and other outsourcing costs on large IT outsourcing
    programs.


– Information Technology operating margin
    increased $20 million, or 6 percent, in 2006 as
    compared to 2005. The increase was driven by higher sales volume
    in Intelligence, Defense, and CS&L, primarily on the
    Virginia IT outsourcing program. The increase also reflects
    $5 million lower amortization expense for purchased
    intangibles.

Funded
    Contract Acquisitions

2007 –

Technical Services funded contract
    acquisitions decreased $19 million or 1 percent in
    2007 as compared with 2006, primarily reflecting a decrease of
    $355 million at TSG, partially offset by a
    $327 million increase at LCOE. The decrease at TSG is
    primarily due to accelerated funding received in 2006 for the
    Saudi Arabian National Guard (SANG) program. The increase in the
    LCOE group is due to additional tasking across various programs,
    including the Hunter CLS program. Significant funded contract
    acquisitions in 2007 included $417 million for the Nevada
    Test Site (NTS) program, $310 million for the Joint Base
    Operations Support (JBOS) program, $174 million for the
    Sierra Vista Hunter program, $112 million for the Battle
    Command Training program, $98 million for the
    Ft. Irwin program, $75 million for the TSC program and
    $75 million for F-15 repairs at the Warner Robins Regional
    Repair Service Center (WRRSC).


– Technical Services funded contract
    acquisitions increased $578 million, or 34 percent, in
    2006 as compared with 2005. Significant funded contract
    acquisitions in 2006 included $462 million for the Nevada
    Test Site (NTS) program, $354 million in additional funding
    in the JBOS program, and $297 million in additional funding
    in the SANG program.

Sales and
    Service Revenues

2007 –

Technical Services revenue increased
    $319 million or 17 percent, in 2007 as compared with
    2006, primarily due to increases of $248 million and
    $66 million in SSG and LCOE, respectively. The increase in
    SSG is primarily driven by $252 million from the effects of
    a full year of sales for the NTS program in 2007 as compared to
    six months of revenue in 2006. The increase in LCOE is due to
    increased demand for F-15 repairs at WRRSC, increased demand on
    the Sierra Vista Hunter program and increased work on the B2
    programs.


– Technical Services revenue increased
    $241 million, or 15 percent, in 2006 as compared with
    2005. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume for
    the NTS, Combined Tactical Training Range and Ft. Irwin
    programs, partially offset by lower volume in the JBOS program.

Segment
    Operating Margin

2007 –

Technical Services operating margin
    remained unchanged in 2007 when compared with 2006. The volume
    increases associated with the NTS, F-15 repairs, Sierra Vista
    Hunter and B2 programs were offset by the effects of performance
    improvements taken in the prior year and favorable 2006 margin
    adjustments to reflect risk reduction on contracts for spares
    production on fixed price contracts. A lower margin mix from the
    NTS program also contributed to offsetting the volume increase.


– Technical Services operating margin
    increased $20 million, or 20 percent, in 2006 as
    compared with 2005. The increase includes net performance
    improvements from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
    Services, SANG, and APG-66 Japan programs. Volume changes
    contributed to the 2006 operating margin primarily driven by
    higher sales volume in the NTS program.

Funded
    Contract Acquisitions


– Integrated Systems funded contract
    acquisitions decreased $1.1 billion, or 18 percent, as
    compared with 2006, resulting from decreases of
    $641 million and $653 million at ISWR and ISER,
    respectively, partially offset by an increase of
    $160 million on International Programs. The decrease is
    primarily due to higher 2006 funded contract acquisitions as a
    result of delayed funding upon approval of the fiscal year 2006
    defense budget. Significant funded contract acquisitions
    included $825 million for the

F/A-18

program, $816 million for the

E-2

program,
    $579 million for the B-2 program, and $560 million for
    the High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) Systems (Global Hawk)
    program.


– Integrated Systems funded contract
    acquisitions increased $1.6 billion, or 34 percent, as
    compared with the same period in 2005, resulting from increases
    of $757 million and $826 million at ISWR and ISER,
    respectively. The increase is primarily due to higher 2006
    funded contract acquisitions as a result of delayed funding upon
    approval of the fiscal year 2006 defense budget. Significant
    funded contract acquisitions included $1.2 billion for the

E-2

program,
    $978 million for the F-35 program, $767 million for
    the

F/A-18

program, and $718 million for the HALE Systems (Global
    Hawk) program.

Sales and
    Service Revenues


– Integrated Systems revenue decreased
    $433 million, or 8 percent, as compared with 2006,
    resulting from decreases of $105 million and
    $369 million at ISWR and ISER, respectively. Approximately
    $325 million of the decrease was a result of the transition
    of the

E-2D

Advanced Hawkeye, F-35 and EA-18G development programs to their
    early production phases. Also contributing to the reduction in
    revenue was approximately $160 million from the effects of
    significant customer-directed scope reductions associated with
    the

E-10A

platform and related MP-RTIP efforts. These reductions were
    partially offset by higher volume of $69 million for the

F/A-18

Multi-Year Procurement (MYP) and $77 million for the Global
    Hawk programs.


– Integrated Systems revenue increased
    $11 million as compared with 2005, resulting from an
    increase of $239 million in ISWR, partially offset by a
    decrease of $209 million in ISER. The increase in ISWR is
    primarily due to higher sales volume for the F-35,

F/A-18,

and
    various restricted programs. The decrease in ISER is primarily
    due to lower volume in the

E-2D

Advanced Hawkeye, Joint STARS, and EA-6B programs.

Segment
    Operating Margin


– Integrated Systems operating margin
    increased $40 million, or 7 percent, as compared with
    the same period in 2006. The increase in operating margin
    includes net margin improvements of $86 million primarily
    due to risk reduction achieved on the Global Hawk and various
    B-2 programs and favorable settlement of a prior year’s
    overhead costs, partially offset by the margin effects of lower
    sales volume described above. The increase in operating margin
    as a percentage of segment sales is primarily due to risk
    reduction on the

E-2

program,
    improved performance on B-2 support programs, and the favorable
    settlement of a prior year’s overhead costs described above.


– Integrated Systems operating margin
    increased $52 million, or 10 percent, as compared with
    2005. The increase in operating margin primarily reflects
    improvements on the F-35, EA-18G, and

F/A-18

programs combined with higher sales volume in the

F/A-18

and
    F-35 programs.

    National Systems and Technology & Emerging Systems,
    respectively.


– Space Technology revenues increased
    $57 million, or 2 percent, as compared with 2005. The
    increase was primarily due to higher sales in Military Systems
    due to higher volume in the AEHF program and higher sales in
    Technology & Emerging Systems due to the ABL program,
    partially offset by lower sales in Civil Systems due to lower
    volume for the NPOESS program.

Segment
    Operating Margin


– Space Technology operating margin
    increased $16 million, or 7 percent, in 2007 as
    compared with 2006. The increase in operating margin was

    Machine program.

Sales and
    Service Revenues


– Electronics revenue increased
    $363 million, or 6 percent, in 2007 as compared with
    2006, reflecting $178 million higher sales in Defensive
    Systems, $116 million higher sales in the Government
    Systems, and $97 million in Naval & Marine
    Systems (NMS), partially offset by $100 million lower sales
    in Aerospace Systems. The increase in Defensive Systems is
    primarily due to higher deliveries on Land Forces and
    Electro-Optical & Infrared Countermeasures programs.
    The increase in Government Systems sales is primarily
    attributable to increases in Communications and ISR programs.
    The increase in NMS sales is primarily due to higher volume on a
    restricted program. The lower Aerospace Systems sales are
    primarily due to the effect of declining volume on fixed price
    development programs.


– Electronics revenue increased
    $30 million, or less than 1 percent, in 2006 as
    compared with 2005. The increase was primarily due to higher
    sales in automated flat sorting machines to the U.S. Postal
    Service, vehicle intercommunications systems and infrared
    countermeasures programs, partially offset by lower sales volume
    in the F-16 Block 60 and Longbow Missile programs as these
    programs near completion. Sales for 2006 also included
    adjustments resulting from charges for the MESA Wedgetail and
    Peace Eagle fixed-price development airborne surveillance
    programs.

Segment
    Operating Margin


– Electronics operating margin increased
    $59 million, or 8 percent, in 2007 as compared with
    2006. The increase in operating margin is largely attributable
    to higher volume, primarily in Government Systems, Defensive
    Systems, and Naval & Marine Systems. Operating margin
    for 2007 included a $27 million pre-tax charge for the F-16
    Block 60 fixed-price development combat avionics program.
    The 2007 charge reflected a higher estimate of software
    integration costs to complete the Falcon Edge electronic warfare
    suite as compared to $121 million in pre-tax charges in
    2006 for several programs mentioned below. The 2007 operating
    margin also includes $14 million in consolidation costs
    related to the closure of several facilities as a result of a
    continuing focus on effective infrastructure management and
    $26 million in provisions for settled and outstanding
    matters.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION


– Electronics operating margin increased
    $45 million, or 6 percent, in 2006 as compared with
    2005. The increase was primarily due to $55 million lower
    amortization expense and includes net performance improvements
    on various programs. Operating margin for 2006 included a
    $51 million pre-tax charge for the Wedgetail contract and a
    $42 million pre-tax charge for the Peace Eagle contract
    (both under the MESA program), and a $28 million pre-tax
    charge for the ASPIS II program. These charges primarily reflect
    the impact of development, test & evaluation schedule
    extension, required hardware modifications and related
    retrofits. Operating margin for 2005 included a $65 million
    pre-tax charge for the F-16 Block 60 fixed-price
    development combat avionics program. The charge reflected a
    higher estimate of costs to complete the Falcon Edge electronic
    warfare suite, including rework of the mission software.

    $4.8 billion, or 47 percent as compared with 2006,
    primarily representing decreases of $5.2 billion in
    Aircraft Carriers and Expeditionary Warfare. The decrease is
    partially due to higher 2006 funded contract acquisitions as a
    result of delayed funding approval for the fiscal year 2006
    defense budget as well as the funding received on the

George H.W. Bush

,

USS Carl Vinson

and
    Ford Class programs in 2006, originally expected in 2007.
    Significant funded contract acquisitions during the year include
    $1.4 billion for the LPD program, $1.1 billion for the
    LHA program, $510 million for the

Virginia

-class
    submarine program, $624 million for the DDG 1000 program,

    Service Revenues

2007 –

Ships revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 increased $467 million, or
    9 percent as compared with 2006. The increase was primarily
    due to $252 million in higher sales in Expeditionary
    Warfare, $92 million in higher sales in Fleet Support,
    $81 million in higher sales in Coast Guard and Coastal
    Defense, $53 million in higher sales in Submarines,
    $52 million in higher sales in Aircraft Carriers, partially
    offset by $33 million in lower sales in Surface Combatants,
    and $25 million in lower sales in Services,
    Commercial & Other. The increase in

-46-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Expeditionary Warfare was primarily due to higher sales volume
    in the LPD and LHA programs due to production

ramp-ups,

partially offset by lower sales volume in the LHD program as a
    result of a labor strike at the Pascagoula, Mississippi
    shipyard. The increase in Fleet Support was due to the
    reorganization of AMSEC. The increase in Coast Guard and Coastal
    Defense was due to higher sales volume in the WMSL program. The
    decrease in Surface Combatants was due to lower sales in the DDG
    1000 program and the impacts of the labor strike.


– Ships revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 decreased $465 million, or
    8 percent as compared with 2005. The decrease was primarily
    due to lower sales volume in the DDG 1000 program driven by the
    transition from Phase III to Phase IV and changes in
    the Navy acquisition strategy regarding major sub-contractors,
    as well as continued recovery from the impact of Hurricane
    Katrina in the LPD program. The decrease was partially offset by
    higher sales in the

USS Carl Vinson

, DDG 51, NSC, and LHA
    programs.

Segment
    Operating Margin


– Ships operating margin for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 increased $145 million, or
    37 percent, as compared with 2006, primarily consisting of
    $62 million for recovery of lost profits due to having
    reached an agreement on a portion of the Katrina insurance
    claim, a $23 million pre-tax gain resulting from the
    reorganization of AMSEC, and increased volume across multiple
    programs, offset by $55 million resulting from a contract
    earnings rate adjustment on LHD 8 primarily due to a schedule
    extension resulting from manpower constraints in critical crafts
    (electrical and pipefitting) following the strike at the
    Pascagoula shipyard in 2007.


– Ships operating margin for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 increased $144 million, or
    58 percent as compared with 2005. The increase was
    primarily due to a prior year charge of $150 million to
    account for Hurricane Katrina-related cost growth, as well as a
    $15 million impact from Hurricane Katrina-related work
    delays (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8). The 2006 operating
    margin includes a pension benefit resulting from the Pension
    Protection Act of 2006. These increases were partially offset by
    lower sales volume in the DDG 1000 program.

BACKLOG

Total backlog at December 31, 2007, was approximately
    $64 billion. Total backlog includes both funded backlog
    (unfilled orders for which funding is contractually obligated by
    the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which
    funding is not currently contractually obligated by the
    customer). Unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract
    options and unfunded IDIQ orders. For multi-year services
    contracts with non-federal government customers having no stated
    contract values, backlog includes only the amounts committed by
    the customer. Major components in unfunded backlog as of
    December 31, 2007, included various restricted programs and
    the KEI program in the Mission Systems segment; the F-35 and

F/A-18

programs in the Integrated Systems segment; the NTS program in
    the Technical Services segment; the NPOESS and restricted
    programs in the Space Technology segment; Block II of the

Virginia

class submarines program and the LHA program in
    the Ships segment.

    66 percent of the 2007 year-end funded backlog is
    expected to be converted into sales in 2008. Total
    U.S. Government orders, including those made on behalf of
    foreign governments, comprised 89 percent, 90 percent,
    and 83 percent of the funded backlog at the end of 2007,
    2006, and 2005, respectively. Total foreign customer orders
    accounted for 6 percent, 5 percent, and
    10 percent of the funded backlog at the end of 2007, 2006,
    and 2005, respectively. Domestic commercial backlog represented
    5 percent, 5 percent, and 7 percent of funded
    backlog at the end of 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Company management uses various financial measures to assist in
    capital deployment decision making including net cash provided
    by operations, free cash flow, net debt-to-equity, and net
    debt-to-capital. Management believes these measures are useful
    to investors in assessing the company’s financial
    performance.

Free Cash
    Flow

Free cash flow represents cash generated from operations
    available for discretionary use after operational cash
    requirements to improve or maintain levels of production have
    been met. Free cash flow is a useful measure for investors as it
    affects the ability of the company to grow by funding strategic
    business acquisitions and return value to shareholders through
    repurchasing its shares and paying dividends.

Free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under
    GAAP, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies
    in the same manner. This measure should not be considered in
    isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in
    accordance with GAAP as indicators of performance.

Cash
    Flows

The following is a discussion of the company’s major
    operating, investing and financing activities for each of the
    three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, as
    classified on the consolidated statements of cash flows located
    in Part II, Item 8.

Operating
    Activities


– Cash provided by operating activities in
    2007 increased $1.1 billion as compared with 2006, and
    reflects lower pension contributions, higher net income, and
    continued trade working capital reductions. Pension plan
    contributions totaled $342 million in 2007, of which
    $200 million was voluntarily pre-funded compared with
    contributions of $1.2 billion in 2006, of which
    $800 million was voluntarily pre-funded.

Cash collected from customers increased by $2 billion, and
    cash paid to suppliers and employees increased by
    $635 million in 2007 as compared with 2006. Net cash
    provided by operating activities for 2007 included the receipt
    of $125 million of insurance proceeds related to Hurricane
    Katrina, $52 million of federal and state income tax
    refunds, and $21 million of interest income.

At December 31, 2007, net working capital (current assets
    less current liabilities) was $340 million, as compared to
    a working capital deficit of $28 million in 2006, primarily
    due to a decrease in current income taxes payable as a result of
    the adoption in 2007 of FIN 48.


– Cash provided by operating activities
    was $1.8 billion as compared with $2.6 billion in
    2005. The decrease was primarily due to contributions to the
    company’s pension plans totaling $1.2 billion, of
    which $800 million was voluntarily pre-funded in the fourth
    quarter, as compared to contributions of $415 million in
    2005, of which $203 million was voluntarily pre-funded in
    the fourth quarter.

Cash collected from customers decreased by $166 million,
    and cash paid to suppliers and employees increased by
    $361 million. Net cash from operating activities for 2006
    included the receipt of $100 million of insurance proceeds
    related to Hurricane Katrina, $60 million of federal and
    state income tax refunds, and $45 million of interest
    income.

At December 31, 2006, net working capital deficit (current
    assets less current liabilities) was $28 million, primarily
    reflecting a lower cash balance offset by a lower current
    portion of long-term debt.

-49-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION


– Cash provided by operating activities
    was $2.6 billion. Net cash from operating activities for
    2005 included the receipt of $89 million of insurance
    proceeds related to Hurricane Katrina, $88 million of
    federal and state income tax refunds, and $78 million of
    interest, including interest on a state tax refund for research
    and development credits for the years 1988 through 1990. These
    cash inflows were partially offset by a payment of
    $99 million for a litigation settlement.

Employer contributions to the company’s pension plans were
    $415 million in 2005, including voluntary pre-funding
    payments of $203 million in 2005.

At December 31, 2005, net working capital deficit (current
    assets less current liabilities) was $418 million.

Investing
    Activities


– Cash used in investing activities was

    three businesses for $690 million (See Note 4 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8),
    paid $137 million for outsourcing costs related to newly
    acquired outsourcing services contracts, and released
    $59 million of restricted cash related to the Gulf
    Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue Bonds (see
    discussion in “Financing Activities” below) which was
    partially offset by restrictions related to the Xinetics
    purchase (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8).

Capital expenditures in 2007 were $685 million, including
    $118 million to replace property damaged by Hurricane
    Katrina and $47 million of capitalized software costs.
    Capital expenditure commitments at December 31, 2007 were
    approximately $668 million, which are expected to be paid
    with cash on hand and restricted cash.


– Cash used in investing activities was
    $601 million in 2006. During 2006, the company received
    $209 million from the sale of the remaining
    9.7 million of its TRW Auto common shares. Also during
    2006, Ships received access to $200 million from the
    issuance of Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue
    Bonds (see discussion in Financing Activities below) of which
    $127 million remained restricted as of December 31,
    2006. In addition, the company received $117 million of
    insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Katrina, paid
    $77 million for outsourcing costs related to newly acquired
    outsourcing services contracts, and paid $35 million for
    the purchase of an investment.

    sales of the Interconnect Technologies assembly business unit
    and Winchester.

    $111 million to replace property damaged by Hurricane
    Katrina and $36 million of capitalized software costs.


– Cash used in investing activities was
    $855 million in 2005. During 2005, the company paid
    $361 million to acquire two businesses. This includes the
    acquisition of Confluent in September 2005 and Integic in March
    2005. The company received $238 million from the sale of
    investments, including $95 million for 3.4 million
    common shares of Endwave and $143 million for
    7.3 million common shares of TRW Auto. During 2005, the
    company also received $57 million from the sale of Teldix.

The company received insurance proceeds of $38 million in
    2005 to replace damaged property at the Ships segment as a
    result of Hurricane Katrina.

Capital expenditures in 2005 were $823 million, including
    $80 million to replace property damaged by Hurricane
    Katrina and $41 million of capitalized software costs.

Financing
    Activities


– Cash used in financing activities was
    $1.5 billion comprised primarily of $1.2 billion in
    share repurchases, $504 million of dividends paid to
    shareholders, and $384 million in repayment of borrowings
    under lines of credit (See Note 13 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8), partially
    offset by $315 million in borrowings under lines of credit,

Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue
    Bonds –

In December 2006, Ships entered into a
    loan agreement with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation
    (MBFC) under which Ships received access to $200 million
    from the issuance of Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial
    Development Revenue Bonds by the MBFC. The loan accrues interest
    payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 4.55 percent per
    annum. The company’s obligation related to these bonds is
    recorded in long-term debt in the consolidated statements of
    financial position in Part II, Item 8. The bonds are
    subject to redemption at the company’s discretion on or
    after December 1, 2016, and will mature on December 1,
    2028. The bond issuance proceeds must be used to finance the
    construction, reconstruction, and renovation of the
    company’s interest in certain ship manufacturing and repair
    facilities, or portions thereof, located in the state of
    Mississippi. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    approximately $140 million and $73 million,
    respectively, was used by Ships and the remaining
    $60 million and $127 million, respectively, was
    recorded in miscellaneous other assets as restricted cash in the
    consolidated statements of financial position in Part II,
    Item 8. Repayment of the bonds is guaranteed by the company.

As part of the share repurchase programs the company has entered
    into four separate accelerated share repurchase agreements since
    November 2005, with two different banks (the Banks) to
    repurchase shares of common stock. In each case, shares were
    immediately borrowed by the Banks that were then sold to and
    canceled by the company. Subsequently, shares were purchased in
    the open market by the Banks to settle their share borrowings.
    The cost of the company’s share repurchases was subject to
    adjustment based on the actual cost of the shares subsequently
    purchased by the Banks. If an additional amount is owed by the
    company upon settlement, the price adjustment could have been
    settled, at the company’s option, in cash or in shares of
    common stock.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

The company retires its common stock upon repurchase and has not
    made any purchases of common stock other than in connection with
    these publicly announced repurchase programs.

As of December 31, 2007, the company has authorized
    $2.5 billion for share repurchases.

Credit
    Ratings

The company’s credit ratings at December 31, 2007, are
    summarized below:

Standard &

Fitch

Moody’s

Poors

Long-term: Northrop Grumman

BBB+

Baa1

BBB+

In June 2007, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded its
    ratings on debt securities issued by the company. The long term
    rating was changed to Baa1 from Baa2. In December 2007, Fitch
    revised its outlook on the company to stable from positive.

Credit
    Facility

In August of 2005, the company entered into a credit agreement
    which provides for a five-year revolving credit facility in an
    aggregate principal amount of $2 billion. The credit
    facility permits the company to request additional lending
    commitments from the lenders under the agreement or other
    eligible lenders under certain circumstances, and thereby
    increase the aggregate principal amount of the lending
    commitments under the agreement by up to an additional
    $500 million. The agreement provides for swingline loans
    and letters of credit as sub-facilities for the credit
    facilities provided for in the agreement. Borrowings under the
    credit facility bear interest at various rates, including the
    London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), adjusted based on the
    company’s credit rating, or an alternate base rate plus an
    incremental margin. The credit facility also requires a facility
    fee based on the daily aggregate amount of commitments (whether
    or not utilized) and the company’s credit rating level. The
    company’s credit agreement contains certain financial
    covenants relating to a maximum debt to capitalization ratio,
    and certain restrictions on additional asset liens, unless
    permitted by the agreement. As of December 31, 2007, the
    company was in compliance with all covenants. In August of 2007,
    the company entered into an amended and restated credit
    agreement amending the company’s 2005 credit agreement.

Concurrent with the effectiveness of the 2005 credit agreement,
    the prior revolving credit agreement, for $2.5 billion, was
    terminated. No principal or interest was outstanding or accrued
    and unpaid under the prior agreement on its termination date.

In August of 2007, the company entered into an amended and
    restated credit agreement amending the company’s 2005
    credit agreement. The agreement extends the maturity date of the
    credit facility from August 5, 2010 to August 10, 2012
    and provides improved pricing terms, reduced facility fees, and
    full availability of the facility for letters of credit. At
    December 31, 2007, and 2006, there was no balance
    outstanding under this facility. There was a maximum of
    $350 million borrowed under this facility during 2007 and
    no borrowings during 2006.

Mandatorily
    Redeemable Series B Convertible Preferred Stock

The company issued 3.5 million shares of mandatorily
    redeemable Series B convertible preferred stock in April
    2001. Each share of Series B preferred stock has a
    liquidation value of $100 per share. The liquidation value, plus
    accrued but unpaid dividends, is payable on April 4, 2021,
    the mandatory redemption date. The company has the option to
    redeem all, but not less than all, of the shares of
    Series B preferred stock at any time after seven years from
    the date of issuance for a number of shares of the
    company’s common stock equal to the liquidation value plus
    accrued and unpaid dividends divided by the current market price
    of common stock determined in relation to the date of
    redemption. Under this option, had the redemption taken place at
    December 31, 2007, each share would have been converted
    into 1.261 shares of common stock. Each share of preferred
    stock is convertible, at any time, at the option of the holder
    into the right to receive shares of the company’s common
    stock. Initially, each share was convertible into
    .911 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment in the
    event of certain dividends and distributions, a stock split, a
    merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of the

-52-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

company’s assets, a liquidation or distribution, and
    certain other events. Had the conversion taken place at
    December 31, 2007, each share would have been converted
    into 1.822 shares of common stock. Holders of preferred
    stock are entitled to cumulative annual cash dividends of $7 per
    share, payable quarterly. Upon liquidation of the company, each
    share of preferred stock is entitled to a liquidation preference
    before any distribution may be made on the company’s common
    stock or any series of capital stock that is junior to the
    Series B preferred stock. In the event of a change in
    control of the company, holders of Series B preferred stock
    also have specified exchange rights into common stock of the
    company or into specified securities or property of another
    entity participating in the change in control transaction. As of
    December 31, 2007, 10 million shares of preferred
    stock are authorized, of which 3.5 million shares
    designated as Series B preferred are issued and
    outstanding. No other shares of preferred stock are issued and
    outstanding.

Subsequent Event

– On February 20, 2008,
    the company’s Board of Directors approved the redemption of
    the Series B convertible preferred stock on April 4,
    2008.

Other
    Sources and Uses of Capital

Additional Capital

– To provide for long-term
    liquidity, the company believes it can obtain additional
    capital, if necessary, from such sources as the public or
    private capital markets, the sale of assets, sale and leaseback
    of operating assets, and leasing rather than purchasing new
    assets. The company has an effective shelf registration on file
    with the Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the
    issuance of up to $2 billion in debt and equity securities.

Cash on hand at the beginning of the year plus cash generated
    from operations and cash available under credit lines are
    expected to be sufficient in 2008 to service debt, finance
    capital expansion projects, pay federal, foreign, and state
    income taxes, and continue paying dividends to shareholders. The
    company will continue to provide the productive capacity to
    perform its existing contracts, prepare for future contracts,
    and conduct research and development in the pursuit of
    developing opportunities. While these expenditures tend to limit
    short-term liquidity, they are made with the intention of
    improving the long-term growth and profitability of the company.

Financial Arrangements

– In the ordinary course
    of business, the company uses standby letters of credit and
    guarantees issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued by
    insurance companies principally to guarantee the performance on
    certain contracts and to support the company’s self-insured
    workers’ compensation plans. At December 31, 2007,
    there were $439 million of unused stand-by letters of
    credit, $148 million of bank guarantees, and
    $538 million of surety bonds outstanding.

In December 2006, the company guaranteed a $200 million
    loan made to Ships in connection with the Gulf Opportunity Zone
    Industrial Revenue Bonds. Under the loan agreement the company
    guaranteed repayment by Ships of the principal and interest to
    the Trustee. The company also guaranteed payment of the
    principal and interest by the Trustee to the underlying
    bondholders.

Co-Operative Agreements

– In 2003, Ships
    executed agreements with the states of Mississippi and Louisiana
    whereby Ships leases facility improvements and equipment from
    Mississippi and from a non-profit economic development
    corporation in Louisiana in exchange for certain commitments by
    Ships to these states. As of December 31, 2007, Ships has
    fully met its obligations under the Mississippi agreement and
    has met all but one requirement under the Louisiana agreement.
    Failure by Ships to meet the remaining Louisiana commitment
    would result in reimbursement by Ships to Louisiana in
    accordance with the agreement. As of December 31, 2007,
    Ships expects that the remaining commitment under the Louisiana
    agreement will be met based on its most recent business plan.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rates

– The company is exposed to
    market risk, primarily related to interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange rates. Financial instruments subject to
    interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt
    obligations, variable-rate short-term borrowings under the
    credit agreement, short-term investments, and long-term notes
    receivable. At December 31, 2007, substantially all
    outstanding borrowings were fixed-rate long-term debt
    obligations of which a significant portion are not callable
    until maturity. The company has a modest exposure to interest
    rate risk resulting from two interest rate swap agreements
    described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8. The company’s
    sensitivity to a 1 percent change in interest rates is tied
    to its $2 billion credit agreement, which had no balance
    outstanding at December 31, 2007 or 2006, and the
    aforementioned interest rate swap agreements. See Note 13
    to the consolidated financial statements in Part II,
    Item 8.

Derivatives

– The company does not hold or
    issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The
    company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage
    its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31,
    2007, and 2006, two interest rate swap agreements were in
    effect. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements
    in Part II, Item 8.

Foreign Currency

– The company enters into
    foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency
    exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and
    payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. At
    December 31, 2007, and 2006, the amount of foreign currency
    forward contracts outstanding was not material. The company does
    not consider the market risk exposure relating to foreign
    currency exchange to be material to the consolidated financial
    statements. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON THE
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Northrop Grumman Corporation

Los Angeles, California

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of
    financial position of Northrop Grumman Corporation and
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,
    2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of
    income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 2007. Our audits also included the
    financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
    Item 15. These financial statements and the financial
    statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    Northrop Grumman Corporation and subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
    schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
    financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted, effective January 1, 2007,
    a new accounting standard for income taxes. As discussed in
    Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the
    Company adopted, effective December 31, 2006, a new
    accounting standard for retirement benefits.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 20, 2008 expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

– Northrop Grumman
    Corporation and its subsidiaries (Northrop Grumman or the
    company) provide technologically advanced, innovative products,
    services, and solutions in information and services, aerospace,
    electronics, and shipbuilding. As prime contractor, principal
    subcontractor, partner, or preferred supplier, Northrop Grumman
    participates in many high-priority defense and non-defense
    technology programs in the U.S. and abroad. Northrop
    Grumman conducts most of its business with the
    U.S. Government, principally the Department of Defense
    (DoD). The company is therefore affected by, among other things,
    the federal budget process. The company also conducts business
    with local, state, and foreign governments and makes domestic
    and international commercial sales.

Principles of Consolidation

– The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of Northrop Grumman
    and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts, transactions,
    and profits among Northrop Grumman and its subsidiaries are
    eliminated in consolidation.

Accounting Estimates

– The company’s
    financial statements are in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
    The preparation thereof requires management to make estimates
    and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of
    the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates
    have been prepared on the basis of the most current and best
    available information and actual results could differ materially
    from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

– As a defense contractor
    engaging in long-term contracts, the majority of the
    company’s business is derived from long-term contracts for
    the construction of facilities, production of goods, and
    services provided to the federal government. In accounting for
    these contracts, the company extensively utilizes the
    cost-to-cost and the units-of-delivery measures of the
    percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Sales under
    cost-reimbursement contracts and construction-type contracts
    that provide for delivery at a low volume per year or a small
    number of units after a lengthy period of time over which a
    significant amount of costs have been incurred are accounted for
    using the cost-to-cost measure of the percentage-of-completion
    method of accounting. Under this method, sales, including
    estimated earned fees or profits, are recorded as costs are
    incurred. For most contracts, sales are calculated based on the
    percentage that total costs incurred bear to total estimated
    costs at completion. For certain contracts with large up-front
    purchases of material, sales are calculated based on the
    percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total
    estimated direct labor costs. Sales under construction-type
    contracts that provide for delivery at a high volume per year
    are accounted for using the units-of-delivery measure of the
    percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under this
    method, sales are recognized as deliveries are made to the
    customer generally using unit sales values in accordance with
    the contract terms. The company estimates profit as the
    difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated
    cost of a contract and recognizes that profit over the life of
    the contract based on deliveries. The company classifies
    contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending
    upon the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying
    contracts.

Certain contracts contain provisions for price redetermination
    or for cost

and/or

performance incentives. Such redetermined amounts or incentives
    are included in sales when the amounts can reasonably be
    determined and estimated. Amounts representing contract change
    orders, claims, requests for equitable adjustment, or
    limitations in funding are included in sales only when they can
    be reliably estimated and realization is probable. In the period
    in which it is determined that a loss will result from the
    performance of a contract, the entire amount of the estimated
    ultimate loss is charged against income. Loss provisions are
    first offset against costs that are included in inventories,
    with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities. Changes in
    estimates of contract sales, costs, and profits are recognized
    using the cumulative

catch-up

method of accounting. This method recognizes in the current
    period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior
    periods. Hence, the effect of the changes on future periods of
    contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimates
    had been the original

-69-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

estimates. A significant change in an estimate on one or more
    contracts could have a material adverse effect on the
    company’s consolidated financial position or results of
    operations.

Revenue under contracts to provide services to non-federal
    government customers are generally recognized when services are
    performed. Service contracts include operations and maintenance
    contracts, and outsourcing-type arrangements, primarily in the
    Information Technology segment. Revenue under such contracts is
    generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of
    contract performance, unless evidence suggests that the revenue
    is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different
    pattern. Costs incurred under these service contracts are
    expensed as incurred, except that direct and incremental

set-up

costs
    are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement.
    Operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate
    from period to period, particularly in the earlier phases of the
    contract.

Service contracts that include more than one type of product or
    service are accounted for under the provisions of Emerging
    Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue

No. 00-21 –

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.

Accordingly, for applicable arrangements, revenue
    recognition includes the proper identification of separate units
    of accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements
    based on relative fair values.

Research and Development –

Company-sponsored
    research and development activities primarily include
    independent research and development (IR&D) efforts related
    to government programs. IR&D expenses are included in
    general and administrative expenses and are generally allocated
    to U.S. Government contracts. Company-sponsored research
    and development expenses totaled $537 million,
    $572 million, and $536 million in 2007, 2006, and
    2005, respectively. Expenses for research and development
    sponsored by the customer are charged directly to the related
    contracts.

Product Warranty Costs –

The company provides
    certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of
    non-conforming items for a specified period of time. Most of the
    company’s product warranties are provided under government
    contracts, the costs of which are incorporated into contract
    pricing. Accrued product warranty costs of $80 million and
    $81 million were included in other current liabilities at
    December 31, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Environmental Costs

– Environmental liabilities
    are accrued when the company determines it is responsible for
    remediation costs and such amounts are reasonably estimable.
    When only a range of amounts is established and no amount within
    the range is more probable than another, the minimum amount in
    the range is recorded. Environmental liabilities are recorded on
    an undiscounted basis. At sites involving multiple parties, the
    company accrues environmental liabilities based upon its
    expected share of liability, taking into account the financial
    viability of other jointly liable parties. Environmental
    expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
    Capitalized expenditures relate to long-lived improvements in
    currently operating facilities. The company does not anticipate
    and record insurance recoveries before collection is probable.
    At December 31, 2007, and 2006, the company did not have
    any accrued receivables related to insurance reimbursements or
    recoveries for environmental matters.

Derivative Financial Instruments –

Derivative
    financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in
    the financial statements and measured at fair value. Changes in
    the fair value of derivative financial instruments that qualify
    and are designated as fair value hedges are required to be
    recorded in income from continuing operations, while changes in
    the fair value of derivative financial instruments that qualify
    and are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other
    comprehensive income. The company may use derivative financial
    instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk and to
    balance its fixed and variable rate long-term debt portfolio.
    The company does not use derivative financial instruments for
    trading purposes, nor does it use leveraged financial
    instruments. Credit risk related to derivative financial
    instruments is considered minimal and is managed by requiring
    high credit standards for its counterparties and periodic
    settlements.

The company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to
    manage foreign currency exchange risk related to receipts from
    customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign
    currencies. Gains and losses from such

-70-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

transactions are included as contract costs. At
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the amount of foreign currency
    forward contracts outstanding was not material.

The company enters into interest rate swap agreements to benefit
    from floating interest rates as an offset to the fixed-rate
    characteristic of certain of its long-term debt instruments. At
    December 31, 2007, two interest rate swap agreements were
    in effect and accounted for as fair value hedges designed to
    convert fixed rates to floating rates. These interest rate swaps
    each hedge a $200 million notional amount of
    U.S. dollar fixed-rate debt, and mature on October 15,
    2009, and February 15, 2011, respectively. Any changes in
    the fair value of the swaps are offset by an equal and opposite
    change in the fair value of the hedged item; therefore, there is
    no net impact to the company’s reported consolidated
    results of operations. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    aggregate net fair value of the swaps was not material. The
    company may also enter into interest rate swap agreements to
    offset the variable-rate characteristics of certain
    variable-rate term loans which may be outstanding from time to
    time under the company’s credit facility (see Note 13).

Other, net

– For 2006, Other, net primarily
    consisted of a pre-tax gain of $111 million related to the
    sale of the company’s remaining 9.7 million TRW
    Automotive (TRW Auto) shares. For 2005, Other, net primarily
    consisted of the sale of 7.3 million TRW Auto shares and
    approximately 3.4 million Endwave shares, which generated
    pre-tax gains of $70 million and $95 million,
    respectively.

Income Taxes

– Provisions for federal, foreign,
    state, and local income taxes are calculated on reported
    financial statement pre-tax income based on current tax law and
    include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from
    those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and
    liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently
    payable because certain items of income and expense are
    recognized in different time periods for financial reporting
    purposes than for income tax purposes. If a tax position does
    not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of
    penalties, the company recognizes an expense for the amount of
    the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed in the tax
    return of the company. The company recognizes interest accrued
    related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
    Penalties, if probable and reasonably estimable, are recognized
    as a component of income tax expense. State and local income and
    franchise tax provisions are allocable to contracts in process
    and, accordingly, are included in general and administrative
    expenses.

In accordance with the recognition standards established by
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No.
    (FIN) 48 –

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement 109

,
    the company makes a comprehensive review of its portfolio of
    uncertain tax positions regularly. In this regard, an uncertain
    tax position represents the company’s expected treatment of
    a tax position taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be
    taken in a future tax return or claim, that has not been
    reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial
    reporting purposes. Until these positions are sustained by the
    taxing authorities, the company has not recognized the tax
    benefits resulting from such positions and reports the tax
    effects as a liability for uncertain tax positions in its
    consolidated statements of financial position.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

– Cash and cash
    equivalents include interest-earning debt instruments that
    mature in three months or less from the date purchased.

Marketable Securities

– At December 31,
    2007, and 2006, substantially all of the company’s
    investments in marketable securities were classified as
    available-for-sale or trading. For available-for-sale
    securities, any unrealized gains and losses are reported as a
    separate component of shareholders’ equity. Unrealized
    gains and losses on trading securities are included in Other,
    net in the consolidated statements of income and were not
    material to any period presented. The fair values of these
    marketable securities are determined based on prevailing market
    prices.

Accounts Receivable

– Accounts receivable
    include amounts billed and currently due from customers, amounts
    currently due but unbilled (primarily related to contracts
    accounted for under the cost-to-cost measure of the
    percentage-of-completion method of accounting), certain
    estimated contract changes, claims or requests for

-71-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

equitable adjustment in negotiation that are probable of
    recovery, and amounts retained by the customer pending contract
    completion.

Inventoried Costs

– Inventoried costs primarily
    relate to work in process under fixed-price, units-of-delivery
    contracts. These costs represent accumulated contract costs less
    the portion of such costs allocated to delivered items.
    Accumulated contract costs include direct production costs,
    factory and engineering overhead, production tooling costs, and,
    for government contracts, allowable general and administrative
    expenses. The ratio of inventoried general and administrative
    expenses to total inventoried costs is estimated to be the same
    as the ratio of total general and administrative expenses
    incurred to total contract costs incurred. According to the
    provisions of U.S. Government contracts, the customer
    asserts title to, or a security interest in, inventories related
    to such contracts as a result of contract advances,
    performance-based payments, and progress payments. General
    corporate expenses and IR&D allocable to commercial
    contracts are expensed as incurred. In accordance with industry
    practice, inventoried costs are classified as a current asset
    and include amounts related to contracts having production
    cycles longer than one year. Product inventory primarily
    consists of raw materials and is stated at the lower of cost or
    market, generally using the average cost method.

Outsourcing Contract Costs

– Costs on
    outsourcing contracts, including costs incurred for bid and
    proposal activities, are generally expensed as incurred.
    However, certain costs incurred upon initiation of an
    outsourcing contract are deferred and expensed over the contract
    life. These costs represent incremental external costs or
    certain specific internal costs that are directly related to the
    contract acquisition and transition/set-up. The primary types of
    costs that may be capitalized include labor and related fringe
    benefits, subcontractor costs, and travel costs.

Depreciable Properties

– Property, plant, and
    equipment owned by the company are depreciated over the
    estimated useful lives of individual assets. Costs incurred for
    computer software developed or obtained for internal use are
    capitalized and classified in machinery and other equipment.
    Most of these assets are depreciated using declining-balance
    methods, with the remainder using the straight-line method, with
    the following lives:

Years

Land improvements

2-45

Buildings and improvements

2-45

Machinery and other equipment

2-25

Capitalized software costs

3-5

Leasehold improvements

Length of lease

Restricted Cash

– Access to proceeds from the
    Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue Bonds (see
    Note 13) is restricted to certain capital
    expenditures. As such, the amount of unexpended proceeds
    available is recorded in miscellaneous other assets as
    restricted cash in the consolidated statements of financial
    position.

Leases

– The company uses its incremental
    borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification as
    capital or operating and defines the initial lease term to
    include renewal options determined to be reasonably assured. The
    company conducts operations primarily under operating leases.

Most lease agreements contain incentives for tenant
    improvements, rent holidays, or rent escalation clauses. For
    incentives for tenant improvements, the company records a
    deferred rent liability and amortizes the deferred rent over the
    term of the lease as a reduction to rent expense. For rent
    holidays and rent escalation clauses during the lease term, the
    company records minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis
    over the term of the lease. For purposes of recognizing lease
    incentives, the company uses the date of initial possession as
    the commencement date, which is generally when the company is
    given the right of access to the space and begins to make
    improvements in preparation of intended use.

Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangible
    Assets

– The company performs impairment tests for
    goodwill as of November 30th of each year, or when
    evidence of potential impairment exists. When it is determined
    that

-72-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

impairment has occurred, a charge to operations is recorded.
    Goodwill and other purchased intangible asset balances are
    included in the identifiable assets of the business segment to
    which they have been assigned. Any goodwill impairment, as well
    as the amortization of other purchased intangible assets, is
    charged against the respective business segments’ operating
    margin. Purchased intangible assets are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.

Self-Insurance Accruals

– Included in other
    long-term liabilities is approximately $519 million and
    $485 million related to self-insured workers’
    compensation as of December 31, 2007, and 2006,
    respectively. The company estimates the required liability of
    such claims on a discounted basis utilizing actuarial methods
    based on various assumptions, which include, but are not limited
    to, the company’s historical loss experience and projected
    loss development factors.

Litigation, Commitments, and Contingencies

–
    Amounts associated with litigation, commitments, and
    contingencies are recorded as charges to earnings when
    management, after taking into consideration the facts and
    circumstances of each matter, including any settlement offers,
    has determined that it is probable that a liability has been
    incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

Retirement Benefits

– The company sponsors
    various pension plans covering substantially all employees. The
    company also provides postretirement benefit plans other than
    pensions, consisting principally of health care and life
    insurance benefits, to eligible retirees and qualifying
    dependents. The liabilities and annual income or expense of the
    company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans
    are determined using methodologies that involve several
    actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the
    discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return (based on the
    market-related value of assets), and medical trend (rate of
    growth for medical costs). The fair values of plan assets are
    determined based on prevailing market prices or estimated fair
    value for investments with no available quoted prices. Not all
    net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in net
    earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to
    production as product costs, and a portion remains in inventory
    at the end of a reporting period. The company’s funding
    policy for pension plans is to contribute, at a minimum, the
    statutorily required amount to an irrevocable trust.

Foreign Currency Translation

– For operations
    outside the U.S. that prepare financial statements in
    currencies other than the U.S. dollar, results of
    operations and cash flows are translated at average exchange
    rates during the period, and assets and liabilities are
    generally translated at end-of-period exchange rates.
    Translation adjustments are not material and are included as a
    separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in
    consolidated shareholders’ equity.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

– The
    components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are as
    follows:

Financial Statement Reclassification

    have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation of
    the Interconnect Technologies (ITD) businesses, formerly
    reported in the Electronics segment, as discontinued operations
    (see Note 5) and the business operation realignments
    as of January 1, 2007 (see Note 6).

NEW
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

There have been no changes in the company’s critical
    accounting policies during 2007, except for a change in the
    measurement and recording of uncertain tax positions in
    accordance with FIN 48. The expanded disclosure
    requirements of FIN 48 are presented in Note 12 to the
    consolidated financial statements.

In January 2008, the FASB issued Statement 133 Implementation
    Issue No. E23 –

Issues Involving the
    Application of the Shortcut Method under Paragraph 68

.
    This implementation issue amends the accounting and reporting
    standards of paragraph 68 of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133 –

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

to permit use of the shortcut method for (1) swaps that
    have a nonzero fair value at inception, provided that the
    nonzero fair value at inception is attributable solely to a
    bid-ask spread; and (2) hedged items that have a settlement
    date after the swap trade date. This implementation issue is
    effective for hedging relationships designated on or after
    January 1, 2008, although adoption requires reconsideration
    of existing fair value hedges accounted for using the short-cut
    method at the date of adoption. Management is currently
    evaluating the effect that adoption of this implementation issue
    will have on the company’s consolidated financial position
    and results of operations upon adoption in 2008.

In December 2007, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 141(R) –

Business
    Combinations

. SFAS No. 141(R) expands the
    definition of a business, thus increasing the number of
    transactions that will qualify as business combinations.
    SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquirer to recognize
    100 percent of an acquired business’ assets and
    liabilities, including goodwill and certain contingent assets
    and liabilities, at their fair values at the acquisition date.
    Contingent consideration will be recognized at fair value on the
    acquisition date, with changes in fair value recognized in
    earnings until settled. Likewise, changes in acquired tax
    contingencies, including those existing at the date of adoption,
    will be recognized in earnings if outside the maximum allocation
    period (generally one year). Transaction-related expenses and
    restructuring costs will be expensed as incurred, and any
    adjustments to finalize the purchase accounting allocations,
    even within the allocation period, will be shown as revised in
    the future financial statements to reflect the adjustments as if
    they had been recorded on the acquisition date. Finally, a gain
    could result in the event of a bargain purchase (acquisition of
    a business below the fair market value of the assets and
    liabilities), or a gain or loss in the case of a change in the
    control of an existing investment. SFAS No. 141(R)
    will be applied prospectively to business combinations with
    acquisition dates on or after January 1, 2009. Adoption is
    not expected to materially impact the company’s
    consolidated financial position or results of operations
    directly when it becomes effective in 2009, as the only impact
    that the standard will have on recorded amounts at that time is
    that related to disposition of uncertain tax positions related
    to prior acquisitions. Following the date of adoption of the
    standard, the resolution of such items at values that differ
    from recorded amounts will be adjusted through earnings, rather
    than through goodwill. Adoption of this statement is, however,
    expected to have a significant effect on how acquisition
    transactions subsequent to January 1, 2009 are reflected in
    the financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 160 –

Noncontrolling Interests
    in Consolidated Financial Statements

–

an
    amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51.

SFAS No. 160 requires (1) presentation of
    ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than
    the parent within equity in the consolidated statements of
    financial position, but separately from the parent’s
    equity; (2) separate presentation of the consolidated net
    income attributable to the parent and to the minority interest
    on the face of the consolidated statements of income;
    (3) accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership
    interest where the parent retains its controlling financial
    interest in its subsidiary as equity transactions;
    (4) initial measurement of the noncontrolling interest
    retained for any deconsolidated subsidiaries at fair value with
    recognition of any resulting gains or losses through earnings;
    and (5) additional disclosures that identify and
    distinguish between the interests of the parent and
    noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 is effective for
    the company beginning January 1, 2009. Adoption of this
    statement is not expected to have a material impact on the
    company’s consolidated financial position and results of
    operations when it becomes effective in 2009, but will
    significantly affect the accounting for noncontrolling (or
    minority) interests from that date forward.

In December 2007, the EITF issued EITF Issue

No. 07-1 –

Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements

. Issue

No. 07-1

defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting and
    disclosure requirements for transactions between participants in
    a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the
    arrangement and third parties. EITF Issue

No. 07-1

is effective for the company beginning January 1, 2009.
    Management is currently evaluating the effect that adoption of
    this issue will have on the company’s consolidated
    financial position and results of operations when it becomes
    effective in 2009.

In September 2006, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 157 –

Fair Value
    Measurements

, which defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for consistently measuring fair value under generally
    accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about
    fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff
    Position (FSP)

FAS 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

, which
    defers the implementation for the non-recurring nonfinancial
    assets and liabilities from fiscal years beginning after
    November 15 , 2007 to fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2008. The provisions of SFAS No. 157
    will be applied prospectively. The statement provisions
    effective as of January 1, 2008, do not have a material
    effect on the company’s consolidated financial position and
    results of operations. Management does not believe that the
    remaining provisions will have a material effect on the
    company’s consolidated financial position and results of
    operations when they become effective on January 1,
    2009.

COMMON
    STOCK DIVIDENDS

On February 21, 2007, the company’s Board of Directors
    approved a 23 percent increase to the quarterly common
    stock dividends, from $.30 per share to $.37 per share,
    effective with the first quarter 2007 dividends.

On May 17, 2006, the company’s Board of Directors
    approved a 15 percent increase to the quarterly common
    stock dividends, from $.26 per share to $.30 per share,
    effective with the second quarter 2006 dividends.

On March 23, 2005, the company’s Board of Directors
    approved a 13 percent increase to the quarterly common
    stock dividends, from $.23 per share to $.26 per share,
    effective with the second quarter 2005 dividends.

BUSINESS
    ACQUISITIONS


– In January 2007, the company acquired
    Essex Corporation (Essex) for approximately $590 million in
    cash, including estimated transaction costs of $15 million,
    and the assumption of debt totaling $23 million. Essex
    provides signal processing services and products, and advanced
    optoelectronic imaging for U.S. government intelligence and
    defense customers. The operating results of Essex are reported
    in the Mission Systems segment. The assets, liabilities, and
    results of operations of Essex were not material to the
    company’s consolidated financial position or results of
    operations, and thus pro-forma information is not presented.

In July 2007, the company and Science Applications International
    Corporation (SAIC) reorganized their joint venture AMSEC, LLC
    (AMSEC), by dividing AMSEC along customer and product lines.
    AMSEC is a full-service supplier that provides engineering,
    logistics and technical support services primarily to Navy ship
    and aviation programs. Under the reorganization plan, the
    company retained the ship engineering, logistics and technical
    service businesses under the AMSEC name (the AMSEC Businesses)
    and, in exchange, SAIC received the aviation, combat systems and
    strike force integration services businesses from AMSEC (the
    Divested Businesses). This reorganization was treated as a step
    acquisition for the acquisition of SAIC’s interests in the
    AMSEC Businesses, with the company recognizing a pre-tax gain of
    $23 million for the effective sale of its interests in the
    Divested Businesses. The operating results of the AMSEC
    Businesses and transaction gain have been reported in the Ships
    segment. Prior to the reorganization, the company accounted for
    AMSEC, LLC under the equity method. The assets, liabilities, and
    results of operations of the AMSEC Businesses were not material
    to the company’s consolidated financial position or results
    of operations, and thus pro-forma information is not presented.
    The consolidated financial statements reflect preliminary
    estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed and the related allocation of the purchase
    price for the entities acquired. Management does not expect
    adjustments to these estimates, if any, to have a material
    effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or
    results of operations.

-75-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

During the third quarter of 2007, the company acquired Xinetics
    Inc., reported in the Space Technology segment, and the
    remaining 61 percent of Scaled Composites, LLC, reported in
    the Integrated Systems segment, for an aggregate amount of
    approximately $100 million in cash. The assets,
    liabilities, and results of operations of these entities were
    not material to the company’s consolidated financial
    position or results of operations, and thus pro-forma
    information is not presented. The consolidated financial
    statements reflect preliminary estimates of the fair value of
    the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the related
    allocation of the purchase price for the entities acquired.
    Management does not expect adjustments to these estimates, if
    any, to have a material effect on the company’s
    consolidated financial position or results of operations.


– There were no significant acquisitions
    during 2006.


– The company acquired Confluent RF
    Systems Corporation, reported in the Integrated Systems segment,
    for $42 million in cash, which included transaction costs
    of $2 million, and Integic Corporation, reported in the
    Information Technology segment, for $319 million in cash,
    which included transaction costs of $6 million.

BUSINESS
    DISPOSITIONS


– During the second quarter, management
    announced its decision to exit the remaining ITD business
    reported within the Electronics segment. Sales for this business
    for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, were
    $14 million, $35 million, and $89 million,
    respectively. The shut-down was completed during the third
    quarter of 2007 and costs associated with the shutdown were not
    material. The results of this business are reported as
    discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of
    income, net of applicable income taxes, for all periods
    presented.


– The company sold the assembly business
    unit of ITD during the first quarter of 2006 and Winchester
    Electronics (Winchester) during the second quarter of 2006 for
    net cash proceeds of $26 million and $17 million,
    respectively, and recognized after-tax gains of $4 million
    and $2 million, respectively, in discontinued operations.
    The results of operations of the assembly business unit of ITD
    are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated
    statements of income, net of applicable income taxes. The
    results of operations of Winchester, reported in the Electronics
    segment, were not material to any of the periods presented and
    have therefore not been reclassified as discontinued operations.

During the second quarter of 2006, the Enterprise Information
    Technology business, formerly reported in the Information
    Technology segment, was shut down and costs associated with the
    exit activities were not material. The results of operations of
    this business are reported as discontinued operations in the
    consolidated statements of income, net of applicable income
    taxes.

2005 –

The company sold Teldix GmbH (Teldix)
    for $57 million in cash and recognized an after-tax gain of
    $14 million in discontinued operations. The results of
    operations of Teldix, reported in the Electronics segment, were
    not material to any of the periods presented and have therefore
    not been reclassified as discontinued operations.

    elements in the following tables, except for assets by segment.

Assets –

Substantially all of the
    company’s assets are located or maintained in the United
    States.

Realignments

– The company, from time to time,
    acquires or disposes of businesses, and realigns contracts,
    programs or business areas among and within its operating
    segments that possess similar customers, expertise, and
    capabilities. These realignments are designed to more fully
    leverage existing capabilities and enhance development and
    delivery of products and services. In January 2007, certain
    programs and business areas were transferred between Information
    Technology, Mission Systems, Space Technology, and Technical
    Services. The sales and segment operating margin in the
    following tables have been revised, where applicable, to reflect
    these realignments for all periods presented.

Subsequent Realignments

– In January 2008, the
    Newport News and Ship Systems sectors were realigned into a
    single segment called Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding to enable
    the company to more effectively utilize its shipbuilding assets
    and deploy its talented shipbuilders, processes, technologies,
    production facilities and planned capital investment to meet
    customer needs. This realignment had no impact on the
    company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations, cash flows, or segment reporting.

Also in January 2008, the company announced the transfer of
    certain programs and assets from the Mission Systems segment to
    the Space Technology segment, effective July 1, 2008. This
    transfer will allow Mission Systems to focus on the rapidly
    growing command, control, communications, computers,
    intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance business, and the
    missiles business will be an integrated element of the
    company’s Aerospace business growth strategy. In addition,
    certain Electronics businesses were transferred to Mission
    Systems effective January 2008. The transfer of these businesses
    is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows.

These subsequent realignments have not been reflected in any of
    the accompanying financial information.

– Unallocated expenses
    includes the portion of corporate expenses not considered

    other expenses.

Net Pension Adjustment –

The net pension
    adjustment reflects the difference between pension expense
    determined in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America and pension expense
    allocated to the operating segments determined in accordance
    with CAS.

EARNINGS
    PER SHARE

Basic Earnings Per Share

– Basic earnings per
    share from continuing operations are calculated by dividing
    income from continuing operations available to common
    shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common
    stock outstanding during each period.

Diluted Earnings Per Share

– Diluted earnings
    per share include the dilutive effect of stock options and other
    stock awards granted to employees under stock-based compensation
    plans, and for 2007 and 2006, 6.4 million dilutive shares
    from the company’s mandatorily redeemable convertible
    series B preferred stock (Note 14). The dilutive
    effect of these potential common stock instruments totaled
    12.6 million, 12.9 million, and 6.7 million
    shares for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and
    2005, respectively. The weighted-average diluted shares
    outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006,
    and 2005, exclude stock options to purchase approximately 59
    thousand shares, 8 thousand shares, and 4 million shares,
    respectively, because such options have an exercise price in
    excess of the average market price of the company’s common
    stock during the year.

As part of the share repurchase programs, the company has
    entered into four separate accelerated share repurchase
    agreements since November 2005, with two different banks (the
    Banks) to repurchase shares of common stock. In each case,
    shares were immediately borrowed by the Banks that were then
    sold to and canceled by the company. Subsequently, shares were
    purchased in the open market by the Banks to settle their share
    borrowings. Under these arrangements, the cost of the
    company’s share repurchases was subject to adjustment based
    on the actual cost of the shares subsequently purchased by the
    Banks. If an additional amount was owed by the company upon
    settlement, the price adjustment could have been settled, at the
    company’s option, in cash or in shares of common stock.

    RECEIVABLE, NET

Unbilled amounts represent sales for which billings have not
    been presented to customers at year-end. These amounts are
    usually billed and collected within one year. Progress payments
    are received on a number of fixed-price contracts.

Accounts receivable at December 31, 2007, are expected to
    be collected in 2008, except for approximately $262 million
    due in 2009 and $118 million due in 2010 and later.

Allowances for doubtful amounts mainly represent estimates of
    overhead costs which may not be successfully negotiated and
    collected.

GOODWILL
    AND OTHER PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill

Goodwill and other purchased intangible assets are included in
    the identifiable assets of the segment to which they have been
    assigned. Impairment tests are performed at least annually and
    more often as circumstances require. Any goodwill impairment, as
    well as the amortization of other purchased intangible assets,
    is charged against the respective segment’s operating
    margin. The annual impairment test for all segments was
    performed as of November 30, 2007, with no indication of
    impairment. In performing the goodwill impairment tests, the
    company uses a discounted cash flow approach corroborated by
    comparative market multiples, where appropriate, to determine
    the fair value of reporting units.

The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill during 2007 and
    2006, are as follows:

Segment Realignment

– Effective in January
    2007, the Software Defined Radios business area was transferred
    from Space Technology to Mission Systems and Technical Services.
    As a result of this realignment, goodwill of approximately
    $380 million was reallocated among these three segments.
    Effective January 1, 2006, the company realigned businesses
    among four of its operating segments to form a new segment. As a
    result of this realignment, goodwill of approximately
    $792 million was reallocated among these five segments.

Fair Value Adjustments to Net Assets Acquired

–
    For 2007, the fair value adjustments were primarily due to the
    favorable settlement of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audits
    and a claim for a tax refund. For 2006, the fair value
    adjustments were primarily due to the favorable settlement of
    IRS audits and the realization of additional capital loss
    carryforward tax assets.

    Additionally, the company has policies with split dollar
    arrangements which are recorded at the lesser of their cash
    surrender value or premiums paid. The amounts associated with
    these policies are recorded in miscellaneous other assets in the
    consolidated statements of financial position.

Long-Term Debt

– The fair value of the
    long-term debt was calculated based on interest rates available
    for debt with terms and due dates similar to the company’s
    existing debt arrangements.

Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock

– The
    fair value of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock was
    calculated based on the closing market price quoted on the New
    York Stock Exchange at December 31, 2007, and 2006,
    respectively.

Interest Rate Swaps –

The company has from time
    to time entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate
    interest rate risk. As described in Note 1, two interest
    rate swap agreements were in effect at December 31, 2007,
    and 2006.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts –

The
    company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to manage
    foreign currency exchange risk related to receipts from
    customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign
    currencies. Gains and losses from such transactions are included
    as contract costs.

INCOME
    TAXES

The company’s effective tax rates on income from continuing
    operations were 33 percent, 31 percent, and
    32 percent for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006, and 2005, respectively. During 2007, the company reached a
    partial settlement agreement with the IRS regarding its audit of
    the company’s tax years ended December 31, 2001
    through 2003 (see below). During 2006, the company reached final
    approval with the IRS regarding its audit of the company’s
    B-2 program for the years ended December 31, 1997 through
    December 31, 2000. As a result, during 2007 and 2006, the
    company recognized net tax benefits of $22 and $48 million,
    respectively, due to the reversal of previously established
    expense provisions. The company also recognized a net tax
    benefit of $18 million in 2006 related to tax credits
    associated with qualified wages paid to employees affected by
    Hurricane Katrina.

Uncertain Tax Positions

– The company adopted
    the provisions of FIN 48 in 2007. As a result of the
    implementation of FIN 48, the company made a comprehensive
    review of its portfolio of uncertain tax positions in accordance
    with recognition standards established by FIN 48. In this
    regard, an uncertain tax position represents the company’s
    expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax
    return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim,
    that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for
    financial reporting purposes. Until these positions are
    sustained by the taxing authorities, the company has not
    recognized the tax benefits resulting from such positions and
    reports the tax effects as a liability for uncertain tax
    positions in its consolidated statements of financial position.
    The company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized
    tax benefits in income tax expense. Penalties, if probable and
    reasonably estimable, are recognized as a component of income
    tax expense.

As a result of this review, the company adjusted the estimated
    value of its uncertain tax positions on January 1, 2007, by
    recognizing additional liabilities totaling $66 million
    through a charge to retained earnings, and reducing the carrying
    value of uncertain tax positions resulting from prior
    acquisitions by $63 million through a reduction of
    goodwill. Upon the adoption of FIN 48 at January 1,
    2007, the estimated value of the company’s uncertain tax
    positions was a liability of $514 million, which includes
    accrued interest of $55 million. If the company’s
    positions are sustained by the taxing authority in favor of the
    company, approximately $331 million would be treated as a
    reduction of goodwill, and the balance of $183 million
    would reduce the company’s effective tax rate.

As of December 31, 2007, the estimated value of the
    company’s uncertain tax positions was a liability of
    $554 million, which includes accrued interest of
    $68 million. If the company’s positions are sustained
    by the taxing authority in favor of the company, approximately
    $394 million would be treated as a reduction of goodwill,
    and the balance of $160 million would reduce the
    company’s effective tax rate.

The change in unrecognized tax benefits during 2007, excluding
    interest, is as follows:

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

In connection with the IRS examination of the company’s
    income tax returns for the years ended 2001 through 2003, the
    company reached a partial settlement agreement with the IRS at
    the examination level during 2007. In January 2008, the company
    reached a tentative partial settlement agreement with IRS
    Appeals on substantially all of the remaining issues for the
    audit of the years 2001 – 2003. This agreement is
    subject to review by the Congressional Joint Committee on
    Taxation (Joint Committee). Although the final outcome is not
    determinable until the Joint Committee completes its review,
    during 2008, it is reasonably possible that a reduction to
    unrecognized tax benefits of up to $59 million may occur,
    which could result in a reduction to tax expense of
    $10 million. Also as part of the tentative partial
    agreement, the company anticipates that the net capital loss
    carryforward benefit will be reduced by $346 million.

In addition, pursuant to the company’s merger with TRW in
    December 2002, the company is liable for tax deficiencies of TRW
    and its subsidiaries prior to the merger. The IRS examined the
    TRW income tax returns for the years ended 1999 through the date
    of the merger and asserted tax deficiencies for those years to
    which the company took exception. The 1999 through 2002 TRW
    audit deficiencies are currently under consideration at IRS
    Appeals. In January 2008 the company and the IRS reached a
    tentative agreement with respect to the proposed tax
    deficiencies. Although the final outcome is not determinable
    until the Joint Committee completes its review, during 2008 it
    is reasonably possible that a reduction to unrecognized tax
    benefits of up to $82 million may occur, all of which would
    result in a reduction to goodwill.

The company’s federal tax returns for the years 2004
    through 2006 are currently under examination by the IRS. In
    addition, open tax years related to state and foreign
    jurisdictions remain subject to examination but are not
    considered material.

Although the company believes it has adequately provided for all
    tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be
    greater than the company’s accrued position. Accordingly,
    additional provisions on federal, foreign and state tax related
    matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are
    made or the underlying matters are effectively settled or
    otherwise resolved.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the company
    recorded approximately $14 million for tax-related interest
    and penalties.

Deferred Income Taxes

– Deferred income taxes
    reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
    carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
    reporting purposes and tax purposes. Such amounts are classified
    in the consolidated statements of financial position as current
    or noncurrent assets or liabilities based upon the
    classification of the related assets and liabilities.

Foreign Income –

Deferred income taxes have not
    been provided on accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign
    subsidiaries of $358 million at December 31, 2007, as
    the company intends to permanently reinvest these earnings,
    thereby indefinitely postponing their remittance. Should these
    earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise,
    the distributions would be subject to U.S. federal income
    tax at the statutory rate of 35 percent, less foreign tax
    credits applicable to such distributions, if any. In addition,
    such distributions would be subject to withholding taxes in the
    various tax jurisdictions.

Tax Carryforwards –

The company has a capital
    loss tax carryforward at December 31, 2007, against which a
    full valuation allowance has been recorded. The majority of the
    capital loss carryforward, which primarily arose from the sale
    of TRW Auto, will expire in 2008. In connection with the partial
    settlement agreement reached during 2007 for the tax return
    years ended 2001 through 2003, the capital loss carryforward and
    related valuation allowance decreased by $528 million
    during 2007. Future reductions to the valuation allowance
    resulting from the recognition of tax benefits, if any, will
    reduce goodwill. During 2007, foreign income tax credit
    carryforward

-89-

items of $180 million were utilized and, as a result, the
    foreign tax credit carryforward and the associated valuation
    allowance were reversed.

NOTES PAYABLE
    TO BANKS AND LONG-TERM DEBT

Lines of Credit

– The company has available
    short-term credit lines in the form of money market facilities
    with several banks. The amount and conditions for borrowing
    under these credit lines depend on the availability and terms
    prevailing in the marketplace. No fees or compensating balances
    are required for these credit facilities.

Credit Facility

– In August of 2005, the
    company entered into a credit agreement which provides for a
    five-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal
    amount of $2 billion. The credit facility permits the
    company to request additional lending commitments from the
    lenders under the agreement or other eligible lenders under
    certain circumstances, and thereby increase the aggregate
    principal amount of the lending commitments under the agreement
    by up to an additional $500 million. The agreement provides
    for swingline loans and letters of credit as sub-facilities for
    the credit facilities provided for in the agreement. Borrowings
    under the credit facility bear interest at various rates,
    including the London Interbank Offered Rate, adjusted based on
    the company’s credit rating, or an alternate base rate plus
    an incremental margin. The credit facility also requires a
    facility fee based on the daily aggregate amount of commitments
    (whether or not utilized) and the company’s credit rating
    level. The company’s credit agreement contains certain
    financial covenants relating to a maximum debt to capitalization
    ratio, and certain restrictions on additional asset liens,
    unless permitted by the agreement. In August of 2007, the
    company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement
    amending the company’s 2005 credit agreement. The agreement
    extends the maturity date of the credit facility from
    August 5, 2010 to August 10, 2012 and provides
    improved pricing terms, reduced facility fees, and full
    availability of the facility for letters of credit. At
    December 31, 2007, and 2006, there was no balance
    outstanding under this facility. There was a maximum of
    $350 million borrowed under this facility during 2007 and
    no borrowings during 2006. As of December 31, 2007, the
    company was in compliance with all covenants.

Concurrent with the effectiveness of the 2005 credit agreement,
    the prior credit agreement, for $2.5 billion, was
    terminated. No principal or interest was outstanding or accrued
    and unpaid under the prior credit agreement on its termination
    date.

Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue
    Bonds –

In December 2006, Ships entered into a
    loan agreement with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation
    (MBFC) under which Ships received access to $200 million
    from the issuance of Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial
    Development Revenue Bonds by the MBFC. The loan accrues interest
    payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 4.55 percent per
    annum. The company’s obligation related to these bonds is
    recorded in long-term debt in the consolidated statements of
    financial position. The bonds are subject to redemption at the
    company’s discretion on or after December 1, 2016, and
    will mature on December 1, 2028. The bond issuance proceeds
    must be used to finance the construction, reconstruction, and
    renovation of the company’s interest in certain ship
    manufacturing and repair facilities, or portions thereof,
    located in the state of Mississippi. As of December 31,
    2007 and 2006, approximately $140 million and
    $73 million, respectively, was used by Ships and the
    remaining $60 million and $127 million, respectively,
    was recorded in miscellaneous other assets as restricted cash in
    the consolidated statements of financial position. Repayment of
    the bonds is guaranteed by the company.

    accrued but unpaid dividends, is payable on April 4, 2021,
    the mandatory redemption date. The company has the option to
    redeem all, but not less than all, of the shares of
    Series B preferred stock at any time after seven years from
    the date of issuance for a number of shares of the
    company’s common stock equal to the liquidation value plus
    accrued and unpaid dividends divided by the current market price
    of common stock determined in relation to the date of
    redemption. Under this option, had the redemption taken place at
    December 31, 2007, each share would have been converted
    into 1.261 shares of common stock. Each share of preferred
    stock is convertible, at any time, at the option of the holder
    into the right to receive shares of the company’s common
    stock. Initially, each share was convertible into
    .911 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment in the
    event of certain dividends and distributions, a stock split, a
    merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of the
    company’s assets, a liquidation or distribution, and
    certain other events. Had the conversion taken place at
    December 31, 2007, each share would have been converted
    into 1.822 shares of common stock. Holders of preferred
    stock are entitled to cumulative annual cash dividends of $7 per
    share, payable quarterly. Upon liquidation of the company, each
    share of preferred stock is entitled to a liquidation preference
    before any distribution may be made on the company’s common
    stock or any series of capital stock that is junior to the
    Series B preferred stock. In the event of a change in
    control of the company, holders of Series B preferred stock

also have specified exchange rights into common stock of the
    company or into specified securities or property of another
    entity participating in the change in control transaction.

As of December 31, 2007, 10 million shares of
    preferred stock are authorized, of which 3.5 million shares
    designated as Series B preferred are issued and
    outstanding. No other shares of preferred stock are issued and
    outstanding.

Subsequent Event

– On February 20, 2008,
    the company’s Board of Directors approved the redemption of
    the Series B convertible preferred stock on April 4,
    2008.

LITIGATION

U.S. Government Investigations and
    Claims

– Departments and agencies of the
    U.S. Government have the authority to investigate various
    transactions and operations of the company, and the results of
    such investigations may lead to administrative, civil or
    criminal proceedings, the ultimate outcome of which could be
    fines, penalties, repayments or compensatory or treble damages.
    U.S. Government regulations provide that certain findings
    against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from
    future U.S. Government contracts or the loss of export
    privileges for a company or an operating division or
    subdivision. Suspension or debarment could have a material
    adverse effect on the company because of its reliance on
    government contracts.

As previously disclosed, in October 2005, the
    U.S. Department of Justice and a restricted
    U.S. Government customer apprised the company of potential
    substantial claims relating to certain microelectronic parts
    produced by the Space and Electronics Sector of former TRW Inc.,
    now a component of the company. The relationship, if any,
    between the potential claims and a civil False Claims Act case
    that remains under seal in the U.S. District Court for the
    Central District of California remains unclear to the company.
    In the third quarter of 2006, the parties commenced settlement
    discussions. While the company continues to believe that it did
    not breach the contracts in question and that it acted
    appropriately in this matter, the company proposed to settle the
    claims and any associated matters and recognized a pre-tax
    charge of $112.5 million in the third quarter of 2006 to
    cover the cost of the settlement proposal and associated
    investigative costs. The company extended the offer in an effort
    to avoid litigation and in recognition of the value of the
    relationship with this customer. The U.S. Government has
    not accepted the settlement offer and has advised the company
    that if settlement is not reached it will pursue its claims
    through litigation. Because of the highly technical nature of
    the issues involved and their restricted status and because of
    the significant disagreement between the company and the
    U.S. Government as to the U.S. Government’s
    theories of liability and damages (including a material
    difference between the U.S. Government’s damage
    theories and the company’s offer), final resolution of this
    matter could take a considerable amount of time, particularly if
    litigation should ensue. If the U.S. Government were to
    pursue litigation and were to be ultimately successful on its
    theories of liability and damages, which could be trebled under
    the Federal False Claims Act, the effect upon the company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash
    flows would materially exceed the amount provided by the
    company. Based upon the information available to the company to
    date, the company believes that it has substantive defenses but
    can give no assurance that its views will prevail. Accordingly,
    the ultimate disposition of this matter cannot presently be
    determined.

As previously disclosed, on May 17, 2007, the
    U.S. Coast Guard issued a revocation of acceptance under
    the Deepwater Program for eight converted 123-foot patrol boats
    (the vessels) based on alleged “hull buckling and shaft
    alignment problems.” By letter dated June 5, 2007, the
    Coast Guard stated that the revocation of acceptance also was
    based on alleged “nonconforming topside equipment” on
    the vessels. On August 13, 2007, the company submitted a
    response to the Coast Guard, maintaining that the revocation of
    acceptance was improper. In late December 2007, the Coast Guard
    responded to the company’s August submittal and advised
    Integrated Coast Guard Systems (the contractors’ joint
    venture for performing the Deepwater Program) that the Coast
    Guard is seeking $96.1 million from the Joint Venture as a
    result of the revocation of acceptance of the eight vessels
    delivered under the 123-foot conversion program. The majority of
    the costs associated with the 123-foot conversion effort are
    associated with the alleged structural deficiencies of the
    vessels which were converted under

-92-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

contracts with the company and with a subcontractor to the
    company. The letter is not a contracting officer’s final
    decision and the company and its joint venture partner and
    subcontractor are preparing a response. Based upon the
    information available to the company to date, the company
    believes that it has substantive defenses but can give no
    assurance that its views will prevail.

Based upon the available information regarding matters that are
    subject to U.S. Government investigations, other than as
    set out above, the company believes, but can give no assurance,
    that the outcome of any such matters would not have a material
    adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results
    of operations, or cash flows.

Litigation

– Various claims and legal
    proceedings arise in the ordinary course of business and are
    pending against the company and its properties. Based upon the
    information available, the company believes that the resolution
    of any of these various claims and legal proceedings would not
    have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows.

As previously disclosed, the company was a defendant in
    litigation brought by Cogent Systems, Inc. (Cogent) in Los
    Angeles Superior Court in California on April 20, 2005, for
    unspecified damages for alleged unauthorized use of Cogent
    technology relating to fingerprint recognition. On
    September 10, 2007, the company and Cogent announced that
    they had reached an agreement to settle the litigation and
    settlement documents were executed in the fourth quarter of
    2007. Under the terms of the agreement, the company agreed to
    pay Cogent $25 million to settle the litigation and
    $15 million for a non-exclusive license to use specified
    Cogent state-of-the-art automated fingerprint identification
    software in certain existing programs. Substantially all these
    amounts were charged to expense in 2007. The company and Cogent
    also agreed to enter into a five-year research and development,
    service and products agreement, under which the company must
    purchase from Cogent $20 million in new products and
    services over the term of the agreement.

As previously disclosed, the U.S. District Court for the
    Central District of California consolidated two separately filed
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) lawsuits, which
    the plaintiffs seek to have certified as class actions, into the
    In Re Northrop Grumman Corporation ERISA Litigation. On
    August 7, 2007, the Court denied plaintiffs’ motion
    for class certification, and the plaintiffs appealed the
    Court’s decision on class certification to the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On
    October 11, 2007, the Ninth Circuit granted appellate
    review, which delayed the commencement of trial previously
    scheduled to begin January 22, 2008. The company believes,
    but can give no assurance, that the outcome of these matters
    would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Insurance Recovery

– Property damage from
    Hurricane Katrina is covered by the company’s comprehensive
    property insurance program. The insurance provider for coverage
    of property damage losses over $500 million, Factory Mutual
    Insurance Company (FM Global), has advised management of a
    disagreement regarding coverage for certain losses above
    $500 million. As a result, the company has taken legal
    action against the insurance provider as the company believes
    that its insurance policies are enforceable and intends to
    pursue all of its available rights and remedies. In August 2007,
    the district court in which the litigation is pending issued an
    order finding that the excess insurance policy provided coverage
    for the company’s Katrina related loss. In November 2007,
    FM Global filed a notice of appeal of the district court’s
    order. Based on the current status of the assessment and claim
    process, no assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome of
    this matter.

Provisions for Legal & Investigative
    Matters

– Litigation accruals are recorded as
    charges to earnings when management, after taking into
    consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter,
    including any settlement offers, has determined that it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate resolution of
    any exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as
    further facts and circumstances become known.

16.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Contract Performance Contingencies

– Contract
    profit margins may include estimates of revenues not
    contractually agreed to between the customer and the company for
    matters such as contract changes, negotiated settlements,

-93-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

claims and requests for equitable adjustment for previously
    unanticipated contract costs. These estimates are based upon
    management’s best assessment of the underlying causal
    events and circumstances, and are included in determining
    contract profit margins to the extent of expected recovery based
    on contractual entitlements and the probability of successful
    negotiation with the customer. As of December 31, 2007, the
    amounts related to the aforementioned items are not material
    individually or in the aggregate.

In April 2007, the company was notified by the prime contractor
    on the Wedgetail contract under the Multirole Electronic Scanned
    Array (MESA) program that it anticipates the prime
    contractor’s delivery dates will be late and this could
    subject the prime contractor to liquidated damages from the
    customer. Should liquidated damages be assessed, the company
    would share in a proportionate amount of those damages to a
    maximum of approximately $40 million. As of
    December 31, 2007, the company has not been notified by the
    prime contractor as to any claim for liquidated damages. Until
    such time as additional information is available from the prime
    contractor, it is not possible to determine the impact to the
    consolidated financial statements, if any, for this matter.

Environmental Matters

– In accordance with
    company policy on environmental remediation, the estimated cost
    to complete remediation has been accrued where it is probable
    that the company will incur such costs in the future to address
    environmental impacts at currently or formerly owned or leased
    operating facilities, or at sites where it has been named a
    Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) by the Environmental
    Protection Agency, or similarly designated by other
    environmental agencies. To assess the potential impact on the
    company’s consolidated financial statements, management
    estimates the total reasonably possible remediation costs that
    could be incurred by the company, taking into account currently
    available facts on each site as well as the current state of
    technology and prior experience in remediating contaminated
    sites. These estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted to
    reflect changes in facts and technical and legal circumstances.
    Management estimates that as of December 31, 2007, the
    range of reasonably possible future costs for environmental
    remediation sites is $186 million to $285 million, of
    which $223 million is accrued in other current liabilities.
    Factors that could result in changes to the company’s
    estimates include: modification of planned remedial actions,
    increases or decreases in the estimated time required to
    remediate, discovery of more extensive contamination than
    anticipated, changes in laws and regulations affecting
    remediation requirements, and improvements in remediation
    technology. Should other PRPs not pay their allocable share of
    remediation costs, the company may have to incur costs in
    addition to those already estimated and accrued. Although
    management cannot predict whether new information gained as
    projects progress will materially affect the estimated liability
    accrued, management does not anticipate that future remediation
    expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the
    company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows.

Co-Operative Agreements

– In 2003, Ships
    executed agreements with the states of Mississippi and Louisiana
    whereby Ships leases facility improvements and equipment from
    Mississippi and from a non-profit economic development
    corporation in Louisiana in exchange for certain commitments by
    Ships to these states. As of December 31, 2007, Ships has
    fully met its obligations under the Mississippi agreement and
    has met all but one requirement under the Louisiana agreement.
    Failure by Ships to meet the remaining Louisiana commitment
    would result in reimbursement by Ships to Louisiana in
    accordance with the agreement. As of December 31, 2007,
    Ships expects that the remaining commitment under the Louisiana
    agreement will be met based on its most recent business plan.

Financial Arrangements

– In the ordinary course
    of business, the company uses standby letters of credit and
    guarantees issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued by
    insurance companies principally to guarantee the performance on
    certain contracts and to support the company’s self-insured
    workers’ compensation plans. At December 31, 2007,
    there were $439 million of unused stand-by letters of
    credit, $148 million of bank guarantees, and
    $538 million of surety bonds outstanding.

The company has also guaranteed a $200 million loan made to
    Ships in connection with the Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial
    Revenue Bonds issued in December 2006. Under the loan agreement
    the company guaranteed

-94-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Ships’ repayment of the principal and interest to the
    Trustee. The company also guaranteed payment of the principal
    and interest by the Trustee to the underlying bondholders. See
    Note 13.

Indemnifications

– The company has retained
    certain warranty, environmental, income tax, and other potential
    liabilities in connection with certain divestitures. The
    settlement of these liabilities is not expected to have a
    material effect on the company’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In May 2006, Goodrich Corporation (Goodrich) notified the
    company of its claims under indemnities assumed by the company
    in its December 2002 acquisition of TRW that related to the sale
    by TRW of its Aeronautical Systems business in October 2002.
    During the fourth quarter of 2007, the company reached a
    negotiated resolution with Goodrich and paid $18.5 million
    in complete release of these claims.

U.S. Government Claims

– During the second
    quarter of 2006, the U.S. Government advised the company of
    claims and penalties concerning certain potential disallowed
    costs. The parties are engaged in discussions to enable the
    company to evaluate the merits of these claims as well as to
    assess the amounts being claimed. The company does not believe,
    but can give no assurance, that the outcome of any such matters
    would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Operating Leases

– Rental expense for operating
    leases, excluding discontinued operations, was $585 million
    in 2007, $548 million in 2006, and $512 million in
    2005. These amounts are net of immaterial amounts of sublease
    rental income. Minimum rental commitments under long-term
    noncancellable operating leases as of December 31, 2007,
    total approximately $2.1 billion, which are payable as
    follows: 2008 – $445 million; 2009 –
    $368 million; 2010 – $293 million;
    2011 – $211 million; 2012 –
    $183 million; and thereafter – $565 million.

Related Party Transactions

– For all periods
    presented, the company had no material related party
    transactions.

17.

IMPACT
    FROM HURRICANE KATRINA

Background

– In August 2005, the company’s
    operations in the Gulf Coast area of the U.S. were
    significantly impacted by Hurricane Katrina and the
    company’s shipyards in Louisiana and Mississippi sustained
    significant windstorm damage from the hurricane. As a result of
    the storm, the company has incurred costs to replace or repair
    destroyed or damaged assets, suffered losses under its
    contracts, and incurred substantial costs to clean up and
    recover its operations. As of the date of the storm, the company
    had a comprehensive insurance program that provided coverage
    for, among other things, property damage, business interruption
    impact on net profitability (referred to in this discussion
    generally as “lost profits”), and costs associated
    with

clean-up

and
    recovery.

Insurance Coverage Summary

– The company’s
    property insurance program at the time of loss was established
    in two layers of coverage. The primary layer of coverage was
    provided by a syndicate of leading insurers (the Primary
    Insurers) and covered losses up to $500 million. The excess
    (second) layer of coverage was provided by FM Global (the
    Secondary Insurer). This excess layer reimburses the company for
    losses above $500 million up to the policy limit of
    approximately $20 billion. The company has had prior
    experience with damage from storms and similar events and has
    had success in obtaining recovery from its insurers for covered
    damages. Based on its prior experience with processing insurance
    claims, the company has a well-defined process for developing,
    analyzing and preparing its claims for insurance recovery.

Accounting for Insurance Recoveries

– The
    company makes various assessments and estimates in determining
    amounts to record as insurance recoveries, including
    ascertaining whether damages are covered by insurance and
    assessing the viability and financial well-being of its
    insurers. The company and its Primary Insurers reached an
    arrangement whereby the company submitted detailed requests for
    reimbursement of its

clean-up,

restoration and capital asset repair or replacement costs while
    its overall claim was in the process of being evaluated by the
    insurers. After such requests were reviewed, progress payments
    against the overall coverage limits were approved by the
    insurers. Based on prior experience with insurance recoveries,
    and in reliance on the acceptance by the

-95-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

insurers of the company’s claim reimbursement process, the
    company recognized a receivable from the Primary Insurers as
    costs were incurred, and offset this receivable with progress
    payments as received.

In accordance with U.S. government cost accounting
    regulations affecting the majority of the company’s
    contracts, the cost of insurance premiums for property damage
    and business interruption coverage, other than “coverage of
    profit,” is an allowable cost that may be charged to
    long-term contracts. Because the majority of long-term contracts
    at the shipyards are flexibly-priced, the government customer
    would benefit from the majority of insurance recoveries in
    excess of the net book value of damaged assets and the costs for

clean-up

and
    recovery. In a similar manner, losses on property damage that
    are not recovered through insurance are required to be included
    in the company’s overhead pools for allocation to long-term
    contracts under a systematic process. The company is currently
    in discussions with its government customers to determine an
    appropriate methodology to be used to account for these amounts
    for government contract purposes. The company anticipates that
    the ultimate outcome of such discussions will not have a
    material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.

The company has full entitlement to insurance recoveries related
    to lost profits; however, because of uncertainties concerning
    the ultimate determination of recoveries related to lost
    profits, in accordance with company policy no such amounts are
    recognized by the company until they are settled with the
    insurers. Furthermore, due to the uncertainties with respect to
    the company’s disagreement with the Secondary Insurer, no
    receivables have been recognized by the company in the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements for insurance
    recoveries from the Secondary Insurer.

Insurance Claim –

The company’s Hurricane
    Katrina insurance claim is continually being evaluated based on
    actions to date and an assessment of remaining recovery scope.
    The company updated its assessment during the fourth quarter of
    2007 and, as a result, the company’s aggregate claim for
    insurance recovery as a result of Hurricane Katrina is estimated
    to be $1.1 billion, consisting of

clean-up

and
    restoration costs of $278 million, property damages
    (including the value of destroyed assets not replaced) and other
    capital expenditures of $492 million and lost profits of
    $318 million. Certain amounts within the overall claim are
    still in the process of being finalized and the overall value of
    the claim may change from these amounts.

In June 2007, the company reached a final agreement with all but
    one of its Primary Insurers under which the insurers agreed to
    pay their policy limits (less the policy deductible and certain
    other minor costs). As a result of the agreement regarding the
    claims from the first layer of coverage, the company received a
    total insurance recovery for damages to the shipyards of
    $466 million reflecting policy limits less certain minor
    costs. The company is continuing to seek recovery of its claim
    from the remaining insurer in the first layer that did not
    participate in the agreement. As a result of the agreement, the
    company received final cash payments totaling $113 million
    in the second quarter of 2007, of which $62 million has
    been attributed to the recovery of lost profits and has been
    included as an adjustment to cost of sales in the Ships segment
    in the consolidated statement of income. Cumulative proceeds
    from the agreement have also been used to fund $126 million
    in capital expenditures for assets fully or partially damaged by
    the storm and $278 million in

clean-up

and
    restoration costs. Insurance recoveries received to date have
    enabled the company to recover the entire net book value of
    $98 million of assets totally or partially destroyed by the
    storm. To the extent that the company is unsuccessful in
    receiving the full value of its remaining claim relating to
    capital assets, the company will be responsible for funding the
    capital expenditures necessary to operate its shipyards. Through
    December 31, 2007, the company has incurred capital
    expenditures totaling $310 million related to assets
    damaged by Hurricane Katrina.

The company expects that its residual claim will be resolved
    separately with the remaining insurers in each of its two layers
    of coverage, and the company has pursued the resolution of its
    claim with that understanding. The Secondary Insurer has denied
    coverage for substantial portions of the company’s claim
    and the parties are presently in litigation to resolve this
    matter. In August 2007, the district court in which the
    litigation is pending issued an order finding that the excess
    insurance policy provided coverage for the company’s
    Katrina related loss. The Secondary Insurer has appealed that
    decision and that appeal is still pending (see Note 15).

RETIREMENT
    BENEFITS

Plan
    Descriptions

Pension Benefits

– The company sponsors several
    defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. covering
    approximately 95 percent of its employees. Pension benefits
    for most employees are based on the employee’s years of
    service and compensation. It is the policy of the company to
    fund at least the minimum amount required for all qualified
    plans, using actuarial cost methods and assumptions acceptable
    under U.S. Government regulations, by making payments into
    benefit trusts separate from the company. The pension benefit
    for most employees is based upon criteria whereby employees earn
    age and service points over their employment period. Ten of the
    company’s 21 domestic qualified plans, which cover
    approximately 60 percent of all employees, were in a
    legally defined full-funding limitation status at
    December 31, 2007.

Defined Contribution Plans

– The company also
    sponsors 401(k) defined contribution plans in which most
    employees are eligible to participate. Company contributions for
    most plans are based on a cash matching of employee
    contributions up to 4 percent of compensation. Certain
    hourly employees are covered under a target benefit plan. The
    company also participates in a multiemployer plan for certain of
    the company’s union employees. The company’s
    contributions to these plans for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, were $294 million,
    $266 million and $248 million, respectively.

Non-U.S. Benefit

Plans –

The company sponsors several benefit plans
    for

non-U.S. employees.

These plans are designed to provide benefits appropriate to
    local practice and in accordance with local regulations. Some of
    these plans are funded using benefit trusts separate from the
    company.

Medical and Life Benefits

– The company
    provides a portion of the costs for certain health care and life
    insurance benefits for a substantial number of its active and
    retired employees. Covered employees achieve eligibility to
    participate in these contributory plans upon retirement from
    active service if they meet specified age and years of service
    requirements. Qualifying dependents are also eligible for
    medical coverage. Approximately 65 percent of the
    company’s current retirees participate in the medical
    plans. The company reserves the right to amend or terminate the
    plans at any time. In November 2006, the company adopted plan
    amendments and communicated to plan participants that it would
    cap the amount of its contributions to substantially all of its
    remaining post retirement medical and life benefit plans that
    were previously not subject to limits on the company’s
    contributions.

In addition to a medical inflation cost-sharing feature, the
    plans also have provisions for deductibles, co-payments,
    coinsurance percentages, out-of-pocket limits, conformance to a
    schedule of reasonable fees, the use of managed care providers,
    and maintenance of benefits with other plans. The plans also
    provide for a Medicare carve-out, and a maximum lifetime benefit
    of $2 million per covered individual. Subsequent to
    January 1, 2005 (or earlier at some segments), newly hired
    employees are not eligible for post employment medical and life
    benefits.

The effect of the Medicare prescription drug subsidy from the
    Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
    2003 on the company’s net periodic postretirement benefit
    cost for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    was an increase of $3 million and a reduction of
    $26 million and $36 million, respectively. The
    reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
    as a result of the subsidy is $38 million and
    $76 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, based on the impact of the subsidy on the eligible
    plans.

The assumptions used for pension benefits are consistent with
    those used for retiree medical and life insurance benefits. The
    long-term rate of return on plan assets used for the medical and
    life benefits are reduced to allow for the impact of tax on
    expected returns as, unlike the pension trust, the earnings of
    certain VEBA trusts are taxable.

Through consultation with investment advisors, expected
    long-term returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset
    classes were developed. Several factors were considered,
    including survey of investment managers’ expectations,
    current market data such as yields/price-earnings ratios, and
    historical market returns over long periods. Using policy target
    allocation percentages and the asset class expected returns, a
    weighted-average expected return was calculated.

In 2007, the company changed the year to reach the ultimate
    trend rate from 2010 to 2012. Assumed health care trend rates
    have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health
    care plans. A one-percentage-point change in the initial through
    the ultimate health care cost trend rates would have the
    following effects:

Plan assets are invested in various asset classes that are
    expected to produce a sufficient level of diversification and
    investment return over the long term. The investment goals are
    (1) to exceed the assumed actuarial rate of return over the
    long term within reasonable and prudent levels of risk, and
    (2) to preserve the real purchasing power of assets to meet
    future obligations. Liability studies are conducted on a regular
    basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an
    objective to balance risk. Risk targets are established and
    monitored against acceptable ranges.

All investment policies and procedures are designed to ensure
    that the plans’ investments are in compliance with ERISA.
    Guidelines are established defining permitted investments within
    each asset class. Derivatives are used for transitioning assets,
    asset class rebalancing, managing currency risk, and for
    management of fixed income and alternative investments. The
    investment policies for most of the pension plans require that
    the asset allocation be maintained within the following ranges:

At December 31, 2007, and 2006, plan assets included
    investments with non-readily determinable fair values, comprised
    primarily of real estate, private equity investments, and hedge
    funds, totaling $4.1 billion and $2.7 billion,
    respectively. For these assets, estimates of fair value are
    determined using the best information available. At
    December 31, 2007, and 2006, the pension and health and
    welfare trusts did not hold any Northrop Grumman common stock.

In 2008, the company expects to contribute the required minimum
    funding level of approximately $121 million to its pension
    plans and approximately $201 million to its other
    postretirement benefit plans. During 2007 and 2006, the company
    made voluntary pension contributions of $200 million and
    $800 million, respectively.

It is not expected that any assets will be returned to the
    company from the benefit plans during 2008.

STOCK
    COMPENSATION PLANS

Plan
    Descriptions

At December 31, 2007, Northrop Grumman had stock-based
    compensation awards outstanding under the following plans: the
    2001 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan (2001 LTISP), the 1993
    Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan (1993 LTISP), both applicable to
    employees, and the 1993 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors
    (1993 SPND) and 1995 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (1995
    SPND) as amended. All of these plans were approved by the
    company’s shareholders. The company has historically issued
    new shares to satisfy award grants.

Employee Plans

– The 2001 LTISP and the 1993
    LTISP permit grants to key employees of three general types of
    stock incentive awards: Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights
    (SARs), and Stock Awards. Each Stock Option grant is made with
    an exercise price either at the closing price of the stock on
    the date of grant (market options) or at a premium over the
    closing price of the stock on the date of grant (premium
    options). Stock Options generally vest in 25 percent
    increments over four years from the grant date under the 2001
    LTISP and in years two to five under the 1993 LTISP, and grants
    outstanding expire ten years after the grant date. No SARs have
    been granted under either of the LTISPs. Stock Awards, in the
    form of restricted performance stock rights and restricted stock
    rights, are granted to key employees without payment to the
    company. Under the 2001 LTISP, recipients of restricted
    performance stock rights earn shares of stock, based on
    financial metrics determined by the Board of Directors in
    accordance with the plan. If the objectives have not been met at
    the end of the applicable performance period, up to
    100 percent of the original grant for the eight highest
    compensated employees and up to 70 percent of the original
    grant for all other recipients will be forfeited. If the
    financial metrics are met or exceeded during the performance
    period, all recipients can earn up to 150 percent of the
    original grant. Beginning in 2007, all members of the Corporate
    Policy Council could forfeit up to 100 percent of the
    original 2007 grant, and all recipients could earn up to
    200 percent of the original 2007 grant. Restricted stock
    rights issued under either plan generally vest after three
    years. Termination of employment can result in forfeiture of
    some or all of the benefits extended. Of the 50 million
    shares approved

-102-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

for issuance under the 2001 LTISP, approximately 17 million
    shares were available for future grants as of December 31,
    2007.

Non-Employee Plans

– Under the 1993 SPND, half
    of the retainer fee earned by each director must be deferred
    into a stock unit account. In addition, directors may defer
    payment of all or part of the remaining retainer fee, which is
    placed in a stock unit account until the conclusion of board
    service. The 1995 SPND provided for annual stock option grants.
    Effective June 1, 2005, no new grants have been issued from
    this plan. The 1995 SPND was amended in May 2007 to permit
    payment of the stock unit portion of the retainer fee described
    above. Each grant of stock options under the 1995 SPND was made
    at the closing market price on the date of the grant, was
    immediately exercisable, and expires ten years after the grant
    date. At December 31, 2007, approximately
    318,000 shares were available for future grants under the
    1995 SPND and 25,442 shares were available for future use
    under the 1993 SPND.

Adoption
    of New Standard

Prior to January 1, 2006, the company applied Accounting
    Principles Board Opinion No. 25 –

Accounting
    for Stock Issued to Employees

and related interpretations in
    accounting for awards made under the company’s stock-based
    compensation plans. Stock Options granted under the plans had an
    exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of the
    common stock on the date of the grant, and accordingly, no
    compensation expense was recognized. Stock Awards were valued at
    their fair market value measured at the date of grant, updated
    periodically using the mark-to-market method, and compensation
    expense was recognized over the vesting period of the award.

Effective January 1, 2006, the company adopted the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123R –

Share-Based
    Payment

(SFAS No. 123R), using the
    modified-prospective transition method. Under this transition
    method, compensation expense recognized during the year ended
    December 31, 2006, included: (a) compensation expense
    for all share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested
    as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
    SFAS No. 123 –

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

(SFAS No. 123), and
    (b) compensation expense for all share-based awards granted
    or modified on or after January 1, 2006, based on the grant
    date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123R. In accordance with the
    modified-prospective transition method, results for prior
    periods have not been restated. All of the company’s stock
    award plans are considered equity plans under
    SFAS No. 123R, and compensation expense recognized as
    previously described is net of estimated forfeitures of
    share-based awards over the vesting period. The effect of
    adopting SFAS No. 123R was not material to the
    company’s income from continuing operations and net income
    for the year ended December 31, 2006, and the cumulative
    effect of adoption using the modified-prospective transition
    method was similarly not material.

Compensation
    Expense

Total stock-based compensation for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, was $196 million,
    $202 million, and $180 million, respectively, of which
    $12 million, $11 million, and $4 million related
    to Stock Options and $184 million, $191 million, and
    $176 million related to Stock Awards, respectively. Tax
    benefits recognized in the consolidated statements of income for
    stock-based compensation during the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, were $77 million,
    $71 million, and $63 million, respectively. In
    addition, the company realized tax benefits of $60 million
    from the exercise of Stock Options and $78 million from the
    issuance of Stock Awards in 2007.

Effective January 1, 2006, compensation expense for
    restricted performance stock rights is estimated based on the
    grant date fair value and recognized over the vesting period.
    The fixed 30 percent minimum distribution portion for all
    but the eight highest compensated employees, and all but the
    Corporate Policy Council members for 2007 forward, is measured
    at the grant date fair value and the variable portion is
    adjusted to the expected distribution at the end of each
    accounting period. Compensation expense for restricted stock
    rights is measured at the grant date fair value and recognized
    over the vesting period.

-103-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Stock
    Options

The fair value of each of the company’s Stock Option awards
    is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the
    table below. The fair value of the company’s Stock Option
    awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting
    period of the options, which is generally four years. Expected
    volatility is based on an average of (1) historical
    volatility of the company’s stock and (2) implied
    volatility from traded options on the company’s stock. The
    risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the
    Stock Option award is based on the yield curve of a zero-coupon
    U.S. Treasury bond on the date the award is granted with a
    maturity equal to the expected term of the award. The company
    uses historical data to estimate forfeitures. The expected term
    of awards granted is derived from historical experience under
    the company’s stock-based compensation plans and represents
    the period of time that awards granted are expected to be
    outstanding.

The significant weighted-average assumptions relating to the
    valuation of the company’s Stock Options for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, was as follows:

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, was
    $153 million, $149 million, and $50 million,
    respectively. Intrinsic value is measured using the fair market
    value at the date of exercise (for options exercised) or at
    December 31, 2007 (for outstanding options), less the
    applicable exercise price.

Stock Awards

– Compensation expense for Stock
    Awards is measured at the grant date based on fair value and
    recognized over the vesting period. The fair value of Stock
    Awards is determined based on the closing market price of the
    company’s common stock on the grant date. For purposes of
    measuring compensation expense, the amount of shares ultimately
    expected to vest is estimated at each reporting date based on
    management’s expectations regarding the relevant
    performance criteria. In the table below, the share adjustment
    resulting from the final performance measure is considered
    granted in the period that the related grant is vested. During
    the year ended December 31, 2007, 2.6 million shares
    of common stock were issued to employees in settlement of

    value of $125 million. In 2008, an additional
    2.9 million shares of common stock will be issued to
    employees that were vested in 2007, with a grant date fair value
    of $155 million. During the year ended December 31,
    2006, 2.4 million shares of common stock were issued to
    employees in settlement of prior year stock awards that were
    fully vested, with a total value upon issuance of
    $143 million and a grant date fair value of
    $133 million. During the year ended December 31, 2005,
    1.9 million shares were issued to employees in settlement
    of prior year Stock Awards that were fully vested, with a total
    value upon issuance of $104 million and a grant date fair

    December 31, 2007, there was $199 million of
    unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested awards
    granted under the company’s stock-based compensation plans,
    of which $17 million relates to Stock Options and
    $182 million relates to Stock Awards. These amounts are
    expected to be charged to expense over a weighted-average period
    of 1.4 years.

UNAUDITED
    SELECTED QUARTERLY DATA

Unaudited quarterly financial results are set forth in the
    following tables. The financial results for all periods
    presented have been revised to reflect the various business
    dispositions that occurred during the 2006 and 2007 fiscal years
    (see note 5 for further details). The company’s common
    stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (trading symbol
    NOC). This unaudited quarterly information is labeled using a
    calendar convention; that is, first quarter is consistently
    labeled as ended on March 31, second quarter as ended on
    June 30, and third quarter as ended on September 30.
    It is the company’s long-standing practice to establish
    actual interim closing dates using a “fiscal”
    calendar, which requires the businesses to close their books on
    a Friday, in order to normalize the potentially disruptive
    effects of quarterly closings on business processes. The effects
    of this practice only exist within a reporting year.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Northrop Grumman Corporation (the company)
    prepared and is responsible for the consolidated financial
    statements and all related financial information contained in
    this Annual Report. This responsibility includes establishing
    and maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting. The company’s internal control over financial
    reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
    the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America.

To comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the
    Sarbanes – Oxley Act of 2002, the company designed and
    implemented a structured and comprehensive assessment process to
    evaluate its internal control over financial reporting across
    the enterprise. The assessment of the effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control –
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Because of its
    inherent limitations, a system of internal control over
    financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and
    may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management regularly
    monitors its internal control over financial reporting, and
    actions are taken to correct any deficiencies as they are
    identified. Based on its assessment, management has concluded
    that the company’s internal control over financial
    reporting is effective as of December 31, 2007.

Deloitte & Touche LLP issued an attestation report
    dated February 20, 2008, concerning the company’s
    internal control over financial reporting, which is contained in
    this Annual Report. The company’s consolidated financial
    statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    have been audited by the independent registered public
    accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States).

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL
    CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Northrop Grumman Corporation

Los Angeles, California

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    Northrop Grumman Corporation and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control –
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 of
    the Company and our report dated February 20, 2008
    expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements
    and the financial statement schedule and included an explanatory
    paragraph regarding the company’s adoption of a new
    accounting standard.
