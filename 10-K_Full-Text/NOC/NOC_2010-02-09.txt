HISTORY
    AND ORGANIZATION

History

Northrop Grumman Corporation (herein referred to as
    “Northrop Grumman”, the “company”,
    “we”, “us”, or “our”) is an
    integrated enterprise consisting of businesses that cover the
    entire global security spectrum, from undersea to outer space
    and into cyberspace. The companies that are part of today’s
    Northrop Grumman have achieved historic accomplishments, from
    transporting Charles Lindbergh across the Atlantic to carrying
    astronauts to the moon’s surface and back.

The company was originally formed as Northrop Corporation in
    California in 1939 and was reincorporated in Delaware in 1985.
    From 1994 through 2002, we entered a period of significant
    expansion through acquisitions of other businesses, most notably:

n

In 1994, Northrop Corporation acquired Grumman Corporation
    (Grumman) and was renamed Northrop Grumman Corporation. Grumman
    was a premier military aircraft systems integrator and builder
    of the Lunar Module that first delivered men to the surface
    of the moon.

n

In 1996, we acquired the defense and electronics businesses of
    Westinghouse Electric Corporation, a world leader in the
    development and production of sophisticated radar and other
    electronic systems for the nation’s defense, civil
    aviation, and other international and domestic applications.

n

In 2001, we acquired Litton Industries (Litton), a global
    electronics and information technology enterprise, and one of
    the nation’s leading full-service design, engineering,
    construction, and life cycle supporters of major surface ships
    for the United States (U.S.) Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, and
    international navies.

n

Also in 2001, we acquired Newport News Shipbuilding (Newport
    News). Newport News is the nation’s sole designer, builder
    and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and one of
    only two companies capable of designing and building
    nuclear-powered submarines.

n

In 2002, we acquired TRW Inc. (TRW), a leading developer of
    military and civil space systems and satellite payloads, as well
    as a leading global integrator of complex, mission-enabling
    systems and services.

Since 2002, other notable acquisitions include Integic
    Corporation (2005), an information technology provider
    specializing in enterprise health and business process
    management solutions and Essex Corporation (2007), a signal
    processing product and services provider to
    U.S. intelligence and defense customers. In addition, we
    divested our Advisory Services Division, TASC, Inc., in 2009.

These and other transactions have shaped us into our present
    position as a premier provider of technologically advanced,
    innovative products, services and solutions in aerospace,
    electronics, information and services and shipbuilding. As prime
    contractor, principal subcontractor, partner, or preferred
    supplier, we participate in many high-priority defense and
    commercial technology programs in the U.S. and abroad. We
    conduct most of our business with the U.S. Government,
    principally the Department of Defense (DoD). We also conduct
    business with local, state, and foreign governments and domestic
    and international commercial customers. For a discussion of
    risks associated with our DoD and foreign operations, see Risk
    Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

Organization

From time to time, we acquire or dispose of businesses, and
    realign contracts, programs or business areas among and within
    our operating segments that possess similar customers,
    expertise, and capabilities. Internal realignments are designed
    to more fully leverage existing capabilities and enhance
    development and delivery of products and services. The operating
    results for all periods presented have been revised to reflect
    these changes made through December 31, 2009.

-1-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

In January 2009, we streamlined our organizational structure by
    reducing the number of operating segments from seven to five.
    The five segments are Aerospace Systems, which combines the
    former Integrated Systems and Space Technology segments;
    Electronic Systems; Information Systems, which combines the
    former Information Technology and Mission Systems segments;
    Shipbuilding; and Technical Services. Creation of the Aerospace
    Systems and Information Systems segments was intended to
    strengthen our alignment with customers, improve our ability to
    execute on programs and win new business, and enhance cost
    competitiveness.

During the first quarter of 2009, we realigned certain
    logistics, services, and technical support programs and
    transferred assets from the Information Systems and Electronic
    Systems segments to the Technical Services segment. This
    realignment was intended to strengthen our core capability in
    aircraft and electronics maintenance, repair and overhaul, life
    cycle optimization, and training and simulation services.

During the first quarter of 2009, we transferred certain optics
    and laser programs from the Information Systems segment to the
    Aerospace Systems segment. The prior year sales and segment
    operating income were not reclassified to reflect this business
    transfer as the operating results of this business were not
    considered material.

In December 2009, we sold our Advisory Services Division (ASD),
    for $1.65 billion in cash to an investor group led by
    General Atlantic LLC and affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis
    Roberts & Co. L.P., and recognized a gain of
    $15 million, net of taxes. ASD was a business unit
    comprised of the assets and liabilities of TASC, Inc., its
    wholly-owned subsidiary TASC Services Corporation, and certain
    contracts carved out from other businesses also in our
    Information Systems segment that provide systems engineering
    technical assistance (SETA) and other analysis and advisory
    services.

In January 2008, we realigned the Newport News and Ship Systems
    businesses into a single operating segment called Northrop
    Grumman Shipbuilding. Previously, these businesses were separate
    operating segments which were aggregated into a single reporting
    segment for financial reporting purposes. In addition, we
    transferred certain Electronic Systems businesses to the former
    Mission Systems segment during the first quarter of 2008.

During the second quarter of 2008, we transferred certain
    programs and assets from the missiles business in the
    Information Systems segment to the Aerospace Systems segment.
    This transfer allowed Information Systems to focus on the
    rapidly growing command, control, communications, computing,
    intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) business.
    The missiles business became an integrated element of our
    Aerospace business growth strategy.

Submarines

– Northrop Grumman is one of only
    two U.S. companies capable of designing and building
    nuclear-powered submarines. In February 1997, the company and
    Electric Boat, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Dynamics
    Corporation, reached an agreement to cooperatively build

Virginia

class nuclear attack submarines. The initial
    four submarines in the class were delivered in 2004, 2006, and
    2008. Shipbuilding and Electric Boat were awarded a construction
    contract in August 2003 for the second block of six

Virginia

class submarines, the first two of which were delivered in
    2008 and 2009, respectively. Construction on the remaining four
    submarines is underway, with the last scheduled to be delivered
    in 2014. In December 2008, Shipbuilding and Electric Boat were
    awarded a construction contract for the third block of eight

Virginia

class submarines. The multi-year contract allows
    Shipbuilding and its teammate to proceed with the construction
    of one submarine per year in 2009 and 2010, and two submarines
    per year from 2011 to 2013. The eighth submarine to be procured
    under this contract is scheduled for delivery in 2019.

Coast Guard & Coastal Defense

–
    Shipbuilding is a joint venture partner along with Lockheed
    Martin for the Coast Guard’s Deepwater Modernization
    Program. Shipbuilding has design and production responsibility
    for surface ships. In 2006, the Shipbuilding/Lockheed Martin
    joint venture was awarded a

43-month

contract extension for the Deepwater program. The first National
    Security Cutter (NSC), USCGC

Berthoff

, was delivered to
    the Coast Guard in 2008 followed by the

Waesche

(NSC2) in
    2009. Currently, the

Stratton

(NSC3) is in construction,
    and long lead procurement is underway for NSC4.

Fleet Support

– Fleet Support provides
    after-market services, including on-going maintenance and repair
    work, for a wide array of naval and commercial vessels. The
    segment has ship repair facilities in the U.S. Navy’s
    largest homeports of Norfolk, Virginia, and San Diego,
    California.

Services & Other

– Shipbuilding
    provides various services to commercial nuclear and non-nuclear
    industrial customers. In January 2008, Savannah River Nuclear
    Solutions, a joint venture among Shipbuilding, Fluor
    Corporation, and Honeywell, was awarded a contract for site
    management and operations of the U.S. Department of
    Energy’s Savannah River Site in Aiken, South Carolina. In
    October 2008, Shipbuilding announced the formation of a joint
    venture with AREVA NP to build a new manufacturing and
    engineering facility in Newport News, Virginia, to help supply
    the growing American nuclear energy sector.

TECHNICAL
    SERVICES

Technical Services, headquartered in Herndon, Virginia, is a
    leading provider of logistics, infrastructure, and sustainment
    support, while also providing a wide array of technical services
    including training and simulation. The segment consists of three
    areas of business: Systems Support; Training &

SUMMARY
    SEGMENT FINANCIAL DATA

For a more complete understanding of our segment financial
    information, see Segment Operating Results in Part II,
    Item 7, and Note 6 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8.

CUSTOMERS
    AND REVENUE CONCENTRATION

Our primary customer is the U.S. Government.
    U.S. Government revenue (which includes Foreign Military
    Sales) accounted for approximately 91 percent of total
    revenues in 2009, 2008, and 2007. No single product or service
    accounted for more than 10 percent of total revenue during
    any period presented. See Risk Factors in Part I,
    Item 1A.

PATENTS

The following table summarizes the number of patents we own or
    have pending as of December 31, 2009:

Owned

Total

U.S. patents

3,144


3,549

Foreign patents

6,293

Patents developed while under contract with the
    U.S. Government may be subject to use by the
    U.S. Government. We license intellectual property to, and
    from, third parties. We believe our ability to conduct
    operations would not be materially affected by the loss of any
    particular intellectual property right.

SEASONALITY

No material portion of our business is considered to be
    seasonal. Our revenue recognition timing is based on several
    factors, including the timing of contract awards, the incurrence
    of contract costs, cost estimation, and unit deliveries. See
    Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments- Revenue
    Recognition in Part II, Item 7.

BACKLOG

At December 31, 2009, total backlog was $69.2 billion
    compared with $76.4 billion at the end of 2008.
    Approximately 37 percent of backlog at December 31,
    2009, is expected to be converted into sales in 2010.

Total backlog includes both funded backlog (firm orders for
    which funding is contractually obligated by the customer) and
    unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding is not currently
    contractually obligated by the customer). Unfunded backlog
    excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite
    delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) orders. For multi-year
    services contracts with non-federal government customers having
    no stated contract values, backlog includes only the amounts
    committed by the customer. For backlog by segment see Backlog in
    Part II, Item 7.

RAW
    MATERIALS

The most significant raw material we require is steel, used
    primarily for shipbuilding. We have mitigated supply risk by
    negotiating long-term agreements with a number of steel
    suppliers. In addition, we have mitigated price risk related to
    steel purchases through certain contractual arrangements with
    the U.S. Government. While we have generally been able to
    obtain key raw materials required in our production processes in
    a timely manner, a significant delay in supply deliveries could
    have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Risk Factors
    in Part I, Item 1A and Overview- Outlook in
    Part II, Item 7.

GOVERNMENT
    REGULATION

Our businesses are affected by numerous laws and regulations
    relating to the award, administration and performance of
    U.S. Government contracts. See Risk Factors in Part I,
    Item 1A.

The U.S. Government generally has the ability to terminate
    our contracts, in whole or in part, without prior notice, for
    convenience or for default based on performance. If any of our
    government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we
    are normally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for
    costs incurred and profit on those costs. Termination resulting
    from our default could require us to pay for re-procurement
    costs in excess of the original contract price, net of the value
    of work accepted from the original contract. The
    U.S. Government could also hold us liable for damages
    resulting from the default. In the event that appropriations for
    one of our programs becomes unavailable, or is reduced or
    delayed, our contract or subcontract under such program may be
    terminated or adjusted by the U.S. Government. See Risk
    Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

Certain programs with the U.S. Government that are
    prohibited by the customer from being publicly discussed in
    detail are referred to as “restricted” in this

Form 10-K.

The consolidated financial statements and financial information
    in this

Form 10-K

reflect the operating results of restricted programs under
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (GAAP). See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

RESEARCH
    AND DEVELOPMENT

Our research and development activities primarily include
    independent research and development (IR&D) efforts related
    to government programs. IR&D expenses are included in
    general and administrative expenses and are generally allocated
    to U.S. Government contracts. IR&D expenses totaled
    $610 million, $564 million, and $522 million in
    2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. We charge expenses for
    research and development sponsored by the customer directly to
    the related contracts.

EMPLOYEE
    RELATIONS

We maintain good relations with our 120,700 employees, of
    which approximately 20 percent are covered by
    32 collective bargaining agreements. We re-negotiated 17 of
    our collective bargaining agreements in 2009. These negotiations
    had no material adverse effect on our results of operations. For
    risks associated with collective bargaining agreements, see Risk
    Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    MATTERS

Our manufacturing operations are subject to and affected by
    federal, state, foreign, and local laws and regulations relating
    to the protection of the environment. We provide for the
    estimated cost to complete environmental remediation where we
    determine it is probable that we will incur such costs in the
    future to address environmental impacts at currently or formerly
    owned or leased operating facilities, or at sites where we are
    named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) by the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similarly
    designated by other environmental agencies. These estimates may
    change given the inherent difficulty in estimating environmental
    cleanup costs to be incurred in the future due to the
    uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup,
    determination of legally responsible parties, and the status of
    laws, regulations, and their interpretations.

We assess the potential impact on our financial statements by
    estimating the possible remediation costs that we could
    reasonably incur on a

site-by-site

basis. These estimates consider our environmental
    engineers’ professional judgment and, when necessary, we
    consult with outside environmental specialists. In most
    instances, we can only estimate a range of reasonably possible
    costs. We accrue our best estimate when determinable or the
    minimum amount when no single amount is more probable. We record
    accruals for environmental cleanup costs in the accounting
    period in which it becomes probable we have incurred a liability
    and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We record insurance
    recoveries only when we determine that collection is probable
    and we do not include any litigation costs related to
    environmental matters in our environmental remediation accrual.

We estimate that at December 31, 2009, the range of
    reasonably possible future costs for environmental remediation
    sites is $239 million to $483 million, of which we
    accrued $115 million in other current liabilities and
    $168 million in other long term liabilities in the
    consolidated statements of financial position. We record
    environmental accruals on an undiscounted basis. At sites
    involving multiple parties, we provide environmental accruals
    based upon our expected share of liability, taking into account
    the financial viability of other jointly liable parties. We
    expense or capitalize environmental expenditures as appropriate.
    Capitalized expenditures relate to long-lived improvements in
    currently operating facilities. We may have to incur costs in
    addition to those already estimated and accrued if other PRPs do
    not pay their allocable share of remediation costs, which could
    have a material effect on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows. We have made the
    investments we believe necessary to comply with environmental
    laws. Although we cannot predict whether information gained as
    projects progress will materially affect the estimated accrued
    liability, we do not anticipate that future remediation
    expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows.

We could be affected by future laws or regulations, including
    those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other
    actions known as “green initiatives.” We recently
    established a goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions
    during the next five years. To comply with current and future
    environmental laws and regulations and to meet this goal, we
    expect to incur capital and operating costs, but at this time we
    do not expect that such costs will have a material adverse
    effect upon our financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

COMPETITIVE
    CONDITIONS

We compete with many companies in the U.S. defense industry
    for a number of programs, both large and small, but primarily
    with Lockheed Martin Corporation, The Boeing Company, Raytheon
    Company, General Dynamics Corporation, L-3 Communications
    Corporation, SAIC, and BAE Systems. Intense competition and long
    operating cycles are both key characteristics of our business
    and the defense industry. It is common in this industry for work
    on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A
    company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate
    award of the contract to another party, turn out to be a
    subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting party. It is
    not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company
    and, simultaneously, perform as a supplier to or a customer of
    such competitor on other contracts. The nature of major defense
    programs, conducted under binding contracts, allows companies
    that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity
    not common in many industries.

-9-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our
    ability to develop and market our products and services, as well
    as our ability to provide the people, technologies, facilities,
    equipment, and financial capacity needed to deliver those
    products and services with maximum efficiency. We must continue
    to maintain sources for raw materials, fabricated parts,
    electronic components, and major subassemblies. In this
    manufacturing and systems integration environment, effective
    oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success
    as managing internal operations.

Similarly, there is intense competition among many companies in
    the information and services markets, which are generally more
    labor intensive with competitive margin rates over contract
    periods of shorter duration. Competitors in the information and
    services markets include the defense industry participants
    mentioned above as well as many other large and small entities
    with expertise in various specialized areas. Our ability to
    successfully compete in the information and services markets
    depends on a number of factors; most important is the capability
    to deploy skilled professionals, many requiring security
    clearances, at competitive prices across the diverse spectrum of
    these markets. Accordingly, we have implemented various
    workforce initiatives to ensure our success in attracting,
    developing and retaining sufficient resources to maintain or
    improve our competitive position within these markets.

Item 1A.
    Risk Factors

Our consolidated financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not
    exclusively within our control, that may cause actual
    performance to differ materially from historical or projected
    future performance. We urge you to carefully consider the risk
    factors described below in evaluating the information contained
    in this report.

n

We depend heavily on a single customer, the U.S.
    Government, for a substantial portion of our business, including
    programs subject to security classification restrictions on
    information, and changes affecting this customer’s capacity
    to do business with us could have a material adverse effect on
    us or our prospects.

Approximately 92 percent of our revenues during 2009 were
    derived from products and services ultimately sold to the
    U.S. Government (which includes Foreign Military Sales). We
    are a supplier, either directly or as a subcontractor or team
    member, to the U.S. Government and its agencies. These
    contracts are subject to the respective customers’
    political and budgetary constraints and processes, changes in
    customers’ short-range and long-range strategic plans, the
    timing of contract awards, significant changes in contract
    scheduling, intense

-10-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

competition, difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules when
    bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical
    work, and delays in the timing of contract approval, as well as
    other risks such as contractor suspension or debarment in the
    event of certain violations of legal and regulatory requirements.

In addition, a material amount of our revenues and profits are
    derived from programs that are subject to security
    classification restrictions (restricted business), which could
    limit our ability to discuss details about these programs, their
    risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs. As a
    result, you might have less insight into our restricted business
    than our other businesses or could experience less ability to
    evaluate fully the risks, disputes or claims associated with the
    restricted business.

n

Contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to
    uncertain levels of funding, modification due to changes in
    customer priorities and potential termination.

The funding of U.S. Government programs is subject to
    congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes.
    For certain programs, Congress appropriates funds on a fiscal
    year basis even though a program may extend over several fiscal
    years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded
    initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress
    makes further appropriations. We cannot predict the extent to
    which total funding

and/or

funding for individual programs will be included, increased or
    reduced as part of the 2010 and subsequent budgets ultimately
    approved by Congress or be included in the scope of separate
    supplemental appropriations. The impact, severity and duration
    of the current U.S. economic situation, the sweeping
    economic plans adopted by the U.S. Government, and
    pressures on the federal budget could also adversely affect the
    total funding

and/or

funding for individual programs. In the event that
    appropriations for one of our programs becomes unavailable, or
    is reduced or delayed, our contract or subcontract under such
    program may be terminated or adjusted by the
    U.S. Government, which could have a material adverse effect
    on our future sales under such program.

We also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in
    priorities due to military transformation and planning

and/or

the
    nature of war-related activity on existing, follow-on or
    replacement programs. A shift of government priorities to
    programs in which we do not participate

and/or

reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in
    which we do participate, unless offset by other programs and
    opportunities, could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations or bid prospects.

In addition, the U.S. Government generally has the ability
    to terminate contracts, in whole or in part, without prior
    notice, for convenience or for default based on performance. In
    the event of termination for the government’s convenience,
    contractors are normally protected by provisions covering
    reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on
    those costs. Termination resulting from our default can expose
    us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our
    ability to compete for contracts.

n

As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a
    number of procurement regulations and could be adversely
    affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from
    a U.S. audit or investigation.

U.S. Government contractors must comply with significant
    procurement regulations and other requirements. These
    requirements, although customary in government contracts,
    increase our performance and compliance costs. If procurement
    requirements change, our costs of complying with them could
    increase and reduce our margins.

We operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely
    audited and reviewed by the U.S. Government and its
    agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and
    Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). These agencies review
    our performance under our contracts, our cost structure and our
    compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as
    well as the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal
    control systems and policies. Systems that are subject to review
    include our purchasing systems, billing systems, property
    management and control systems, cost estimating systems,
    compensation systems and management information systems. Any
    costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract
    will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already
    reimbursed. If an audit

-11-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to
    civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which
    may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits,
    suspension of payments, fines and suspension, or prohibition
    from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition,
    we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of
    impropriety were made against us.

We are also, from time to time, subject to U.S. Government
    investigations relating to our operations and are expected to
    perform in compliance with a vast array of federal laws,
    including the Truth in Negotiations Act, the False Claims Act,
    the International Traffic in Arms Regulations promulgated under
    the Arms Export Control Act, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices
    Act. We may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts,
    contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of
    penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results
    of operations and financial condition, if we are found to have
    violated the law or are indicted or convicted for violations of
    federal laws related to government security regulations,
    employment practices or protection of the environment, or are
    found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law. Such
    convictions could also result in suspension or debarment from
    government contracting for some period of time. Given our
    dependence on government contracting, suspension or debarment
    could have a material adverse effect on us.

n

Competition within our markets and an increase in bid
    protests may reduce our revenues and market share.

We operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may
    have more extensive or more specialized engineering,
    manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some
    areas. We anticipate higher competition in some of our core
    markets as a result of the reduction in budgets for many
    U.S. Government agencies and fewer new program starts. In
    addition, as discussed in more detail above, projected
    U.S. defense spending levels for periods beyond the
    near-term are uncertain and difficult to predict. Changes in
    U.S. defense spending may limit certain future market
    opportunities. We are also facing increasing competition in our
    domestic and international markets from foreign and
    multinational firms. Additionally, some customers, including the
    DoD, are more frequently turning to commercial contractors,
    rather than traditional defense contractors, for information
    technology and other support work. If we are unable to continue
    to compete successfully against our current or future
    competitors, we may experience declines in revenues and market
    share which could negatively impact our results of operations
    and financial condition.

The competitive environment is also affected by an increase in
    bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards.
    Bid protests could result in the award decision being
    overturned, requiring a re-bid of the contract. Even where a bid
    protest does not result in a re-bid, the resolution extends the
    time until the contract activity can begin which may reduce our
    earnings in the period in which the contract would otherwise
    have commenced.

n

Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to
    develop new products and new technologies and maintain a
    qualified workforce to meet the needs of current and future
    customers.

The markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly
    changing technologies. The product, program and service needs of
    our customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our
    success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our
    ability to develop and market our products and services, as well
    as our ability to provide the people, technologies, facilities,
    equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those
    products and services with maximum efficiency. If we fail to
    maintain our competitive position, we could lose a significant
    amount of future business to our competitors, which would have a
    material adverse effect on our ability to generate favorable
    financial results and maintain market share.

Operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to
    attract and retain sufficient personnel with requisite skills

and/or

security clearances. If qualified personnel become scarce, we
    could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in
    order to attract and retain such employees or could experience
    difficulty in performing under our contracts if the needs for
    such employees are unmet.

-12-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Approximately 20 percent of our 120,700 employees are
    covered by an aggregate of 32 collective bargaining agreements.
    We expect to re-negotiate renewals of three of our collective
    bargaining agreements in 2010, and we are continuing to
    negotiate an initial contract for a group of employees.
    Collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to
    five years and are subject to renegotiation at that time. We may
    experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of
    existing collective bargaining agreements. If we experience such
    difficulties, we could incur additional expenses and work
    stoppages. Any such expenses or delays could adversely affect
    programs served by employees who are covered by collective
    bargaining agreements. In the recent past we have experienced
    work stoppages and other labor disruptions in Shipbuilding.

n

Many of our contracts contain performance obligations that
    require innovative design capabilities, are technologically
    complex, require state-of-the-art manufacturing expertise or are
    dependent upon factors not wholly within our control. Failure to
    meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability
    and future prospects.

We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced and
    innovative products and services applied by our customers in a
    variety of environments. Problems and delays in development or
    delivery as a result of issues with respect to design,
    technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve
    assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from
    achieving contractual requirements.

In addition, our products cannot be tested and proven in all
    situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems.
    Examples of unforeseen problems that could negatively affect
    revenue and profitability include loss on launch of spacecraft,
    premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair
    or replacement, problems with quality, country of origin,
    delivery of subcontractor components or services and unplanned
    degradation of product performance. These failures could result,
    either directly or indirectly, in loss of life or property.
    Among the factors that may affect revenue and profits could be
    unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or
    indemnification from the customer, diversion of management focus
    in responding to unforeseen problems, loss of follow-on work,
    and, in the case of certain contracts, repayment to the
    government customer of contract cost and fee payments we
    previously received.

Certain contracts, primarily involving space satellite systems,
    contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in
    the event of partial or complete failure of the system upon
    launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period
    of time. Under such terms, we could be required to forfeit fees
    previously recognized

and/or

collected. We have not experienced any material losses in the
    last decade in connection with such contract performance
    incentive provisions. However, if we were to experience launch
    failures or complete satellite system failures in the future,
    such events could have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position or results of operations.

n

Contract cost growth on fixed-price and other contracts
    that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due
    from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the
    potential loss of future business.

Operating income is adversely affected when we incur contract
    costs that cannot be billed to customers. This cost growth can
    occur if estimates to complete increase due to technical
    challenges, manufacturing difficulties or delays, or
    workforce-related issues, or if initial estimates used for
    calculating the contract cost were incorrect. The cost
    estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise.
    Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability or reduced
    productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to
    be performed, the timelines and availability of materials, major
    subcontractor performance and quality of their products, the
    effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of
    funding from the customer, natural disasters and the inability
    to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A
    significant change in cost estimates on one or more programs
    could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
    financial position or results of operations.

Most of our contracts are firm fixed-price contracts or flexibly
    priced contracts. Flexibly priced contracts include both
    cost-type and fixed-price incentive contracts. Due to their
    nature, firm fixed-price contracts

-13-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

inherently have more risk than flexibly priced contracts.
    Approximately 33 percent of our annual revenues are derived
    from firm fixed-price contracts – see Contracts in
    Part II, Item 7. We typically enter into firm
    fixed-price contracts where costs can be reasonably estimated
    based on experience. In addition, our contracts contain
    provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights. Should
    the terms specified in our contracts not be met, then
    profitability may be reduced. Fixed-price development work
    comprises a small portion of our firm fixed-price contracts and
    inherently has more uncertainty as to future events than
    production contracts and therefore more variability in estimates
    of the costs to complete the development stage. As work
    progresses through the development stage into production, the
    risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract
    are generally reduced. In addition, successful performance of
    firm fixed-price development contracts that include production
    units is subject to our ability to control cost growth in
    meeting production specifications and delivery rates. While
    management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated
    with fixed-price development contracts, future events could
    result in either upward or downward adjustments to those
    estimates. Examples of our significant fixed-price development
    contracts include the F-16 Block 60 combat avionics program
    and the MESA radar system program for the Wedgetail and Peace
    Eagle contracts, both of which are performed by the Electronic
    Systems segment.

Under a fixed-price incentive contract, the allowable costs
    incurred by the contractor are subject to reimbursement, but are
    subject to a cost-share limit which affects profitability.
    Contracts in Shipbuilding are often fixed-price incentive
    contracts for production of a first item without a separate
    development contract. Accordingly, we face the additional
    difficulty of estimating production costs on a product that has
    not yet been designed. Further, Shipbuilding sometimes enters
    into follow-on fixed-price contracts after a significant delay
    from the first production request, and the passage of time makes
    it more difficult for us to accurately estimate costs for
    renewed production.

Under a cost-type contract the allowable costs incurred by the
    contractor are also subject to reimbursement plus a fee that
    represents profit. We enter into cost-type contracts for
    development programs with complex design and technical
    challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or
    incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned
    over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial
    risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program
    cancellation if cost, schedule, or technical performance issues
    arise.

n

Our earnings and margins depend, in part, on our ability
    to perform under contracts and on subcontractor performance as
    well as raw material and component availability and
    pricing.

When agreeing to contractual terms, our management makes
    assumptions and projections about future conditions and events,
    many of which extend over long periods. These projections assess
    the productivity and availability of labor, the complexity of
    the work to be performed, the cost and availability of
    materials, the impact of delayed performance, and the timing of
    product deliveries. If there is a significant change in one or
    more of these circumstances or estimates, or if we face
    unanticipated contract costs, the profitability of one or more
    of these contracts may be adversely affected.

We also rely on other companies to provide raw materials and
    major components for our products and rely on subcontractors to
    produce hardware elements and sub-assemblies and perform some of
    the services that we provide to our customers. Disruptions or
    performance problems caused by our subcontractors and vendors
    could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our
    commitments to customers. Our ability to perform our obligations
    as a prime contractor could be adversely affected if one or more
    of the vendors or subcontractors are unable to provide the

agreed-upon

products or materials or perform the

agreed-upon

services in a timely and cost-effective manner.

n

Our business is subject to disruption caused by natural
    disasters and other factors that could adversely affect our
    profitability and our overall financial position.

We have significant operations located in regions of the
    U.S. that may be exposed to damaging storms and other
    natural disasters, such as hurricanes or earthquakes. Although
    preventative measures may help to mitigate damage, the damage
    and disruption resulting from natural disasters may be
    significant. Should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms
    be insufficient to recover all costs, we could experience a
    material adverse effect on our financial position. Our suppliers
    and subcontractors are also subject to natural disasters that
    could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a
    contract. Performance failures by our subcontractors due to
    natural disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform
    our obligations on the prime contract, which could reduce our
    profitability due to damages or other costs that may not be
    fully recoverable from the subcontractor or from the customer
    and could result in a termination of the prime contract and have
    an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts.

Natural disasters can also disrupt electrical and other power
    distribution networks and the critical industrial infrastructure
    needed for normal business operations. These disruptions could
    cause adverse effects on our profitability and performance,
    including computer and internet operation and accessibility.

n

We use estimates when accounting for contracts. Changes in
    estimates could affect our profitability and our overall
    financial position.

Contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing
    risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making
    assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size
    and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total
    revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to
    many variables. For example, assumptions have to be made
    regarding the length of time to complete the contract because
    costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for
    materials. Similarly, assumptions have to be made regarding the
    future impact of our self-imposed efficiency initiatives and
    cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards or penalties related
    to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue
    and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient
    information to assess anticipated performance.

Because of the significance of the judgment and estimation
    processes described above, it is possible that materially
    different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions
    were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change.
    Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates
    may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial
    reporting and performance. See Critical Accounting Policies,
    Estimates, and Judgments in Part II, Item 7.

n

Our international business is subject to greater risks
    sometimes associated with doing business in foreign
    countries.

Although our international business constitutes only
    5 percent of total revenues, we are subject to numerous
    U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without
    limitation, regulations relating to import-export control,
    technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings,
    exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the
    anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration
    Act. Failure by us or our sales representatives or consultants
    to comply with these laws and regulations could result in
    administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could, in the
    extreme case, result in suspension or debarment from government
    contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could
    have a material adverse effect on us. Changes in regulation or
    political environment may affect our ability to conduct business
    in foreign markets, including investment, procurement and
    repatriation of earnings.

n

Our reputation and our ability to do business may be
    impacted by the improper conduct of employees, agents or
    business partners.

We have implemented extensive compliance controls, policies and
    procedures to prevent and detect reckless or criminal acts
    committed by employees, agents or business partners that would
    violate the laws of the

-15-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws governing
    payments to government officials, competition and data privacy.
    However we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such reckless
    or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business
    partners. Any improper actions could subject us to civil or
    criminal investigations, monetary and non-monetary penalties and
    could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct
    business, our results of operations and our reputation.

n

Our business could be negatively impacted by security
    threats and other disruptions.

As a defense contractor, we face certain security threats,
    including threats to our information technology infrastructure
    and unlawful attempts to gain access to our proprietary or
    classified information. Our information technology networks and
    related systems are critical to the smooth operation of our
    business and essential to our ability to perform day to day
    operations. Loss of security within this critical operational
    infrastructure could disrupt our operations, require significant
    management attention and resources and could have a material
    adverse effect on our performance.

We also manage information technology systems for various
    customers. While we maintain information security policies and
    procedures for managing these systems, we face generally the
    same security threats for these systems as for our own systems.
    Computer viruses, attempts to gain access to our customers’
    data or other electronic security breaches could lead to
    disruptions in mission critical systems for our customers,
    unauthorized release of confidential or personally identifiable
    information and corruption of customer data. These events could
    damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial
    actions we must take, potential liability to customers and
    litigation expenses.

n

Our nuclear operations subject us to various
    environmental, regulatory, financial and other risks.

The development and operation of nuclear-powered aircraft
    carriers, nuclear-powered submarines and other nuclear
    operations subject us to various risks, including:

n

potential liabilities relating to harmful effects on the
    environment and human health resulting from nuclear operations
    and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials;

n

unplanned expenditures relating to maintenance, operation,
    security and repair, including repairs required by the Nuclear
    Regulatory Commission;

n

limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially
    available to cover losses that might arise in connection with
    nuclear operations; and

n

potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident whether
    or not it is within our control.

The U.S. Government provides indemnity protection against
    specified risks under Public Law

85-804

and
    the Price-Anderson Nuclear Indemnities Act for certain of our
    nuclear operations risks. Our nuclear operations are subject to
    various safety-related requirements imposed by the
    U.S. Navy, Department of Energy, and Nuclear Regulatory
    Commission. In the event of non-compliance, these agencies may
    increase regulatory oversight, impose fines or shut down our
    operations, depending upon the assessment of the severity of the
    situation. Revised security and safety requirements promulgated
    by these agencies could necessitate substantial capital and
    other expenditures.

n

Unforeseen environmental costs could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
    operations.

Our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of
    federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws
    and regulations. In addition, we could be affected by future
    laws or regulations, including those imposed in response to
    climate change concerns and other actions commonly referred to
    as “green initiatives.” Compliance with current and
    future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and
    is expected to continue to require significant capital and
    operating costs, but is not expected to have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition.

-16-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Environmental laws and regulations can impose substantial fines
    and criminal sanctions for violations, and may require the
    installation of costly pollution control equipment or
    operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges

and/or

decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance
    releases. In addition, if we were found to be in violation of
    the Federal Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, the facility
    or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the
    EPA on the “Excluded Parties List” maintained by the
    General Services Administration. The listing would continue
    until the EPA concluded that the cause of the violation had been
    cured. Listed facilities cannot be used in performing any
    U.S. Government contract while they are listed by the EPA.
    We also incur, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply
    with current federal and state environmental laws and
    regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants previously
    released into the environment.

The adoption of new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement
    of existing laws and regulations, imposition of new cleanup
    requirements, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive
    contamination, litigation involving environmental impacts, our
    ability to recover such costs under previously priced contracts
    or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause
    us to incur costs in the future that would have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
    operations.

n

We are subject to various claims and litigation that could
    ultimately be resolved against us requiring material future cash
    payments and/or future material charges against our operating
    income and materially impairing our financial position.

The size and complexity of our business make it highly
    susceptible to claims and litigation. We are subject to various
    existing environmental claims, income tax matters and other
    litigation, which, if not resolved within established reserves,
    could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See
    Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3, Critical
    Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments in Part II,
    Item 7 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8. Any claims or
    litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could
    negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the
    public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively
    or obtain adequate insurance in the future.

n

We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual
    property rights, which could affect our ability to
    compete.

We own many U.S. and foreign patents and patent
    applications, and we have rights in numerous trademarks and
    copyrights. The U.S. Government has licenses under certain
    of our patents and certain other intellectual property that are
    developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use
    or authorize others to use such patents and intellectual
    property for government purposes. Our patents and other
    intellectual property are subject to challenge, invalidation,
    misappropriation or circumvention by third parties.

We also rely significantly upon proprietary technology,
    information, processes and know-how that are not subject to
    patent protection. We seek to protect this information through
    trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees,
    consultants, subcontractors, or other parties, as well as
    through other security measures. These agreements and security
    measures may not provide meaningful protection for our
    unpatented proprietary information. In the event of an
    infringement of our intellectual property rights, a breach of a
    confidentiality agreement or divulgence of proprietary
    information, we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain
    our intellectual property. Litigation to determine the scope of
    intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful,
    could be costly and could divert management’s attention
    away from other aspects of our business. In addition, our trade
    secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed
    by competitors.

In some instances, we have augmented our technology base by
    licensing the proprietary intellectual property of others. In
    the future, we may not be able to obtain necessary licenses on
    commercially reasonable terms.

n

Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of
    our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of
    material losses we incur, which could adversely affect our
    profitability and overall financial position.

We endeavor to identify and obtain in established markets
    insurance agreements to cover significant risks and liabilities
    (including, among others, natural disasters, product liability
    and business interruption). Not every risk or liability can be
    protected by insurance, and, for insurable risks, the limits of
    coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be
    sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred,
    including for example, a catastrophic earthquake claim. In some,
    but not all, circumstances we may receive indemnification from
    the U.S. Government. Because of the limitations in overall
    available coverage referred to above, we may have to bear
    substantial costs for uninsured losses that could have an
    adverse effect upon our consolidated results of operations and
    our overall consolidated financial position. Additionally,
    disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the
    timing of cash flows and, if litigation with the carrier becomes
    necessary, an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material
    adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. For
    example, we commenced legal action against an insurance carrier
    arising out of a disagreement concerning the coverage of certain
    losses related to Hurricane Katrina, and another carrier has
    denied coverage for certain other losses related to Hurricane
    Katrina and advised us that it will seek reimbursement of
    certain amounts previously advanced by that carrier. See
    Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8.

n

Changes in future business conditions could cause business
    investments and/or recorded goodwill to become impaired,
    resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would
    reduce our operating income.

As part of our overall strategy, we will, from time to time,
    acquire a minority or majority interest in a business. These
    investments are made upon careful analysis and due diligence
    procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic
    objective. These procedures often involve certain assumptions
    and judgment in determining acquisition price. Even after
    careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary
    significantly from initial estimates. Goodwill accounts for
    approximately half of our recorded total assets. We evaluate
    goodwill amounts for impairment annually, or when evidence of
    potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based
    on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a
    significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market
    conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded
    goodwill. Adverse equity market conditions that result in a
    decline in market multiples and our stock price could result in
    an impairment of goodwill

and/or

other
    intangible assets. We continue to monitor the recoverability of
    the carrying value of our goodwill and other long-lived assets.
    See Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments in
    Part II, Item 7.

n

Anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint
    ventures or strategic alliances may not be realized.

As part of our overall strategy, we may, from time to time,
    merge with or acquire businesses, or form joint ventures or
    create strategic alliances. Whether we realize the anticipated
    benefits from these transactions depends, in part, upon the
    integration between the businesses involved, the performance of
    the underlying products, capabilities or technologies and the
    management of the transacted operations. Accordingly, our
    financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated
    performance issues, transaction-related charges, amortization of
    expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of
    long-term assets and partner performance. Although we believe
    that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and
    processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that
    these transactions will be successful.

n

Market volatility and adverse capital and credit market
    conditions may affect our ability to access cost-effective
    sources of funding and expose us to risks associated with the
    financial viability of suppliers and the ability of
    counterparties to perform on financial instruments.

The financial and credit markets recently experienced levels of
    volatility and disruption, reducing the availability of credit
    for certain issuers. Historically, we have occasionally accessed
    these markets to support certain business activities including,
    acquisitions, capital expansion projects, refinancing existing
    debt and

-18-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

issuing letters of credit. In the future, we may not be able to
    obtain capital market financing or credit availability on
    similar terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse
    effect on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows.

The tightening of credit could also adversely affect our
    suppliers’ ability to obtain financing. Delays in
    suppliers’ ability to obtain financing, or the
    unavailability of financing could cause us to be unable to meet
    our contract obligations and could adversely affect our results
    of operations. The inability of our suppliers to obtain
    financing could also result in the need for us to transition to
    alternate suppliers, which could result in significant
    incremental cost and delay.

We have executed transactions with counterparties in the
    financial services industry, including brokers and dealers,
    commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional
    parties. These transactions expose us to potential credit risk
    in the event of default of a counterparty. In addition, our
    credit risk may be increased when collateral held by us cannot
    be realized upon a sale or is liquidated at prices not
    sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative
    exposure due to it.

n

Pension and medical expenses associated with our
    retirement benefit plans may fluctuate significantly depending
    upon changes in actuarial assumptions, future market performance
    of plan assets, future trends in health care costs and
    legislative or other regulatory actions.

A substantial portion of our current and retired employee
    population is covered by pension and post-retirement benefit
    plans, the costs of which are dependent upon our various
    assumptions, including estimates of rates of return on benefit
    related assets, discount rates for future payment obligations,
    rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs. In
    addition, funding requirements for benefit obligations of our
    pension and post-retirement benefit plans are subject to
    legislative and other government regulatory actions.

Variances from these estimates could have a material adverse
    effect on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows. For example, the recent volatility in
    the financial markets resulted in lower than expected returns on
    our pension plan assets in 2008, which resulted in higher
    pension costs in 2009. See Note 16 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8.

n

Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to
    additional income tax liabilities could affect our
    profitability.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and many
    foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in
    determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the
    ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and
    calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
    Furthermore, changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and
    regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or
    lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of
    certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby
    affecting our income tax expense and profitability. The final
    determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be
    materially different from our historical income tax provisions
    and accruals. Additionally, changes in the effective tax rate as
    a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with
    differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall
    profitability, changes in tax legislation, changes in the
    valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of
    audits and the examination of previously filed tax returns by
    taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax
    exposures could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income
    tax expense and profitability.

    Properties

At December 31, 2009, we owned or leased approximately

We maintain our properties in good operating condition. We
    believe that the productive capacity of our properties is
    adequate to meet current contractual requirements and those for
    the foreseeable future.

In January 2010, we announced our decision to move our corporate
    office from Los Angeles, California to the Washington D.C.
    region by the summer of 2011. This move will enable us to better
    serve our customers. Although we are moving some corporate staff
    from Los Angeles, the state of California remains a significant
    business location for us.

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated
    as net cash provided by operations less capital expenditures and
    outsourcing contract and related software costs. Outsourcing
    contract and related software costs are similar to capital
    expenditures in that the contract costs represent incremental
    external costs or certain specific internal costs that are
    directly related to the contract acquisition and
    transition/set-up. These outsourcing contract and related
    software costs are deferred and expensed over the contract life.
    See Liquidity and Capital Resources – Free Cash Flow
    in Part II, Item 7 for more information on this
    measure.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

OVERVIEW

Business

We provide technologically advanced, innovative products,
    services, and integrated solutions in aerospace, electronics,
    information and services and shipbuilding to our global
    customers. We participate in many high-priority defense and
    commercial technology programs in the United States (U.S.) and
    abroad as a prime contractor, principal subcontractor, partner,
    or preferred supplier. We conduct most of our business with the
    U.S. Government, principally the Department of Defense
    (DoD). We also conduct business with local, state, and foreign
    governments and domestic and international commercial customers.

Outlook

From the end of 2008 through 2009, the United States and global
    economies endured a period of substantial economic uncertainty,
    and the related financial markets experienced significant
    volatility. While the financial markets showed signs of
    stabilization in the second half of 2009, the U.S. and
    global economies are still recovering and some companies
    continue to struggle. If the future economic environment
    continues to be less favorable than it has been in recent years,
    we could be negatively impacted if the financial viability of
    certain of our subcontractors and key suppliers is impaired. In
    addition, the valuation of our pension assets was negatively
    affected by the volatility in the financial markets in 2008,
    resulting in higher pension costs in 2009. Should the financial
    markets experience further decline which impacts our plan asset
    returns, we could again have higher future pension costs and
    required plan funding than in prior years.

We conduct business primarily with U.S. Government
    customers under long-term contracts and we have not materially
    changed our product and service offerings due to the current
    economic conditions. The U.S. Government’s budgetary
    processes give us good visibility regarding future spending and
    the threat areas that it is addressing. We believe that our
    current contracts, and our strong backlog of previously awarded
    contracts align well with our customer’s future needs, and
    this provides us with good insight regarding future cash flows
    from our businesses. Nonetheless, we recognize that no business
    is completely immune to the current economic

-26-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

situation and new policy initiatives could adversely affect
    future defense spending levels, which could lower our expected
    future revenues. Certain programs in which we participate may be
    subject to potential reductions due to a slower rate of growth
    in the U.S. Defense Budget and funds being utilized to
    support the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

We believe that our portfolio of technologically advanced,
    innovative products, services, and integrated solutions will
    generate revenue growth in 2010 and beyond, despite the trend of
    slower growth rates in the U.S. defense budget. We expect
    sales in 2010 to be in the range of $34 to $34.6 billion
    based on backlog (funded and unfunded) of approximately
    $69.2 billion as of December 31, 2009. We describe in
    the following paragraphs the major industry and economic factors
    that may affect our future performance.

Industry
    Factors

We are subject to the unique characteristics of the
    U.S. defense industry as a monopsony, whereby demand for
    our products and services comes primarily from one customer, and
    by certain elements peculiar to our own business mix.

Liquidity Trends

– In light of the ongoing
    economic situation, we have evaluated our future liquidity
    needs, both from a short-term and long-term perspective. We
    expect that cash on hand at the beginning of the year plus cash
    generated from operations and cash available under credit lines
    will be sufficient in 2010 to service debt, finance capital
    expansion projects, pay federal, foreign, and state income
    taxes, fund pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, and
    continue paying dividends to shareholders. We have a committed
    $2 billion revolving credit facility, with a maturity date
    of August 10, 2012, that can be accessed on a

same-day

basis.

During the second quarter of 2009, we issued $350 million
    of

5-year

and $500 million of

10-year

unsecured senior obligations. Interest on the notes is payable
    semi-annually in arrears at fixed rates of 3.70 percent and
    5.05 percent per annum, and the notes will mature on
    August 1, 2014, and August 1, 2019, respectively. We
    can redeem these senior notes at our discretion at any time
    prior to maturity. We are using the net proceeds from these
    notes for general corporate purposes including debt repayment,
    acquisitions, share repurchases, pension plan funding, and
    working capital. A portion of the net proceeds was used to
    retire $400 million of 8 percent senior debt that
    matured.

We believe we can obtain additional capital to provide for
    long-term liquidity, if necessary, from such sources as the
    public or private capital markets, the sale of assets, sale and
    leaseback of operating assets, and leasing rather than
    purchasing new assets. We have an effective shelf registration
    statement on file with the SEC.

Recent Developments in U.S. Cost Accounting Standards
    (CAS) Pension Recovery Rules

– On
    September 2, 2008, the CAS Board published an Advance
    Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) that if adopted would
    provide a framework to partially harmonize the CAS rules with
    the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) requirements. The
    proposed CAS rule includes provisions for a transition period
    from the existing CAS requirement to a partially harmonized CAS
    requirement. As published, the proposed rule would partially
    mitigate the near-term mismatch between

PPA-amended

Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum
    contribution requirements, which would not yet be recoverable
    under CAS. However, until the final rule is published, (and to
    the extent that the final rule does not completely eliminate any
    mismatch between ERISA funding requirements and CAS), government
    contractors maintaining defined benefit pension plans in general
    would still experience a timing mismatch between required
    contributions and the CAS recoverable pension costs. The CAS
    Board is expected to issue a final rule in 2010, which would
    apply to our contracts starting in 2011. We anticipate that
    contractors will be entitled to seek an equitable adjustment for
    the additional CAS contract costs required by the final rule.

Economic
    Opportunities, Challenges, and Risks

Today the United States faces a complex and rapidly changing
    national security environment. The defense of the U.S. and
    its allies requires the ability to respond to constantly
    evolving threats, terrorist acts, regional conflicts and cyber
    attacks, responses to which are increasingly dependent upon
    early threat identification. National responses to such threats
    can require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from
    dissuasion, deterrence,

-27-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

active defense, security and stability operations, or
    peacekeeping. We believe that the U.S. Government will
    continue to place a high priority on the protection of its
    engaged forces and citizenry and on minimizing collateral damage
    when force must be applied in pursuit of national objectives. As
    a result, the U.S. and its military coalitions increasingly
    rely on sophisticated systems providing long-range surveillance
    and intelligence, battle management, and precision strike
    capabilities. Accordingly, defense procurement spending is
    expected to include the development and procurement of military
    platforms and systems demonstrating stealth, long-range,
    survivability, persistence and standoff capabilities. Advanced
    electronics and software that enhance the capabilities of
    individual systems and provide for the real-time integration of
    individual surveillance, information management, strike, and
    battle management platforms will also be a priority.

The United States is engaged in a multi-front, multi-decade
    struggle that we expect will require an affordable balance
    between investments in current missions and investments in new
    capabilities to meet future challenges. The recently released
    2010 Quadrennial Defense Review emphasizes the related challenge
    of rebuilding readiness at a time when DoD is pursuing growth,
    modernization and transformation of its forces and capabilities.
    We do not expect defense requirements to change significantly in
    the foreseeable future, and the size of national security
    budgets is expected to remain responsive. The fiscal year 2011
    budget submitted by the President requests $548.9 billion
    in discretionary authority for the DoD base budget (and an
    additional $159 billion to support contingency operations),
    representing a slight increase over the 2010 budget. Although
    the President’s budget request proposes reductions to
    certain programs in which we participate or for which we expect
    to compete, we believe that spending on recapitalization and
    modernization of defense and homeland security assets will
    continue to be a national priority.

Our substantial new competitive opportunities include unmanned
    vehicles, reconnaissance and surveillance platforms, missile
    defense radar, satellite communications systems, restricted
    programs, cybersecurity, technical services and information
    technology contracts, and numerous international and homeland
    security programs. In pursuit of these opportunities, we
    continue to focus on operational and financial performance for
    continued improvements in earnings in 2010 and beyond.

U.S. Government programs focused on areas involving
    intelligence, persistent surveillance, directed energy
    applications, and cyber space in which we either participate, or
    strive to participate, must compete with other programs for
    consideration and resources during the U.S. budget
    formulation and appropriation processes. In addition to domestic
    and international considerations, the Pentagon faces its own
    near-term and long-term internal fiscal constraints as it
    attempts to balance competing pressures from within and adhere
    to calls for better economy, efficiency and accountability.
    Budget decisions made in this environment will have long-term
    consequences for our size and structure and the entire defense
    industry.

We have historically concentrated our efforts in high technology
    areas such as stealth, airborne and space surveillance, battle
    management, systems integration, defense electronics,
    cybersecurity and information technology. We have a significant
    presence in federal and civil information systems; the
    manufacture of combatant ships including aircraft carriers and
    submarines; space technology; Command, Control, Communications,
    Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance
    (C4ISR); and missile systems. We believe that our programs are a
    high priority for national defense, but under budgetary
    pressures, one or more of our programs may be reduced, extended,
    or terminated by our U.S. Government customers.

Congress last year passed legislation to add further discipline
    and accountability to the acquisition system. This legislation,
    the Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act of 2009, requires DoD
    to develop mechanisms to address cost, schedule and performance
    in establishing program requirements. As acquisition reform
    progresses, we will continue to anticipate and respond to the
    actions of the Pentagon and Congress to determine their impact
    on our operations.

We provide certain product warranties that require repair or
    replacement of non-conforming items for a specified period of
    time. Most of our product warranties are provided under
    government contracts, the costs of which are generally
    incorporated into contract pricing.

Prime contracts with various agencies of the
    U.S. Government and subcontracts with other prime
    contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations,
    including the False Claims Act and the International Traffic in
    Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act.
    Noncompliance found by any one agency may result in fines,
    penalties, debarment, or suspension from receiving additional
    contracts with all U.S. Government agencies. We could
    experience material adverse effects on our business and results
    of operations if we were suspended or debarred from additional
    contracts.

We could be affected by future laws or regulations, including
    those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other
    actions known as “green initiatives.” We recently
    established a goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions
    during the next five years. To comply with current and future
    environmental laws and regulations and to meet this goal, we
    expect to incur capital and operating costs, but at this time we
    do not expect that such costs will have a material adverse
    effect upon our financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

See Risk Factors located in Part I, Item 1A for a more
    complete description of risks faced by us and the defense
    industry.

BUSINESS
    ACQUISITIONS


– We acquired Sonoma Photonics, Inc., as
    well as assets from Swift Engineering’s Killer Bee Unmanned
    Air Systems product line in April 2009 for an aggregate amount
    of approximately $33 million. The operating results from
    the date of acquisition are reported in the Aerospace Systems
    segment.


– We acquired 3001 International, Inc.
    (3001 Inc.) in October 2008 for approximately $92 million
    in cash. 3001 Inc. provides geospatial data production and
    analysis, including airborne imaging, surveying, mapping and
    geographic information systems for U.S. and international
    government intelligence, defense and civilian customers. The
    operating results of 3001 Inc. are reported in the Information
    Systems segment from the date of acquisition.


– We acquired Xinetics Inc. and the
    remaining 61 percent of Scaled Composites, LLC, both of
    which are reported in the Aerospace Systems segment, during the
    third quarter of 2007, for an aggregate amount of approximately
    $100 million in cash.

In July 2007, we reorganized the AMSEC, LLC joint venture
    (AMSEC) with our partner, Science Applications International
    Corporation (SAIC), by dividing AMSEC along customer and product
    lines. AMSEC is a full-service supplier that provides
    engineering, logistics and technical support services primarily
    to U.S. Navy ship and aviation programs. Under the
    reorganization plan, we retained the ship engineering, logistics
    and technical service businesses under the AMSEC name (the AMSEC
    Businesses) and, in exchange, SAIC received the aviation, combat
    systems and strike force integration services businesses (the
    Divested Businesses). We treated this reorganization as a step
    acquisition for the acquisition of SAIC’s interests in the
    AMSEC Businesses, and recognized a pre-tax gain of
    $23 million for the effective sale of our interests in the
    Divested Businesses. From the date of this reorganization, the
    operating results of the AMSEC Businesses and transaction gain
    have been consolidated in the Shipbuilding segment. Prior to the
    reorganization, we accounted for the part of AMSEC, LLC that we
    did not already own under the equity method.

In January 2007, we acquired Essex Corporation (Essex) for
    approximately $590 million in cash, including the
    assumption of debt totaling $23 million. Essex provides
    signal processing services and products, and advanced
    optoelectronic imaging for U.S. government intelligence and
    defense customers. We report operating results of Essex in the
    Information Systems segment.

BUSINESS
    DISPOSITIONS


– We sold ASD in December 2009, for
    $1.65 billion in cash to an investor group led by General
    Atlantic, LLC and affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis
    Roberts & Co. L.P., and recognized a gain of
    $15 million, net of taxes. ASD was a business unit
    comprised of the assets and liabilities of TASC, Inc., its
    wholly-owned subsidiary TASC Services Corporation, and certain
    contracts carved out from other businesses also in Information
    Systems that provide systems engineering technical assistance
    (SETA) and other analysis and advisory services. Sales for ASD

the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, were
    approximately $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion, and
    $1.5 billion, respectively. The assets, liabilities and
    operating results of this business unit are reported as
    discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of
    operations for all periods presented.

2008 –

We sold our Electro-Optical Systems
    (EOS) business in April 2008 for $175 million in cash to
    L-3 Communications Corporation and recognized a gain of
    $19 million, net of taxes. EOS, formerly a part of the
    Electronic Systems segment, produces night vision and applied
    optics products. Sales for this business through April 2008 and
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 were approximately
    $53 million and $190 million, respectively. The
    assets, liabilities and operating results of this business are
    reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated
    statements of operations for all periods presented.


– During the second quarter of 2007, we
    announced our decision to exit the remaining Interconnect
    Technologies (ITD) business reported within the Electronic
    Systems segment. Sales for this business in the year ended
    December 31, 2007 was $14 million. We completed the
    shut-down during the third quarter of 2007 and costs associated
    with the shut-down were not material. The results of this
    business are reported as discontinued operations in the
    consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.

CONTRACTS

We generate the majority of our business from long-term
    government contracts for development, production, and support
    activities. Government contracts typically include the following
    cost elements: direct material, labor and subcontracting costs,
    and certain indirect costs including allowable general and
    administrative costs. Unless otherwise specified in a contract,
    costs billed to contracts with the U.S. Government are
    determined under the requirements of the Federal Acquisition
    Regulation (FAR) and CAS regulations as allowable and allocable
    costs. Examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the
    U.S. Government in accordance with the requirements of the
    FAR and CAS regulations include, but are not limited to, certain
    legal costs, lobbying costs, charitable donations, interest
    expense and advertising costs.

Our long-term contracts typically fall into one of two broad
    categories:

Flexibly Priced Contracts

– Includes both
    cost-type and fixed-price incentive contracts. Cost-type
    contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s
    allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit.
    Cost-type contracts generally require that the contractor use
    its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some
    specified time and some stated dollar limitation. Fixed-price
    incentive contracts also provide for reimbursement of the
    contractor’s allowable costs, but are subject to a
    cost-share limit which affects profitability. Fixed-price
    incentive contracts effectively become firm fixed-price
    contracts once the cost-share limit is reached.

-30-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Firm Fixed-Price Contracts

– A firm fixed-price
    contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is
    agreed to for a price that is a pre-determined, negotiated
    amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of
    costs incurred by the contractor.

Time-and-materials

contracts are considered firm fixed-price contracts as they
    specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged.

Contract Fees

– Negotiated contract fee
    structures, for both flexibly priced and fixed-price contracts
    include, but are not limited to: fixed-fee amounts, cost sharing
    arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost
    target performance, positive award fees, and negative penalty
    arrangements. Profit margins may vary materially depending on
    the negotiated contract fee arrangements,
    percentage-of-completion of the contract, the achievement of
    performance objectives, and the stage of performance at which
    the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and
    award fee contracts, is finally determined.

Award Fees

– Certain contracts contain
    provisions consisting of award fees based on performance
    criteria such as cost, schedule, quality, and technical
    performance. Award fees are determined and earned based on an
    evaluation by the customer of the company’s performance
    against such negotiated criteria. Fees that can be reasonably
    assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the
    performance period of the contract. Award fee contracts are
    widely used throughout our operating segments. Examples of
    significant long-term contracts with substantial negotiated
    award fee amounts are the Global Hawk Engineering and
    Manufacturing Development and the majority of satellite
    contracts.

Compliance and Monitoring

– We monitor our
    policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a
    regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar
    terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable
    government regulations. In addition, costs incurred and
    allocated to contracts with the U.S. Government are
    routinely audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS

Revenue
    Recognition

Overview

– We derive the majority of our
    business from long-term contracts for the production of goods
    and services provided to the federal government, which are
    accounted for in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for
    construction-type and production-type contracts and federal
    government contractors. We classify contract revenues as product
    sales or service revenues depending on the predominant
    attributes of the relevant underlying contracts. We also enter
    into contracts that are not associated with the federal
    government, such as contracts to provide certain services to
    non-federal government customers. We account for those contracts
    in accordance with the relevant revenue recognition GAAP.

We consider the nature of these contracts and the types of
    products and services provided when determining the proper
    accounting method for a particular contract.

Percentage-of-Completion Accounting

– We
    generally recognize revenues from our long-term contracts under
    the cost-to-cost or the units-of-delivery measures of the
    percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The
    percentage-of-completion method recognizes income as work on a
    contract progresses. For most contracts, sales are calculated
    based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to
    total estimated costs at completion of the contract. For certain
    contracts with large up-front purchases of material, primarily
    in the Shipbuilding segment, sales are generally calculated
    based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to
    total

-31-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

estimated direct labor costs. The units-of-delivery measure is a
    modification of the percentage-of-completion method, which
    recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer
    generally using unit sales values in accordance with the
    contract terms. We estimate profit as the difference between
    total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract
    and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on
    deliveries.

The use of the percentage-of-completion method depends on our
    ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the
    design, manufacture, and delivery of our products and services.
    Such costs are typically incurred over a period of several
    years, and estimation of these costs requires the use of
    judgment. We record sales under cost-type contracts as costs are
    incurred.

Many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives
    based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that
    may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product. These
    incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be
    earned or penalties to be incurred. Incentives and award fees
    that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are
    recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentives
    and award fees that are not reasonably assured or cannot be
    reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time
    as a reasonable estimate can be made.

Other changes in estimates of contract sales, costs, and profits
    are recognized using the cumulative

catch-up

method of accounting. This method recognizes in the current
    period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior
    periods. Hence, the effect of the changes on future periods of
    contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate
    had been the original estimate. A significant change in an
    estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect
    on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Certain Service Contracts

– We generally
    recognize revenue under contracts to provide services to
    non-federal government customers when services are performed.
    Service contracts include operations and maintenance contracts,
    and outsourcing-type arrangements, primarily in Information
    Systems and Technical Services. We generally recognize revenue
    under such contracts on a straight-line basis over the period of
    contract performance, unless evidence suggests that the revenue
    is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different
    pattern. Costs incurred under these service contracts are
    expensed as incurred, except that direct and incremental

set-up

costs
    are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement.
    Operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate
    from period to period, particularly in the earlier phases of the
    contract.

Contracts that include more than one type of product or service
    are accounted for under the relevant GAAP for revenue
    arrangements with multiple-elements. Accordingly, for applicable
    arrangements, revenue recognition includes the proper
    identification of separate units of accounting and the
    allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair
    values.

Cost Estimation

– The cost estimation process
    requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional
    knowledge and experience of our engineers, program managers, and
    financial professionals. Factors that are considered in
    estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract
    recovery include the availability, productivity and cost of
    labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed,
    the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the
    effect of any delays in performance, the availability and timing
    of funding from the customer, and the recoverability of any
    claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant
    change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a
    material effect on our consolidated financial position or
    results of operations. We update our contract cost estimates at
    least annually and more frequently as determined by events or
    circumstances. We generally review and reassess our cost and
    revenue estimates for each significant contract on a quarterly
    basis.

We record a provision for the entire loss on the contract in the
    period the loss is determined when estimates of total costs to
    be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to
    be earned. We offset loss provisions first against costs that
    are included in unbilled accounts receivable or inventoried
    assets, with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities.

Purchase
    Accounting and Goodwill

Overview

– We allocate the purchase price of an
    acquired business to the underlying tangible and intangible
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their
    respective fair market values, with the excess recorded as
    goodwill. Such fair market value assessments require judgments
    and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and
    other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ
    materially from original estimates. For acquisitions completed
    through December 31, 2008, we recorded adjustments to fair
    value assessments to goodwill over the purchase price allocation
    period (typically not exceeding twelve months), and adjusted
    goodwill for the resolution of income tax uncertainties which
    extended beyond the purchase price allocation period.

In 2009, we implemented new GAAP accounting guidance related to
    business combinations that impacts how we record adjustments to
    fair values included in the purchase price allocation and the
    resolution of income tax uncertainties. For acquisitions
    completed after January 1, 2009, any adjustments to the
    fair value of purchased assets and subsequent resolution of
    uncertain tax positions are recognized in net earnings, rather
    than as adjustments to goodwill.

Acquisition Accruals

– We establish certain
    accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies
    from our acquisitions and divestitures. We have recorded these
    accruals and subsequent adjustments during the purchase price
    allocation period for acquisitions and as events occur for
    divestitures. The accruals were determined based upon the terms
    of the purchase or sales agreements and, in most cases, involve
    a significant degree of judgment. We recorded these accruals in
    accordance with our interpretation of the terms of the purchase
    or sale agreements, known facts, and an estimation of probable
    future events based on our experience.

Tests for Impairment

– We perform impairment
    tests for goodwill as of November 30th of each year,
    or when evidence of potential impairment exists.  We
    record a charge to operations when we determine that an
    impairment has occurred. In order to test for potential
    impairment, we use a discounted cash flow analysis, corroborated
    by comparative market multiples where appropriate.

The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis
    requiring judgment are the projected results of operations,
    weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and terminal value
    assumptions. The WACC takes into account the relative weights of
    each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and
    debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted
    as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with
    longer term contracts and barriers to market entry. The terminal
    value assumptions are applied to the final year of the
    discounted cash flow model.

Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a
    business’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded
    goodwill, differences in assumptions may have a material effect
    on the results of our impairment analysis.

Litigation,
    Commitments, and Contingencies

Overview

– We are subject to a range of claims,
    lawsuits, environmental and income tax matters, and
    administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these
    matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional
    knowledge and experience of management and our internal and
    external legal counsel. In accordance with our practices
    relating to accounting for contingencies, we record amounts as
    charges to earnings after taking into consideration the facts
    and circumstances of each matter, including any settlement
    offers, and determine that it is probable that a liability has
    been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
    estimated. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us
    may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and
    circumstances become known.

Environmental Accruals

– We are subject to the
    environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which
    we conduct operations. We record a liability for the costs of
    expected environmental remediation obligations when we determine
    that it is probable we will incur such costs, and the amount of
    the liability can be reasonably estimated. When a range of costs
    is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate
    than another, we record the minimum amount of the range.

-33-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Factors which could result in changes to the assessment of
    probability, range of estimated costs, and environmental
    accruals include: modification of planned remedial actions,
    increase or decrease in the estimated time required to
    remediate, discovery of more extensive contamination than
    anticipated, results of efforts to involve other legally
    responsible parties, financial insolvency of other responsible
    parties, changes in laws and regulations or contractual
    obligations affecting remediation requirements, and improvements
    in remediation technology. Although we cannot predict whether
    new information gained as projects progress will materially
    affect the estimated liability accrued, we do not anticipate
    that future remediation expenditures will have a material
    adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations,
    or cash flows.

Litigation Accruals

– Litigation accruals are
    recorded as charges to earnings when management, after taking
    into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter,
    including any settlement offers, has determined that it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate resolution of
    any exposure to us may vary from earlier estimates as further
    facts and circumstances become known. Based upon the information
    available, we believe that the resolution of any of these
    various claims and legal proceedings would not have a material
    adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations, or cash flows.

Uncertain Tax Positions –

In 2007, we adopted a
    new accounting standard related to uncertain tax positions, and
    made a comprehensive review of our portfolio of uncertain tax
    positions at the date of adoption. Only tax positions meeting
    the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold may be recognized
    or continue to be recognized in the financial statements. The
    timing and amount of accrued interest is determined by the
    applicable tax law associated with an underpayment of income
    taxes. If a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory
    threshold to avoid payment of penalties, we recognize an expense
    for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is
    claimed in our tax return. We recognize interest accrued related
    to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Penalties,
    if probable and reasonably estimable, are recognized as a
    component of income tax expense. See Note 12 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8.
    Under existing GAAP, prior to January 1, 2009, changes in
    accruals associated with uncertainties arising from the
    resolution of pre-acquisition contingencies of acquired
    businesses were charged or credited to goodwill; effective
    January 1, 2009, such changes will be recorded to income
    tax expense. Adjustments to other tax accruals are generally
    recorded in earnings in the period they are determined.

Retirement
    Benefits

Overview

– We annually evaluate assumptions
    used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair
    values of plan assets for our pension plans and other
    post-retirement benefits plans in consultation with our outside
    actuaries. In the event that we determine that plan amendments
    or changes in the assumptions are warranted, future pension and
    post-retirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease.

Assumptions

– The principal assumptions that
    have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position
    and results of operations are the discount rate, the expected
    long-term rate of return on plan assets, the health care cost
    trend rate and the estimated fair market value of plan assets.
    For certain plan assets where the fair market value is not
    readily determinable, such as real estate, private equity, and
    hedge funds, estimates of fair value are determined using the
    best information available.

Discount Rate

– The discount rate represents
    the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of
    future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle
    the pension and post-retirement benefit obligations. The
    discount rate is generally based on the yield of high-quality
    corporate fixed-income investments. At the end of each year, the
    discount rate is primarily determined using the results of bond
    yield curve models based on a portfolio of high quality bonds
    matching the notional cash inflows with the expected benefit
    payments for each significant benefit plan. Taking into
    consideration the factors noted above, our weighted-average
    pension composite discount rate was 6.03 percent at
    December 31, 2009, and 6.25 percent at
    December 31, 2008. Holding all other assumptions constant,
    and since net actuarial gains and losses were in excess of the
    10 percent accounting corridor in 2009, an increase or
    decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption
    for 2009

-34-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

would have decreased or increased pension and post-retirement
    benefit expense for 2009 by approximately $80 million, of
    which $4 million relates to post-retirement benefits, and
    decreased or increased the amount of the benefit obligation
    recorded at December 31, 2009, by approximately
    $800 million, of which $70 million relates to
    post-retirement benefits. The effects of hypothetical changes in
    the discount rate for a single year may not be representative
    and may be asymmetrical or nonlinear for future years because of
    the application of the accounting corridor. The accounting
    corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net
    gains and losses is not required. Due to adverse capital market
    conditions in 2008 our pension plan assets experienced a
    negative return of approximately 16 percent in 2008. As a
    result, substantially all of our plans experienced net actuarial
    losses outside the 10 percent accounting corridor at the
    end of 2008, thus requiring accumulated gains and losses to be
    amortized to expense. As a result of this condition, sensitivity
    of net periodic costs to changes in the discount rate were much
    higher in 2009 than was the case in 2008 and prior. This
    condition is expected to continue into the near future.

Expected Long-Term Rate of Return –

The
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets represents the
    average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested in a
    specified target asset allocation to provide for anticipated
    future benefit payment obligations. For 2009 and 2008, we
    assumed an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of
    8.5 percent. An increase or decrease of 25 basis
    points in the expected long-term rate of return assumption for
    2009, holding all other assumptions constant, would increase or
    decrease our pension and post-retirement benefit expense for
    2009 by approximately $48 million.

Health Care Cost Trend Rates

– The health care
    cost trend rates represent the annual rates of change in the
    cost of health care benefits based on estimates of health care
    inflation, changes in health care utilization or delivery
    patterns, technological advances, and changes in the health
    status of the plan participants. For 2009, we assumed an
    expected initial health care cost trend rate of 7 percent
    and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent
    reached in 2014. In 2008, we assumed an expected initial health
    care cost trend rate of 7.5 percent and an ultimate health
    care cost trend rate of 5 percent be reached in 2014.

Differences in the initial through the ultimate health care cost
    trend rates within the range indicated below would have had the
    following impact on 2009 post-retirement benefit results:

Cost of
    Product Sales and Service Revenues

2009 –

Cost of product sales in 2009 increased
    $1.1 billion, or 7 percent, over 2008 primarily as a
    result of the higher sales volume described above. The increase
    in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was
    primarily due to higher GAAP pension costs across all of our
    businesses.

Cost of service revenues in 2009 increased $654 million, or
    6 percent, over 2008 primarily as a result of the higher
    sales volume described above. The increase in cost of service
    revenues as a percentage of service revenues was primarily due
    to higher U.S. GAAP pension costs across all of our
    businesses.

2008 –

Cost of product sales in 2008 increased
    $1.2 billion, or 8 percent, over 2007 and increased
    170 basis points as a percentage of product sales over the
    same period due largely to the sales volume increase described
    above. The increase in cost of product sales as a percentage of
    product sales is primarily due to cost growth at the Gulf Coast
    shipyards. In 2008, we recorded a net charge of
    $263 million on LHD-8 and other Shipbuilding programs, as
    well as additional costs for work delays at a subcontractor on
    the LPD program as a result of Hurricane Ike.

-36-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Cost of service revenues in 2008 increased $871 million, or
    9 percent, over 2007 primarily due to the sales volume
    increase described above. The 70 basis points increase in
    cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues is
    primarily due to lower performance in the Civil Systems business
    area in Information Systems.

See the Segment Operating Results section below for further
    information.

General and Administrative Expenses

– In
    accordance with industry practice and the regulations that
    govern the cost accounting requirements for government
    contracts, most general corporate expenses incurred at both the
    segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and
    allocable costs on government contracts. For most components of
    the company, these costs are allocated to contracts in progress
    on a systematic basis, and contract performance factors include
    this cost component as an element of cost. General and
    administrative expenses primarily relate to segment operations.
    General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total
    sales and service revenues decreased from 9.7 percent in
    2008 to 9.3 percent in 2009, primarily as a result of lower
    corporate overhead costs and a gain resulting from a legal
    settlement. General and administrative expenses as a percentage
    of total sales and service revenues decreased from
    10.1 percent in 2007 to 9.7 percent in 2008 primarily
    as a result of costs remaining relatively constant while
    revenues increased over the same period in 2007.

Goodwill Impairment –

In 2008, we recorded a
    non-cash charge totaling $3.1 billion at Aerospace Systems
    and Shipbuilding. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8.

Operating
    Income (Loss)

We consider operating income to be an important measure for
    evaluating our operating performance and, as is typical in the
    industry, we define operating income as revenues less the
    related cost of producing the revenues and general and
    administrative expenses. We also further evaluate operating
    income for each of the business segments in which we operate.

We internally manage our operations by reference to
    “segment operating income.” Segment operating income
    is defined as operating income before unallocated expenses and
    net pension adjustment, neither of which affect the segments,
    and the reversal of royalty income, which is classified as
    “other, net” for financial reporting purposes. Segment
    operating income is one of the key metrics we use to evaluate
    operating performance. Segment operating income is not, however,
    a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and may not be
    defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner.

Segment
    Operating Income (Loss)

2009 –

Segment operating income in 2009 was
    $2.9 billion as compared with segment operating loss of
    $299 million in 2008 and segment operating income of
    $3.0 billion in 2007. The loss in 2008 was primarily due to
    a goodwill impairment charge totaling $3.1 billion at
    Aerospace Systems and Shipbuilding.

Unallocated
    Expenses

Unallocated expenses generally include the portion of corporate
    expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable
    CAS regulations and FAR, and therefore not allocated to the
    segments, for costs related to management and administration,
    legal, environmental, certain compensation and retiree benefits,
    and other expenses. Unallocated expenses for 2009 decreased
    $46 million, or 29 percent, as compared with 2008,
    primarily due to a gain resulting from a legal settlement, net
    of legal provisions and related expenses, partially offset by
    higher costs related to environmental remediation and
    post-retirement employee benefits. Unallocated expenses

-37-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

for 2008 decreased $52 million, or 25 percent, as
    compared with 2007 primarily due to $88 million in higher
    legal and investigative provisions recorded in 2007, partially
    offset by an increase in environmental, health and welfare, and
    other unallocated corporate costs in 2008.

Net Pension Adjustment –

Net pension adjustment
    reflects the difference between pension expense determined in
    accordance with GAAP and pension expense allocated to the
    operating segments determined in accordance with CAS. The net
    pension adjustment in 2009 was an expense of $311 million,
    as compared with income of $263 million and
    $127 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The net
    pension expense in 2009 was primarily the result of negative
    returns on plan assets in 2008. The income in 2008 and 2007 was
    due to decreased GAAP pension expense, primarily resulting from
    better-than-estimated investment returns in prior years and
    higher discount rate assumptions.

Royalty Income Adjustment

– Royalty income is
    included in segment operating income and reclassified to other
    income for financial reporting purposes. See

Other, net

below.

Interest
    Expense


– Interest expense in 2009 decreased
    $14 million, or 5 percent, as compared with 2008. The
    decrease is primarily due to higher capitalized interest and
    lower interest rates.


– Interest expense in 2008 decreased
    $41 million, or 12 percent, as compared with 2007. The
    decrease is primarily due to the conversion and redemption of
    the mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock in April
    2008, which reduced the related dividends paid during 2008
    (which were recorded as interest expense in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of operations in Part II,
    Item 8). Lower LIBOR rates on the interest rate swap
    agreements also contributed to the decrease in interest expense.

Other,
    net

2009 –

Other, net for 2009 was $64 million
    income, an increase of $26 million as compared with 2008,
    primarily due to positive mark-to-market adjustments on
    investments in marketable securities used as funding for
    non-qualified employee benefits and a gain from the recovery of
    a loan to an affiliate, partially offset by $60 million of
    royalty income from patent infringement settlements in 2008.

2008 –

Other, net for 2008 was $38 million
    income, an increase of $21 million as compared with 2007,
    primarily due to $60 million in royalty income from patent
    infringement settlements at Electronic Systems in 2008,
    partially offset by negative mark-to-market adjustments on
    investments in marketable securities used as a funding source
    for non-qualified employee benefits.

Federal
    and Foreign Income Taxes

2009 –

Our effective tax rate on earnings from
    continuing operations for 2009, was 30.6 percent compared
    with 33.8 percent in 2008 (excluding the non-cash,
    non-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $3.1 billion
    at Aerospace Systems and Shipbuilding). In 2009, we recognized
    net tax benefits of approximately $75 million primarily as
    a result of a final settlement with the IRS Office of Appeals
    and the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation
    (Joint Committee) related to our tax returns for the years ended

2001-2003.

2008 –

Our effective tax rate on earnings from
    continuing operations for 2008, was 33.8 percent (excluding
    the non-cash, non-deductible goodwill impairment charge of
    $3.1 billion at Aerospace Systems and Shipbuilding) as
    compared with 32.8 percent in 2007. In 2008, we recognized
    net tax benefits of $35 million primarily attributable to a
    settlement reached with the IRS and the Joint Committee with
    respect to the IRS audit of TRW tax returns for the years

1999-2002.

Discontinued
    Operations

2009 –

Earnings from discontinued operations,
    net of tax, was $113 million for 2009, compared with
    $117 million in 2008. The earnings were primarily
    attributable to the operating results and gain on disposition of
    the ASD, which was sold in December 2009. See Note 5 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Diluted
    Earnings (Loss) Per Share

2009 –

Diluted earnings per share from
    continuing operations in 2009 were $4.87 per share, as compared
    with $4.12 diluted loss per share in 2008. Earnings per share
    are based on weighted-average diluted shares outstanding of
    323.3 million for 2009 and weighted average basic shares
    outstanding of 334.5 million for 2008. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the potential dilutive effect of
    7.1 million shares from stock options, stock awards, and
    the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock were excluded from
    the computation of weighted average shares outstanding as the
    shares would have had an anti-dilutive effect. The goodwill
    impairment charge of $3.1 billion at Aerospace Systems and
    Shipbuilding reduced our 2008 diluted earnings per share from
    continuing operations by $9.15 per share.

2008 –

Diluted loss per share from continuing
    operations in 2008 was $4.12 per share, as compared with $5.01
    diluted earnings per share in 2007. Earnings per share are based
    on weighted-average basic shares outstanding of
    334.5 million for 2008 (which excludes potential dilutive
    shares as noted above) and weighted-average diluted shares
    outstanding of 354.3 million for 2007.

Net Cash
    Provided by Operating Activities

2009 –

Net cash provided by operating
    activities in 2009 was $2.1 billion compared with
    $3.2 billion in 2008 and reflects higher pension plan
    contributions and income tax payments. In 2009, we contributed
    $858 million to our pension plans, of which
    $800 million was voluntarily pre-funded, as compared with
    $320 million in 2008, of which $200 million was
    voluntarily pre-funded. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, was
    $1.3 billion in 2009, as compared with $719 million in
    2008. Income taxes paid in 2009 included $508 million
    resulting from the sale of ASD.

Net cash provided by operating activities for 2009 included
    $171 million of federal and state income tax refunds and
    $11 million of interest income.

2008 –

Net cash provided by operating
    activities in 2008 was $3.2 billion as compared to
    $2.9 billion in 2007 and reflects lower income tax payments
    and continued trade working capital reductions. Pension plan
    contributions totaled $320 million in 2008, of which
    $200 million was voluntarily pre-funded, and were
    comparable to 2007.

Net cash provided by operating activities for 2008 included
    $113 million of federal and state income tax refunds and
    $23 million of interest income.

SEGMENT
    OPERATING RESULTS

Basis of
    Presentation

Realignments –

In January 2009, we streamlined
    our organizational structure by reducing the number of operating
    segments from seven to five. The five segments are Aerospace
    Systems, which combines the former Integrated Systems and Space
    Technology segments; Electronic Systems; Information Systems,
    which combines the former Information Technology and Mission
    Systems segments; Shipbuilding; and Technical Services. Creation
    of the Aerospace Systems and Information Systems segments is
    intended to strengthen alignment with customers, improve our
    ability to execute on programs and win new business, and enhance
    our cost competitiveness.

During the first quarter of 2009, we realigned certain
    logistics, services, and technical support programs and
    transferred assets from the Information Systems and Electronic
    Systems segments to the Technical Services segment. This
    realignment is intended to strengthen our core capability in
    aircraft and electronics maintenance, repair and overhaul, life
    cycle optimization, and training and simulation services.

The sales and segment operating income in the following tables
    have been revised to reflect the above realignments for all
    periods presented.

During the first quarter of 2009, we transferred certain optics
    and laser programs from the Information Systems segment to the
    Aerospace Systems segment. We did not reclassify the prior year
    sales and segment operating income in the following tables to
    reflect this business transfer as the operating results of this
    business were not considered material.

KEY
    SEGMENT FINANCIAL MEASURES

Operating
    Performance Assessment and Reporting

We manage and assess the performance of our businesses based on
    our performance on individual contracts and programs obtained
    generally from government organizations using the financial
    measures referred to below, with consideration given to the
    Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments described
    on page 31. Based on this approach and the nature of our
    operations, the discussion of results of operations generally
    focuses around our five segments versus distinguishing between
    products and services. Product sales are predominantly generated
    in the Aerospace Systems, Electronic Systems and Shipbuilding
    segments, while the majority of our service revenues are
    generated by the Information Systems and Technical Services
    segments.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Sales and
    Service Revenues

Period-to-period sales reflect performance under new and ongoing
    contracts. Changes in sales and service revenues are typically
    expressed in terms of volume. Unless otherwise described, volume
    generally refers to increases (or decreases) in reported
    revenues due to varying production activity levels, delivery
    rates, or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes
    will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the
    margin rate for a particular contract.

Segment
    Operating Income

Segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance
    results of contracts within a business area or segment. Excluded
    from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with
    contract performance, including the portion of corporate
    expenses such as management and administration, legal,
    environmental, certain compensation and other retiree benefits,
    and other expenses not considered allowable or allocable under
    applicable CAS regulations and the FAR, and therefore not
    allocated to the segments. Changes in segment operating income
    are typically expressed in terms of volume, as discussed above,
    or performance. Performance refers to changes in contract margin
    rates. These changes typically relate to profit recognition
    associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion
    of the contract (EAC) that reflect improved (or deteriorated)
    operating performance on a particular contract. Operating income
    changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the
    time an EAC change is recorded. Operating income may also be
    affected by, among other things, the effects of workforce
    stoppages, the effects of natural disasters (such as hurricanes
    and earthquakes), resolution of disputed items with the
    customer, recovery of insurance proceeds, and other discrete
    events. At the completion of a long-term contract, any
    originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully
    utilized (such as warranty reserves) could also impact contract
    earnings. Where such items have occurred, and the effects are
    material, a separate description is provided.

For a more complete understanding of each segment’s product
    and services, see the business descriptions in Part I,
    Item 1.

2009 –

Aerospace Systems revenue increased
    $594 million, or 6 percent, as compared with 2008. The
    increase was primarily due to $201 million higher sales in
    Space Systems (SS), $201 million higher sales in Battle
    Management & Engagement Systems (BM&ES), and
    $191 million higher sales in Strike &
    Surveillance Systems (S&SS). The increase in SS was
    primarily due to the

ramp-up

of
    restricted programs awarded in 2008, partially offset by
    decreased sales volume on the National Polar-orbiting
    Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) and
    cancellation of the Transformational Satellite Communications
    System (TSAT) program. The increase in BM&ES was primarily
    due to higher sales volume on the Broad Area Maritime
    Surveillance (BAMS) Unmanned Aircraft System, the

E-2D

Advanced Hawkeye, and the EA-18G programs, partially offset by
    lower sales volume on the E2-C as the program is nearing
    completion. The increase in S&SS was primarily due to
    higher sales volume from Global Hawk High-Altitude
    Long-Endurance (HALE) Systems, F-35,

F/A-18,

and

B-2

programs, partially offset by decreased activity on the Kinetic
    Energy Interceptor (KEI) program, which was terminated for
    convenience in 2009, and the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile
    (ICBM) program.

-41-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

2008 –

Aerospace Systems revenue increased
    $591 million, or 6 percent, as compared with 2007. The
    increase was primarily due to $288 million higher sales in
    Advanced Products & Technology (AP&T),
    $233 million higher sales in S&SS, and
    $100 million higher sales in SS. The increase in AP&T
    was primarily due to higher sales volume associated with the
    N-UCAS program. The increase in S&SS was primarily due to
    higher sales volume on the Global Hawk HALE Systems, KEI, and
    B-2 programs, partially offset by lower sales volume on the F-35
    program and the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion
    Program (MP-RTIP). The increase in SS was primarily due to
    higher sales volume on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
    program, NPOESS, and restricted programs, partially offset by
    lower sales volume on the Advanced Extremely High Frequency
    (AEHF) and STSS programs, and termination of the Space Radar
    program in the second quarter of 2008.

Segment
    Operating Income

2009 –

Aerospace Systems operating income
    increased $655 million, or 157 percent, as compared
    with 2008. The increase was primarily due to a 2008 goodwill
    impairment charge of $570 million (see Note 10 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8),
    $61 million from the higher sales volume discussed above,
    and $24 million in improved program performance. The
    $24 million in improved program performance was principally
    due to $67 million in performance improvements in S&SS
    programs, primarily related to ICBM and Global Hawk HALE
    Systems, partially offset by $33 million in lower
    performance across various programs in SS and BM&ES.

2008 –

Aerospace Systems operating income
    decreased $503 million, or 55 percent, as compared
    with 2007. The decrease in operating income was due to a
    $570 million goodwill impairment charge and a
    $27 million favorable adjustment in 2007 related to the
    settlement of prior years’ overhead costs, partially offset
    by $59 million from the higher sales volume described above
    and $35 million in net performance improvements associated
    with risk retirement in several key programs within S&SS,
    AP&T, and various restricted programs.

2009 –

Electronic Systems revenue increased
    $623 million, or 9 percent, as compared with 2008. The
    increase was primarily due to $225 million in higher sales
    in Aerospace Systems (AS), $128 million higher sales in
    Space & I&SR Systems, $89 million higher
    sales in Defensive Systems (DS), $80 million in higher
    sales in Navigation Systems (NS) and $59 million in higher
    sales in Naval & Marine Systems (N&MS). The
    increase in AS was due to higher volume on the F-35 Low Rate
    Initial Production (LRIP), B-52 Sustainment and intercompany
    programs. The increase in Space & ISR Systems was due
    to higher volume on the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS)
    follow-on production program. The increase in DS was due to
    higher deliveries associated with the Large Aircraft Infrared
    Countermeasures (LAIRCM) program. The increase in N&MS was
    due to higher volume on power and propulsion systems for the

Virginia

-class submarine program. The increase in NS was
    due to higher volume on Inertial and Fiber Optic Gyro Navigation
    Programs.

2008 –

Electronic Systems revenue increased
    $582 million, or 9 percent, as compared with 2007. The
    increase was primarily due to $241 million in higher sales
    in AS, $165 million in higher sales in Land Forces,
    $69 million in higher sales in NS, and $60 million in
    higher sales in DS. The increase in AS was due to higher
    deliveries of upgraded F-16 international fire control radar
    systems and increased volume on the MESA Korea program. The
    increase in Land Forces was due to higher volume on vehicular
    intercommunication systems (VIS) and the Ground/Air Task
    Oriented Radar (G/ATOR) radar program. The increase in NS was
    due to higher volume associated with Inertial Navigation
    programs. The increase in DS was due to higher deliveries
    associated with the LAIRCM program.

    Operating Income

2009 –

Electronic Systems operating income
    increased $22 million, or 2 percent, as compared with
    2008. The increase was primarily due to $79 million from
    the higher sales volume discussed above, partially offset by
    $57 million in higher unfavorable performance adjustments
    in 2009. The higher unfavorable performance adjustments in 2009
    were due to adjustments of $98 million in Government
    Systems, primarily on the Flats Sequencing System postal
    automation program, partially offset by favorable performance
    adjustments in restricted Aerospace Systems programs and Land
    Forces programs. Operating performance adjustments in 2008
    included royalty income of $60 million and a
    $20 million charge for the MESA Wedgetail program as
    discussed below.

2008 –

Electronic Systems operating income
    increased $138 million, or 17 percent, as compared
    with 2007. The increase in operating income was primarily due to
    $78 million from the higher sales volume described above
    and $60 million in royalty income resulting from patent
    infringement settlements at NS. The 2008 operating income
    included a charge of $20 million for our MESA Wedgetail
    program associated with potential liquidated damages arising
    from the prime contractor’s announced schedule delay in
    completing the program. The 2007 operating income included a
    charge of $27 million for the F-16 Block 60
    fixed-price development combat avionics program.

2009 –

Information Systems revenue increased
    $406 million, or 5 percent, as compared with 2008. The
    increase was primarily due to $287 million in higher sales
    in Intelligence Systems and $201 million in higher sales in
    Defense Systems, partially offset by $98 million in lower
    sales in Civil Systems. The increase in Intelligence Systems was
    primarily due to program growth on the Counter Narco-Terrorism
    Program Office, Guardrail Common Sensor System IDIQ and certain
    restricted programs, partially offset by lower sales volume on
    the Navstar Global Positioning System Operational Control
    Segment (GPS OCX) program. The increase in Defense Systems was
    primarily driven by program growth on Trailer Mounted Support
    System, Airborne and Maritime/Fixed Stations Joint Tactical
    Radio Systems and Battlefield Airborne Communications Node
    (BACN) activities, partially offset by fewer delivery orders on
    the Force XXI Battle Brigade and Below (FBCB2) I-Kits program.
    The decrease in Civil Systems was primarily driven by lower
    volume on the New York City Wireless (NYCWiN) and Virginia IT
    outsourcing (VITA) programs.

2008 –

Information Systems revenue increased
    $447 million, or 6 percent, as compared with 2007. The
    increase was primarily due to higher sales volume on the Navstar
    GPS OCX, Counter-Rocket Artillery Mortar, Command Post Platform
    and Joint National Integration Center Research and Development
    programs, partially offset by lower sales volume on the Space
    Based Surveillance System, F-22 and F-35 programs, and the
    winding down of various commercial, state and local programs.

Segment
    Operating Income

2009 –

Information Systems operating income
    increased $2 million as compared with 2008. The increase
    was primarily due to $30 million from the higher sales
    volume discussed above, offset by $37 million of
    non-recurring costs associated with the sale of ASD and
    unfavorable performance results in Civil Systems (CSD) programs,
    principally due to the VITA outsourcing program for the
    Commonwealth of Virginia.

2008 –

Information Systems operating income
    decreased $96 million, or 13 percent, as compared with
    2007. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by
    lower performance results, primarily due to a

-43-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

$57 million negative performance adjustment in the NYCWiN
    program recorded in the third quarter of 2008 in CSD. The
    adjustment included provisions related to a key supplier as well
    as a revised estimate of cost to complete the program. The
    decrease in operating income as a percentage of sales reflected
    lower performance for Defense Systems programs, including higher
    planned internal investment for a new business opportunity, and
    final allocation of current and prior year overhead items.

2009 –

Shipbuilding revenue increased
    $68 million as compared with 2008. The increase was due to
    $180 million higher sales in Submarines, $58 million
    higher sales in Expeditionary Warfare and $39 million
    higher sales in Aircraft Carriers, partially offset by
    $113 million lower sales in Fleet Support and
    $109 million lower sales in Surface Combatants. The
    increase in Submarines was primarily due to higher sales volume
    on the construction of the

Virginia

-class submarines. The
    increase in Expeditionary Warfare was due to higher sales volume
    in the LPD program due to production

ramp-ups,

partially offset by the delivery of the LHD 8. The decrease in
    Fleet Support was primarily due to the redelivery of the USS

Toledo

submarine in the first quarter of 2009 and
    decreased carrier fleet support services. The decrease in
    Surface Combatants was primarily due to lower sales volume on
    the DDG 51 program.

2008 –

Shipbuilding revenues increased
    $357 million, or 6 percent, as compared with 2007. The
    increase was primarily due to $254 million higher sales in
    Aircraft Carriers, $178 million higher sales in Surface
    Combatants, and $112 million higher sales in Fleet Support,
    partially offset by $184 million lower sales in
    Expeditionary Warfare. The increase in Aircraft Carriers was
    primarily due to higher sales volume on the

Gerald R.
    Ford

, USS

Enterprise

Extended Dry-docking Selected
    Restricted Availability (EDSRA), and USS

Theodore Roosevelt

Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH), partially offset by
    lower volume on the USS

Carl Vinson

. The increase in
    Surface Combatants was primarily due to higher sales volume in
    the DDG 51 and DDG 1000 programs. The increase in Fleet Support
    was primarily due to the consolidation of AMSEC in the 2008
    period. Expeditionary Warfare sales for 2008 were negatively
    impacted by a contract adjustment of $134 million on the
    LHD 8 program and the impact of Hurricane Gustav, partially
    offset by higher sales in the LPD program. In 2007, all programs
    at the Pascagoula, Mississippi facility were negatively impacted
    by a labor strike.

Segment
    Operating Income (Loss)

2009 –

Shipbuilding operating income was
    $299 million as compared with operating loss of
    $2.3 billion in 2008. The increase was primarily due to the
    2008 goodwill impairment charge of $2.5 billion (See
    Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8), and improved performance in
    Expeditionary Warfare as compared to 2008. In 2008, the
    Expeditionary Warfare business had net negative performance
    adjustments of $263 million due principally to adjustments
    on the LHD 8 contract, cost growth and schedule delays on the
    LPD program and the effects of Hurricane Ike on a
    subcontractor’s performance.

2008 –

Shipbuilding operating loss was
    $2.3 billion as compared with operating income of
    $538 million in the same period of 2007. The decrease was
    due to a goodwill impairment charge of $2.5 billion, and
    $366 million in net lower performance results, partially
    offset by the higher sales volume described above. The decrease
    in performance results was primarily due to $263 million in
    net performance adjustments on LHD 8 and other programs in 2008,
    cost growth and schedule delays on several LPD ships resulting
    primarily from the effects of Hurricane Ike on an LPD
    subcontractor (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8),

2009 –

Technical Services revenue increased
    $241 million, or 10 percent, as compared with 2008.
    The increase was primarily due to $245 million higher sales
    in the Life Cycle Optimization & Engineering Group
    (LCOE), and $74 million higher sales in the
    Training & Simulation Group (TSG), offset by
    $72 million in lower sales for the Systems Support Group
    (SSG). The increase in LCOE was due to increased task orders for
    the Counter Narcoterrorism Technology Program Office and higher
    demand on the Hunter Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) programs
    in support of the DoD’s surge in Intelligence,
    Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) initiatives. The increase
    in TSG was due to higher volume on various training and
    simulation programs including the Joint Warfighting Center
    Support, Saudi Arabian National Guard Modernization and
    Training, Global Linguists Solutions, National
    Level Exercise 2009 and African Contingency Operations
    Training Assistance programs. These increases were partially
    offset by lower 2009 sales in SSG due to the completion of the
    Joint Base Operations Support (JBOSC) program in 2008.

2008 –

Technical Services revenue increased
    $113 million or 5 percent, as compared with 2007. The
    increase was primarily due to $93 million in higher sales
    in LCOE and $42 million in higher sales in TSG, partially
    offset by $26 million in lower sales in SSG. The increase
    in LCOE was associated with higher volume in the Hunter CLS and
    B-2 Stealth Bomber programs. The increase in TSG was primarily
    due to higher sales volume from various new training and
    simulation program awards. The decrease in SSG was primarily
    associated with the completion of the JBOSC program.

Segment
    Operating Income

2009 –

Operating income at Technical Services
    increased $17 million, or 12 percent, as compared with
    2008. The increase was primarily due to the higher sales volume
    discussed above and $3 million from performance
    improvements across numerous programs.

2008 –

Technical Services operating income
    increased $5 million, or 4 percent, as compared with
    2007. The increase in operating income was due to higher sales
    volume was partially offset by a higher level of planned
    internal investment and final allocation of current and prior
    year overhead items.

BACKLOG

Total backlog at December 31, 2009, was approximately
    $69.2 billion. Total backlog includes both funded backlog
    (firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the
    customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding is
    not currently contractually obligated by the customer). Unfunded
    backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded IDIQ
    orders. For multi-year services contracts with non-federal
    government customers having no stated contract values, backlog
    includes only the amounts committed by the customer.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating
    results into cash for deployment in growing our businesses and
    maximizing shareholder value. We actively manage our capital
    resources through working capital improvements, capital
    expenditures, strategic business acquisitions and divestitures,
    debt repayments, required and voluntary pension contributions,
    and returning cash to our shareholders through dividend payments
    and repurchases of common stock.

-46-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

We use various financial measures to assist in capital
    deployment decision making, including net cash provided by
    operations, free cash flow, net debt-to-equity, and net
    debt-to-capital. We believe these measures are useful to
    investors in assessing our financial performance.

The table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided
    by operating activities.

Free Cash
    Flow

Free cash flow represents cash from operating activities less
    capital expenditures and outsourcing contract and related
    software costs. Outsourcing contract and related software costs
    are similar to capital expenditures in that the contract costs
    represent incremental external costs or certain specific
    internal costs that are directly related to the contract
    acquisition and transition/set-up. These outsourcing contract
    and related software costs are deferred and expensed over the
    contract life. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure for
    investors as it reflects our ability to grow by funding
    strategic business acquisitions and return value to shareholders
    through repurchasing our shares and paying dividends.

Free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under
    GAAP, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies
    in the same manner. This measure should not be considered in
    isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in
    accordance with GAAP as indicators of performance.

Operating
    Activities

2009 –

Net cash provided by operating
    activities in 2009 decreased $1.1 billion as compared with
    2008, reflecting higher voluntary pension contributions and
    increased income taxes paid resulting from the sale of ASD.
    Pension plan contributions totaled $858 million in 2009, of
    which $800 million was voluntarily pre-funded.

In 2010, we expect to contribute the required minimum funding
    level of approximately $57 million to our pension plans and
    approximately $171 million to our other post-retirement
    benefit plans and we also expect to make additional voluntary
    pension contributions of approximately $300 million in the
    second quarter of 2010. We expect cash generated from operations
    for 2010 to be sufficient to service debt and contract
    obligations, finance capital expenditures, continue acquisition
    of shares under the share repurchase program, and continue
    paying dividends to the our shareholders. Although 2010 cash
    from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these
    obligations, we may borrow under credit facilities to
    accommodate timing differences in cash flows. We have a
    committed $2 billion revolving credit facility that is
    currently undrawn and that can be accessed on a

same-day

basis. Additionally, we believe we could access capital markets
    for debt financing for longer-term funding, under current market
    conditions, if needed.

2008 –

Net cash provided by operating
    activities in 2008 increased $321 million as compared with
    2007, and reflects lower income tax payments and continued trade
    working capital reductions. Pension plan contributions totaled
    $320 million in 2008, of which $200 million was
    voluntarily pre-funded, and were comparable to 2007. Net cash
    provided by operating activities for 2008 included
    $113 million of federal and state income tax refunds and
    $23 million of interest income.


– Cash provided by operating activities in
    2007 increased $1.1 billion as compared with 2006, and
    reflects lower pension contributions, higher net income, and
    continued trade working capital reductions. Pension plan
    contributions totaled $342 million in 2007, of which
    $200 million was voluntarily pre-funded compared with
    contributions of $1.2 billion in 2006, of which
    $800 million was voluntarily pre-funded. Net cash provided
    by operating activities for 2007 included the receipt of
    $125 million of insurance proceeds related to Hurricane
    Katrina, $52 million of federal and state income tax
    refunds, and $21 million of interest income.

Investing
    Activities

2009 –

Cash provided by investing activities
    was $867 million in 2009. During 2009, we received
    $1.65 billion in proceeds from the sale of ASD (see
    Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8), paid $68 million for
    outsourcing costs related to outsourcing services contracts, and
    paid $33 million to acquire Sonoma Photonics, Inc. and the
    assets from Swift Engineering’s Killer Bee Unmanned Air
    Systems product line (see Note 4 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8).

Capital expenditures in 2009 were $654 million and include
    $36 million of capitalized software costs.

2008 –

Cash used in investing activities was
    $626 million in 2008. During 2008, we received
    $175 million in proceeds from the sale of the
    Electro-Optical Systems business, spent $92 million for the
    acquisition of 3001 International, Inc. (see Notes 4 and 5
    to the consolidated financial statements in Part II,
    Item 8), paid $110 million for outsourcing costs
    related to outsourcing services contracts, and released
    $61 million of restricted cash related to the Gulf
    Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue Bonds (see
    Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8). We had $11 million in
    restricted cash as of December 31, 2008 related to the
    Xinetics Inc. purchase (see Note 4 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8).

Capital expenditures in 2008 were $681 million and include
    $23 million of capitalized software costs. Capital
    expenditure commitments at December 31, 2008, were
    approximately $554 million, which are expected to be paid
    with cash on hand.


– Cash used in investing activities was
    $1.4 billion in 2007. During 2007, we acquired Essex
    Corporation, Xinetics and the remaining 61 percent of
    Scaled Composites, LLC for approximately $690 million (see
    Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8), paid $137 million for
    outsourcing costs related to newly acquired outsourcing services
    contracts, and released $70 million of restricted cash
    related to the Gulf

Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue Bonds (see
    Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8) of which $60 million
    remained restricted as of December 31, 2007. This was
    partially offset by $11 million new restrictions related to
    the Xinetics purchase.

Capital expenditures in 2007 were $681 million, including
    $118 million to replace property damaged by Hurricane
    Katrina and $47 million of capitalized software costs.

Financing
    Activities

2009 –

Cash used in financing activities in
    2009 was $1.2 billion compared with $2 billion in
    2008. The $815 million decrease in cash used is primarily
    due to the $843 million in net proceeds from issuance of
    debt.

In July 2009, we issued $350 million of

5-year

and
    $500 million of

10-year

unsecured senior obligations. Interest on the notes is payable
    semi-annually in arrears at fixed rates of 3.70 percent and
    5.05 percent per annum. The notes will mature on
    August 1, 2014, and August 1, 2019, respectively.
    These senior notes are subject to redemption at our discretion
    at any time prior to maturity in whole or in part at the
    principal amount plus any make-whole premium and accrued and
    unpaid interest. The net proceeds from these notes are being
    used for general corporate purposes including debt repayment,
    acquisitions, share repurchases, pension plan funding, and
    working capital. A portion of the net proceeds was used to
    retire $400 million of 8 percent senior debt that
    matured in the third quarter of 2009.

2008 –

Cash used in financing activities in
    2008 was $2 billion compared to $1.5 billion in 2007.
    The $532 million increase is primarily due to
    $380 million more for common stock purchases and
    $171 million lower proceeds from stock option exercises.
    See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8 for a discussion concerning our common
    stock repurchases.

2007 –

Cash used in financing activities in
    2007 was $1.5 billion compared to $1.7 billion in
    2006. The $233 million decrease is primarily due to
    $922 million lower net repayments of long-term debt,
    partially offset by $350 million more common stock
    repurchases, $119 million lower proceeds from stock option
    exercises, $113 million higher net payments under lines of
    credits, and $102 million for higher dividends paid.

Share Repurchases –

We repurchased
    23.1 million, 21.4 million, and 15.4 million
    shares in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. See Note 7 to
    the consolidated financial statements in Part II,
    Item 8.

On December 31, 2009, Northrop Grumman Space &
    Mission Systems Corp. (NGS&MSC) (formerly TRW Inc.) was
    merged into Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NGSC) and NGSC
    became the

to NGS&MSC with respect to the debt previously issued by
    TRW Inc.

Credit
    Facility

We have a revolving credit agreement which provides for a
    five-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal
    amount of $2 billion and a maturity date of August 10,
    2012. The credit facility permits us to request additional
    lending commitments from the lenders under the agreement or
    other eligible lenders under certain circumstances, and thereby
    increase the aggregate principal amount of the lending
    commitments under the agreement by up to an additional
    $500 million. Our credit agreement contains a financial
    covenant relating to a maximum debt to capitalization ratio, and
    certain restrictions on additional asset liens, unless permitted
    by the agreement. As of December 31, 2009, we were in
    compliance with all covenants.

There were no borrowings during 2009 and a maximum of
    $300 million borrowed under this facility during 2008.
    There was no balance outstanding under this facility at
    December 31, 2009, and 2008.

Other
    Sources and Uses of Capital

Additional Capital –

We believe we can obtain
    additional capital, if necessary for long-term liquidity, from
    such sources as the public or private capital markets, the sale
    of assets, sale and leaseback of operating assets, and leasing
    rather than purchasing new assets. We have an effective shelf
    registration statement on file with the SEC.

We expect that cash on hand at the beginning of the year plus
    cash generated from operations and cash available under credit
    lines will be sufficient in 2010 to service debt, finance
    capital expansion projects, pay federal, foreign, and state
    income taxes, fund pension and other post retirement benefit
    plans, and continue paying dividends to shareholders. We will
    continue to provide the productive capacity to perform our
    existing contracts, prepare for future contracts, and conduct
    research and development in the pursuit of developing
    opportunities.

Financial Arrangements –

In the ordinary course
    of business, we use standby letters of credit and guarantees
    issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued by insurance
    companies principally to guarantee the performance on certain
    contracts and to support our self-insured workers’
    compensation plans. At December 31, 2009, there were
    $531 million of unused stand-by letters of credit,
    $178 million of bank guarantees, and $452 million of
    surety bonds outstanding.

A “purchase obligation” is defined as an agreement to
    purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally
    binding on us and that specifies all significant terms,
    including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed,
    minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate
    timing of the transaction. These amounts are primarily comprised
    of open purchase order commitments to vendors and subcontractors
    pertaining to funded contracts.

(2)

Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of total accrued
    workers’ compensation and environmental reserves, deferred
    compensation, and other miscellaneous liabilities, of which
    $115 million and $265 million of the environmental and
    workers’ compensation reserves, respectively, are recorded
    in other current liabilities. It excludes obligations for
    uncertain tax positions of $423 million, as the timing of
    the payments, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated.

Item 7A.  Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rates –

We are exposed to market risk,
    primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency
    exchange rates. Financial instruments subject to interest rate
    risk include variable-rate short-term borrowings under the
    credit agreement, and short-term investments. At
    December 31, 2009, substantially all outstanding borrowings
    were fixed-rate long-term debt obligations of which a
    significant portion are not callable until maturity. We have a
    modest exposure to interest rate risk resulting from the
    interest rate swap agreements described in Note 1 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8.
    During 2008, we entered into two forward-starting interest rate
    swap agreements with a notional value totaling $400 million
    to limit future interest rate exposure and designated them as
    cash flow hedges. These swaps were settled in June 2009. Our
    sensitivity to a 1 percent change in interest rates is tied
    to our $2 billion credit agreement, which had no balance
    outstanding at December 31, 2009 or 2008, and the
    aforementioned interest rate swap agreements. See Note 13
    to the consolidated financial statements in Part II,
    Item 8.

Derivatives –

We do not hold or issue
    derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We may
    enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure
    to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2009, and
    2008, one and four interest rate swap agreements, respectively,
    were in effect. See Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8.

Foreign Currency –

We enter into foreign
    currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exchange
    rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to
    suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. At
    December 31, 2009, and 2008, the amount of foreign currency
    forward contracts outstanding was not material. We do not
    consider the market risk exposure relating to foreign currency
    exchange to be material to the consolidated financial
    statements. See Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8.

    Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Northrop Grumman Corporation

Los Angeles, California

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of
    financial position of Northrop Grumman Corporation and
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of
    operations, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These
    financial statements and the financial statement schedule are
    the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
    statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    Northrop Grumman Corporation and subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
    schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
    financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 8, 2010 expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

– Northrop Grumman
    Corporation and its subsidiaries (Northrop Grumman or the
    company) provide technologically advanced, innovative products,
    services, and solutions in aerospace, electronics, information
    systems, shipbuilding and technical services. In January 2009,
    the company streamlined its organizational structure by reducing
    the number of operating segments from seven to five. The five
    segments are Aerospace Systems, which combines the former
    Integrated Systems and Space Technology segments; Electronic
    Systems; Information Systems, which combines the former
    Information Technology and Mission Systems segments;
    Shipbuilding; and Technical Services. Creation of the Aerospace
    Systems and Information Systems segments is intended to
    strengthen alignment with customers, improve the company’s
    ability to execute on programs and win new business, and enhance
    cost competitiveness. Product sales are predominantly generated
    in the Aerospace Systems, Electronic Systems and Shipbuilding
    segments, while the majority of the company’s service
    revenues are generated by the Information Systems and Technical
    Services segments.

Certain amounts in these financial statements have been
    reclassified to reflect the new organizational structure and
    segment realignments (See Notes 6 and 10).

Aerospace Systems

is a premier developer, integrator,
    producer and supporter of manned and unmanned aircraft,
    spacecraft, high-energy laser systems, microelectronics and
    other systems and subsystems critical to maintaining the
    nation’s security and leadership in technology. These
    systems are used, primarily by U.S. government customers,
    in many different mission areas including intelligence,
    surveillance and reconnaissance; communications; battle
    management; strike operations; electronic warfare; missile
    defense; earth observation; space science; and space exploration.

Electronic Systems

is a leading designer, developer,
    manufacturer and integrator of a variety of advanced electronic
    and maritime systems for national security and select
    non-defense applications. Electronic Systems provides systems to
    U.S. and international customers for such applications as
    airborne surveillance, aircraft fire control, precision
    targeting, electronic warfare, automatic test equipment,
    inertial navigation, integrated avionics, space sensing,
    intelligence processing, air and missile defense,
    communications, mail processing, biochemical detection, ship
    bridge control, and shipboard components.

Information Systems

is a leading global provider of
    advanced solutions for Department of Defense (DoD), national
    intelligence, federal civilian, state and local agencies, and
    commercial customers. Products and services are focused on the
    fields of command, control, communications, computers and
    intelligence; air and missile defense; airborne reconnaissance;
    intelligence processing; decision support systems;
    cybersecurity; information technology; and systems engineering
    and integration.

Shipbuilding

is the nation’s sole industrial
    designer, builder, and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft
    carriers and one of only two companies capable of designing and
    building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy.
    Shipbuilding is also one of the nation’s leading full
    service systems providers for the design, engineering,
    construction, and life cycle support of major surface ships for
    the U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, and international
    navies.

Technical Services

is a leading provider of logistics,
    infrastructure, and sustainment support, while also providing a
    wide array of technical services, including training and
    simulation.

As prime contractor, principal subcontractor, partner, or
    preferred supplier, Northrop Grumman participates in many
    high-priority defense and non-defense technology programs in the
    U.S. and abroad. Northrop Grumman conducts most of its
    business with the U.S. Government, principally the DoD. The
    company is therefore affected by, among other things, the
    federal budget process. The company also conducts business with
    local, state, and foreign governments and makes domestic and
    international commercial sales.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Principles of Consolidation

– The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of Northrop Grumman
    and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts, transactions,
    and profits among Northrop Grumman and its subsidiaries are
    eliminated in consolidation.

Accounting Estimates

– The company’s
    financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America
    (U.S. GAAP). The preparation thereof requires management to
    make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at
    the date of the financial statements as well as the reported
    amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
    Estimates have been prepared on the basis of the most current
    and best available information and actual results could differ
    materially from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

– As a defense contractor
    engaging in long-term contracts, the majority of the
    company’s business is derived from long-term contracts for
    production of goods, and services provided to the federal
    government. In accounting for these contracts, the company
    extensively utilizes the

cost-to-cost

and the

units-of-delivery

measures of the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting. Sales under cost-reimbursement contracts
    and construction-type contracts that provide for delivery at a
    low volume per year or a small number of units after a lengthy
    period of time over which a significant amount of costs have
    been incurred are accounted for using the

cost-to-cost

measure of the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting. Under this method, sales, including
    estimated earned fees or profits, are recorded as costs are
    incurred. For most contracts, sales are calculated based on the
    percentage that total costs incurred bear to total estimated
    costs at completion. For certain contracts with large up-front
    purchases of material, primarily in the Shipbuilding segment,
    sales are calculated based on the percentage that direct labor
    costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs. Sales
    under construction-type contracts that provide for delivery at a
    high volume per year are accounted for using the

units-of-delivery

measure of the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting. Under this method, sales are recognized as
    deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales
    values for delivered units in accordance with the contract
    terms. The company estimates profit as the difference between
    total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract
    and recognizes that profit over the life of the contract based
    on deliveries or as computed on the basis of the estimated final
    average unit costs plus profit. The company classifies contract
    revenues as product sales or service revenues depending upon the
    predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts.

Certain contracts contain provisions for price redetermination
    or for cost

and/or

performance incentives. Such redetermined amounts or incentives
    are included in sales when the amounts can reasonably be
    determined and estimated. Amounts representing contract change
    orders, claims, requests for equitable adjustment, or
    limitations in funding are included in sales only when they can
    be reliably estimated and realization is probable. In the period
    in which it is determined that a loss will result from the
    performance of a contract, the entire amount of the estimated
    ultimate loss is charged against income. Loss provisions are
    first offset against costs that are included in unbilled
    accounts receivable or inventoried costs, with any remaining
    amount reflected in liabilities. Changes in estimates of
    contract sales, costs, and profits are recognized using the
    cumulative

catch-up

method of accounting. This method recognizes in the current
    period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior
    periods. Hence, the effect of the changes on future periods of
    contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate
    had been the original estimate. A significant change in an
    estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect
    on the company’s consolidated financial position or results
    of operations.

Revenue under contracts to provide services to non-federal
    government customers are generally recognized when services are
    performed. Service contracts include operations and maintenance
    contracts, and outsourcing-type arrangements, primarily in the
    Information Systems segment. Revenue under such contracts is
    generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of
    contract performance, unless evidence suggests that the revenue
    is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different
    pattern. Costs incurred under these service contracts are
    expensed as incurred, except that direct and incremental

set-up

costs
    are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement.
    Operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate
    from period to period, particularly in the earlier phases of the
    contract. For contracts that include more than one type of

-65-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

product or service, revenue recognition includes the proper
    identification of separate units of accounting and the
    allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair
    values.

General and Administrative Expenses

– In
    accordance with industry practice and the regulations that
    govern the cost accounting requirements for government
    contracts, most general corporate expenses incurred at both the
    segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and
    allocable costs on government contracts. For most components of
    the company, these costs are allocated to contracts in progress
    on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include
    this cost component as an element of cost. General and
    administrative expenses primarily relate to segment operations.

Research and Development –

Company-sponsored
    research and development activities primarily include
    independent research and development (IR&D) efforts related
    to government programs. IR&D expenses are included in
    general and administrative expenses and are generally allocated
    to government contracts. Company-sponsored IR&D expenses
    totaled $610 million, $564 million, and
    $522 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.
    Expenses for research and development sponsored by the customer
    are charged directly to the related contracts.

Product Warranty Costs –

The company provides
    certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of
    non-conforming items for a specified period of time. Most of the
    company’s product warranties are provided under government
    contracts, the costs of which are incorporated into contract
    pricing. Accrued product warranty costs of $74 million and
    $71 million were included in other current liabilities at
    December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Environmental Costs

– Environmental liabilities
    are accrued when the company determines it is responsible for
    remediation costs and such amounts are reasonably estimable.
    When only a range of amounts is established and no amount within
    the range is more probable than another, the minimum amount in
    the range is recorded. Environmental liabilities are recorded on
    an undiscounted basis. At sites involving multiple parties, the
    company accrues environmental liabilities based upon its
    expected share of liability, taking into account the financial
    viability of other jointly liable parties. Environmental
    expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
    Capitalized expenditures relate to long-lived improvements in
    currently operating facilities. The company does not anticipate
    and record insurance recoveries before collection is probable.
    At December 31, 2009, and 2008, the company did not have
    any accrued receivables related to insurance reimbursements or
    recoveries for environmental matters.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments –

The
    company adopted the new GAAP accounting guidance relating to
    fair value measurements and disclosures effective
    January 1, 2008. The new guidance clarifies the definition
    of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value,
    establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to
    measure fair value and expands disclosures about the use of fair
    value measurements.

The valuation techniques utilized are based upon observable and
    unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data
    obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs
    reflect internal market assumptions. These two types of inputs
    create the following fair value hierarchy:

Level 1 –  Quoted prices for identical
    instruments in active markets.

Level 2 –  Quoted prices for similar instruments
    in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar
    instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived
    valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant
    value drivers are observable.

Level 3 –  Significant inputs to the valuation
    model are unobservable.

Derivative Financial Instruments –

Derivative
    financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in
    the financial statements and measured at fair value. Changes in
    the fair value of derivative financial instruments that qualify
    and are designated as fair value hedges are required to be
    recorded in income from continuing operations, while the
    effective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivative
    financial instruments that qualify and are

-66-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other
    comprehensive income. The company may use derivative financial
    instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign
    currency exchange risks and to balance its fixed and variable
    rate long-term debt portfolio. The company does not use
    derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
    purposes, nor does it use leveraged financial instruments.
    Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is
    considered minimal and is managed by requiring high credit
    standards for its counterparties and periodic settlements.

For derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging
    instruments, gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair
    value are reported in Other, net in the consolidated statements
    of operations.

Income Taxes

– Provisions for federal, foreign,
    state, and local income taxes are calculated on reported
    financial statement pre-tax income based on current tax law and
    include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from
    those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and
    liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently
    payable because certain items of income and expense are
    recognized in different time periods for financial reporting
    purposes than for income tax purposes. If a tax position does
    not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of
    penalties, the company recognizes an expense for the amount of
    the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed in the tax
    return of the company. The company recognizes interest accrued
    related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
    Penalties, if probable and reasonably estimable, are recognized
    as a component of income tax expense. State and local income and
    franchise tax provisions are allocable to contracts in process
    and, accordingly, are included in general and administrative
    expenses.

The company makes a comprehensive review of its portfolio of
    uncertain tax positions regularly. In this regard, an uncertain
    tax position represents the company’s expected treatment of
    a tax position taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be
    taken in a future tax return or claim, that has not been
    reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial
    reporting purposes. Until these positions are sustained by the
    taxing authorities, the company does not recognize the tax
    benefits resulting from such positions and reports the tax
    effects as a liability for uncertain tax positions in its
    consolidated statements of financial position.

Cash and cash equivalents

– For cash and cash
    equivalents, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to
    the short-term nature of these items. Cash and cash equivalents
    include short-term interest-earning debt instruments that mature
    in three months or less from the date purchased.

Marketable Securities

– At December 31,
    2009, and 2008, substantially all of the company’s
    investments in marketable securities were classified as

available-for-sale

or trading. For

available-for-sale

securities, any unrealized gains and losses are reported as a
    separate component of shareholders’ equity. Unrealized
    gains and losses on trading securities are included in Other,
    net in the consolidated statements of operations. Investments in
    marketable securities are recorded at fair value.

Accounts Receivable

– Accounts receivable
    include amounts billed and currently due from customers, amounts
    currently due but unbilled (primarily related to contracts
    accounted for under the

cost-to-cost

measure of the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting), certain estimated contract change
    amounts, claims or requests for equitable adjustment in
    negotiation that are probable of recovery, and amounts retained
    by the customer pending contract completion.

Inventoried Costs

– Inventoried costs primarily
    relate to work in process under fixed-price,

units-of-delivery

and fixed-priced-incentive contracts using labor dollars as the
    basis of the percentage-of-completion calculation. These costs
    represent accumulated contract costs less the portion of such
    costs allocated to delivered items. Accumulated contract costs
    include direct production costs, factory and engineering
    overhead, production tooling costs, and, for government
    contracts, allowable general and administrative expenses.
    According to the provisions of U.S. Government contracts,
    the customer asserts title to, or a security interest in,
    inventories related to such contracts as a result of contract
    advances, performance-based payments, and progress payments. In
    accordance with industry practice, inventoried costs are
    classified as a current asset and include amounts related to
    contracts

-67-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

having production cycles longer than one year. Product inventory
    primarily consists of raw materials and is stated at the lower
    of cost or market, generally using the average cost method.
    General corporate expenses and IR&D allocable to commercial
    contracts are expensed as incurred.

Outsourcing Contract Costs

– Costs on
    outsourcing contracts, including costs incurred for bid and
    proposal activities, are generally expensed as incurred.
    However, certain costs incurred upon initiation of an
    outsourcing contract are deferred and expensed over the contract
    life. These costs represent incremental external costs or
    certain specific internal costs that are directly related to the
    contract acquisition and transition/set-up. The primary types of
    costs that may be capitalized include labor and related fringe
    benefits, subcontractor costs, and travel costs.

Depreciable Properties

– Property, plant, and
    equipment owned by the company are depreciated over the
    estimated useful lives of individual assets. Costs incurred for
    computer software developed or obtained for internal use are
    capitalized and classified in machinery and other equipment.
    Most of these assets are depreciated using declining-balance
    methods, with the remainder using the straight-line method, with
    the following lives:

Years

Land improvements

2-45

Buildings and improvements

2-45

Machinery and other equipment

2-25

Capitalized software costs

3-5

Leasehold improvements

Length of lease

Leases

– The company uses its incremental
    borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification as
    capital or operating and defines the initial lease term to
    include renewal options determined to be reasonably assured. The
    company conducts operations primarily under operating leases.

Many of the company’s real property lease agreements
    contain incentives for tenant improvements, rent holidays, or
    rent escalation clauses. For incentives for tenant improvements,
    the company records a deferred rent liability and amortizes the
    deferred rent over the term of the lease as a reduction to rent
    expense. For rent holidays and rent escalation clauses during
    the lease term, the company records minimum rental expenses on a
    straight-line basis over the term of the lease. For purposes of
    recognizing lease incentives, the company uses the date of
    initial possession as the commencement date, which is generally
    when the company is given the right of access to the space and
    begins to make improvements in preparation of intended use.

Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangible
    Assets

– The company performs impairment tests for
    goodwill as of November 30th of each year, or when
    evidence of potential impairment exists. When it is determined
    that impairment has occurred, a charge to operations is
    recorded. Goodwill and other purchased intangible asset balances
    are included in the identifiable assets of the business segment
    to which they have been assigned. Any goodwill impairment, as
    well as the amortization of other purchased intangible assets,
    is charged against the respective business segments’
    operating income. Purchased intangible assets are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (see
    Note 10).

Self-Insurance Accruals

– Accruals for
    self-insured workers’ compensation totaling approximately
    $520 million and $523 million as of December 31,
    2009, and 2008, respectively are included in other liabilities.
    The company estimates the required liability for such claims on
    a discounted basis utilizing actuarial methods based on various
    assumptions, which include, but are not limited to, the
    company’s historical loss experience and projected loss
    development factors.

Litigation, Commitments, and Contingencies

–
    Amounts associated with litigation, commitments, and
    contingencies are recorded as charges to earnings when
    management, after taking into consideration the facts and
    circumstances of each matter, including any settlement offers,
    has determined that it is probable that a liability has been
    incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Retirement Benefits

– The company sponsors
    various pension plans covering substantially all employees. The
    company also provides post-retirement benefit plans other than
    pensions, consisting principally of health care and life
    insurance benefits, to eligible retirees and qualifying
    dependents. The liabilities and annual income or expense of the
    company’s pension and other post-retirement benefit plans
    are determined using methodologies that involve several
    actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the
    discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return (based on the
    market-related value of assets), and the medical cost experience
    trend rate (rate of growth for medical costs). The fair values
    of plan assets are determined based on prevailing market prices
    or estimated fair value for investments with no available quoted
    prices. Not all net periodic pension income or expense is
    recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is
    allocated to production as product costs, and a portion remains
    in inventory at the end of a reporting period. The
    company’s funding policy for pension plans is to
    contribute, at a minimum, the statutorily required amount to an
    irrevocable trust.

Stock Compensation

– All of the company’s
    stock compensation plans are considered equity plans, and
    compensation expense recognized is net of estimated forfeitures
    over the vesting period. The company issues stock options and
    stock awards, in the form of restricted performance stock rights
    and restricted stock rights, under its existing plans. The fair
    value of stock option grants are estimated on the date of grant
    using a

Black-Scholes

option-pricing model and expensed on a straight-line basis over
    the vesting period of the options, which is generally three to
    four years. The fair value of stock awards are determined based
    on the closing market price of the company’s common stock
    on the grant date and at each reporting date the amount of
    shares is adjusted to equal the amount ultimately expected to
    vest. Compensation expense for stock awards is expensed over the
    vesting period, usually three to five years.

Foreign Currency Translation

– For operations
    outside the U.S. that prepare financial statements in
    currencies other than the U.S. dollar, results of
    operations and cash flows are translated at average exchange
    rates during the period, and assets and liabilities are
    generally translated at

end-of-period

exchange rates. Translation adjustments are not material and are
    included as a separate component of accumulated other
    comprehensive loss in consolidated shareholders’ equity.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

– The
    components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are as
    follows:

Subsequent Events

– Management has evaluated

    February 8, 2010, for appropriate accounting treatment and
    disclosure.

Financial Statement Reclassification

– Certain
    amounts in the prior year financial statements and related notes
    have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation of
    the Advisory Services Division (ASD), formerly reported in the
    Information Systems segment and the Electro-optical Systems
    (EOS) business, formerly reported in the Electronic Systems
    segment, as discontinued operations (see Note 5) and
    the business operation realignments effective in 2009 (see
    Note 6).

ACCOUNTING
    STANDARD UPDATES

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued its final Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 168 –

The FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally

-69-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Accepted Accounting Principles a replacement of FASB
    Statement No. 162

. SFAS No. 168 made the FASB
    Accounting Standards Codification (the Codification) the single
    source of U.S. GAAP used by nongovernmental entities in the
    preparation of financial statements, except for rules and
    interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal
    securities laws, which are sources of authoritative accounting
    guidance for SEC registrants. The Codification is meant to
    simplify user access to all authoritative accounting guidance by
    reorganizing U.S. GAAP pronouncements into roughly 90
    accounting topics within a consistent structure; its purpose is
    not to create new accounting and reporting guidance. The
    Codification supersedes all existing non-SEC accounting and
    reporting standards and was effective for the company beginning
    July 1, 2009. Following SFAS No. 168, the Board
    will not issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB
    Staff Positions, or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts;
    instead, it will issue Accounting Standards Updates. The FASB
    will not consider Accounting Standards Updates as authoritative
    in their own right; these updates will serve only to update the
    Codification, provide background information about the guidance,
    and provide the bases for conclusions on the change(s) in the
    Codification. In the description of Accounting Standards Updates
    that follows, references in “italics” relate to
    Codification Topics and Subtopics, and their descriptive titles,
    as appropriate.

Accounting
    Standards Updates Not Yet Effective

In June 2009, an update was made to

“Consolidation – Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities.”

Among other things, the update
    replaces the calculation for determining which entities, if any,
    have a controlling financial interest in a variable interest
    entity (VIE) from a quantitative based risks and rewards
    calculation, to a qualitative approach that focuses on
    identifying which entities have the power to direct the
    activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s
    economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the
    VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE. The update
    also requires ongoing assessments as to whether an entity is the
    primary beneficiary of a VIE (previously, reconsideration was
    only required upon the occurrence of specific events), modifies
    the presentation of consolidated VIE assets and liabilities, and
    requires additional disclosures about a company’s
    involvement in VIEs. This update will be effective for the
    company beginning January 1, 2010. Management is currently
    evaluating the effect that adoption of this update will have, if
    any, on the company’s consolidated financial position and
    results of operations when it becomes effective in 2010.

In October 2009, an update was made to

“Revenue
    Recognition – Multiple Deliverable Revenue
    Arrangements.”

This update removes the

objective-and-reliable-evidence-of-fair-value

criterion from the separation criteria used to determine whether
    an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more
    than one unit of accounting, replaces references to “fair
    value” with “selling price” to distinguish from
    the fair value measurements required under the

“Fair
    Value Measurements and Disclosures”

guidance, provides
    a hierarchy that entities must use to estimate the selling
    price, eliminates the use of the residual method for allocation,
    and expands the ongoing disclosure requirements. This update is
    effective for the company beginning January 1, 2011 and can
    be applied prospectively or retrospectively. Adoption is not
    expected to materially impact the company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows directly
    when it becomes effective, as the company will not elect
    retrospective adoption. However, this update may impact how the
    company reflects multiple-element arrangements entered into
    subsequent to January 1, 2011, in the financial statements.

Other Accounting Standards Updates not effective until after
    December 31, 2009, are not expected to have a significant
    effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or
    results of operations.

DIVIDENDS
    ON COMMON STOCK AND CONVERSION OF PREFERRED STOCK

Dividends on Common Stock

– In May 2009, the
    company’s board of directors approved an increase to the
    quarterly common stock dividend, from $.40 per share to $.43 per
    share, for stockholders of record as of June 1, 2009.

In April 2008, the company’s board of directors approved an
    increase to the quarterly common stock dividend, from $.37 per
    share to $.40 per share, for stockholders of record as of
    June 2, 2008.

-70-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

On February 21, 2007, the company’s board of directors
    approved an increase to the quarterly common stock dividend,
    from $.30 per share to $.37 per share, effective with the first
    quarter 2007 dividends.

Conversion of Preferred Stock

– On
    February 20, 2008, the company’s board of directors
    approved the redemption of the 3.5 million shares of
    mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock on
    April 4, 2008. Prior to the redemption date, substantially
    all of the preferred shares were converted into common stock at
    the election of stockholders. All remaining unconverted
    preferred shares were redeemed by the company on the redemption
    date. As a result of the conversion and redemption, the company
    issued approximately 6.4 million shares of common stock.

BUSINESS
    ACQUISITIONS


– In April 2009, the company acquired
    Sonoma Photonics, Inc., as well as assets from Swift
    Engineering’s Killer Bee Unmanned Air Systems product line
    for an aggregate amount of approximately $33 million in
    cash. The operating results of these businesses are reported in
    the Aerospace Systems segment from the date of acquisition. The
    assets, liabilities, and results of operations of these
    businesses were not material to the company’s consolidated
    financial position or results of operations, and thus pro-forma
    financial information is not presented.


– In October 2008, the company acquired
    3001 International, Inc. (3001 Inc.) for approximately
    $92 million in cash. 3001 Inc. provides geospatial data
    production and analysis, including airborne imaging, surveying,
    mapping and geographic information systems for U.S. and
    international government intelligence, defense and civilian
    customers. The operating results of 3001 Inc. are reported in
    the Information Systems segment from the date of acquisition.
    The assets, liabilities, and results of operations of 3001 Inc.
    are not material to the company’s consolidated financial
    position or results of operations, and thus pro-forma
    information is not presented.


– During the third quarter of 2007, the
    company acquired Xinetics Inc. and the remaining 61 percent
    of Scaled Composites, LLC for an aggregate amount of
    approximately $100 million in cash. The operating results
    of these businesses are reported in the Aerospace Systems
    segment from the date of acquisition. The assets, liabilities,
    and results of operations of these businesses were not material
    to the company’s consolidated financial position or results
    of operations, and thus pro-forma information is not presented.

In July 2007, the company and Science Applications International
    Corporation (SAIC) reorganized the AMSEC, LLC, joint venture
    (AMSEC), by dividing AMSEC along customer and product lines.
    AMSEC is a full-service supplier that provides engineering,
    logistics and technical support services primarily to Navy ship
    and aviation programs. Under the reorganization plan, the
    company retained the ship engineering, logistics and technical
    service businesses under the AMSEC name (the AMSEC Businesses)
    and, in exchange, SAIC received the aviation, combat systems and
    strike force integration services businesses from AMSEC (the
    Divested Businesses). This reorganization was treated as a step
    acquisition for the acquisition of SAIC’s interests in the
    AMSEC Businesses, with the company recognizing a pre-tax gain of
    $23 million for the effective sale of its interests in the
    Divested Businesses. From the date of this reorganization, the
    operating results of the AMSEC Businesses, and transaction gain,
    have been reported on a consolidated basis in the Shipbuilding
    segment from the date of this reorganization. Prior to the
    reorganization, the company accounted for AMSEC, LLC, under the
    equity method. The assets, liabilities, and results of
    operations of the AMSEC Businesses were not material to the
    company’s consolidated financial position or results of
    operations, and thus pro-forma information is not presented.

In January 2007, the company acquired Essex Corporation (Essex)
    for approximately $590 million in cash, including the
    assumption of debt totaling $23 million. Essex provides
    signal processing services and products, and advanced
    optoelectronic imaging for U.S. government intelligence and
    defense customers. The operating results of Essex are reported
    in the Information Systems segment from the date of acquisition.
    The assets, liabilities, and results of operations of Essex were
    not material to the company’s consolidated financial
    position or results of operations, and thus pro-forma
    information is not presented.

BUSINESS
    DISPOSITIONS

2009 –

In December 2009, the company sold ASD
    for $1.65 billion in cash to an investor group led by
    General Atlantic, LLC, and affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis
    Roberts & Co. L.P., and recognized a gain of
    $15 million, net of taxes. ASD was a business unit
    comprised of the assets and liabilities of TASC, Inc., its
    wholly-owned subsidiary TASC Services Corporation, and certain
    contracts carved out from other Northrop Grumman businesses also
    in Information Systems that provide systems engineering
    technical assistance (SETA) and other analysis and advisory
    services. Sales for this business in the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, were approximately
    $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.5 billion,
    respectively. The assets, liabilities and operating results of
    this business unit are reported as discontinued operations in
    the consolidated statements of operations for all periods
    presented.

2008 –

In April 2008, the company sold its
    Electro-Optical Systems (EOS) business for $175 million in
    cash to L-3 Communications Corporation and recognized a gain of
    $19 million, net of taxes. EOS, formerly a part of the
    Electronic Systems segment, produces night vision and applied
    optics products. Sales for this business through April 2008 and
    for the year ended December 31, 2007, were approximately
    $53 million and $190 million, respectively. The
    assets, liabilities and operating results of this business are
    reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated
    statements of operations for all periods presented.


– During the second quarter of 2007,
    management announced its decision to exit the remaining
    Interconnect Technologies (ITD) business reported within the
    Electronic Systems segment. Sales for this business in the year
    ended December 31, 2007, was $14 million. The
    shut-down was completed during the third quarter of 2007 and
    costs associated with the shut-down were not material. The
    results of this business are reported as discontinued operations
    in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods
    presented.

Discontinued Operations

– Earnings for the
    businesses classified within discontinued operations (primarily
    the result of the sale of ASD discussed above) were as follows:

Year Ended December 31

Tax rates on discontinued operations vary from the
    company’s effective tax rate generally due to the
    non-deductibility of goodwill for tax purposes and the effects,
    if any, of capital loss carryforwards. Assets of discontinued
    operations as of December 31, 2008, consisted primarily of
    $1 billion in goodwill and accounts receivable of ASD.
    Liabilities of discontinued operations consisted primarily of
    accounts payable of ASD.

SEGMENT
    INFORMATION

At December 31, 2009, the company was aligned into five
    reportable segments: Aerospace Systems, Electronic Systems,
    Information Systems, Shipbuilding, and Technical Services.

Segment Realignments

– The company, from time
    to time, acquires or disposes of businesses, and realigns
    contracts, programs or business areas among and within its
    operating segments that possess similar customers, expertise,
    and capabilities. Internal realignments are designed to more
    fully leverage existing capabilities and enhance development and
    delivery of products and services.

-72-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

In January 2009, the company streamlined its organizational
    structure by reducing the number of operating segments from
    seven to five. The five segments are Aerospace Systems, which
    combines the former Integrated Systems and Space Technology
    segments; Electronic Systems; Information Systems, which
    combines the former Information Technology and Mission Systems
    segments; Shipbuilding; and Technical Services. Creation of the
    Aerospace Systems and Information Systems segments is intended
    to strengthen alignment with customers, improve the
    company’s ability to execute on programs and win new
    business, and enhance cost competitiveness. Product sales are
    predominantly generated in the Aerospace Systems, Electronic
    Systems and Shipbuilding segments, while the majority of the
    company’s service revenues are generated by the Information
    Systems and Technical Services segments.

During the first quarter of 2009, the company realigned certain
    logistics, services, and technical support programs and
    transferred assets from the Information Systems and Electronic
    Systems segments to the Technical Services segment. This
    realignment is intended to strengthen the company’s core
    capability in aircraft and electronics maintenance, repair and
    overhaul, life cycle optimization, and training and simulation
    services.

Sales and segment operating income in the tables below have been
    revised to reflect the above realignments for all periods
    presented.

During the first quarter of 2009, the company transferred
    certain optics and laser programs from the Information Systems
    segment to the Aerospace Systems segment. As the operating
    results of this business were not considered material, the prior
    year sales and segment operating income were not reclassified to
    reflect this business transfer.

U.S. Government Sales

– Revenue from the
    U.S. Government (which includes Foreign Military Sales)
    includes revenue from contracts for which Northrop Grumman is
    the prime contractor as well as those for which the company is a
    subcontractor and the ultimate customer is the
    U.S. Government. All of the company’s segments derive
    substantial revenue from the U.S. Government. Sales to the
    U.S. Government amounted to approximately
    $31.0 billion, $29.3 billion, and $27.4 billion,
    or 91.8 percent, 90.7 percent, and 90.2 percent
    of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008, and 2007, respectively.

Goodwill Impairment Charge –

The operating
    losses for the year ended December 31, 2008, at Aerospace
    Systems and Shipbuilding reflect goodwill impairment charges of
    $570 million and $2,490 million, respectively.

Shipbuilding Earnings Charge Relating to LHD 8 Contract
    Performance

– During the first quarter of 2008,
    the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $272 million for
    cost growth on the LHD 8 contract and an additional
    $54 million primarily for schedule impacts on other ships
    and impairment of purchased intangibles at the Gulf Coast
    shipyards.

Unallocated Expenses

– Unallocated expenses
    generally include the portion of corporate expenses not
    considered allowable or allocable under applicable
    U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) regulations
    and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and therefore not
    allocated to the segments, for costs related to management and
    administration, legal, environmental, certain compensation and
    retiree benefits, and other expenses.

Net Pension Adjustment –

The net pension
    adjustment reflects the difference between pension expense
    determined in accordance with GAAP and pension expense allocated
    to the operating segments determined in accordance with CAS.

Royalty Income Adjustment

– Royalty income is
    included in segment operating income and reclassified to other
    income for financial reporting purposes. The royalty income
    adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2008, includes
    $60 million related to patent infringement settlements at
    Electronic Systems.

EARNINGS
    (LOSS) PER SHARE

Basic Earnings (Loss) Per Share

– Basic
    earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations are
    calculated by dividing earnings (loss) from continuing
    operations available to common stockholders by the
    weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
    during each period.

Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share

– Diluted
    earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    include the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock
    awards granted to employees under stock-based compensation
    plans. The dilutive effect of these securities totaled
    4.1 million shares for the year ended December 31,
    2009. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the potential
    dilutive effect of 7.1 million shares from stock options,
    other

-75-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

stock awards, and the mandatorily redeemable convertible
    preferred stock (see Note 3) were excluded from the
    computation of weighted average shares outstanding as the shares
    would have had an anti-dilutive effect on the earnings per share
    computation. Diluted earnings per share for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, include the dilutive effect of stock
    options, other stock awards and the mandatorily redeemable
    convertible preferred stock. The dilutive effect of these
    securities totaled 12.6 million shares (including
    6.4 million shares for the company’s mandatorily
    redeemable convertible preferred stock). The weighted-average
    diluted shares outstanding for the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008, and 2007, exclude stock options to purchase
    approximately 8.1 million shares, 2.1 million shares,
    and 59 thousand shares, respectively, because such options have
    an exercise price in excess of the average market price of the
    company’s common stock during the year.

Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations are

Under certain of its share repurchase authorizations, the
    company has entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements
    with banks to repurchase shares of common stock. Under these
    agreements, shares were immediately borrowed by the bank and
    then sold to and canceled by the company. Subsequently, shares
    were purchased in the open market by the bank to settle its
    share borrowings. The ultimate cost of the company’s share
    repurchases under these agreements was subject to adjustment
    based on the actual cost of the shares subsequently purchased by
    the bank. If an additional amount was owed by the company upon
    settlement, the price adjustment could have been settled, at the
    company’s option, in cash or in shares of common stock. The
    final price adjustments

-76-

under these agreements have been immaterial. No accelerated
    share repurchase agreements were utilized in connection with the
    2009 repurchases shown above.

As of December 31, 2009, the company has a remaining
    authorization of $924 million for share repurchases.

ACCOUNTS
    RECEIVABLE, NET

Unbilled amounts represent sales for which billings have not
    been presented to customers at year-end. These amounts are
    usually billed and collected within one year. Progress payments
    are received on a number of firm fixed-price contracts. Unbilled
    amounts are presented net of progress payments of
    $5.6 billion and $4.7 billion at December 31,
    2009, and 2008, respectively.

Accounts receivable at December 31, 2009, are expected to
    be collected in 2010, except for approximately $76 million
    due in 2011 and $7 million due in 2012 and later.

Allowances for doubtful amounts mainly represent estimates of
    overhead costs which may not be successfully negotiated and
    collected.

GOODWILL
    AND OTHER PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill

Goodwill and other purchased intangible assets are included in
    the identifiable assets of the segment to which they have been
    assigned. Impairment tests are performed at least annually and
    more often as circumstances require. Any goodwill impairment, as
    well as the amortization of other purchased intangible assets,
    is charged against the respective segment’s operating
    income. The annual impairment test for all segments was
    performed as of November 30, 2009, with no indication of
    impairment. In performing the goodwill impairment tests, the
    company uses a discounted cash flow approach corroborated by
    comparative market multiples, where appropriate, to determine
    the fair value of its businesses.

The company recorded a non-cash charge totaling
    $3.1 billion at Shipbuilding and Aerospace Systems in the
    fourth quarter of 2008 for the impairment of goodwill. The
    impairment charge was primarily driven by adverse equity market
    conditions that caused a decrease in current market multiples
    and the company’s stock price as of November 30, 2008.
    The charge reduced goodwill recorded in connection with
    acquisitions made in 2001 and 2002 and also represents the
    company’s accumulated goodwill impairment losses at
    December 31, 2009, and 2008.

Segment Realignments

– As discussed in
    Note 1, in January 2009 the company streamlined its
    organizational structure by reducing the number of operating
    segments from seven to five and the carrying value of the
    goodwill balances from the prior segment alignments were
    transferred into the goodwill amounts shown for the new segment
    alignment.

During the first quarter of 2009, the company realigned certain
    logistics, services, and technical support programs and
    transferred assets from the Information Systems and Electronic
    Systems segments to the Technical Services segment. As a result
    of this realignment, goodwill of approximately $123 million
    was reallocated among these segments. Additionally during the
    first quarter of 2009, the company transferred certain optics
    and laser programs from the Information Systems segment to the
    Aerospace Systems segment, resulting in the reallocation of
    goodwill of approximately $41 million.

In January 2008, the former Newport News and Ship Systems
    businesses were combined into a single operating segment called
    Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding and their goodwill balances were
    combined. In addition,

-78-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

certain Electronic Systems businesses were transferred to
    Information Systems during the first quarter of 2008, along with
    goodwill of $47 million. During the second quarter of 2008,
    the company transferred certain programs and assets, including
    goodwill of $505 million, from the missiles business in the
    Information Systems segment to the Aerospace Systems segment.

Goodwill totaling $1 billion related to ASD has been
    included in assets of discontinued operations at
    December 31, 2008 and excluded from the goodwill balance of
    Information Systems for all periods presented (see Note 5).

Fair Value Adjustments to Net Assets Acquired

–
    For 2008, the fair value adjustments were primarily due to the
    final settlement of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
    examination of the

1999-2002

TRW income tax returns (see Note 12) and purchase
    price allocation related to the 3001 Inc. acquisition (see
    Note 4).

    Aggregate amortization expense for 2009, 2008, and 2007, was
    $104 million, $136 million, and $132 million,
    respectively. The 2008 amount includes a $19 million
    impairment of purchased intangibles recorded in the first
    quarter of 2008 associated with the LHD 8 and other Gulf
    Coast shipbuilding programs.

FAIR
    VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Investments in Marketable Securities

– The
    company holds a portfolio of marketable securities, primarily
    consisting of equity securities that are classified as either
    trading or available-for-sale and can be liquidated without
    restriction. These assets are recorded at fair value,
    substantially all of which are based upon quoted market prices
    for identical instruments in active markets and thus considered
    Level 1 inputs. As of December 31, 2009, and
    December 31, 2008, respectively, there were marketable
    equity securities of $58 million and $44 million
    included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and
    $233 million and $180 million of marketable equity
    securities included in miscellaneous other assets.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

– The company utilizes derivative
    financial instruments in order to manage exposure to interest
    rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. The company
    does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or
    speculative purposes, nor does it use leveraged financial
    instruments. Interest rate swap agreements utilize floating
    interest rates as an offset to the fixed-rate characteristics of
    certain long-term debt instruments. Foreign currency forward
    contracts are used to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk
    related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers
    denominated in foreign currencies.

Derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or
    liabilities in the financial statements and measured at fair
    value, substantially all of which are based model-derived
    valuations whose inputs are observable and thus considered
    Level 2 inputs. Changes in the fair value of derivative
    financial instruments that qualify and are designated as fair
    value hedges are recorded in earnings from continuing
    operations, while the effective portion of the changes in the
    fair value of derivative financial instruments that qualify and
    are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other
    comprehensive income. Credit risk related to derivative
    financial instruments is considered minimal and is managed by
    requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic
    settlements of the underlying transactions.

For derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging
    instruments as well as the ineffective portion of cash flow
    hedges, gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value
    are reported in Other, net in the consolidated statements of
    operations. Unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges are
    reclassified from other comprehensive income to earnings from
    continuing operations upon the recognition of the underlying
    transactions.

As of December 31, 2009, an interest rate swap with a
    notional value of $200 million, and foreign currency
    purchase and sale forward contract agreements with notional
    values of $77 million and $151 million, respectively,
    were designated as hedging instruments. The remaining notional
    values outstanding at December 31, 2009, under foreign
    currency purchase and sale forward contracts of $19 million
    and $74 million, respectively, were not designated as
    hedging instruments.

As of December 31, 2008, interest rate swaps with notional
    values totaling $400 million, and foreign currency purchase
    and sale forward contract agreements with notional values of
    $74 million and $210 million, respectively, were
    designated as hedging instruments. The remaining notional values
    outstanding at December 31, 2008, under foreign currency
    purchase and sale forward contracts of $56 million and
    $82 million, respectively, were not designated as hedging
    instruments.

In October 2008, the company entered into two forward-starting
    interest rate swaps with a notional value totaling
    $400 million and designated these swaps as cash flow
    hedges. The fair value of the forward-starting swap agreements
    was a $58 million liability at December 31, 2008, and
    was included in other current liabilities. These swaps were
    settled as of June 8, 2009, and the related impact on the
    consolidated statements of operations was not material. All
    other derivative fair values and related unrealized gains and
    losses at December 31, 2009, and 2008, were not material.

The carrying amounts of other financial instruments not listed
    in the table below approximate fair value due to the short-term
    nature of these items. Carrying amounts and the related
    estimated fair values of the company’s financial
    instruments not recorded at fair value in the financial
    statements are as follows:

Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance Policies –

The company maintains variable universal life insurance
    policies on a group of executives which are recorded at their
    cash surrender value as determined by the insurance carrier.
    Additionally, the

-80-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

company has split-dollar life insurance policies on former
    officers and executives from acquired businesses which are
    recorded at the lesser of their cash surrender value or premiums
    paid. The policies are utilized as a partial funding source for
    deferred compensation and other non-qualified employee
    retirement plans. Amounts associated with these policies are
    recorded in miscellaneous other assets in the consolidated
    statements of financial position.

Long-Term Debt

– The fair value of long-term
    debt was calculated based on interest rates available for debt
    with terms and maturities similar to the company’s existing
    debt arrangements.

12.

INCOME
    TAXES

The company’s effective tax rate on earnings from
    continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    was 30.6 percent as compared with 33.8 percent and
    32.8 percent in 2008 and 2007, respectively (excluding for
    2008 the non-cash, non-deductible goodwill impairment charge of
    $3.1 billion at Aerospace Systems and Shipbuilding). The
    company’s effective tax rates reflect tax credits,
    manufacturing deductions and the impact of settlements with the
    Internal Revenue Service (IRS). During 2009, the company reached
    a final settlement with the IRS regarding its audit of the
    company’s tax returns for the years ended December 31,
    2001 through 2003 and recognized $75 million of net benefit
    upon settlement, including $20 million of interest. During
    2008, the company reached a final settlement with the IRS
    regarding its audit of the TRW tax returns for the years ended
    1999 through 2002 and recognized $35 million of benefit
    upon settlement, including $4 million of interest. During
    2007, the company reached a partial settlement agreement with
    the IRS regarding its audit of the company’s tax years
    ended December 31, 2001 through 2003 and recognized
    $22 million of benefit upon settlement, including
    $6 million of interest.

Uncertain Tax Positions

– During the third
    quarter of 2009, the company reached a final settlement
    agreement with the IRS and the U.S. Congressional Joint
    Committee on Taxation (Joint Committee) with respect to the
    IRS’ audit of the company’s tax returns for the years
    2001 through 2003. As a result of this settlement, the company
    reduced its liability for uncertain tax positions by
    $60 million, which was recorded as a reduction to the
    company’s effective tax rate.

During the third quarter of 2008, the company reached a final
    settlement agreement with the IRS and Joint Committee with
    respect to the IRS’ audit of the TRW tax returns for the
    years 1999 through 2002. As a result of this settlement, the
    company reduced its liability for uncertain tax positions by
    $126 million (including accrued interest of
    $44 million), $95 million of which was recorded as a
    reduction of goodwill.

As of December 31, 2009, the estimated value of the
    company’s uncertain tax positions was a liability of
    $423 million which includes accrued interest of
    $61 million. If the company’s positions are sustained
    by the taxing authorities in favor of the company, the reversal
    of the amounts accrued for uncertain tax positions would reduce
    the company’s effective tax rate.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

– Unrecognized tax
    benefits consist of the carrying value of the company’s
    recorded uncertain tax positions as well as the potential tax
    benefits that could result from other tax positions that have
    not been recognized in the financial statement under GAAP. At
    December 31, 2009, and 2008, unrecognized tax benefits that
    have not been recognized in the financial statements amounted to
    $67 million. The change in unrecognized tax benefits during 2009
    and 2008, excluding interest, is as follows:

Although the company believes that it has adequately provided
    for all of its tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing
    authorities in future years could be greater than the
    company’s accrued positions. Accordingly, additional
    provisions on income tax related matters could be recorded in
    the future due to revised estimates, settlement or other
    resolution of the underlying tax matters. In addition, open tax
    years related to state and foreign

jurisdictions remain subject to examination but are not
    considered material. The IRS is currently conducting an
    examination of the company’s tax returns for the years 2004
    through 2006. It is reasonably possible that the company will
    reach a settlement with the IRS and Joint Committee within the
    next twelve months which may result in a material net reduction
    in the company’s liability for uncertain tax positions.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the company
    recorded approximately $6 million of interest income, and
    during the year ended December 31, 2008, the company
    recorded $29 million of interest expense within its federal
    and foreign income tax provision.

Deferred Income Taxes

– Deferred income taxes
    reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
    carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
    reporting purposes and tax purposes. Such amounts are classified
    in the consolidated statements of financial position as current
    or noncurrent assets or liabilities based upon the
    classification of the related assets and liabilities.

The tax effects of significant temporary differences and
    carryforwards that gave rise to year-end deferred federal, state
    and foreign tax balances, as presented in the consolidated
    statements of financial position, are as follows:

Foreign Income –

As of December 31, 2009,
    the company had approximately $590 million of accumulated
    undistributed earnings generated by its foreign subsidiaries. No
    deferred tax liability has been recorded on these earnings since
    the company intends to permanently reinvest these earnings,
    thereby indefinitely postponing their remittance. Should these
    earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise,
    the distributions would be subject to U.S. federal income
    tax at the statutory rate of 35 percent, less foreign tax
    credits available to offset

such distributions, if any. In addition, such distributions
    would be subject to withholding taxes in the various tax
    jurisdictions.

Tax Carryforwards

– During 2009, the company
    utilized all of its remaining capital loss carryforwards in
    connection with the sale of ASD.

NOTES PAYABLE
    TO BANKS AND LONG-TERM DEBT

Lines of Credit

– The company has available
    uncommitted short-term credit lines in the form of money market
    facilities with several banks. The amount and conditions for
    borrowing under these credit lines depend on the availability
    and terms prevailing in the marketplace. No fees or compensating
    balances are required for these credit facilities.

Credit Facility

– The company has a revolving
    credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of
    $2 billion that matures on August 10, 2012. The credit
    facility permits the company to request additional lending
    commitments of up to $500 million from the lenders under
    the agreement or other eligible lenders under certain
    circumstances. The agreement provides for swingline loans and
    letters of credit as sub-facilities for the credit facilities
    provided for in the agreement. Borrowings under the credit
    facility bear interest at various rates, including the London
    Interbank Offered Rate, adjusted based on the company’s
    credit rating, or an alternate base rate plus an incremental
    margin. The credit facility also requires a facility fee based
    on the daily aggregate amount of commitments (whether or not
    utilized) and the company’s credit rating level, and
    contains a financial covenant relating to a maximum debt to
    capitalization ratio, and certain restrictions on additional
    asset liens. There were no borrowings during 2009 and a maximum
    of $300 million borrowed under this facility during 2008.
    There was no balance outstanding under this facility at
    December 31, 2009, and 2008. As of December 31, 2009,
    the company was in compliance with all covenants.

Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue
    Bonds –

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    Shipbuilding had $200 million outstanding from the issuance
    of Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue Bonds
    issued by the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation. These
    bonds accrue interest at a fixed rate of 4.55 percent per
    annum (payable semi-annually), and repayment of principal and
    interest is guaranteed by the company. In accordance with the
    terms of the bonds, the proceeds have been used to finance the
    construction, reconstruction, and renovation of the
    company’s interest in certain ship manufacturing and repair
    facilities, or portions thereof, located in the state of
    Mississippi.

Debt Issuance –

In July 2009, the company
    issued $350 million of

5-year

and
    $500 million of

10-year

unsecured senior obligations. Interest on the notes is payable
    semi-annually in arrears at fixed rates of 3.70 percent and
    5.05 percent per annum, and the notes will mature on
    August 1, 2014, and August 1, 2019, respectively.
    These senior notes are subject to redemption at the
    company’s discretion at any time prior to maturity in whole
    or in part at the principal amount plus any make-whole premium
    and accrued and unpaid interest. The net proceeds from these
    notes are being used for general corporate purposes including
    debt repayment, acquisitions, share repurchases, pension plan
    funding, and working capital. On October 15, 2009, a
    portion of the net proceeds was used to retire $400 million
    of 8 percent senior debt that had matured.

LITIGATION

U.S. Government Investigations and
    Claims

– Departments and agencies of the
    U.S. Government have the authority to investigate various
    transactions and operations of the company, and the results of
    such investigations may lead to administrative, civil or
    criminal proceedings, the ultimate outcome of which could be
    fines, penalties, repayments or compensatory or treble damages.
    U.S. Government regulations provide that certain findings
    against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from
    future U.S. Government contracts or the loss of export
    privileges for a company or an operating division or
    subdivision. Suspension or debarment could have a material
    adverse effect on the company because of its reliance on
    government contracts.

In the second quarter of 2007, the U.S. Coast Guard issued
    a revocation of acceptance under the Deepwater Program for eight
    converted 123-foot patrol boats (the vessels) based on alleged
    “hull buckling and shaft alignment problems” and
    alleged “nonconforming topside equipment” on the
    vessels. The company submitted a written response that argued
    that the revocation of acceptance was improper. The Coast Guard
    advised Integrated Coast Guard Systems, LLC (ICGS), which was
    formed by the contractors to perform the Deepwater Program, that
    it was seeking $96.1 million from ICGS as a result of the
    revocation of acceptance. The majority of the costs associated
    with the 123-foot conversion effort are associated with the
    alleged structural deficiencies of the vessels, which were
    converted under contracts with the company and a subcontractor
    to the company. In 2008, the Coast Guard advised ICGS that the
    Coast Guard would support an investigation by the
    U.S. Department of Justice of ICGS and its subcontractors
    instead of pursuing its $96.1 million claim independently.
    The Department of Justice conducted

-85-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

an investigation of ICGS under a sealed False Claims Act
    complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
    District of Texas and decided in early 2009 not to intervene at
    that time. On February 12, 2009, the Court unsealed the
    complaint filed by Michael J. DeKort, a former Lockheed Martin
    employee, against ICGS, Lockheed Martin Corporation and the
    company, relating to the 123-foot conversion effort. On
    July 22, 2009, the three defendants moved to dismiss the
    complaint. On October 2, 2009, the Court set a trial date
    of November 1, 2010. Based upon the information available
    to the company to date, the company believes that it has
    substantive defenses to any potential claims but can give no
    assurance that the company will prevail in this litigation.

In August 2008, the company disclosed to the Antitrust Division
    of the U.S. Department of Justice possible violations of
    federal antitrust laws in connection with the bidding process
    for certain maintenance contracts at a military installation in
    California. In February 2009, the company and the Department of
    Justice signed an agreement admitting the company into the
    Corporate Leniency Program. As a result of the company’s
    acceptance into the Program, the company will be exempt from
    federal criminal prosecution and criminal fines relating to the
    matters the company reported to the Department of Justice if the
    company complies with certain conditions, including its
    continued cooperation with the government’s investigation
    and its agreement to make restitution if the government was
    harmed by the violations.

Based upon the available information regarding matters that are
    subject to U.S. Government investigations, the company
    believes that the outcome of any such matters would not have a
    material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

Litigation

– Various claims and legal
    proceedings arise in the ordinary course of business and are
    pending against the company and its properties. Based upon the
    information available, the company believes that the resolution
    of any of these various claims and legal proceedings would not
    have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows.

The company is one of several defendants in litigation brought
    by the Orange County Water District in Orange County Superior
    Court in California on December 17, 2004, for alleged
    contribution to volatile organic chemical contamination of the
    County’s shallow groundwater. The lawsuit includes counts
    against the defendants for violation of the Orange County Water
    District Act, the California Super Fund Act, negligence,
    nuisance, trespass and declaratory relief. Among other things,
    the lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for the cost of
    remediation, payment of attorney fees and costs, and punitive
    damages. The June 2009 trial date was vacated and a status
    conference has been set for March 12, 2010.

On March 27, 2007, the U.S. District Court for the
    Central District of California consolidated two Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) lawsuits that had been
    separately filed on September 28, 2006 and January 3,
    2007, into In Re Northrop Grumman Corporation ERISA Litigation.
    The plaintiffs seek to have the lawsuits certified as class
    actions. On August 6, 2007, the District Court denied
    plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, and the
    plaintiffs appealed the Court’s decision on class
    certification to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
    Circuit. On September 8, 2009, the Ninth Circuit vacated
    the Order denying class certification and remanded the issue to
    the District Court for further consideration. As required by the
    Ninth Circuit’s Order, the case was also reassigned to a
    different judge.

On June 22, 2007, a putative class action was filed against
    the Northrop Grumman Pension Plan and the Northrop Grumman
    Retirement Plan B and their corresponding administrative
    committees, styled as

Skinner et al. v. Northrop Grumman
    Pension Plan, etc., et al.,

in the U.S. District Court
    for the Central District of California. The putative class
    representatives alleged violations of ERISA and breaches of
    fiduciary duty concerning a 2003 modification to the Northrop
    Grumman Retirement Plan B. The modification relates to the
    employer funded portion of the pension benefit available during
    a five-year transition period that ended on June 30, 2008.
    The plaintiffs dismissed the Northrop Grumman Pension Plan, and
    in 2008 the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of
    all remaining defendants on all claims. The plaintiffs appealed,
    and in May 2009, the Ninth Circuit reversed the decision of the
    District Court and remanded the matter back to the District
    Court for further proceedings, finding that there was ambiguity
    in a 1998 summary plan description related to the

-86-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

employer funded component of the pension benefit. The plaintiffs
    filed a motion to certify the class. The parties also filed
    cross-motions for summary judgment. On January 26, 2010,
    the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Plan
    and denied plaintiffs’ motion. The District Court also
    denied plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and
    struck the trial date of March 23, 2010 as unnecessary
    given the Court’s grant of summary judgment for the Plan.
    On February 2, 2010, the plaintiffs appealed the judgment
    in favor of the Plan.

Other Matters

– The company is pursuing legal
    action against an insurance provider arising out of a
    disagreement concerning the coverage of certain losses related
    to Hurricane Katrina (see Note 15). The company commenced
    the action against Factory Mutual Insurance Company (FM Global)
    on November 4, 2005, which is now pending in the
    U.S. District Court for the Central District of California,
    Western Division. In August 2007, the District Court issued an
    order finding that the excess insurance policy provided coverage
    for the company’s Katrina-related loss. In November 2007,
    FM Global filed a notice of appeal of the District Court’s
    order. On August 14, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals
    for the Ninth Circuit reversed the earlier summary judgment
    order in favor of the company, holding that the FM Global excess
    policy unambiguously excludes damage from the storm surge caused
    by Hurricane Katrina under its “Flood” exclusion. The
    Ninth Circuit remanded the case to the District Court to
    determine whether the California efficient proximate cause
    doctrine affords the company coverage under the policy even if
    the Flood exclusion of the policy is unambiguous. The company
    filed a Petition for Rehearing En Banc, or in the Alternative,
    For Panel Rehearing with the Ninth Circuit on August 27,
    2008. On April 2, 2009, the Ninth Circuit denied the
    company’s Petition for Rehearing and remanded the case to
    the District Court. On June 10, 2009, the company filed a
    motion seeking leave of court to file a complaint adding AON
    Risk Services, Inc. of Southern California as a defendant. On
    July 1, 2009, FM Global filed a motion for partial summary
    judgment seeking a determination that the California efficient
    proximate cause doctrine is not applicable or that it affords no
    coverage under the policy. Both motions have been fully briefed
    and argued. Based on the current status of the litigation, no
    assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome of this matter.

During 2008, the company received notification from

Munich-American

Risk Partners (Munich Re), the only remaining insurer within the
    primary layer of insurance coverage with which a resolution has
    not been reached, that it will pursue arbitration proceedings
    against the company related to approximately $19 million
    owed by Munich Re to Northrop Grumman Risk Management Inc.
    (NGRMI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, for certain
    losses related to Hurricane Katrina. The company was
    subsequently notified that Munich Re also will seek
    reimbursement of approximately $44 million of funds
    previously advanced to NGRMI for payment of claim losses of
    which Munich Re provided reinsurance protection to NGRMI
    pursuant to an executed reinsurance contract, and
    $6 million of adjustment expenses. The company believes
    that NGRMI is entitled to full reimbursement of its covered
    losses under the reinsurance contract and has substantive
    defenses to the claim of Munich Re for return of the funds paid
    to date.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Contract Performance Contingencies

– Contract
    profit margins may include estimates of revenues not
    contractually agreed to between the customer and the company for
    matters such as contract changes, settlements in the process of
    negotiation, claims and requests for equitable adjustment for
    previously unanticipated contract costs. These estimates are
    based upon management’s best assessment of the underlying
    causal events and circumstances, and are included in determining
    contract profit margins to the extent of expected recovery based
    on contractual entitlements and the probability of successful
    negotiation with the customer. As of December 31, 2009, the
    amounts related to the aforementioned items are not material
    individually or in the aggregate.

Guarantees of Subsidiary Performance Obligations –

From time to time in the ordinary course of business, the
    company guarantees performance obligations of its subsidiaries
    under certain contracts. In addition, the company’s
    subsidiaries may enter into joint ventures, teaming and other
    business arrangements (Business Arrangements) to support the
    company’s products and services in domestic and
    international markets. The company generally strives to limit
    its exposure under these arrangements to its subsidiary’s
    investment in the

-87-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Business Arrangement, or to the extent of such subsidiary’s
    obligations under the applicable contract. In some cases,
    however, the company may be required to guarantee performance by
    the Business Arrangement and, in such cases, the company
    generally obtains cross-indemnification from the other members
    of the Business Arrangement. At December 31, 2009, the
    company is not aware of any existing event of default that would
    require it to satisfy any of these guarantees.

Environmental Matters

– The estimated cost to
    complete remediation has been accrued where it is probable that
    the company will incur such costs in the future to address
    environmental impacts at currently or formerly owned or leased
    operating facilities, or at sites where it has been named a
    Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) by the Environmental
    Protection Agency, or similarly designated by other
    environmental agencies. These accruals do not include any
    litigation costs related to environmental matters, nor do they
    include amounts recorded as asset retirement obligations. To
    assess the potential impact on the company’s consolidated
    financial statements, management estimates the range of
    reasonably possible remediation costs that could be incurred by
    the company, taking into account currently available facts on
    each site as well as the current state of technology and prior
    experience in remediating contaminated sites. These estimates
    are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect changes in
    facts and technical and legal circumstances. Management
    estimates that as of December 31, 2009, the range of
    reasonably possible future costs for environmental remediation
    sites is $239 million to $483 million, of which
    $115 million is accrued in other current liabilities and
    $168 million is accrued in other long-term liabilities.
    Factors that could result in changes to the company’s
    estimates include: modification of planned remedial actions,
    increases or decreases in the estimated time required to
    remediate, changes to the determination of legally responsible
    parties, discovery of more extensive contamination than
    anticipated, changes in laws and regulations affecting
    remediation requirements, and improvements in remediation
    technology. Should other PRPs not pay their allocable share of
    remediation costs, the company may have to incur costs in
    addition to those already estimated and accrued. In addition,
    there are some potential remediation sites where the costs of
    remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. Although management
    cannot predict whether new information gained as projects
    progress will materially affect the estimated liability accrued,
    management does not anticipate that future remediation
    expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the
    company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows.

Hurricane Impacts –

During the third quarter of
    2008, the Gulf Coast shipyards were affected by Hurricane
    Gustav. As a result of the storm, the Gulf Coast shipyards
    experienced a shut-down for several days, and a resulting minor
    delay in ship construction throughout the yards; however the
    storm caused no significant physical damage to the yards.
    Shipbuilding’s sales and operating income in 2008 were
    reduced by approximately $100 million and $13 million,
    respectively, during the second half of 2008 due to lost
    production and additional costs resulting from the shut-down.

Also during the third quarter of 2008, a subcontractor’s
    operations in Texas were severely impacted by Hurricane Ike. The
    subcontractor produces compartments for two of the LPD
    amphibious transport dock ships under construction at the Gulf
    Coast shipyards. As a result of the delays and cost growth
    caused by the subcontractor’s production delays,
    Shipbuilding’s 2008 operating income was reduced by
    approximately $23 million during the second half of 2008.
    In 2009, the company received $25 million of insurance
    proceeds representing interim payments on the Hurricane Ike
    insurance claim.

In August 2005, the company’s Gulf Coast operations were
    significantly impacted by Hurricane Katrina and the
    company’s shipyards in Louisiana and Mississippi sustained
    significant windstorm damage from the hurricane. As a result of
    the storm, the company incurred costs to replace or repair
    destroyed or damaged assets, suffered losses under its
    contracts, and incurred substantial costs to clean up and
    recover its operations. As of the date of the storm, the company
    had a comprehensive insurance program that provided coverage
    for, among other things, property damage, business interruption
    impact on net profitability, and costs associated with

clean-up

and
    recovery. The company has recovered a portion of its Hurricane
    Katrina claim and expects that its remaining claim will be
    resolved separately with the two remaining insurers, FM Global
    and Munich Re (see Note 14).

-88-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

The company has full entitlement to any insurance recoveries
    related to business interruption impacts on net profitability
    resulting from these hurricanes. However, because of
    uncertainties concerning the ultimate determination of
    recoveries related to business interruption claims, in
    accordance with company policy no such amounts are recognized
    until they are resolved with the insurers. Furthermore, due to
    the uncertainties with respect to the company’s
    disagreement with FM Global in relation to the Hurricane Katrina
    claim, no receivables have been recognized by the company in the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements for insurance
    recoveries from FM Global.

In accordance with U.S. Government cost accounting
    regulations affecting the majority of the company’s
    contracts, the cost of insurance premiums for property damage
    and business interruption coverage, other than “coverage of
    profit”, is an allowable expense that may be charged to
    contracts. Because a substantial portion of long-term contracts
    at the shipyards are flexibly-priced, the government customer
    would benefit from a portion of insurance recoveries in excess
    of the net book value of damaged assets and

clean-up

and
    restoration costs paid by the company. When such insurance
    recoveries occur, the company is obligated to return a portion
    of these amounts to the government.

Shipbuilding Quality Issues

– In conjunction
    with a second quarter 2009 review of design, engineering and
    production processes at Shipbuilding undertaken as a result of
    leaks discovered in the USS

San Antonio’s

(LPD
    17) lube oil system, the company became aware of a quality
    issue relating to certain pipe welds on ships under production
    as well as those that had previously been delivered. Since that
    discovery, the company has been working with its customers to
    determine the nature and extent of the pipe weld issue and its
    possible impact on the company’s products. This effort has
    resulted in the preparation of a technical analysis of the
    problem, additional inspections on the ships, a rework plan for
    ships previously delivered and in various stages of production,
    and modifications to the work plans for ships being placed into
    production all of which has been done with the knowledge and
    support of the affected customers. The incremental costs
    associated with the anticipated resolution of this matter have
    been reflected in the financial performance analysis and
    contract booking rates beginning with the second quarter of 2009.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, certain bearing wear and debris
    were found in the lubrication system of the main propulsion
    diesel engines (MPDE) installed on LPD 21. Shipbuilding is
    participating with the U.S. Navy and other industry
    participants involved with the MPDEs in a review panel
    established by the Navy to examine the MPDE lubrication
    system’s design, construction, operation and maintenance
    for the LPD 17 class of ships. The team is focusing on
    identification and understanding of the root causes of the MPDE
    diesel bearing wear and the debris in the lubrication system,
    and will support the implementation of appropriate corrective
    actions consistent with applicable contract and legal
    requirements. When the root cause analysis is complete, the
    company will implement appropriate corrective actions in
    partnership with the customer to minimize the possibility of
    this kind of occurrence in the future.

At December 31, 2009, the company does not believe that
    resolution of the quality matter relating to pipe welds and the
    issues relating to bearing wear and lube oil debris on LPD 17
    class ships will have a material adverse effect upon the
    company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Co-Operative Agreements

– In 2003, Shipbuilding
    executed agreements with the states of Mississippi and Louisiana
    whereby Shipbuilding leases facility improvements and equipment
    from Mississippi and from a non-profit economic development
    corporation in Louisiana in exchange for certain commitments by
    Shipbuilding to these states. As of December 31, 2009,
    Shipbuilding has fully met its obligations under the Mississippi
    agreement and has met all but one requirement under the
    Louisiana agreement. Failure by Shipbuilding to meet the
    remaining Louisiana commitment would result in reimbursement by
    Shipbuilding to Louisiana in accordance with the agreement. As
    of December 31, 2009, Shipbuilding expects that the
    remaining commitment under the Louisiana agreement will be met
    based on its most recent business plan.

Financial Arrangements

– In the ordinary course
    of business, the company uses standby letters of credit and
    guarantees issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued by
    insurance companies principally to guarantee

-89-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

the performance on certain contracts and to support the
    company’s self-insured workers’ compensation plans. At
    December 31, 2009, there were $531 million of unused
    stand-by letters of credit, $178 million of bank
    guarantees, and $452 million of surety bonds outstanding.

The company has also guaranteed a $200 million loan made to
    Shipbuilding in connection with the Gulf Opportunity Zone
    Industrial Revenue Bonds issued in December 2006. Under the loan
    agreement the company guaranteed Shipbuilding’s repayment
    of the principal and interest to the Trustee. The company also
    guaranteed payment of the principal and interest by the Trustee
    to the underlying bondholders (see Note 13).

Indemnifications

– The company has retained
    certain warranty, environmental, income tax, and other potential
    liabilities in connection with certain of its divestitures. The
    settlement of these liabilities is not expected to have a
    material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

U.S. Government Claims

– From time to
    time, the U.S. Government advises the company of claims and
    penalties concerning certain potential disallowed costs. When
    such findings are presented, the company and the
    U.S. Government representatives engage in discussions to
    enable the company to evaluate the merits of these claims as
    well as to assess the amounts being claimed. The company does
    not believe, but can give no assurance, that the outcome of any
    such matters would have a material adverse effect on its
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows.

Operating Leases

– Rental expense for operating
    leases, excluding discontinued operations, was $549 million
    in 2009, $567 million in 2008, and $568 million in
    2007. These amounts are net of immaterial amounts of sublease
    rental income. Minimum rental commitments under long-term
    noncancellable operating leases as of December 31, 2009,
    total approximately $1.7 billion, which are payable as
    follows: 2010 – $382 million; 2011 –
    $304 million; 2012 – $238 million; 2013
    – $181 million; 2014 – $161 million and
    thereafter – $434 million.

Related Party Transactions

– For all periods
    presented, the company had no material related party
    transactions.

RETIREMENT
    BENEFITS

Plan
    Descriptions

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

– The company
    sponsors several defined benefit pension plans in the
    U.S. covering the majority of its employees. Pension
    benefits for most employees are based on the employee’s
    years of service and compensation. It is the policy of the
    company to fund at least the minimum amount required for all
    qualified plans, using actuarial cost methods and assumptions
    acceptable under U.S. Government regulations, by making
    payments into benefit trusts separate from the company. The
    pension benefit for most employees is based upon criteria
    whereby employees earn age and service points over their
    employment period.

Defined Contribution Plans

– The company also
    sponsors 401(k) defined contribution plans in which most
    employees are eligible to participate, as well as certain
    bargaining unit employees. Company contributions for most plans
    are based on a cash matching of employee contributions up to
    4 percent of compensation. Certain hourly employees are
    covered under a target benefit plan. The company also
    participates in a multiemployer plan for certain of the
    company’s union employees. In addition to the 401(k)
    defined contribution benefit, non-union represented employees
    hired after June 30, 2008, are eligible to participate in a
    defined contribution program in lieu of a defined benefit
    pension plan. The company’s contributions to these defined
    contribution plans for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008, and 2007, were $341 million, $311 million, and
    $294 million, respectively.

Non-U.S. Benefit

Plans –

The company sponsors several benefit plans
    for

non-U.S. employees.

These plans are designed to provide benefits appropriate to
    local practice and in accordance with local regulations. Some of
    these plans are funded using benefit trusts that are separate
    from the company.

Medical and Life Benefits

– The company
    provides a portion of the costs for certain health care and life
    insurance benefits for a substantial number of its active and
    retired employees. Covered employees achieve eligibility to

-90-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

participate in these contributory plans upon retirement from
    active service if they meet specified age and years of service
    requirements. Qualifying dependents are also eligible for
    medical coverage. Approximately 65 percent of the
    company’s current retirees participate in the medical
    plans. The company reserves the right to amend or terminate the
    plans at any time. In November 2006, the company adopted plan
    amendments and communicated to plan participants that it would
    cap the amount of its contributions to substantially all of its
    remaining post retirement medical and life benefit plans that
    were previously not subject to limits on the company’s
    contributions.

In addition to a medical inflation cost-sharing feature, the
    plans also have provisions for deductibles, co-payments,
    coinsurance percentages, out-of-pocket limits, conformance to a
    schedule of reasonable fees, the use of managed care providers,
    and maintenance of benefits with other plans. The plans also
    provide for a Medicare carve-out, and a maximum lifetime benefit
    of $2 million per covered individual. Subsequent to
    January 1, 2005 (or earlier at some segments), newly hired
    employees are not eligible for post employment medical and life
    benefits.

The effect of the Medicare prescription drug subsidy from the
    Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
    2003 to reduce the company’s net periodic post-retirement
    benefit cost and accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation
    for the periods presented was not material.

The discount rate is generally based on the yield on
    high-quality corporate fixed-income investments. At the end of
    each year, the discount rate is primarily determined using the
    results of bond yield curve models based on a portfolio of high
    quality bonds matching the notional cash inflows with the
    expected benefit payments for each significant benefit plan.

-94-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

The assumptions used for pension benefits are consistent with
    those used for retiree medical and life insurance benefits. The
    long-term rate of return on plan assets used for the medical and
    life benefits are reduced to allow for the impact of tax on
    expected returns as, unlike the pension trust, the earnings of
    certain Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts
    are taxable.

Through consultation with investment advisors, expected
    long-term returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset
    classes were developed. Several factors were considered,
    including survey of investment managers’ expectations,
    current market data such as yields/price-earnings ratios, and
    historical market returns over long periods. Using policy target
    allocation percentages and the asset class expected returns, a
    weighted-average expected return was calculated.

A one-percentage-point change in the initial through the
    ultimate health care cost trend rates would have the following
    effects:

Plan
    Assets and Investment Policy

Plan assets are invested in various asset classes that are
    expected to produce a sufficient level of diversification and
    investment return over the long term. The investment goal is to
    exceed the assumed actuarial rate of return over the long term
    within reasonable and prudent levels of risk. Liability studies
    are conducted on a regular basis to provide guidance in setting
    investment goals with an objective to balance risk. Risk targets
    are established and monitored against acceptable ranges.

All investment policies and procedures are designed to ensure
    that the plans’ investments are in compliance with ERISA.
    Guidelines are established defining permitted investments within
    each asset class. Derivatives are used for transitioning assets,
    asset class rebalancing, managing currency risk, and for
    management of fixed income and alternative investments. For the
    majority of the plans’ assets, the investment policies
    require that the asset allocation be maintained within the
    following ranges as of December 31, 2009:

Asset Allocation Ranges

Domestic equities

10 – 30

%

International equities

5 – 25

    asset category. The table also identifies the level of inputs
    used to determine the fair value of assets in each category (see
    Note 1 for definition of levels). The significant amount of

Generally, investments are valued based on information in
    financial publications of general circulation, statistical and
    valuation services, records of security exchanges, appraisal by
    qualified persons, transactions and bona fide offers. Domestic
    and international equities consist primarily of common stocks
    and institutional common trust funds. Investments in common and
    preferred shares are valued at the last reported sales price of
    the stock on the last business day of the reporting period.
    Units in common trust funds and hedge funds are valued based on
    the redemption price of units owned by the trusts at year-end.
    Fair value for real estate and private equity partnerships is
    primarily based on valuation methodologies that include third
    party appraisals, comparable transactions, discounted cash flow
    valuation models, and public market data.

-96-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Non-government fixed income securities are invested across
    various industry sectors and credit quality ratings. Generally,
    investment guidelines are written to limit securities, for
    example, to no more than 5 percent of each trust account,
    and to exclude the purchase of securities issued by the company.
    The number of real estate and private equity partnerships is 77
    and the unfunded commitments are $1.1 billion and
    $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2009, and 2008,
    respectively. For alternative investments that cannot be
    redeemed, such as limited partnerships, the typical investment
    term is ten years. For alternative investments that permit
    redemptions, such redemptions are generally made quarterly and
    require a 90 day notice.

At December 31, 2009, and 2008, the defined benefit pension
    and VEBA trusts did not hold any Northrop Grumman common stock.

In 2010, the company expects to contribute the required minimum
    funding level of approximately $57 million to its pension
    plans and approximately $171 million to its other
    post-retirement benefit plans and also expects to make
    additional voluntary pension contributions of approximately
    $300 million in the second quarter. During 2009 and 2008,
    the company made voluntary pension contributions of
    $800 million and $200 million, respectively.

STOCK
    COMPENSATION PLANS

Plan
    Descriptions

At December 31, 2009, Northrop Grumman had stock-based
    compensation awards outstanding under the following plans: the
    2001 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan (2001 LTISP), the 1993
    Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan (1993 LTISP), both applicable to
    employees, and the 1993 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors
    (1993 SPND) and 1995 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (1995
    SPND) as amended. All of these plans were approved by the
    company’s shareholders. The company has historically issued
    new shares to satisfy award grants.

Employee Plans

– The 2001 LTISP and the 1993
    LTISP permit grants to key employees of three general types of
    stock incentive awards: stock options, stock appreciation rights
    (SARs), and stock awards. Each stock option grant is made with
    an exercise price either at the closing price of the stock on
    the date of grant (market options) or at a premium over the
    closing price of the stock on the date of grant (premium
    options). Outstanding stock options granted prior to 2009
    generally vest in 25 percent increments over four years
    from the grant date under the 2001 LTISP and in years two to
    five under the 1993 LTISP, and grants outstanding expire ten
    years after the grant date. Stock options granted in 2009 vest
    in 33 percent increments over three years from the grant
    date, and grants outstanding expire seven years after the grant
    date. No SARs have been granted under either of the LTISPs and
    effective with the adoption of the 2001 LTISP, no new grants
    have been issued from the 1993 LTISP. Stock awards, in the form
    of restricted performance stock rights and restricted stock
    rights, are granted to key employees without payment to the
    company.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Under the 2001 LTISP, recipients of restricted performance stock
    rights earn shares of stock, based on financial metrics
    determined by the board of directors in accordance with the
    plan. For grants prior to 2007, if the objectives have not been
    met at the end of the applicable performance period, up to
    100 percent of the original grant for the eight highest
    compensated employees and up to 70 percent of the original
    grant for all other recipients will be forfeited. If the
    financial metrics are met or exceeded during the performance
    period, all recipients can earn up to 150 percent of the
    original grant. Beginning in 2007, all members of the Corporate
    Policy Council (consisting of the CEO and certain other
    leadership positions) could forfeit up to 100 percent of
    the original grant, and all recipients could earn up to
    200 percent of the original grant. Restricted stock rights
    issued under either plan generally vest after three years.
    Termination of employment can result in forfeiture of some or
    all of the benefits extended. Of the 50 million shares
    approved for issuance under the 2001 LTISP, approximately
    13 million shares were available for future grants as of
    December 31, 2009.

Non-Employee Plans

– Under the 1993 SPND, at
    least half of the retainer fee earned by each director must be
    deferred into a stock unit account (Automatic Stock Units).
    Effective January 1, 2010, the amended SPND provides that
    the Automatic Stock Units be awarded at the conclusion of board
    service or as specified by the director. If a director has less
    than 5 years of service, the stock units are awarded at the
    conclusion of board service. In addition, directors may defer
    payment of all or part of the remaining retainer fee and other
    annual committee fees, which are placed in a stock unit account
    (Elective Stock Units). The Elective Stock Units are awarded at
    the conclusion of board service or as specified by the director,
    regardless of years of service. The 1995 SPND provided for
    annual stock option grants, and effective June 1, 2005, no
    new grants have been issued from this plan. The 1995 SPND was
    amended in May 2007 to permit payment of the stock unit portion
    of the retainer fee described above. Each grant of stock options
    under the 1995 SPND was made at the closing market price on the
    date of the grant, was immediately exercisable, and expires ten
    years after the grant date. At December 31, 2009,
    approximately 212 thousand shares were available for future
    grants under the 1995 SPND.

Compensation
    Expense

Total stock-based compensation for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, was $101 million,
    $111 million, and $196 million, respectively, of which
    $20 million, $15 million, and $12 million related
    to stock options and $81 million, $96 million, and
    $184 million, related to stock awards, respectively. Tax
    benefits recognized in the consolidated statements of operations
    for stock-based compensation during the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, were $40 million,
    $44 million, and $77 million, respectively. In
    addition, the company realized tax benefits of $4 million
    from the exercise of stock options and $47 million from the
    issuance of stock awards in 2009.

Stock
    Options

The fair value of each of the company’s stock option awards
    is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the
    table below. The fair value of the company’s stock option
    awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting
    period of the options, which is generally three to four years.
    Expected volatility is based on an average of
    (1) historical volatility of the company’s stock and
    (2) implied volatility from traded options on the
    company’s stock. The risk-free rate for periods within the
    contractual life of the stock option award is based on the yield
    curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the
    award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of
    the award. The company uses historical data to estimate future
    forfeitures. The expected term of awards granted is derived from
    historical experience under the company’s stock-based
    compensation plans and represents the period of time that awards
    granted are expected to be outstanding.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

The significant weighted-average assumptions relating to the
    valuation of the company’s stock options for the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, was as follows:

In 2007 and 2008, the company granted stock options almost
    exclusively to executives, and the expected term of six years
    was based on these employees’ exercise behavior. Beginning
    in 2009, the company began granting options to non-executives
    and assigned an expected term of five years for valuing these
    options. The company believes that this stratification of
    expected terms best represents future expected exercise behavior
    between the two employee groups.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options
    granted during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and
    2007, was $7, $15, and $15, per share, respectively.

In connection with the September 2009 announcement that the
    company’s CEO would retire in June 2010, the board of
    directors modified the CEO’s stock option grants by vesting
    the remaining unvested option grants to purchase
    192,271 shares of company stock. The incremental expense
    associated with these modifications is $2 million of which
    $743,000 was recognized during 2009. The remaining unrecognized
    modification expense will be recognized ratably through June
    2010.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, was
    $11 million, $66 million, and $153 million,
    respectively. Intrinsic value is measured using the fair market
    value at the date of exercise (for options exercised) or at
    December 31, 2009 (for outstanding options), less the
    applicable exercise price.

Stock Awards

– Compensation expense for stock
    awards is measured at the grant date based on fair value and
    recognized over the vesting period, generally three years. The
    fair value of stock awards is determined based on the closing
    market price of the company’s common stock on the grant
    date. For purposes of measuring compensation expense, the amount
    of shares ultimately expected to vest is estimated at each
    reporting date based on management’s expectations regarding
    the relevant performance criteria.

The company issued 2.5 million, 2.9 million, and
    2.6 million shares to employees in settlement of prior year
    stock awards that were fully vested, which had total fair values
    at issuance of $111 million, $233 million, and
    $199 million and grant date fair values of
    $161 million, $155 million, and $125 million
    during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007,
    respectively. The differences between the fair values at
    issuance and the grant date fair values reflect the effects of
    the performance adjustments and changes in the fair market value
    of the company’s common stock.

In 2010, the company expects to issue to employees
    1.3 million shares of common stock that were vested in
    2009, which had a grant date fair value of $95 million.

Unrecognized Compensation Expense

– At
    December 31, 2009, there was $156 million of
    unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested awards
    granted under the company’s stock-based compensation plans,
    of which $21 million relates to stock options and
    $135 million relates to stock awards. These amounts are
    expected to be charged to expense over a weighted-average period
    of 1.4 years.

UNAUDITED
    SELECTED QUARTERLY DATA

Unaudited quarterly financial results are set forth in the
    following tables. The financial results for all periods
    presented have been revised to reflect the various business
    dispositions that occurred during the 2009 and 2008 fiscal years
    (see Note 5 for further details). The company’s common
    stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (trading symbol
    NOC). This unaudited quarterly information is labeled using a
    calendar convention; that is, first quarter is consistently
    labeled as ended on March 31, second quarter as ended on
    June 30, and third quarter as ended on September 30.
    It is the company’s long-standing practice to establish
    actual interim closing dates using a “fiscal”
    calendar, which requires the businesses to close their books on
    a Friday, in order to normalize the potentially disruptive
    effects of quarterly closings on business processes. The effects
    of this practice only exist within a reporting year.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Northrop Grumman Corporation (the company)
    prepared and is responsible for the consolidated financial
    statements and all related financial information contained in
    this Annual Report. This responsibility includes establishing
    and maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting. The company’s internal control over financial
    reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
    the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America.

To comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the
    Sarbanes – Oxley Act of 2002, the company designed and
    implemented a structured and comprehensive assessment process to
    evaluate its internal control over financial reporting across
    the enterprise. The assessment of the effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control –
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Because of its
    inherent limitations, a system of internal control over
    financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and
    may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management regularly
    monitors its internal control over financial reporting, and
    actions are taken to correct any deficiencies as they are
    identified. Based on its assessment, management has concluded
    that the company’s internal control over financial
    reporting is effective as of December 31, 2009.

Deloitte & Touche LLP issued an attestation report
    dated February 8, 2010, concerning the company’s
    internal control over financial reporting, which is contained in
    this Annual Report. The company’s consolidated financial
    statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    have been audited by the independent registered public
    accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States).

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Northrop Grumman Corporation

Los Angeles, California

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    Northrop Grumman Corporation and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control –
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 of
    the Company and our report dated February 8, 2010 expressed
    an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and the
    financial statement schedule.
