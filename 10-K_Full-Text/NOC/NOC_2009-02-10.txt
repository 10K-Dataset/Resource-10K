HISTORY
    AND ORGANIZATION

History

Northrop Grumman Corporation (“Northrop Grumman” or
    the “company”) is an integrated enterprise consisting
    of businesses that cover the entire defense spectrum, from
    undersea to outer space and into cyberspace. The companies that
    have become part of today’s Northrop Grumman achieved
    historic accomplishments, from transporting Charles Lindbergh
    across the Atlantic to carrying astronauts to the moon’s
    surface and back.

The company was originally formed in California in 1939 and was
    reincorporated in Delaware in 1985. From 1994 through 2002, the
    company entered a period of significant expansion through
    acquisitions of other businesses, most notably:

n

In 1994, Northrop Corporation acquired Grumman Corporation
    (Grumman) and was renamed Northrop Grumman. Grumman was a
    premier military aircraft systems integrator and builder of the
    Lunar Module that first delivered men to the surface of the moon.

n

In 1996, the company acquired the defense and electronics
    businesses of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, a world leader
    in the development and production of sophisticated radar and
    other electronic systems for the nation’s defense, civil
    aviation, and other international and domestic applications.

n

In 2001, the company acquired Litton Industries (Litton), a
    global electronics and information technology enterprise, and
    one of the nation’s leading full-service design,
    engineering, construction, and life cycle supporters of major
    surface ships for the United States (U.S.) Navy, U.S. Coast
    Guard, and international navies.

n

Also in 2001, Newport News Shipbuilding (Newport News) was added
    to the company. Newport News is the nation’s sole designer,
    builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and
    one of only two companies capable of designing and building
    nuclear-powered submarines.

n

In 2002, Northrop Grumman acquired the space and mission systems
    businesses of TRW Inc. (TRW), a leading developer of military
    and civil space systems and satellite payloads, as well as a
    leading global integrator of complex, mission-enabling systems
    and services.

The acquisition of these and other businesses have shaped the
    company into its present position as a premier provider of
    technologically advanced, innovative products, services and
    solutions in information and services, aerospace, electronics
    and shipbuilding. As prime contractor, principal subcontractor,
    partner, or preferred supplier, Northrop Grumman participates in
    many high-priority defense and commercial technology programs in
    the U.S. and abroad. The company conducts most of its
    business with the U.S. Government, principally the
    Department of Defense (DoD). The company also conducts business
    with local, state, and foreign governments and domestic and
    international commercial customers. For a description of the
    company’s foreign operations, see Risk Factors in
    Part I, Item 1A.

Organization

On December 31, 2008, the company was aligned into seven
    reporting segments categorized into four primary businesses. The
    Mission Systems, Information Technology, and Technical Services
    segments are presented as Information & Services. The
    Integrated Systems and Space Technology segments are presented
    as Aerospace. The Electronics and Shipbuilding segments are each
    presented as separate businesses.

The company, from time to time, acquires or disposes of
    businesses, and realigns contracts, programs or business areas
    among and within its operating segments that possess similar
    customers, expertise, and capabilities. Internal realignments
    are designed to more fully leverage existing capabilities and
    enhance development and delivery of

-1-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

products and services. The operating results for all periods
    presented have been revised to reflect these changes made
    through December 31, 2008.

During the second quarter of 2008, the company transferred
    certain programs and assets from the missiles business in the
    Mission Systems segment to the Space Technology segment. This
    transfer allows Mission Systems to focus on the rapidly growing
    command, control, communications, intelligence, surveillance,
    and reconnaissance (C3ISR) business. The missiles business will
    be an integrated element of the company’s Aerospace
    business growth strategy.

In January 2008, the Newport News and Ship Systems businesses
    were realigned into a single operating segment called Northrop
    Grumman Shipbuilding. Previously, these businesses were separate
    operating segments which were aggregated into a single reporting
    segment for financial reporting purposes. In addition, certain
    Electronics businesses were transferred to Mission Systems
    during the first quarter of 2008.

Subsequent Realignments

– In January 2009, the
    company streamlined its organizational structure by reducing the
    number of reporting segments from seven to five. The five
    segments are Aerospace Systems, which combines the former
    Integrated Systems and Space Technology segments; Electronic
    Systems; Information Systems, which combines the former
    Information Technology and Mission Systems segments;
    Shipbuilding and Technical Services. The creation of the
    Aerospace Systems and Information Systems segments strengthens
    alignment with customers, improves the company’s ability to
    execute on programs and win new business, and enhances cost
    competitiveness. This subsequent realignment is not reflected in
    any of the accompanying financial information.

SHIPBUILDING

The Shipbuilding segment, headquartered in Newport News,
    Virginia, is the nation’s sole industrial designer,
    builder, and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and
    one of only two companies capable of designing and building
    nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy. Shipbuilding
    is also one of the nation’s leading full service providers
    for the design, engineering, construction, and life cycle
    support of major programs for the U.S. Navy,
    U.S. Coast Guard, international navies, and for commercial
    vessels. The segment includes the following areas of business:
    Aircraft Carriers; Expeditionary Warfare; Surface Combatants;
    Submarines; Coast Guard & Coastal Defense; Fleet
    Support; Commercial; and Services & Other.

Aircraft Carriers

– The U.S. Navy’s
    newest carrier and the last of the Nimitz class, the

USS
    George H. W. Bush

, was commissioned in January 2009.
    Advanced design and preparation efforts have been ongoing for
    the new generation carrier, the Ford class, which will
    incorporate transformational technologies that will result in
    manning reductions, improved war fighting capability, and a new
    nuclear propulsion plant design. In September 2008, Shipbuilding
    received a $5.1 billion contract award for construction of
    the first ship of the class, the

Gerald R. Ford

, which is
    scheduled for delivery in 2015. The company also provides
    ongoing maintenance for the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier
    fleet through overhaul, refueling, and repair work. Shipbuilding
    is currently performing the refueling and complex overhaul of
    the

USS Carl Vinson

with redelivery to the U.S. Navy
    anticipated in early 2009. Planning for the

USS Theodore
    Roosevelt

refueling and complex overhaul began in the fall
    of 2006 and the ship is expected to arrive at Newport News,
    Virginia in the summer of 2009.

Expeditionary Warfare

– Expeditionary Warfare
    programs include the design and construction of amphibious
    assault ships for the U.S. Navy, including the LHD 1 WASP
    class and the San Antonio LPD 17 class. Shipbuilding is the
    sole provider for the LHD class of large-deck, 40,500-ton
    multipurpose amphibious assault ships, which serve as the
    centerpiece of an Amphibious Ready Group. Currently, the LHD-8
    is under construction and is a significant upgrade from the
    preceding seven ships of its class. The LHD-8 is scheduled for
    delivery in mid-2009. In 2007, the construction contract for LHA
    6, the first in a new class of enhanced amphibious assault
    ships, was awarded. The ship is scheduled for delivery in 2013.
    Shipbuilding is also the sole provider of the LPD 17 class of
    ships, which function as amphibious transports. The initial four
    ships were delivered in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008, and five LPD
    17 ships are currently under construction.

Surface Combatants

– Surface Combatants
    includes the design and construction of the Arleigh Burke DDG 51
    class Aegis guided missile destroyers, and the design and
    construction of DDG 1000 (previously DD(X)), the Navy’s
    future transformational surface combatant class. Shipbuilding is
    one of two prime contractors designing and building DDG 51 class
    destroyers, which provide primary anti-aircraft and anti-missile
    ship protection for the U.S. Navy fleet. Three Arleigh
    Burke class destroyers are currently under construction. In
    2006, Shipbuilding was awarded Phase IV detailed design and
    long lead construction funding for the initial DDG 1000. The
    construction award for the second ship in the class, DDG 1001,
    was received in 2008. The contract establishes a joint work
    share between Shipbuilding and General Dynamics’ Bath Iron
    Works (which will produce the first ship in the class) for
    detailed design and construction of the DDG 1000 class of ships.
    The advanced technologies developed for the DDG 1000 are
    anticipated to be incorporated into the next generation guided
    missile cruiser CG(X).

Submarines

– Northrop Grumman is one of only
    two U.S. companies capable of designing and building
    nuclear-powered submarines. In February 1997, the company and
    Electric Boat, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Dynamics
    Corporation, reached an agreement to cooperatively build

Virginia

class nuclear attack submarines. The initial
    four submarines in the class were delivered in 2004, 2006, and
    2008. Electric Boat and Shipbuilding were awarded a construction
    contract in August 2003 for the second block of six

Virginia

class submarines, the first of which was delivered by
    Electric Boat in August 2008. Construction on the remaining five
    submarines is

-8-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

underway, with the last scheduled to be delivered in 2014. In
    December 2008, Shipbuilding and Electric Boat were awarded a
    construction contract for the third block of eight

Virginia

class submarines. The multi-year contract allows
    Shipbuilding and its teammate to proceed with the construction
    of one submarine per year in 2009 and 2010, and two submarines
    per year from 2011 to 2013. The eighth submarine to be procured
    under this contract is scheduled for delivery in 2019.

Coast Guard & Coastal Defense

–
    Shipbuilding is a joint venture partner along with Lockheed
    Martin for the Coast Guard’s Deepwater Modernization
    Program. Shipbuilding has design and production responsibility
    for surface ships. In 2006, the Shipbuilding/Lockheed Martin
    joint venture was awarded a

43-month

contract extension for the Deepwater program. The first National
    Security Cutter (NSC),

USCGC Berthoff

, was delivered to
    the Coast Guard in 2008. Currently the

Waesche

(NSC2) and

Stratton

(NSC3) are in construction, and long lead
    procurement is underway for NSC4.

Fleet Support

– Shipbuilding provides
    after-market services, including on-going maintenance and repair
    work, for a wide array of naval and commercial vessels. The
    company has ship repair facilities in the U.S. Navy’s
    largest homeports of Norfolk, Virginia, and San Diego,
    California.

Commercial

– Under the Polar Tanker program,
    Shipbuilding was under contract to produce five double-hulled
    tankers. These tankers each transport one million barrels of
    crude oil from Alaska to west coast refineries and are fully
    compliant with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. The last ship
    under this program was delivered in mid-2006.

Services & Other

– Shipbuilding
    provides various services to commercial nuclear and non-nuclear
    industrial customers. In January 2008, Savannah River Nuclear
    Solutions, a joint venture among Shipbuilding, Fluor
    Corporation, and Honeywell, was awarded a contract for site
    management and operations of the U.S. Department of
    Energy’s Savannah River Site in Aiken, South Carolina. In
    October 2008, Shipbuilding announced the formation of a joint
    venture with AREVA NP to build a new manufacturing and
    engineering facility in Newport News, Virginia, to help supply
    the growing American nuclear energy sector.

PATENTS

The following table summarizes the number of patents the company
    owns or has pending as of December 31, 2008:

Owned

Pending

Total

U.S. patents

3,210


3,657

Foreign patents

6,218

Patents developed while under contract with the
    U.S. Government may be subject to use by the
    U.S. Government. In addition the company licenses
    intellectual property to, and from, third parties. Management
    believes the company’s ability to conduct its operations
    would not be materially affected by the loss of any particular
    intellectual property right.

SEASONALITY

No material portion of the company’s business is considered
    to be seasonal. The timing of revenue recognition is based on
    several factors including the timing of contract awards, the
    incurrence of contract costs, cost estimation, and unit
    deliveries. See Revenue Recognition in Part II, Item 7.

BACKLOG

At December 31, 2008, total backlog was $78.1 billion
    compared with $63.7 billion at the end of 2007.
    Approximately 65 percent of the $37.4 billion funded
    backlog at December 31, 2008, is expected to be converted
    into sales in 2009.

Total backlog includes both funded backlog (firm orders for
    which funding is contractually obligated by the customer) and
    unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding is not currently
    contractually obligated by the customer). Unfunded backlog
    excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite
    delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) orders. For multi-year
    services contracts with non-federal government customers having
    no stated contract values, backlog includes only the amounts
    committed by the customer. For backlog by segment see Backlog in
    Part II, Item 7.

RAW
    MATERIALS

The most significant raw material required by the company is
    steel, used primarily for shipbuilding. The company has
    mitigated supply risk by negotiating long-term agreements with a
    number of steel suppliers. In addition, the company has
    mitigated price risk related to its steel purchases through
    certain contractual arrangements with the U.S. Government.
    While the company has generally been able to obtain key raw
    materials required in its production processes in a timely
    manner, a significant delay in receipt of these supplies by the
    company could have a material adverse effect on the
    company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows. See Risk Factors in Part I,
    Item 1A.

GOVERNMENT
    REGULATION

The company’s business is affected by numerous laws and
    regulations relating to the award, administration and
    performance of U.S. Government contracts. See Risk Factors
    in Part I, Item 1A.

Certain programs with the U.S. Government that are
    prohibited by the customer from being publicly discussed in
    detail are referred to as “restricted” in this

Form 10-K.

The consolidated financial statements and financial information
    contained within this

Form 10-K

reflect the operating results of restricted programs under
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (U.S. GAAP). See Risk Factors in Part I,
    Item 1A.

RESEARCH
    AND DEVELOPMENT

Company-sponsored research and development activities primarily
    include independent research and development (IR&D) efforts
    related to government programs. IR&D expenses are included
    in general and administrative expenses and are generally
    allocated to U.S. Government contracts. Company-sponsored
    research and development expenses totaled $576 million,
    $534 million, and $569 million in 2008, 2007, and
    2006, respectively. Expenses for research and development
    sponsored by the customer are charged directly to the related
    contracts.

EMPLOYEE
    RELATIONS

The company believes that it maintains good relations with its
    123,600 employees, of which approximately 18 percent
    are covered by 36 collective bargaining agreements. The company
    expects to re-negotiate seven of its collective bargaining
    agreements in 2009. It is not expected that the results of these
    negotiations will, either individually or in the aggregate, have
    a material adverse effect on the company’s results of
    operations. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    MATTERS

Federal, state, and local laws relating to the protection of the
    environment affect the company’s manufacturing operations.
    The company has provided for the estimated cost to complete
    environmental remediation where the company has determined it is
    probable that the company will incur such costs in the future to
    address environmental impacts at currently or formerly owned or
    leased operating facilities, or at sites where it has been named
    a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) by the Environmental
    Protection Agency or similarly designated by other environmental
    agencies. These estimates may change given the inherent
    difficulty in estimating environmental cleanup costs to be
    incurred in the future due to the uncertainties regarding the
    extent of the required cleanup, determination of legally
    responsible parties, and the status of laws, regulations, and
    their interpretations.

In order to assess the potential impact on the company’s
    financial statements, management estimates the possible
    remediation costs that reasonably could be incurred by the
    company on a

site-by-site

basis. Such estimates take into consideration the professional
    judgment of the company’s environmental engineers and, when
    necessary, consultation with outside environmental specialists.
    In most instances, only a range of reasonably possible costs can
    be estimated. However, in the determination of accruals, the
    most probable amount is used when determinable, and the minimum
    is used when no single amount is more probable. The company
    records accruals for environmental cleanup costs in the
    accounting period in which the company’s responsibility is
    established and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The
    company does not anticipate and record insurance recoveries
    before it has determined that collection is probable.

Management estimates that at December 31, 2008, the range
    of reasonably possible future costs for environmental
    remediation sites is $186 million to $279 million, of
    which $231 million is accrued in other current liabilities
    in the consolidated statements of financial position.
    Environmental accruals are recorded on an undiscounted basis. At
    sites involving multiple parties, the company provides
    environmental accruals based upon its expected share of
    liability, taking into account the financial viability of other
    jointly liable parties. Environmental expenditures are expensed
    or capitalized as appropriate. Capitalized expenditures relate
    to long-lived improvements in currently operating facilities. In
    addition, should other PRPs not pay their allocable share of
    remediation costs, the company may have to incur costs in
    addition to those already estimated and accrued, which could
    have a material effect on the company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The
    company has made the investments it believes necessary in order
    to comply with environmental laws. Although management cannot
    predict whether new information gained as projects progress will
    materially affect the estimated liability accrued, management
    does not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will
    have a material adverse effect on the company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

COMPETITIVE
    CONDITIONS

Northrop Grumman, along with Lockheed Martin Corporation, The
    Boeing Company, Raytheon Company, and General Dynamics
    Corporation are among the largest companies in the
    U.S. defense industry at this time. Northrop Grumman
    competes against these and other companies for a number of
    programs, both large and small. Intense competition and long
    operating cycles are both key characteristics of Northrop
    Grumman’s business and the defense industry. It is common
    in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a
    number of companies. A company competing to be a prime
    contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to another
    party, turn out to be a subcontractor for the ultimate prime
    contracting party. It is not uncommon to compete for a contract
    award with a peer company and, simultaneously, perform as a
    supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts.
    The nature of major defense programs, conducted under binding
    contracts, allows companies that perform well to benefit from a
    level of program continuity not common in many industries.

The company’s success in the competitive defense industry
    depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and
    services, as well as its ability to provide the people,
    technologies, facilities, equipment, and financial capacity
    needed to deliver those products and services with maximum
    efficiency. It is necessary to maintain, as the company has,
    sources for raw materials, fabricated parts, electronic
    components, and major subassemblies. In this manufacturing and
    systems integration environment, effective oversight of
    subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing
    internal operations.

Similarly, there is intense competition among many companies in
    the information and services markets, which are generally more
    labor intensive with competitive margin rates over contract
    periods of shorter duration. Competitors in the information and
    services markets include the defense industry participants
    mentioned above as well as many other large and small entities
    with expertise in various specialized areas. The company’s
    ability to successfully compete in the information and services
    markets depends on a number of factors; most important is the
    capability to deploy skilled professionals, many requiring
    security clearances, at competitive prices across the diverse
    spectrum of these markets. Accordingly, various workforce
    initiatives are in place to ensure the company is successful in
    attracting, developing and retaining sufficient resources to
    maintain or improve its competitive position within these
    markets. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

Item 1A.
    Risk Factors

The company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of
    which are not exclusively within the company’s control,
    that may cause actual performance to differ materially from
    historical or projected future performance. The company urges
    investors to carefully consider the risk factors described below
    in evaluating the information contained in this report.

n

The Company Depends Heavily on a Single Customer, the
    U.S. Government, for a Substantial Portion of the
    Company’s Business, Including Programs Subject to Security
    Classification Restrictions on Information. Changes Affecting
    this Customer’s Capacity to Do Business with the Company or
    the Effects of Competition in the Defense Industry Could Have a
    Material Adverse Effect On the Company or Its Prospects.

Approximately 91 percent of the company’s revenues
    during 2008 were derived from products and services ultimately
    sold to the U.S. Government and are therefore affected by,
    among other things, the federal budget process. The company is a
    supplier, either directly or as a subcontractor or team member,
    to the U.S. Government and its agencies as well as foreign
    governments and agencies. These contracts are subject to the
    respective customers’ political and budgetary constraints
    and processes, changes in customers’ short-range and
    long-range strategic plans, the timing of contract awards, and
    in the case of contracts with the U.S. Government, the
    congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes,
    the U.S. Government’s ability to terminate contracts
    for convenience or for default, as well as other risks such as
    contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain
    violations of legal and regulatory requirements. The termination
    or failure to fund one or more significant contracts by the
    U.S. Government could have a material adverse effect on the
    company’s results of operations or prospects. Current or
    future economic conditions could result in the reprioritization
    of or reduction in future U.S. Government defense spending
    levels.

In the event of termination for the government’s
    convenience, contractors are normally protected by provisions
    covering reimbursement for costs incurred. The company is
    involved as a plaintiff in a lawsuit concerning a contract
    terminated for convenience. See Other Matters in Part I,
    Item 3. Termination resulting from the company’s
    default could expose the company to liability and have a
    material adverse effect on its ability to compete for contracts.

In addition, a material amount of the company’s revenues
    and profits is derived from programs that are subject to
    security classification restrictions (restricted business),
    which could limit the company’s ability to discuss details
    about these programs, their risks or any disputes or claims
    relating to such programs. As a result, investors might have
    less insight into the company’s restricted business than
    other businesses of the company or could experience less ability
    to evaluate fully the risks, disputes or claims associated with
    restricted business.

The company’s success in the competitive defense industry
    depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and
    services, as well as its ability to provide the people,
    technologies, facilities, equipment, and financial capacity
    needed to deliver those products and services with maximum
    efficiency. A loss of business to the company’s competitors
    could have a material adverse affect on the company’s
    ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain
    market share.

n

Many of the Company’s Contracts Contain Performance
    Obligations That Require Innovative Design Capabilities, Are
    Technologically Complex, Require

State-Of-The-Art

Manufacturing Expertise or Are Dependent Upon Factors Not Wholly
    Within the Company’s Control. Failure to Meet These
    Obligations Could Adversely Affect the Company’s
    Profitability and Future Prospects.

The company designs, develops and manufactures technologically
    advanced and innovative products and services applied by its
    customers in a variety of environments. Problems and delays in
    development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to
    design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning
    curve assumptions, or materials and components could prevent the
    company from achieving contractual requirements.

-13-

    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

In addition, the company’s products cannot be tested and
    proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen
    problems. Examples of unforeseen problems which could negatively
    affect revenue and profitability include loss on launch of
    spacecraft, premature failure, problems with quality, country of
    origin, delivery of subcontractor components or services, and
    unplanned degradation of product performance. These failures
    could result, either directly or indirectly, in loss of life or
    property. Among the factors that may affect revenue and profits
    could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance
    or indemnification from the customer, diversion of management
    focus in responding to unforeseen problems, loss of follow-on
    work, and, in the case of certain contracts, repayment to the
    government customer of contract cost and fee payments previously
    received by the company.

Certain contracts, primarily involving space satellite systems,
    contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in
    the event of partial or complete failure of the system upon
    launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period
    of time. Under such terms, the company could be required to
    forfeit fees previously recognized

and/or

collected. The company has not experienced any material losses
    in the last decade in connection with such contract performance
    incentive provisions. However, if the company were to experience
    launch failures or complete satellite system failures in the
    future, such events could have a material adverse impact on the
    company’s consolidated financial position or results of
    operations.

n

Contract Cost Growth on Fixed-Price and Other Contracts
    That Cannot Be Justified as an Increase In Contract Value Due
    From Customers Exposes The Company to Reduced Profitability and
    the Potential Loss of Future Business.

Operating income is adversely affected when contract costs that
    cannot be billed to customers are incurred. This cost growth can
    occur if estimates to complete increase due to technical
    challenges or if initial estimates used for calculating the
    contract cost were incorrect. The cost estimation process
    requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost
    growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the
    nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of
    change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any
    delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from
    the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover
    any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant
    change in cost estimates on one or more programs could have a
    material effect on the company’s consolidated financial
    position or results of operations.

Due to their nature, fixed-price contracts inherently have more
    risk than flexibly priced contracts and therefore generally
    carry higher profit margins. Approximately 30 percent of
    the company’s annual revenues are derived from fixed-price
    contracts – see Contracts in Part II,
    Item 7. Flexibly priced contracts may carry risk to the
    extent of their specific contract terms and conditions relating
    to performance award fees, including cost sharing agreements,
    and negative performance incentives. The company typically
    enters into fixed-price contracts where costs can be reasonably
    estimated based on experience. In addition, certain contracts
    other than fixed-price contracts have provisions relating to
    cost controls and audit rights. Should the terms specified in
    those contracts not be met, then profitability may be reduced.
    Fixed-price development work comprises a small portion of the
    company’s fixed-price contracts and inherently has more
    uncertainty as to future events than production contracts and
    therefore more variability in estimates of the costs to complete
    the development stage. As work progresses through the
    development stage into production, the risks associated with
    estimating the total costs of the contract are generally
    reduced. In addition, successful performance of fixed-price
    development contracts which include production units is subject
    to the company’s ability to control cost growth in meeting
    production specifications and delivery rates. While management
    uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with
    fixed-price development contracts, future events could result in
    either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates.
    Examples of the company’s significant fixed-price
    development contracts include the F-16 Block 60 combat
    avionics program and the MESA radar system program for the
    Wedgetail and Peace Eagle contracts, both of which are performed
    by the Electronics segment. It is also not unprecedented in the
    shipbuilding business for the company to

-14-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

negotiate fixed-price production follow-on contracts before the
    development effort has been completed and learning curves fully
    realized on existing flexibly priced development contracts.

n

The Company Uses Estimates When Accounting for Contracts.
    Changes In Estimates Could Affect The Company’s
    Profitability and Its Overall Financial Position.

Contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing
    risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making
    assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size
    and nature of many of the company’s contracts, the
    estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is
    complicated and subject to many variables. For example,
    assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to
    complete the contract because costs also include expected
    increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly,
    assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of
    company initiated efficiency initiatives and cost reduction
    efforts. Incentives, awards, or penalties related to performance
    on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit
    rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information to
    assess anticipated performance.

Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation
    processes described above, it is possible that materially
    different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions
    were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change.
    Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates
    may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial
    reporting and performance. See Critical Accounting Policies,
    Estimates, and Judgments in Part II, Item 7.

n

The Company’s Operations Are Subject to Numerous
    Domestic and International Laws, Regulations and Restrictions,
    and Noncompliance With These Laws, Regulations and Restrictions
    Could Expose the Company to Fines, Penalties, Suspension or
    Debarment, Which Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the
    Company’s Profitability and Its Overall Financial
    Position.

The company has thousands of contracts and operations in many
    parts of the world subject to U.S. and foreign laws and
    regulations. Prime contracts with various agencies of the
    U.S. Government and subcontracts with other prime
    contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations,
    including the False Claims Act and the International Traffic in
    Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act,
    with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in
    fines, penalties, debarment, or suspension from receiving
    additional contracts with all U.S. Government agencies.
    Given the company’s dependence on U.S. Government
    business, suspension or debarment could have a material adverse
    effect on the company.

In addition, international business subjects the company to
    numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including,
    without limitation, regulations relating to import-export
    control, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of
    earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,
    and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export
    Administration Act. Failure by the company or its sales
    representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and
    regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal
    liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension
    or debarment from government contracts or suspension of the
    company’s export privileges, which could have a material
    adverse effect on the company. Changes in regulation or
    political environment may affect the company’s ability to
    conduct business in foreign markets including investment,
    procurement, and repatriation of earnings.

The company operates in a highly regulated environment and is
    routinely audited by the U.S. Government and others. On a
    regular basis, the company monitors its policies and procedures
    with respect to its contracts to ensure consistent application
    under similar terms and conditions and to assess compliance with
    all applicable government regulations. Negative audit findings
    could result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of
    profits, or suspension of payments. From time to time the
    company is subject to U.S. Government investigations
    relating to its operations. Government contractors that are
    found to have violated the law such as the False Claims Act or
    the Arms Export Control Act, or are indicted or convicted for
    violations of other federal laws, or are found not to have acted
    responsibly as defined by the law, may be subject to significant
    fines. Such convictions could also result in suspension or
    debarment from government

-15-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

contracting for some period of time. Given the company’s
    dependence on government contracting, suspension or debarment
    could have a material adverse effect on the company.

n

The Company’s Business Is Subject to Disruption
    Caused By Issues With Its Suppliers, Subcontractors, Workforce,
    Natural Disasters and Other Factors That Could Adversely Affect
    the Company’s Profitability and Its Overall Financial
    Position.

The company may be affected by delivery or performance issues
    with key suppliers and subcontractors, as well as other factors
    that may cause operating results to be adversely affected.
    Changes in inventory requirements or other production cost
    increases may also have a negative effect on the company’s
    consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Performance failures by a subcontractor of the company or
    difficulty in maintaining complete alignment of the
    subcontractor’s obligations with the company’s prime
    contract obligations may adversely affect the company’s
    ability to perform its obligations on the prime contract, which
    could reduce the company’s profitability due to damages or
    other costs that may not be fully recoverable from the
    subcontractor or from the customer and could result in a
    termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on
    the company’s ability to compete for future contracts. If
    the recent period of adverse economic conditions and credit
    market volatility continues, the company’s profitability
    may be negatively impacted by the inability of certain of the
    company’s subcontractors and key suppliers to continue
    providing their products

and/or

services.

Operating results are heavily dependent upon the company’s
    ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with
    requisite skill sets

and/or

security clearances. The successful negotiation of collective
    bargaining agreements and avoidance of organized work stoppages
    are also critical to the ongoing operations of the company.

The company has significant operations located in regions of the
    U.S. that may be exposed to damaging storms and other
    natural disasters. While preventative measures typically help to
    minimize harm to the company, the damage and disruption
    resulting from certain storms or other natural disasters may be
    significant. Although no assurances can be made, the company
    believes it can recover costs associated with natural disasters
    through insurance or its contracts.

Natural disasters such as storms and earthquakes can disrupt
    electrical and other power distribution networks and cause
    adverse effects on profitability and performance, including
    computer and internet operation and accessibility. Computer
    viruses and similar harmful software programs, as well as
    network outages, disruptions and attacks also may have a
    material adverse effect on the company’s profitability and
    performance unless quarantined or otherwise prevented.

n

Changes In Future Business Conditions Could Cause Business
    Investments

and/or

Recorded Goodwill to Become Impaired, Resulting In Substantial
    Losses and Write-Downs That Would Reduce the Company’s
    Operating Income.

As part of its overall strategy, the company will, from time to
    time, acquire a minority or majority interest in a business.
    These investments are made upon careful target analysis and due
    diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or
    strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain
    assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price. After
    acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely
    affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not
    recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after
    careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary
    significantly from initial estimates. Goodwill accounts for
    approximately half of the company’s recorded total assets.
    The company evaluates goodwill amounts for impairment annually,
    or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual
    impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment.
    Principally, a significant decrease in expected cash flows or
    changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment
    of recorded goodwill. Adverse equity market conditions and the
    resulting decline in market multiples and the company’s
    stock price led to a

-16-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

non-cash, after-tax charge of $3.1 billion for impairment
    of goodwill at Shipbuilding and Space Technology. If the current
    economic conditions continue to deteriorate causing further
    decline in the company’s stock price, additional
    impairments to one or more businesses could occur in future
    periods whether or not connected to the annual impairment
    analysis. The company will continue to monitor the
    recoverability of the carrying value of its goodwill and other
    long-lived assets. See Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates,
    and Judgments in Part II, Item 7.

n

The Company Is Subject to Various Claims and Litigation
    That Could Ultimately Be Resolved Against The Company Requiring
    Material Future Cash Payments

and/or

Future Material Charges Against the Company’s Operating
    Income and Materially Impairing the Company’s Financial
    Position.

The size and complexity of the company’s business make it
    highly susceptible to claims and litigation. The company is
    subject to environmental claims, income tax matters and other
    litigation, which, if not resolved within established accruals,
    could have a material adverse effect on the company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows. See Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3, and
    Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments in
    Part II, Item 7.

n

Pension and Medical Expense Associated with the
    Company’s Retirement Benefit Plans May Fluctuate
    Significantly Depending Upon Changes in Actuarial Assumptions
    and Future Market Performance of Plan Assets.

A substantial portion of the company’s current and retired
    employee population is covered by pension and post-retirement
    benefit plans, the costs of which are dependent upon the
    company’s various assumptions, including estimates of rates
    of return on benefit related assets, discount rates for future
    payment obligations, rates of future cost growth and trends for
    future costs. In addition, funding requirements for benefit
    obligations of the company’s pension and post-retirement
    benefit plans are subject to legislative and other government
    regulatory actions. Variances from these estimates could have a
    material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
    Recent volatility in the financial markets has resulted in lower
    than expected returns on the company’s pension plan assets,
    resulting in potentially higher pension costs in future periods.

n

The Company’s Insurance Coverage May Be Inadequate to
    Cover All of Its Significant Risks or Its Insurers May Deny
    Coverage of Material Losses Incurred By the Company, Which Could
    Adversely Affect The Company’s Profitability and Overall
    Financial Position.

The company endeavors to identify and obtain in established
    markets insurance agreements to cover significant risks and
    liabilities (including, among others, natural disasters, product
    liability and business interruption). Not every risk or
    liability can be protected against by insurance, and, for
    insurable risks, the limits of coverage reasonably obtainable in
    the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or
    liabilities incurred. In some, but not all, circumstances the
    company may receive indemnification from the
    U.S. Government. Because of the limitations in overall
    available coverage referred to above, the company may have to
    bear substantial costs for uninsured losses that could have an
    adverse effect upon its consolidated results of operations and
    its overall consolidated financial position. Additionally,
    disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the
    timing of cash flows and, where litigation with the carrier
    becomes necessary, an outcome unfavorable to the company may
    have a material adverse effect on the company’s
    consolidated results of operations. See Note 15 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8.

n

Current Trends in U.S. Government Procurement May
    Adversely Affect Cash Flows or Program Profitability.

The company, like others in the defense industry, is aware of a
    potential problem presented by strict compliance with the
    Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement
    preference for enumerated specialty metals sourced domestically
    or from certain foreign countries. Subcontractors and lower-tier
    suppliers have made disclosures indicating inability to comply
    with the rule as written. Subject to limitations,

-17-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

inability to certify that all enumerated specialty metals in a
    product comply with sourcing requirements can lead to
    U.S. Government customers preventing delivery of materiel
    and products critical to national defense.

n

Current levels of market volatility are unprecedented and
    adverse capital and credit market conditions may affect the
    company’s ability to access cost-effective sources of
    funding.

The capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme
    volatility and disruption in late 2008 and early 2009.
    Historically, the company has occasionally accessed these
    markets to support certain business activities including
    acquisitions, capital expansion projects, refinancing existing
    debt, and issuing letters of credit. In the future, the company
    may not be able to obtain capital market financing or credit
    availability on similar terms, or at all, which could have a
    material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

n

The Company is Subject to Changes in United States and
    Global Market Conditions That Are Beyond the Company’s
    Control and May Have a Material Effect on the Company’s
    Business and Results of Operations.

The United States and global economies are currently
    experiencing a period of substantial economic uncertainty with
    wide-ranging effects, including the current disruption in global
    financial markets. Possible effects of these economic events are
    described in the preceding risk factors, including those
    relating to U.S. Government defense spending, business
    disruptions caused by suppliers or subcontractors, impairment of
    goodwill and other long-lived assets, pension costs and access
    to capital and credit markets. Although governments worldwide,
    including the U.S. Government, have initiated sweeping
    economic plans, the company is unable to predict the impact,
    severity, and duration of these economic events, which could
    have a material effect on the company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Item 3.
    Legal Proceedings

U.S. Government Investigations and
    Claims

– Departments and agencies of the
    U.S. Government have the authority to investigate various
    transactions and operations of the company, and the results of
    such investigations may lead to administrative, civil or
    criminal proceedings, the ultimate outcome of which could be
    fines, penalties, repayments or compensatory or treble damages.
    U.S. Government regulations provide that certain findings
    against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from
    future U.S. Government contracts or the loss of export
    privileges for a company or an operating division or
    subdivision. Suspension or debarment could have a material
    adverse effect on the company because of its reliance on
    government contracts.

As previously disclosed, in October 2005, the
    U.S. Department of Justice and a restricted
    U.S. Government customer apprised the company of potential
    substantial claims relating to certain microelectronic parts
    produced by the Space and Electronics Sector of former TRW Inc.,
    now a part of the company. In the third quarter of 2006, the
    company proposed to settle the claims and any associated matters
    and recognized a pre-tax charge of $112.5 million to cover
    the cost of the settlement proposal and associated investigative
    costs. The U.S. Government has advised the company that if
    continuing settlement discussions are not successful it will
    pursue its claims through litigation. On November 26, 2008,
    the U.S. Department of Justice filed a Notice of
    Intervention in a False Claims Act case that remains under seal
    in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of
    California. Because of the highly technical nature of the issues
    involved and their restricted status, because of the significant
    disagreement of the company with the allegations of the
    underlying qui tam complaint, and because of the significant
    disagreement between the company and the U.S. Government as
    to the U.S. Government’s theories of liability and
    damages (including a material difference between the
    U.S. Government’s damage theories and the
    company’s offer), final resolution of this matter could
    take a considerable amount of time, particularly if litigation
    should ensue. If the U.S. Government were to be ultimately
    successful on its theories of liability and damages, which could
    be trebled under the Federal False Claims Act, the effect upon
    the company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations, and cash flows would materially exceed the amount
    provided by the company. Based upon the information available to
    the company to date, the company believes that it has
    substantive defenses but can give no assurance that its views
    will prevail. Accordingly, the ultimate disposition of this
    matter cannot presently be determined.

As previously disclosed, in the second quarter of 2007, the
    U.S. Coast Guard issued a revocation of acceptance under
    the Deepwater Program for eight converted 123-foot patrol boats
    (the vessels) based on alleged “hull buckling and shaft
    alignment problems” and alleged “nonconforming topside
    equipment” on the vessels. The company submitted a written
    response that argued that the revocation of acceptance was
    improper, and in late December 2007, the Coast Guard advised
    Integrated Coast Guard Systems (the contractors’ joint
    venture for performing the Deepwater Program) that the Coast
    Guard is seeking $96.1 million from the Joint Venture as a

-20-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

result of the revocation of acceptance of the eight vessels
    delivered under the 123-foot conversion program. The majority of
    the costs associated with the 123-foot conversion effort are
    associated with the alleged structural deficiencies of the
    vessels, which were converted under contracts with the company
    and a subcontractor to the company. In May 2008, the Coast Guard
    advised the Joint Venture that the Coast Guard would support an
    investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice of the
    Joint Venture and its subcontractors instead of pursuing its
    $96.1 million claim independently. The Department of
    Justice had previously issued subpoenas related to the Deepwater
    Program, pursuant to which the company has provided responsive
    documents. The company recently learned that a civil False
    Claims Act complaint naming it as a defendant was filed under
    seal. The relationship between the allegations in the complaint
    and the U.S. Department of Justice’s investigation is
    unclear to the company. Based upon the information available to
    the company to date, the company believes that it has
    substantive defenses to any potential claims but can give no
    assurance that its views will prevail.

In August 2008, the company disclosed to the Antitrust Division
    of the U.S. Department of Justice possible violations of
    federal antitrust laws in connection with the bidding process
    for certain maintenance contracts at a military installation in
    California. In February 2009, the company and the Department of
    Justice signed an agreement admitting the company into the
    Corporate Leniency Program. As a result of the company’s
    acceptance into the Program, the company will be exempt from
    federal criminal prosecution and criminal fines relating to the
    matters the company reported to the Department of Justice if the
    company complies with certain conditions, including its
    continued cooperation with the government’s investigation
    and its agreement to make restitution if the government was
    harmed by the violations.

Based upon the available information regarding matters that are
    subject to U.S. Government investigations, other than as
    set out above, the company believes, but can give no assurance,
    that the outcome of any such matters would not have a material
    adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results
    of operations, or cash flows.

Litigation

– Various claims and legal
    proceedings arise in the ordinary course of business and are
    pending against the company and its properties. Based upon the
    information available, the company believes that the resolution
    of any of these various claims and legal proceedings would not
    have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows.

As previously disclosed, the U.S. District Court for the
    Central District of California consolidated two separately filed
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) lawsuits, which
    the plaintiffs seek to have certified as class actions, into the
    In Re Northrop Grumman Corporation ERISA Litigation. On
    August 7, 2007, the Court denied plaintiffs’ motion
    for class certification, and the plaintiffs appealed the
    Court’s decision on class certification to the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On
    October 11, 2007, the Ninth Circuit granted appellate
    review, which delayed the commencement of trial previously
    scheduled to begin January 22, 2008. The company believes
    that the outcome of these matters would not have a material
    adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results
    of operations, or cash flows.

Other
    Matters

In the event of contract termination for the government’s
    convenience, contractors are normally protected by provisions
    covering reimbursement for costs incurred under the contract. As
    previously disclosed, the company received a termination for
    convenience notice on the Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile
    (TSSAM) program in 1995. In December 1996, the company filed a
    lawsuit against the U.S. Government in the U.S. Court
    of Federal Claims seeking the recovery of approximately
    $750 million for uncompensated performance costs,
    investments and a reasonable profit on the program. Prior to
    1996, the company had charged to operations in excess of
    $600 million related to this program. The company is unable
    to predict whether it will realize some or all of its TSSAM
    claims, none of which are recorded on its consolidated statement
    of financial position.

As previously disclosed, the company is pursuing legal action
    against an insurance provider arising out of a disagreement
    concerning the coverage of certain losses related to Hurricane
    Katrina (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8). The company commenced
    the action against Factory Mutual Insurance Company (FM Global)
    on November 4, 2005, which is now pending in the
    U.S. District Court for

-21-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

the Central District of California, Western Division. In August
    2007, the district court issued an order finding that the excess
    insurance policy provided coverage for the company’s
    Katrina-related loss. In November 2007, FM Global filed a notice
    of appeal of the district court’s order. On August 14,
    2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
    reversed the earlier summary judgment order in favor of the
    company, holding that the FM Global excess policy unambiguously
    excludes damage from the storm surge caused by Hurricane Katrina
    under its “Flood” exclusion. The Court of Appeals
    remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the
    California efficient proximate cause doctrine affords the
    company coverage under the policy even if the Flood exclusion of
    the policy is unambiguous. The company filed a Petition for
    Rehearing En Banc, or in the Alternative, For Panel Rehearing
    with the Court of Appeals on August 27, 2008. On
    January 6, 2009, the Court of Appeals ordered FM Global to
    respond to the Petition for Rehearing by January 30, 2009.
    FM Global filed its opposition to the Petition for Rehearing and
    the company now awaits the Court of Appeal’s decision.
    Based on the current status of the assessment and claim process,
    no assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome of this
    matter.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

OVERVIEW

Business

Northrop Grumman provides technologically advanced, innovative
    products, services, and integrated solutions in information and
    services, aerospace, electronics, and shipbuilding to its global
    customers. As a prime contractor, principal subcontractor,
    partner, or preferred supplier, Northrop Grumman participates in
    many high-priority defense and commercial technology programs in
    the U.S. and abroad. Northrop Grumman conducts most of its
    business with the U.S. Government, principally the DoD. The
    company also conducts business with local, state, and foreign
    governments and has domestic and international commercial sales.

Notable
    Events

Certain notable events or activity affecting the company’s
    2008 consolidated financial results included the following:

Financial highlights

n

Sales increased 6 percent to a record $33.9 billion.

n

Cash from operations increased to a record $3.2 billion
    after $200 million pension pre-funding.

n

Total backlog at a record $78.1 billion, driven by record
    contract awards of $48.3 billion.

n

Share repurchases totaled $1.6 billion.

Notable events

n

Non-cash, after-tax charge of $3.1 billion for impairment
    of goodwill at Shipbuilding and Space Technology, primarily
    caused by the effects of adverse equity market conditions that
    caused a decrease in market multiples and the company’s
    stock price at November 30, 2008.

n

Pre-tax charge of $326 million in the first quarter of 2008
    associated with the LHD-8 and other ships, of which
    $63 million was reversed in the second half of
    2008 — see Note 7 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8.

n

Increased quarterly common stock dividend from $.37 to $.40 per
    share beginning in the second quarter of 2008.

n

Contract award of $1.2 billion by U.S. Navy for a BAMS
    Unmanned Aircraft System.

    mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock in exchange
    for 6.4 million shares of common stock — see Note
    8 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II,
    Item 8.

Outlook

The United States and global economies are currently undergoing
    a period of substantial economic uncertainty, and the related
    financial markets are experiencing unprecedented volatility. If
    the future economic environment continues to be less favorable
    than it has been in recent years, the company could experience
    difficulties if the financial viability of certain of its
    subcontractors and key suppliers is impaired. In addition, the
    volatility in the financial markets has affected the valuation
    of the company’s pension assets, resulting in higher
    pension costs in future periods. Adverse equity market
    conditions and the resulting decline in market multiples and the
    company’s stock price have led to a non-cash, after-tax
    charge of $3.1 billion for impairment of goodwill at
    Shipbuilding and Space Technology. If the financial markets
    continue to deteriorate causing further decline in the
    company’s stock price and market capitalization, further
    impairments of goodwill and other long-lived assets may become
    necessary.

The company’s business is conducted primarily with
    U.S. Government customers under long-term contracts and
    there have been no material changes to the company’s
    product and service offerings due to the current economic
    conditions. The U.S. Government’s budgetary processes
    give the company good visibility regarding future

-27-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

spending and the threat areas that they are addressing.
    Management believes that the company’s current contracts,
    and its strong backlog of previously awarded contracts are well
    aligned with the direction of its customer’s future needs,
    and this provides the company with good insight regarding future
    cash flows from its businesses. Nonetheless, management
    recognizes that no business is completely immune to the current
    economic situation and these economic conditions and the
    transition to a new presidential administration could adversely
    affect future defense spending levels which could lead to lower
    than expected revenues for the company in future years. Certain
    programs in which the company participates may be subject to
    potential reductions due to a slower rate of growth in the
    U.S. Defense Budget forecasts and funds being utilized to
    support the on-going Global War on Terrorism.

Despite the trend of slower growth rates in the
    U.S. defense budget, the company believes that its
    portfolio of technologically advanced, innovative products,
    services, and integrated solutions will generate revenue growth
    in 2009 and beyond. Based on total backlog (funded and unfunded)
    of approximately $78 billion as of December 31, 2008,
    the company expects sales in 2009 of approximately
    $34.5 billion. The major industry and economic factors that
    may affect the company’s future performance are described
    in the following paragraphs.

Industry
    Factors

Northrop Grumman is subject to the unique characteristics of the
    U.S. defense industry as a monopsony, and by certain
    elements peculiar to its own business mix. Northrop Grumman,
    along with Lockheed Martin Corporation, The Boeing Company,
    Raytheon Company, and General Dynamics Corporation are among the
    largest companies in the U.S. defense industry at this
    time. Northrop Grumman competes against these and other
    companies for a number of programs, both large and small.
    Intense competition and long operating cycles are both key
    characteristics of Northrop Grumman’s business and the
    defense industry. It is common in this industry for work on
    major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A
    company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate
    award of the contract to another party, turn out to be a
    subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting party. It is
    not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company
    and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of
    such competitor on other contracts. The nature of major defense
    programs, conducted under binding contracts, allows companies
    that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity
    not common in many industries.

The company’s success in the competitive defense industry
    depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and
    services, as well as its ability to provide the people,
    technologies, facilities, equipment, and financial capacity
    needed to deliver those products and services with maximum
    efficiency. It is necessary to maintain, as the company has,
    sources for raw materials, fabricated parts, electronic
    components, and major subassemblies. In this manufacturing and
    systems integration environment, effective oversight of
    subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing
    internal operations.

Similarly, there is intense competition among many companies in
    the information and services markets which is generally more
    labor intensive with competitive margin rates over contract
    periods of shorter duration. Competitors in the information and
    services markets include the defense industry participants
    mentioned above as well as many other large and small entities
    with expertise in various specialized areas. The company’s
    ability to successfully compete in the information and services
    markets depends on a number of factors; most important is the
    capability to deploy skilled professionals, many requiring
    security clearances, at competitive prices across the diverse
    spectrum of these markets. Accordingly, various workforce
    initiatives are in place to ensure the company is successful in
    attracting, developing and retaining sufficient resources to
    maintain or improve its competitive position within these
    markets.

Liquidity Trends

– In light of the current
    economic situation, the company has also evaluated its future
    liquidity needs, both from a short-term and long-term basis. The
    company believes that cash on hand plus cash generated from
    operations along with cash available under credit lines are
    expected to be sufficient in 2009 to service debt, finance
    capital expansion projects, pay federal, foreign, and state
    income taxes, fund pension and other post-retirement benefit
    plans, and continue paying dividends to shareholders. The
    company has a committed

-28-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

$2 billion revolving credit facility, with a maturity date
    of August 10, 2012, that can be accessed on a

same-day

basis.

To provide for long-term liquidity, the company believes it can
    obtain additional capital, if necessary, from such sources as
    the public or private capital markets, the sale of assets, sale
    and leaseback of operating assets, and leasing rather than
    purchasing new assets. The company has an effective shelf
    registration on file with the SEC.

Recent Developments in U.S. Cost Accounting Standards
    (CAS) Pension Recovery Rules

– On
    September 2, 2008, the CAS Board published an Advance
    Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) that if adopted would
    provide a framework to partially harmonize the CAS rules with
    the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) requirements. The
    proposed CAS rule includes provisions for a transition period
    from the existing CAS requirement to a partially harmonized CAS
    requirement. After the PPA effective date for “eligible
    government contractors” (including Northrop Grumman), which
    were granted a delay in their PPA effective date, the proposed
    rule would partially mitigate the near-term mismatch between

PPA-amended

ERISA minimum contribution requirements which would not yet be
    recoverable under CAS. However, unless the final rule is
    revised, government contractors maintaining defined benefit
    pension plans in general would still experience a timing
    mismatch between required contributions and the CAS recoverable
    pension costs. It is anticipated that contractors will be
    entitled to seek an equitable adjustment to prices of previously
    negotiated contracts subject to CAS for increased contract costs
    which result from mandatory changes required by the final rule.
    The CAS Board is required to issue its final rule no later than
    January 1, 2010.

Economic
    Opportunities, Challenges, and Risks

The defense of the U.S. and its allies requires the ability
    to respond to one or more regional conflicts, terrorist acts, or
    threats to homeland security and is increasingly dependent upon
    early threat identification. National responses to those threats
    may require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from
    dissuasion, deterrence, active defense, security and stability
    operations, or peacekeeping. The company believes that the
    U.S. Government will continue to place a high priority on
    the protection of its engaged forces and citizenry and on
    minimizing collateral damage when force must be applied in
    pursuit of national objectives. As a result, the U.S. and
    its military coalitions increasingly rely on sophisticated
    systems providing long-range surveillance and intelligence,
    battle management, and precision strike capabilities combined
    with the ability to rapidly deploy effective force to any
    region. Accordingly, defense procurement spending is expected to
    be weighted toward the development and procurement of military
    platforms and systems demonstrating the stealth, long-range,
    survivability, persistence and standoff capabilities that can
    overcome such obstacles to access. Additionally, advanced
    electronics and software that enhance the capabilities of
    individual systems and provide for the real-time integration of
    individual surveillance, information management, strike, and
    battle management platforms will also be required.

While the upward trend in overall defense spending may slow, the
    company does not expect defense requirements to change
    significantly in the foreseeable future. Many allied countries
    are focusing their development and procurement efforts on
    advanced electronics and information systems capabilities to
    enhance their interoperability with U.S. forces. The size
    of future U.S. and international defense budgets is
    expected to remain responsive to the international security
    environment. While the political environment currently does not
    allow for a thorough insight into the fiscal 2010 budget, it is
    expected defense spending will continue to grow in the near
    term, though probably more modestly than in the past. It is
    possible the new Administration’s proposed budget will
    include reductions in certain programs in which the company
    participates or for which the company expects to compete,
    however the company believes that spending on recapitalization
    and modernization of homeland security and defense assets will
    continue to be a national priority, with particular emphasis on
    areas involving intelligence, persistent surveillance, cyber
    space, energy-saving technologies and non-conventional warfare
    capabilities.

U.S. Government programs in which the company either
    participates, or strives to participate, must compete with other
    programs for consideration during the U.S. budget
    formulation and appropriation processes. Budget

decisions made in this environment will have long-term
    consequences for the size and structure of the company and the
    entire defense industry.

Substantial new competitive opportunities for the company
    include the next-generation long-range bomber, space radar,
    unmanned vehicles, satellite communications systems, restricted
    programs, technical services and information technology
    contracts, and numerous international and homeland security
    programs. In pursuit of these opportunities, Northrop Grumman
    continues to focus on operational and financial performance for
    continued growth in 2010 and beyond.

Northrop Grumman has historically concentrated its efforts in
    high technology areas such as stealth, airborne and space
    surveillance, battle management, systems integration, defense
    electronics, and information technology. The company has a
    significant presence in federal and civil information systems;
    the manufacture of combatant ships including aircraft carriers
    and submarines; space technology; C4ISR; and missile systems.
    The company believes that its programs are a high priority for
    national defense. Nevertheless, under budgetary pressures, there
    remains the possibility that one or more of them may be reduced,
    extended, or terminated by the company’s
    U.S. Government customers.

The company provides certain product warranties that require
    repair or replacement of non-conforming items for a specified
    period of time. Most of the company’s product warranties
    are provided under government contracts, the costs of which are
    generally incorporated into contract pricing.

Prime contracts with various agencies of the
    U.S. Government and subcontracts with other prime
    contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations,
    including the False Claims Act and the International Traffic in
    Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act,
    with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in
    fines, penalties, debarment, or suspension from receiving
    additional contracts with all U.S. Government agencies.
    Given the company’s dependence on U.S. Government
    business, suspension or debarment could have a material adverse
    effect on the company.

See Risk Factors located in Part I, Item 1A for a more
    complete description of risks faced by the company and the
    defense industry.

BUSINESS
    ACQUISITIONS


– In October 2008, the company acquired
    3001 International, Inc. (3001) for approximately
    $92 million in cash. 3001 provides geospatial data
    production and analysis, including airborne imaging, surveying,
    mapping and geographic information systems for U.S. and
    international government intelligence, defense and civilian
    customers. The operating results of 3001 are reported in the
    Information Technology segment from the date of acquisition. The
    consolidated financial statements reflect preliminary estimates
    of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    and the related allocation of the purchase price for the
    entities acquired. Management does not expect adjustments to
    these estimates, if any, to have a material effect on the
    company’s consolidated financial position or results of
    operations.


– During the third quarter of 2007, the
    company acquired Xinetics Inc., reported in the Space Technology
    segment, and the remaining 61 percent of Scaled Composites,
    LLC, reported in the Integrated Systems segment, for an
    aggregate amount of approximately $100 million in cash.

In July 2007, the company and Science Applications International
    Corporation (SAIC) reorganized the AMSEC, LLC joint venture
    (AMSEC), by dividing AMSEC along customer and product lines.
    AMSEC is a full-service supplier that provides engineering,
    logistics and technical support services primarily to Navy ship
    and aviation programs. Under the reorganization plan, the
    company retained the ship engineering, logistics and technical
    service businesses under the AMSEC name (the AMSEC Businesses)
    and, in exchange, SAIC received the aviation, combat systems and
    strike force integration services businesses from AMSEC (the
    Divested Businesses). This reorganization was treated as a step
    acquisition for the acquisition of SAIC’s interests in the
    AMSEC Businesses, with the company recognizing a pre-tax gain of
    $23 million for the effective sale of its interests in the

-30-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Divested Businesses. From the date of this reorganization, the
    operating results of the AMSEC Businesses, and transaction gain,
    have been reported on a consolidated basis in the Shipbuilding
    segment. Prior to the reorganization, the company accounted for
    AMSEC, LLC under the equity method.

In January 2007, the company acquired Essex Corporation (Essex)
    for approximately $590 million in cash, including the
    assumption of debt totaling $23 million. Essex provides
    signal processing services and products, and advanced
    optoelectronic imaging for U.S. government intelligence and
    defense customers. The operating results of Essex are reported
    in the Mission Systems segment.


– There were no significant acquisitions
    during 2006.

BUSINESS
    DISPOSITIONS

2008 –

In April 2008, the company sold its
    Electro-Optical Systems (EOS) business for $175 million in
    cash to L-3 Communications Corporation and recognized a gain of
    $19 million, net of taxes of $39 million. EOS,
    formerly a part of the Electronics segment, produces night
    vision and applied optics products. Sales for this business in
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, were
    approximately $53 million, $190 million, and
    $122 million, respectively. Operating results of this
    business are reported as discontinued operations in the
    consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss)
    income for all periods presented.


– During the second quarter of 2007,
    management announced its decision to exit the remaining
    Interconnect Technologies (ITD) business reported within the
    Electronics segment. Sales for this business in the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, were $14 million and
    $35 million, respectively. The shut-down was completed
    during the third quarter of 2007 and costs associated with the
    shut-down were not material. The results of this business are
    reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated
    statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income for all
    periods presented.


– During the second quarter of 2006, the
    Enterprise Information Technology (EIT) business, formerly
    reported in the Information Technology segment, was shut down
    and costs associated with the exit activities were not material.
    The results of operations of this business are reported as
    discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of
    operations and comprehensive (loss) income for all periods
    presented.

The company sold the assembly business unit of ITD during the
    first quarter of 2006 and Winchester Electronics (Winchester)
    during the second quarter of 2006 for net cash proceeds of
    $26 million and $17 million, respectively, and
    recognized after-tax gains of $4 million and
    $2 million, respectively, in discontinued operations. Each
    of these business units was associated with the Electronics
    segment. The results of operations of the assembly business unit
    of ITD are reported as discontinued operations in the
    consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss)
    income. The results of operations of Winchester were not
    material to any of the periods presented and have therefore not
    been reclassified as discontinued operations.

CONTRACTS

The majority of the company’s business is generated from
    long-term government contracts for development, production, and
    service activities. Government contracts typically include the
    following cost elements: direct material, labor and
    subcontracting costs, and certain indirect costs including
    allowable general and administrative costs. Unless otherwise
    specified in a contract, costs billed to contracts with the
    U.S. Government are determined under the requirements of
    the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Cost Accounting
    Standards (CAS) regulations as allowable and allocable costs.
    Examples of costs incurred by the company and not billed to the
    U.S. Government in accordance with the requirements of the
    FAR and CAS regulations include, but are not limited to, certain
    legal costs, lobbying costs, charitable donations, and
    advertising costs.

The company’s long-term contracts typically fall into one
    of two broad categories:

Flexibly Priced Contracts

– Includes both
    cost-type and fixed-price incentive contracts. Cost-type
    contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s
    allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit.
    Cost-type

-31-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

contracts generally require that the contractor use its best
    efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some
    specified time and some stated dollar limitation. Fixed-price
    incentive contracts also provide for reimbursement of the
    contractor’s allowable costs, but are subject to a
    cost-share limit which affects profitability. Fixed-price
    incentive contracts effectively become firm fixed-price
    contracts once the cost-share limit is reached.

Firm Fixed-Price Contracts

– A firm fixed-price
    contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is
    agreed to for a price that is a pre-determined, negotiated
    amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of
    costs incurred by the contractor.

Time-and-materials

contracts are considered firm fixed-price contracts as they
    specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged.

Contract Fees

– Negotiated contract fee
    structures, for both flexibly priced and fixed-price contracts
    include, but are not limited to: fixed-fee amounts, cost sharing
    arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost
    target performance, positive award fees, and negative penalty
    arrangements. Profit margins may vary materially depending on
    the negotiated contract fee arrangements,

percentage-of-completion

of the contract, the achievement of performance objectives, and
    the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees,
    particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally
    determined.

Positive Award Fees

– Certain contracts contain
    provisions consisting of award fees based on performance
    criteria such as: cost, schedule, quality, and technical
    performance. Award fees are determined and earned based on an
    evaluation by the customer of the company’s performance
    against such negotiated criteria. Fees that can be reasonably
    assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the
    performance period of the contract. Award fee contracts are
    widely used throughout the company’s operating segments.
    Examples of significant long-term contracts with substantial
    negotiated award fee amounts are the KEI, F-35 SDD, Global Hawk
    Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), LPD, DDG-1000
    programs and the majority of satellite contracts.

Compliance and Monitoring

– On a regular basis,
    the company monitors its policies and procedures with respect to
    its contracts to ensure consistent application under similar
    terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable
    government regulations. In addition, costs incurred and
    allocated to contracts with the U.S. Government are
    routinely audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.

    ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS

Revenue
    Recognition

Overview

– The majority of the company’s
    business is derived from long-term contracts for the
    construction of facilities, production of goods, and services
    provided to the federal government, which are accounted for
    under the provisions of Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 45 –

    Long-Term Construction-Type Contracts

. The company classifies contract revenues as
    product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant
    attributes of the relevant underlying contracts. The company
    also enters into contracts that are not associated with the
    federal government, such as contracts to provide certain
    services to non-federal government customers. The company
    accounts for those contracts in accordance with the SEC’s
    Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

, and other relevant revenue recognition

-32-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

The company considers the nature of these contracts and the
    types of products and services provided when it determines the
    proper accounting method for a particular contract.

Percentage-of-Completion

Accounting

– The company generally recognizes
    revenues from its long-term contracts under the

cost-to-cost

and the

units-of-delivery

measures of the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting. The

percentage-of-completion

method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses. For
    most contracts, sales are calculated based on the percentage of
    total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at
    completion of the contract. For certain contracts with large
    up-front purchases of material, primarily in the Shipbuilding
    segment, sales are generally calculated based on the percentage
    that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct
    labor costs. The

units-of-delivery

measure is a modification of the

percentage-of-completion

method, which recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the
    customer generally using unit sales values in accordance with
    the contract terms. The company estimates profit as the
    difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated
    cost of a contract and recognizes that profit over the life of
    the contract based on deliveries.

The use of the

percentage-of-completion

method depends on the ability of the company to make reasonably
    dependable cost estimates for the design, manufacture, and
    delivery of its products and services. Such costs are typically
    incurred over a period of several years, and estimation of these
    costs requires the use of judgment. Sales under cost-type
    contracts are recorded as costs are incurred.

Many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives
    based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that
    may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product. These
    incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be
    earned or penalties to be incurred. Incentives and award fees
    that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are
    recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentives
    and award fees that cannot be reasonably assured and reasonably
    estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a
    reasonable estimate can be made.

Other changes in estimates of contract sales, costs, and profits
    are recognized using the cumulative

catch-up

method of accounting. This method recognizes in the current
    period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior
    periods. Hence, the effect of the changes on future periods of
    contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate
    had been the original estimate. A significant change in an
    estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect
    on the company’s consolidated financial position or results
    of operations.

Certain Service Contracts

– Revenue under
    contracts to provide services to non-federal government
    customers are generally recognized when services are performed.
    Service contracts include operations and maintenance contracts,
    and outsourcing-type arrangements, primarily in the Information
    and Services business. Revenue under such contracts is generally
    recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of contract
    performance, unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned
    or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Costs
    incurred under these service contracts are expensed as incurred,
    except that direct and incremental

set-up

costs
    are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement.
    Operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate
    from period to period, particularly in the earlier phases of the
    contract.

Service contracts that include more than one type of product or
    service are accounted for under the provisions of Emerging
    Issues Task Force Issue

No. 00-21 –

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

.
    Accordingly, for applicable arrangements, revenue recognition
    includes the proper identification of separate units of
    accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements
    based on relative fair values.

Cost Estimation

– The cost estimation process
    requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional
    knowledge and experience of the company’s engineers,
    program managers, and financial professionals. Factors that are
    considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate
    contract recovery include the availability and productivity of
    labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed,
    the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the
    effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of
    funding from the

-33-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

customer, and the recoverability of any claims included in the
    estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on
    one or more contracts could have a material effect on the
    company’s consolidated financial position or results of
    operations. Contract cost estimates are updated at least
    annually and more frequently as determined by events or
    circumstances. Cost and revenue estimates for each significant
    contract are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly.

When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract
    exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned, a provision for
    the entire loss on the contract is recorded to cost of sales in
    the period the loss is determined. Loss provisions are first
    offset against costs that are included in inventoried assets,
    with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities.

Purchase
    Accounting and Goodwill

Overview

– The purchase price of an acquired
    business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their
    respective fair market values, with the excess recorded as
    goodwill. Such fair market value assessments require judgments
    and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and
    other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ
    materially from original estimates. For acquisitions completed
    through December 31, 2008, adjustments to fair value
    assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price
    allocation period (typically not exceeding twelve months).
    Adjustments related to income tax uncertainties, which may have
    extended beyond the purchase price allocation period, through
    December 31, 2008, were also recorded to goodwill.

Acquisition Accruals

– The company has
    established certain accruals in connection with indemnities and
    other contingencies from its acquisitions and divestitures.
    These accruals and subsequent adjustments have been recorded
    during the purchase price allocation period for acquisitions and
    as events occur for divestitures. The accruals were determined
    based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and, in
    most cases, involve a significant degree of judgment. Management
    has recorded these accruals in accordance with its
    interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements,
    known facts, and an estimation of probable future events based
    on management’s experience.

Goodwill

– The company performs impairment
    tests for goodwill as of November 30th of each year, or when
    evidence of potential impairment exists.  When it is
    determined that impairment has occurred, a charge to operations
    is recorded. In order to test for potential impairment, the
    company uses a discounted cash flow analysis, corroborated by
    comparative market multiples where appropriate. Adverse equity
    market conditions and the resulting decline in current market
    multiples and the company’s stock price as of
    November 30, 2008, have led to a goodwill impairment charge
    totaling $3.1 billion at Shipbuilding and Space Technology.
    The company will continue to monitor the recoverability of the
    carrying value of its goodwill and other long-lived assets.

The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis
    requiring judgment are the projected results of operations,
    weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and terminal value
    assumptions. The WACC takes into account the relative weights of
    each component of the company’s consolidated capital
    structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of
    new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk
    profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to
    market entry. The terminal value assumptions are applied to the
    final year of the discounted cash flow model.

Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a
    business’s fair value and the relative size of the
    company’s recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions may
    have a material effect on the results of the company’s
    impairment analysis.

Litigation,
    Commitments, and Contingencies

Overview

– The company is subject to a range of
    claims, lawsuits, environmental and income tax matters, and
    administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these
    matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional
    knowledge and experience of management and its internal and
    external legal counsel. In accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting

-34-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Standards (SFAS) No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies,

amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management,
    after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of
    each matter, including any settlement offers, has determined
    that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
    amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate
    resolution of any such exposure to the company may vary from
    earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become
    known.

Environmental Accruals

– The company is subject
    to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions
    in which it conducts operations. The company records an accrual
    to provide for the costs of expected environmental obligations
    when management becomes aware that an expenditure will be
    incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably
    estimated. Factors which could result in changes to the
    company’s assessment of probability, range of loss, and
    environmental accruals include: modification of planned remedial
    actions, increase or decrease in the estimated time required to
    remediate, discovery of more extensive contamination than
    anticipated, results of efforts to determine legally responsible
    parties, changes in laws and regulations or contractual
    obligations affecting remediation requirements, and improvements
    in remediation technology. Although management cannot predict
    whether new information gained as projects progress will
    materially affect the estimated liability accrued, management
    does not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will
    have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial
    position, results of operation, or cash flows.

Litigation Accruals

– Litigation accruals are
    recorded as charges to earnings when management, after taking
    into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter,
    including any settlement offers, has determined that it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate resolution of
    any exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as
    further facts and circumstances become known. Based upon the
    information available, the company believes that the resolution
    of any of these various claims and legal proceedings would not
    have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Uncertain Tax Positions –

Effective
    January 1, 2007, the company measures and records uncertain
    tax positions in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 48 –

Accounting for Uncertainty in income Taxes – an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.

FIN 48
    prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition
    and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
    in a tax return. Only tax positions meeting the
    more-likely-than-not recognition threshold may be recognized or
    continue to be recognized in the financial statements. The
    timing and amount of accrued interest is determined by the
    applicable tax law associated with an underpayment of income
    taxes. If a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory
    threshold to avoid payment of penalties, the company recognizes
    an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax
    position is claimed in the tax return of the company. The
    company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax
    benefits in income tax expense. Penalties, if probable and
    reasonably estimable, are recognized as a component of income
    tax expense. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8. Prior to 2007, the
    company recorded accruals for tax contingencies and related
    interest when it determined that it was probable that a
    liability had been incurred and the amount of the contingency
    could be reasonably estimated based on specific events such as
    an audit or inquiry by a taxing authority. Under existing
    U.S. GAAP, prior to January 1, 2009, changes in
    accruals associated with uncertainties arising from the
    resolution of pre-acquisition contingencies of acquired
    businesses were charged or credited to goodwill; effective
    January 1, 2009, such changes will be recorded to income
    tax expense. Adjustments to other tax accruals are generally
    recorded in earnings in the period they are determined.

Retirement
    Benefits

Overview

– Assumptions used in determining
    projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets
    for the company’s pension plans and other postretirement
    benefits plans are evaluated annually by management in
    consultation with its outside actuaries. In the event that the
    company determines that plan amendments or changes in the
    assumptions are warranted, future pension and postretirement
    benefit expenses could increase or decrease.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Assumptions

– The principal assumptions that
    have a significant effect on the company’s consolidated
    financial position and results of operations are the discount
    rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and
    the health care cost trend rates. For certain plan assets where
    the fair market value is not readily determinable, such as real
    estate, private equity, and hedge funds, estimates of fair value
    are determined using the best information available.

Discount Rate

– The discount rate represents
    the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of
    future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle
    the pension and postretirement benefit obligations. The discount
    rate is generally based on the yield on high-quality corporate
    fixed-income investments. At the end of each year, the discount
    rate is primarily determined using the results of bond yield
    curve models based on a portfolio of high quality bonds matching
    the notional cash inflows with the expected benefit payments for
    each significant benefit plan. Taking into consideration the
    factors noted above, the company’s weighted-average pension
    composite discount rate was 6.25 percent at
    December 31, 2008, and 6.22 percent at
    December 31, 2007. Holding all other assumptions constant,
    and since net actuarial gains and losses stayed within the
    10 percent accounting corridor (as was the case for the
    2008 expense measurement period), an increase or decrease of
    25 basis points in the discount rate assumption for 2008
    would have decreased or increased pension and postretirement
    benefit expense for 2008 by approximately $30 million and
    decreased or increased the amount of the benefit obligation
    recorded at December 31, 2008, by approximately
    $750 million. The effects of hypothetical changes in the
    discount rate for a single year may not be representative and
    may be asymmetrical or nonlinear for future years because of the
    application of the accounting corridor. The accounting corridor
    is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and
    losses is not required. Due to adverse capital market conditions
    the company’s pension plan assets experienced a negative
    return of approximately 16 percent in 2008. As a result,
    substantially all of the company’s plans have experienced
    net actuarial losses outside the 10 percent accounting
    corridor at the end of 2008, thus requiring accumulated gains
    and losses to be amortized to expense. As a result of this
    condition, sensitivity of net periodic costs to changes in the
    discount rate will be much higher in the near future than was
    the case in 2008.

Expected Long-Term Rate of Return –

The
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets represents the
    average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested in a
    specified target asset allocation to provide for anticipated
    future benefit payment obligations. For 2008 and 2007, the
    company assumed an expected long-term rate of return on plan
    assets of 8.5 percent. An increase or decrease of
    25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return
    assumption for 2008, holding all other assumptions constant,
    would increase or decrease the company’s pension and
    postretirement benefit expense for 2008 by approximately
    $60 million.

Health Care Cost Trend Rates

– The health care
    cost trend rates represent the annual rates of change in the
    cost of health care benefits based on estimates of health care
    inflation, changes in health care utilization or delivery
    patterns, technological advances, and changes in the health
    status of the plan participants. For 2008, the company assumed
    an expected initial health care cost trend rate of 7.5 percent
    and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent
    reached in 2014. In 2007, the company assumed an expected
    initial health care cost trend rate of 8 percent and an
    ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent reached
    in 2012.

Differences in the initial through the ultimate health care cost
    trend rates within the range indicated below would have had the
    following impact on 2008 postretirement benefit results:

2008 –

Revenues for principal product
    businesses in Integrated Systems, Space Technology, Electronics,
    and Shipbuilding during 2008 grew at a combined rate of
    approximately 6 percent over 2007, reflecting sales growth
    at all four reporting segments. Revenue for principal services
    businesses in Information & Services during 2008 grew
    approximately 8 percent over 2007 due largely to double
    digit growth at Mission Systems, resulting from increased volume
    on contracts newly awarded in 2007 and 2008 and increased
    activity on other contracts.


– Revenues for principal product
    businesses in Aerospace, Electronics, and Shipbuilding during
    2007 grew at a combined rate of approximately 3 percent
    over 2006, reflecting sales growth in Electronics and
    Shipbuilding, partially offset by reduced sales in Aerospace.
    The sales growth at Electronics and Shipbuilding is due to
    volume improvements across most business areas, while the sales
    reduction in Aerospace was anticipated as a number of contracts
    transitioned from development to production in 2007. Revenue for
    principal services businesses in Information &
    Services during 2007 grew approximately 11 percent over
    2006 due largely to double digit growth at Information
    Technology and Technical Services, resulting from increased
    volume on contracts that were newly awarded in 2006 and
    increased activity on other contracts.

Cost of
    Product Sales and Service Revenues

2008 –

Cost of product sales during 2008
    increased $1.2 billion, or 8 percent, over 2007 and
    increased 170 basis points as a percent of product sales
    over the same period due largely to the sales volume increase
    described above. The increase in cost of product sales as a
    percentage of product sales is primarily due to cost growth at
    the Gulf Coast shipyards. In the first quarter of 2008, the
    company recorded a $326 million pre-tax charge on LHD-8 and
    other Shipbuilding programs, and in the third quarter of 2008,
    the company recorded additional costs for work delays at a
    subcontractor on the LPD program as a result of Hurricane Ike.
    The LHD-8 program achieved several important risk retirement
    milestones toward its planned delivery date, and as a result
    $63 million of the first quarter 2008 charge was reversed
    in the second half of 2008.

Cost of service revenues during 2008 increased
    $911 million, or 8 percent, over 2007 and increased
    40 basis points as a percent of service revenues over the
    same period due primarily to the sales volume increase described
    above. The increase in cost of service revenues as a percentage
    of service revenues is primarily due to lower performance in the
    Commercial, State & Local business area in Information
    Technology.


– Cost of product sales during 2007
    increased $65 million over 2006 while decreasing
    80 basis points as a percentage of product sales over the
    same period. The increase in cost of product sales is due
    largely to the sales volume increase described above while the
    margin rate improvement is primarily driven by improved program
    performance at Aerospace and Shipbuilding.

Cost of service sales during 2007 increased $1.1 billion,
    or 11 percent, over 2006 while decreasing 210 basis
    points as a percentage of service sales over the same period.
    Cost of service revenues in 2007 increased over 2006 primarily
    due to higher sales volume at Information & Services.

General and Administrative Expenses

– In
    accordance with industry practice and the regulations that
    govern the cost accounting requirements for government
    contracts, most general corporate expenses incurred at both the
    segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and
    allocable costs on government contracts. For most components of
    the company, these costs are allocated to contracts in progress
    on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include
    this cost component as an element of cost. General and
    administrative expenses primarily relate to segment operations.
    General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total
    sales and service revenues decreased from 10 percent in
    2007 to 9.6 percent in 2008 primarily as a result of costs
    remaining relatively constant while revenues increased over the
    same period in 2007. General and administrative expenses
    remained at a constant rate of approximately 10 percent of
    sales in 2007 and 2006.

Goodwill Impairment –

In the fourth quarter of
    2008, the company recorded a non-cash charge totaling
    $3.1 billion at Shipbuilding and Space Technology for the
    impairment of goodwill. In accordance with

-38-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

SFAS No. 142 –

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,

the company performed its required annual
    impairment test for goodwill using a discounted cash flow
    analysis supported by comparative market multiples to determine
    the fair values of its businesses versus their book values. The
    test as of November 30, 2008, indicated that the book
    values for Shipbuilding and Space Technology exceeded the fair
    values of these businesses. The impairment charge is primarily
    driven by adverse equity market conditions that caused a
    decrease in current market multiples and the company’s
    stock price as of November 30, 2008, compared with the test
    performed as of November 30, 2007. The charge reduces
    goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions made in 2001
    and 2002 and does not impact the company’s normal business
    operations.

Prior to recording the goodwill impairment charges at
    Shipbuilding and Space Technology, the company tested the
    purchased intangible assets and other long-lived assets at both
    of these businesses as required by
    SFAS No. 144 –

Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets

, and the
    carrying value of these assets were determined not to be
    impaired.

Operating
    (Loss) Income

The company considers operating income to be an important
    measure for evaluating its operating performance and, as is
    typical in the industry, defines operating income as revenues
    less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and
    administrative expenses. Operating income for the company is
    further evaluated for each of the business segments in which the
    company operates.

Management of the company internally manages its operations by
    reference to “segment operating income.” Segment
    operating income is defined as operating income before
    unallocated expenses and net pension adjustment, both of which
    do not affect the segments, and the reversal of royalty income,
    which is classified as other income for financial reporting
    purposes. Segment operating income is one of the key metrics
    management uses to evaluate operating performance. Segment
    operating income is not, however, a measure of financial
    performance under U.S. GAAP, and may not be defined and
    calculated by other companies in the same manner.

Segment
    Operating (Loss) Income

2008 –

Segment operating loss for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, was $145 million as compared
    with segment operating income of $3.1 billion in 2007. The
    decrease was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge
    totaling $3.1 billion at Shipbuilding and Space Technology.
    See the Segment Operating Results section below for further
    information.


– Segment operating income for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, increased $278 million, or
    10 percent, as compared with 2006. Total segment operating
    income was 9.8 percent and 9.5 percent of total sales
    and service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    and 2006, respectively. See the Segment Operating Results
    section below for further information.

Unallocated
    Expenses

2008 –

Unallocated expenses for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, decreased $47 million, or
    23 percent, as compared with the same period in 2007. The
    decrease was primarily due to $88 million in higher legal
    and investigative provisions recorded in 2007, partially offset
    by an increase in environmental, health and welfare, and other
    unallocated corporate costs in 2008.

-39-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

2007 –

Unallocated expenses for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, decreased $81 million, or
    28 percent, as compared with 2006. The decrease was
    primarily due to $98 million in lower post-retirement
    benefit costs determined under GAAP as a result of a plan design
    change in 2006 and $36 million lower legal and
    investigative provisions, partially offset by an increase in
    other costs including $18 million in higher litigation
    expenses. During the third quarter 2006, the company recorded a
    $112.5 million pre-tax provision for its settlement offer
    to the U.S. Department of Justice and a restricted customer.

Net Pension Adjustment –

The net pension
    adjustment reflects the difference between pension expense
    determined in accordance with SFAS No. 87 –

Employer’s Accounting for Pensions

(U.S. GAAP
    pension expense) and the pension expense allocated to the
    operating segments under CAS. The net pension adjustment
    increased income by $263 million and $127 million in
    2008 and 2007, respectively, as compared with an expense of
    $37 million in 2006. The income in 2008 and 2007 was due to
    decreased U.S. GAAP pension expense primarily resulting
    from better than estimated investment returns and higher
    discount rate assumptions.

Due to adverse capital market conditions the company’s
    pension plan assets experienced a negative return of
    approximately 16 percent in 2008 compared with a long-term
    estimated return of 8.5 percent. As a result of 2008 actual
    plan returns, the company estimates U.S. GAAP pension
    expense of $839 million in 2009, a substantial increase
    over the 2008 expense of $225 million. The 2009 estimate is
    based on a 6.25 discount rate and a long-term rate of return of
    8.5 percent.

Interest
    Expense


– Interest expense decreased
    $41 million, or 12 percent, in 2008 as compared with
    2007. The decrease is primarily due to the conversion and
    redemption of the mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred
    stock in April 2008, which reduced the related dividends paid
    during the 2008 periods (which were recorded as interest expense
    in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and
    comprehensive (loss) income in Part II, Item 8). Lower
    LIBOR rates on the interest rate swap agreements also
    contributed to the decrease in interest expense.

2007 – Interest expense decreased $11 million, or
    3 percent, in 2007 as compared with 2006. The decrease is
    primarily due to a lower average debt balance.

Other,
    net

2008 –

Other, net for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 was $38 million income, an increase
    of $22 million, as compared with 2007, primarily due to
    $59 million in royalty income from patent infringement
    settlements at Electronics in 2008, partially offset by negative
    mark to market adjustments on investments in marketable
    securities used as a funding source for non-qualified employee
    benefits.

2007 –

Other, net for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 was $16 million income, a decrease
    of $153 million, as compared with 2006. During 2006, the
    company sold its remaining 9.7 million TRW Automotive (TRW
    Auto) shares, generating pre-tax gains of $111 million.

Federal
    and Foreign Income Taxes

2008 –

The company’s effective tax rate on
    earnings from continuing operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, was 33.9 percent (excluding the
    non-cash, non-deductible goodwill impairment charge of
    $3.1 billion at Shipbuilding and Space Technology) as
    compared with 32.9 percent in 2007. During 2008, the
    company recognized net tax benefits of $35 million,
    primarily attributable to a settlement reached with the
    U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Congressional
    Joint Committee on Taxation with respect to the IRS audit of TRW
    tax returns for the years

1999-2002.

2007 –

The company’s effective tax rate on
    earnings from continuing operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, was 32.9 percent compared with
    31.2 percent in 2006. During 2007, the company reached a
    partial settlement agreement with the IRS regarding its audit of
    the company’s tax years ended

2001-2003

resulting in a tax benefit of $22 million.

Diluted
    (Loss) Earnings Per Share

2008 –

Diluted loss per share from continuing
    operations for 2008 was $3.83 per share, as compared with $5.18
    diluted earnings per share in 2007. Earnings per share are based
    on weighted-average diluted shares outstanding of
    334.5 million for 2008 and 354.3 million for 2007. For
    the year ended December 31, 2008, the potential dilutive
    effect of 7.1 million shares from stock options, stock
    awards, and the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock were
    excluded from the computation of weighted average diluted common
    shares outstanding as the shares would have had an anti-dilutive
    effect. The goodwill impairment charge of $3.1 billion at
    Shipbuilding and Space Technology reduced the company’s
    diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by $9.04
    per share.


– Diluted earnings per share from
    continuing operations for 2007 was $5.18 per share, an increase
    of 15 percent from $4.51 per share in 2006. Earnings per
    share are based on weighted-average diluted shares outstanding
    of 354.3 million for 2007 and 358.6 million for 2006.
    Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and the
    weighted-average diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive
    effects of stock options, stock awards and the mandatorily
    redeemable convertible preferred stock. All of the mandatorily
    redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted into common
    stock by April 2008. See Note 4 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8.

Net Cash
    Provided by Operating Activities

2008 –

Net cash provided by operating
    activities in 2008 increased $321 million as compared with
    2007 and reflects lower income tax payments and continued trade
    working capital reductions. Pension plan contributions totaled
    $320 million in 2008, of which $200 million was
    voluntarily pre-funded, and were comparable to 2007.

Net cash provided by operating activities for 2008 included
    $113 million of federal and state income tax refunds and
    $23 million of interest income.


– Net cash provided by operating
    activities in 2007 increased $1.1 billion as compared with
    2006, and reflects lower pension contributions, higher net
    earnings, and continued trade working capital reductions.
    Pension plan contributions totaled $342 million in 2007, of
    which $200 million was voluntarily pre-funded, compared
    with contributions of $1.2 billion in 2006, of which
    $800 million was voluntarily pre-funded.

Net cash provided by operating activities for 2007 included the
    receipt of $125 million of insurance proceeds related to
    Hurricane Katrina, $52 million of federal and state income
    tax refunds, and $21 million of interest.

Realignments

– The company, from time to time,
    acquires or disposes of businesses, and realigns contracts,
    programs or business areas among or within its operating
    segments that possess similar customers, expertise, and
    capabilities. These realignments are designed to more fully
    leverage existing capabilities and enhance development and
    delivery of products and services. During the second quarter of
    2008, the company transferred certain programs and assets from
    the missiles business in the Mission Systems segment to the
    Space Technology segment. In January 2008, the Newport News and
    Ship Systems businesses were realigned into a single segment
    called Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding. Previously, these
    businesses were separate operating segments which were
    aggregated into a single segment for financial reporting
    purposes. In addition, certain Electronics businesses were
    transferred to Mission Systems during the first quarter of 2008.
    The operating results for all periods presented have been
    revised to reflect these changes. See a description of the
    segment business areas and specific realignments located in
    Part I, Item 1.

Subsequent Realignments

– In January 2009, the
    company streamlined its organizational structure by reducing the
    number of reporting segments from seven to five. The five
    segments are Aerospace Systems, which combines the former
    Integrated Systems and Space Technology segments; Electronic
    Systems; Information Systems, which combines the former
    Information Technology and Mission Systems segments;
    Shipbuilding and Technical Services. The creation of the
    Aerospace Systems and Information Systems segments strengthens
    alignment with customers, improves the company’s ability to

KEY
    SEGMENT FINANCIAL MEASURES

Operating
    Performance Assessment and Reporting

The company manages and assesses the performance of its
    businesses based on its performance on individual contracts and
    programs obtained generally from government organizations using
    the financial measures referred to below, with consideration
    given to the Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and
    Judgments described on page 32. Based on this approach and
    the nature of the company’s operations, the discussion of
    consolidated results of operations generally focuses around the
    company’s seven reporting segments versus distinguishing
    between products and services. Product sales are predominantly
    generated in the Electronics, Integrated Systems, Space
    Technology and Shipbuilding segments, while the majority of the
    company’s service revenues are generated by the Information
    Technology, Mission Systems and Technical Services segments.

Sales and
    Service Revenues

Period-to-period

sales reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts.
    Changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in
    terms of volume. Unless otherwise described, volume generally
    refers to increases (or decreases) in reported revenues due to
    varying production activity levels, delivery rates, or service
    levels on individual contracts. Volume changes will typically
    carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for
    a particular contract.

Segment
    Operating Income

Segment operating income reflects the performance of segment
    contracts. Excluded from this measure are certain costs not
    directly associated with contract performance, including the
    portion of corporate expenses such as management and
    administration, legal, environmental, certain compensation and
    other retiree benefits, and other expenses not considered
    allowable or allocable under applicable CAS regulations and the
    FAR, and therefore not allocated to the segments. Changes in
    segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of
    volume, as discussed above, or performance. Performance refers
    to changes in contract margin rates. These changes typically
    relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total
    estimated costs at completion of the contract (EAC) that reflect
    improved (or deteriorated) operating performance on a particular
    contract. Operating income changes are accounted for on a
    cumulative to date basis at the time an EAC change is recorded.

Operating income may also be affected by, among other things,
    the effects of workforce stoppages, the effects of natural
    disasters (such as hurricanes and earthquakes), resolution of
    disputed items with the customer, recovery of insurance
    proceeds, and other discrete events. At the completion of a
    long-term contract, any originally estimated costs not incurred
    or reserves not fully utilized (such as warranty reserves) could
    also impact contract earnings. Where such items have occurred,
    and the effects are material, a separate description is provided.

For a more complete understanding of each segment’s product
    and services, see the business descriptions in Part I,
    Item 1.

Mission
    Systems

2008 –

Mission systems revenue increased
    $563 million, or 11 percent, as compared with 2007.
    The increase was due to $337 million in higher sales in
    Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and
    $200 million in higher sales in Command, Control and
    Communications (C3). The increase in ISR is primarily due to the
    ramp up of certain restricted programs and the Navstar Global
    Positioning System Operational Control Segment (Navstar GPS
    OCX), partially offset by lower volume on the wind down of the
    Space Based Surveillance System (SBSS) program. The increase in
    C3 is due to higher volume across various programs, including
    the Counter-Rocket Artillery Mortar (CRAM), Command Post
    Platform (CPP) and Joint National Integration Center
    Research & Development (JRDC), partially offset by
    lower deliveries and development activities in the F-22 and F-35
    Lightning II (F-35) programs.


– Mission Systems revenue increased
    $373 million, or 8 percent, as compared with 2006. The
    increase was due to $279 million in higher sales in ISR and
    $118 million in higher sales in C3. The increase in ISR is
    principally due to the acquisition of Essex. The increase in C3
    is due to higher volume in several programs, including the Force
    XXI Battle Brigade and Below (FBCB2) I-Kits program and
    international commercial businesses and increased scope and
    funding levels in the JRDC program. These increases were
    partially offset by lower volume in the F-35 development program
    as hardware development in 2006 winds down in 2007 and reduced
    scope and deliveries accelerated into 2006 in the F-22 program.

Information
    Technology

2008 –

Information Technology revenue increased
    $32 million, or 1 percent, as compared with 2007. The
    increase was primarily due to $130 million in higher sales
    in Intelligence, and $62 million in higher sales in
    Defense, partially offset by $84 million in lower sales in
    Civilian Agencies and $52 million in lower sales in
    Commercial, State & Local (CS&L). The increase in
    Intelligence is due to new restricted programs and growth on
    existing programs, along with the acquisition of 3001 in the
    fourth quarter of 2008 while the increase in Defense is
    associated with higher volume in the Network Centric Solutions
    program. The decreases in Civilian Agencies and CS&L are
    primarily due to the ending of programs from the previous year
    and a more disciplined approach to obtaining new business in the
    CS&L area.


– Information Technology revenue increased
    $524 million, or 13 percent, as compared with 2006.
    The increase was primarily due to $275 million in higher
    sales in CS&L, $222 million in higher sales in
    Intelligence, and $133 million in higher sales in Defense,
    partially offset by $73 million in lower sales in Civilian
    Agencies. The increase in CS&L is associated with the
    effect of a full year of sales from new programs awarded in
    2006, including the New York City Wireless (NYCWiN), Virginia IT
    outsourcing, and San Diego County IT outsourcing programs.
    The increase in Intelligence is due to new restricted program
    wins and higher volume on existing programs. The increase in
    Defense is due to increased volume on various existing programs
    and new

-44-

    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

business wins. The decrease in Civilian Agencies is primarily
    due to customer program budget reductions and program
    completions.

Technical
    Services

2008 –

Technical Services revenue increased
    $119 million or 5 percent, as compared with 2007. The
    increase is primarily due to $113 million in higher sales
    in Life Cycle Optimization & Engineering (LCOE) and
    $28 million in higher sales in Training &
    Simulation (TSG), partially offset by $26 million in lower
    sales in Systems Support (SSG). The increase in LCOE is
    associated with higher volume in the Hunter CLS and B-2 Stealth
    Bomber (B-2) programs. The increase in TSG is primarily due to
    higher sales volume from various new training and simulation
    program awards. The decrease in SSG is associated with the
    completion of the Joint Base Operations Support program and
    decreased activity on the Nevada Test Site program.

2007 –

Technical Services revenue increased
    $319 million or 17 percent, as compared with 2006. The
    increase is primarily due to $248 million and
    $66 million in higher sales in SSG and LCOE, respectively.
    The increase in SSG is primarily driven by $252 million
    from the effects of a full year of sales for the Nevada Test
    Site program in 2007 as compared to six months of revenue in
    2006. The increase in LCOE is due to increased demand for F-15
    repairs at the Warner Robins Regional Repair Service Center,
    increased demand on the Hunter CLS program and increased work on
    the B-2 programs.

Segment
    Operating Income

Mission
    Systems

2008 –

Operating income at Mission Systems was
    comparable with 2007. The increase in operating income due to
    higher sales volume was offset by $51 million in lower
    performance results. The decrease in operating income as a
    percentage of sales reflects lower performance for command,
    control and communications programs, including higher planned
    internal investment for a new business opportunity, and final
    allocation of current and prior year overhead items.


– Mission Systems operating income
    increased $57 million, or 13 percent, in 2007 as
    compared with 2006. The increase is driven by $37 million
    from the higher sales volume described above and
    $20 million in net performance improvements. The increase
    in operating income as a percentage of sales is due to cost
    improvements achieved based on increases in customer order
    quantities in the FBCB2 I-Kits program, final negotiation of
    award fee earned on the National Team Battle Management Command
    and Control (BMC2) program, lower labor costs and favorable
    pricing of supplier procured materials in the CPP program and
    elimination of risk associated with hardware obsolescence in the
    Ground-Based Midcourse Defense Fire Control and Communications
    (GFC/C) program. Net performance improvements were
    partially offset by $12 million in higher amortization of
    purchased intangibles.

Information
    Technology

2008 –

Information Technology operating income
    decreased $24 million, or 7 percent, as compared with
    2007. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by
    lower performance results in CS&L, primarily due to a
    $57 million negative performance adjustment in the NYCWiN
    program recorded in the third quarter of 2008. The adjustment
    includes provisions related to a key supplier as well as a
    revised estimate of cost to complete the program.


– Information Technology operating income
    decreased $13 million, or 4 percent, as compared with
    2006. The decrease in operating income is due to
    $51 million in lower net performance results, partially
    offset by $38 million from the higher sales volume
    described above. The decrease in operating income as a
    percentage of sales was driven by $28 million in increased
    amortization of deferred and other outsourcing costs on large IT
    outsourcing programs compared to the prior period, and
    $22 million in discretionary spending for internal
    information systems infrastructure expected to yield future cost
    improvements.

Technical
    Services

2008 –

Technical Services operating income
    increased $1 million, or 1 percent, as compared with
    2007. The increase in operating income due to higher sales
    volume was partially offset by a higher level of planned
    internal investment and final allocation of current and prior
    year overhead items.

2007 –

Technical Services operating income was
    comparable with 2006. The increase in operating income due to
    higher sales volume was offset by the effects of performance
    improvements taken in the prior year and favorable 2006 margin
    adjustments to reflect risk reduction on contracts for spares
    production on fixed price contracts. A lower margin mix from the
    Nevada Test Site program also contributed to offsetting the
    volume increase.

Integrated
    Systems

2008 –

Integrated Systems revenue increased
    $437 million, or 9 percent, as compared with 2007. The
    increase was primarily due to higher volume associated with
    Unmanned Combat Air System Carrier Demonstration (UCAS-D),
    Global Hawk High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) Systems, B-2,
    Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS),
    Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) Unmanned Aircraft
    System, and restricted programs, partially offset by lower
    volume in the

E-2

programs, Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program
    (MP-RTIP), F-35, and

E-10A

programs.


– Integrated Systems revenue decreased
    $433 million, or 8 percent, as compared with 2006.
    Approximately $325 million of the decrease was a result of
    the transition of the

E-2D

Advanced Hawkeye, F-35 and EA-18G development programs to their
    early production phases. Also contributing to the reduction in
    revenue was approximately $160 million from the effects of
    significant customer-directed scope reductions associated with
    the

E-10A

platform and related MP-RTIP efforts. These reductions were
    partially offset by higher volume of $69 million for the

F/A-18

Multi-Year Procurement (MYP) and $77 million for the Global
    Hawk programs.

Space
    Technology

2008 –

Space Technology revenue increased
    $160 million, or 4 percent, in 2008 as compared with
    2007. The increase is primarily due to $202 million higher
    sales in National Systems, $104 million higher sales in
    Civil Systems, and $68 million higher sales in Missile
    Systems, partially offset by $206 million lower sales in
    Military Systems. The increase in National Systems is due to
    higher volume on restricted programs, partially offset by the
    termination of the Space Radar program in the second quarter of
    2008. The increase in Civil Systems is due to higher volume
    associated with the JWST and NPOESS programs. The increase in
    Missile Systems is due to higher volume associated with the KEI
    program. The decrease in Military Systems is due to lower volume
    associated with the AEHF and STSS programs.


– Space Technology revenue increased
    $307 million, or 8 percent, in 2007 as compared with
    2006. The increase was primarily due to $187 million higher
    sales in National Systems, $97 million higher sales in
    Missile Systems, and $49 million higher sales in
    Technology & Emerging Systems. The increase in
    National Systems is due to higher volume on restricted programs
    and the Space Radar program. The increase in
    Technology &

Integrated
    Systems

2008 –

Integrated Systems operating income
    increased $22 million, or 4 percent, as compared with
    2007. The increase in operating income reflects $49 million
    from the higher sales volume described above, partially offset
    by the impact of a $27 million favorable adjustment in 2007
    related to the settlement of prior years’ overhead costs.


– Integrated Systems operating income
    increased $40 million, or 7 percent, as compared with
    2006. The increase in operating income is due to
    $91 million in net performance improvements, partially
    offset by $51 million in the lower sales volume described
    above. The increase in operating income as a percentage of sales
    is primarily due to risk reduction achieved on the Global Hawk,

E-2

and B-2
    programs and the favorable settlement of a prior year’s
    overhead costs.

Space
    Technology

2008 –

Space Technology operating loss was
    $196 million as compared with operating income of
    $329 million in 2007. The decrease is due to a goodwill
    impairment charge of $570 million (see

Goodwill
    Impairment

on page 33), partially offset by the higher
    sales volume described above, and $31 million in net
    performance improvements. The net performance improvements are
    associated with risk retirement in several key programs
    including KEI, ICBM, ABL and various restricted programs.


– Space Technology operating income
    increased $18 million, or 6 percent, as compared with
    2006. The increase is due to $24 million in the higher
    sales volume described above, partially offset by
    $6 million in lower performance results.

    in Aerospace Systems, $165 million in higher sales in Land
    Forces, $69 million in higher sales in Navigation Systems,
    and $60 million in higher sales in Defensive Systems. The
    increase in Aerospace Systems is due to higher deliveries of
    upgraded F-16 international fire control radar systems and
    increased volume on the MESA Korea program. The increase in Land
    Forces is due to higher volume on vehicular intercommunication
    systems and the G/ATOR radar program. The increase in Navigation
    Systems is due to higher volume associated with Inertial
    Navigation programs. The increase in Defensive Systems is due to
    higher deliveries associated with the Large Aircraft Infrared
    Countermeasures (LAIRCM) IDIQ program.


– Electronics revenue increased
    $261 million, or 4 percent, as compared with 2006,
    reflecting $169 million higher sales in Land Forces,
    $133 million higher sales in the Space & ISR
    Systems, and $97 million in Naval & Marine
    Systems (NMD), partially offset by $136 million lower sales
    in Aerospace Systems. The increase in Land Forces sales is
    primarily due to higher deliveries on communication and
    weapons & sensor programs. The increase in
    Space & ISR Systems sales is primarily attributable to
    increases in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance
    programs. The increase in NMS sales is primarily due to higher
    volume on a restricted program. The lower Aerospace Systems
    sales are primarily due to the effect of declining volume on
    fixed price development programs.

Segment
    Operating Income

2008 –

Electronics operating income increased
    $139 million, or 17 percent, as compared with 2007.
    The increase in operating income is primarily due to
    $75 million from the higher sales volume described above
    and $59 million in royalty income resulting from patent
    infringement settlements at Navigation Systems. The 2008
    operating income includes a pre-tax charge of $20 million
    for the company’s Wedgetail MESA program associated with
    potential liquidated damages arising from the prime
    contractor’s announced schedule delay in completing the
    program. The 2007 operating income includes a pre-tax charge of
    $27 million for the F-16 Block 60 fixed-price
    development combat avionics program.


– Electronics operating income increased
    $27 million, or 3 percent, as compared with 2006. The
    increase in operating income is largely attributable to higher
    volume, primarily in Government Systems, Defensive Systems, and
    Naval & Marine Systems. Operating income included a
    $27 million pre-tax charge for the F-16 Block 60
    fixed-price development combat avionics program to reflect a
    higher estimate of software integration costs to complete the
    Falcon Edge electronic warfare suite. The 2006 operating income
    includes $121 million in pre-tax charges primarily for the
    MESA and Advanced Self Protection Integrated Suite (ASPIS) II
    programs. The 2007 operating income also includes
    $14 million in consolidation costs related to the closure
    of several facilities as a result of a continuing focus on
    effective infrastructure management and $18 million in
    provisions for settled and outstanding legal matters.

2008 –

Shipbuilding revenues increased
    $357 million, or 6 percent, as compared with 2007. The
    increase is primarily due to $254 million higher sales in
    Aircraft Carriers, $178 million higher sales in Surface
    Combatants, and $112 million higher sales in Fleet Support,
    partially offset by $184 million lower sales in
    Expeditionary Warfare. The increase in Aircraft Carriers is
    primarily due to higher sales volume on the

Gerald R.
    Ford

,

USS Enterprise

Extended Docking Selected
    Restricted Availability (EDSRA), and

USS Roosevelt

Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH), partially offset by
    lower volume on the

USS Carl Vinson

. The increase in
    Surface Combatants is primarily due to higher sales volume in
    the DDG 51 and DDG 1000 programs. The increase in Fleet Support
    is primarily due to the consolidation of AMSEC in the 2008
    period. Expeditionary Warfare sales were negatively impacted by
    a contract adjustment of $134 million on the LHD-8 program
    in the first quarter of 2008 and the Hurricane Gustav impact in
    the third quarter of 2008, partially offset by higher sales in
    the LPD program. In 2007, all programs at the Pascagoula,
    Mississippi facility were negatively impacted by a labor strike.

2007 –

Shipbuilding revenues increased
    $467 million, or 9 percent as compared with 2006. The
    increase was primarily due to $252 million in higher sales
    in Expeditionary Warfare, $92 million in higher sales in
    Fleet Support, $81 million in higher sales in Coast Guard
    and Coastal Defense, $53 million in higher sales in
    Submarines, $52 million in higher sales in Aircraft
    Carriers, partially offset by $33 million in lower sales in
    Surface Combatants, and $25 million in lower sales in
    Services, Commercial & Other. The increase in
    Expeditionary Warfare was primarily due to higher sales volume
    in the LPD and LHA programs due to production

ramp-ups,

partially offset by lower sales volume in the LHD program as a
    result of a labor strike at the Pascagoula, Mississippi
    shipyard. The increase in Fleet Support was due to the
    reorganization of AMSEC. The increase in Coast Guard and Coastal
    Defense was due to higher sales volume in the NSC program. The
    decrease in Surface Combatants was due to lower sales in the DDG
    1000 program and the impacts of the labor strike.

Segment
    Operating (Loss) Income

2008 –

Operating loss at Shipbuilding was
    $2.3 billion as compared with operating income of
    $538 million in the same period of 2007. The decrease is
    due to a goodwill impairment charge of $2.5 billion (see

Goodwill Impairment

on page 33), and
    $366 million in net lower performance results, partially
    offset by the higher sales volume described above. The decrease
    in net performance results is primarily due to a
    $326 million pre-tax charge on LHD-8 and other programs in
    the first quarter of 2008, cost growth and schedule delays on
    several LPD ships resulting primarily from the effects of
    Hurricane Ike on an LPD subcontractor (see Note 16 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8),
    and the effect of reductions in contract booking rates resulting
    from management taking a more conservative approach in its risk
    assessment on programs throughout the Gulf Coast Shipyards. The
    LHD-8 program achieved several important risk retirement
    milestones toward its planned delivery date, and as a result,
    $63 million of the first quarter 2008 charge was reversed
    in the second half of 2008.


– Operating income at Shipbuilding
    increased $145 million, or 37 percent, as compared
    with 2006. The increase is primarily due to $43 million
    from the higher sales volume described above, $62 million
    for recovery of lost profits from a settlement of a portion of
    the Katrina insurance claim, and a $23 million pre-tax gain
    resulting from the reorganization of AMSEC, partially offset by
    $55 million for a contract earnings rate adjustment on
    LHD-8 associated with a schedule extension resulting from
    manpower constraints in critical crafts (electrical and
    pipefitting) following the strike at the Pascagoula shipyard in
    2007.

BACKLOG

Total backlog at December 31, 2008, was approximately
    $78 billion. Total backlog includes both funded backlog
    (firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the
    customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding is
    not currently contractually obligated by the customer). Unfunded
    backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded IDIQ
    orders. For multi-year services contracts with non-federal
    government customers having no stated contract values, backlog

New
    Awards

The value of new contract awards during the year ended
    December 31, 2008, was approximately $48.3 billion.
    Significant new awards during this period include
    $5.6 billion for the

Virginia

-class Block III submarine programs,
    $5.1 billion for the

Gerald R. Ford

(CVN
    78) aircraft carrier, $1.4 billion for the DDG 1000
    Zumwalt-class destroyer, $1.2 billion for the BAMS Unmanned
    Aircraft System program, $402 million for the VIS IDIQ,
    $385 million for the ICBM program, and various restricted
    programs.

On February 29, 2008, the company won a $1.5 billion
    contract award by the U.S. Air Force as an initial step to
    replace its aerial refueling tanker fleet. The losing bidder for
    the contract protested the award decision by the U.S. Air
    Force. In the fourth quarter, the company reduced total backlog
    by $1.5 billion to reflect the termination of the
    U.S. Air Force refueling tanker program.

The value of new contract awards during the year ended
    December 31, 2007, was approximately $35.1 billion.
    Significant new awards during this period include
    $2.4 billion for NPOESS, $2.2 billion for LHA-6,
    $1 billion for LPD-25, $875 million for the Flats
    Sequencing Systems/ Postal Automation program, $636 million
    for the UCAS-D, $628 million for the DDG 1000 Zumwalt-class
    destroyer program, $607 million for the ICBM program,
    $272 million for the JRDC program, $234 million for
    the F-22 program, and various restricted programs.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The company endeavors to ensure the most efficient conversion of
    operating results into cash for deployment in growing its
    businesses and maximizing shareholder value. The company
    actively manages its capital resources through working capital
    improvements, capital expenditures, strategic business
    acquisitions, investment in independent research and
    development, debt repayments, required and voluntary pension
    contributions, and returning cash to its shareholders through
    dividend payments and repurchases of common stock.

Company management uses various financial measures to assist in
    capital deployment decision making including net cash provided
    by operations, free cash flow, net

debt-to-equity,

and net

debt-to-capital.

Management believes these measures are useful to investors in
    assessing the company’s financial performance.

The table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided
    by operating activities.

Free Cash
    Flow

Free cash flow represents cash from operating activities less
    capital expenditures and outsourcing contract and related
    software costs. The company believes free cash flow is a useful
    measure for investors as it reflects the ability of the company
    to grow by funding strategic business acquisitions and return
    value to shareholders through repurchasing its shares and paying
    dividends.

Free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under
    U.S. GAAP, and may not be defined and calculated by other
    companies in the same manner. This measure should not be
    considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating
    results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP as
    indicators of performance.

Cash
    Flows

The following is a discussion of the company’s major
    operating, investing and financing activities for each of the
    three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, as
    classified on the consolidated statements of cash flows located
    in Part II, Item 8.

Operating
    Activities

2008 –

Net cash provided by operating
    activities increased $321 million as compared with 2007,
    and reflects lower income tax payments and continued trade
    working capital reductions. Pension plan contributions totaled
    $320 million in 2008, of which $200 million was
    voluntarily pre-funded, and were comparable to 2007. Net cash
    provided by operating activities for 2008 included
    $113 million of federal and state income tax refunds and
    $23 million of interest income.

In 2009, the company expects to contribute the required minimum
    funding level of approximately $126 million to its pension
    plans and approximately $178 million to its other
    postretirement benefit plans and also expects to make additional
    voluntary pension contributions of approximately
    $250 million in each of the first and third quarters. For
    2009, cash generated from operations is expected to be
    sufficient to service debt and contract obligations, finance
    capital expenditures, continue acquisition of shares under the
    share repurchase program, and continue paying dividends to the
    company’s shareholders. Although 2009 cash from operations
    is expected to be sufficient to service these obligations, the
    company may borrow under credit facilities to accommodate timing
    differences in cash flows. The company has a committed
    $2 billion revolving credit facility that is currently
    undrawn and that can be accessed on a

same-day

basis. Additionally, were longer-term funding to be desired, the
    company believes it could, under current market conditions,
    access the capital markets for debt financing.


– Cash provided by operating activities
    increased $1.1 billion as compared with 2006, and reflects
    lower pension contributions, higher net income, and continued
    trade working capital reductions. Pension plan contributions
    totaled $342 million in 2007, of which $200 million
    was voluntarily pre-funded compared with contributions of
    $1.2 billion in 2006, of which $800 million was
    voluntarily pre-funded. Net cash provided by operating
    activities for 2007 included the receipt of $125 million of
    insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Katrina,
    $52 million of federal and state income tax refunds, and
    $21 million of interest income.


– Cash provided by operating activities
    decreased $0.9 billion as compared with 2005. The decrease
    was primarily due to contributions to the company’s pension
    plans totaling $1.2 billion, of which $800 million was
    voluntarily pre-funded, as compared to contributions of
    $415 million in 2005, of which $203 million was
    voluntarily pre-funded. Net cash from operating activities for
    2006 included the receipt of $100 million of insurance
    proceeds related to Hurricane Katrina, $60 million of
    federal and state income tax refunds, and $45 million of
    interest income.

Investing
    Activities

2008 –

Cash used in investing activities was
    $626 million in 2008. During 2008, the company received
    $175 million in proceeds from the sale of the
    Electro-Optical Systems business, spent $92 million for the
    acquisition of 3001 International, Inc. (see Notes 5 and 6
    to the consolidated financial statements in Part II,
    Item 8), paid $110 million for outsourcing costs
    related to outsourcing services contracts, and released
    $61 million of restricted cash related to the Gulf
    Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue Bonds (see
    Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8). The company has $11 million in
    restricted cash as of December 31, 2008 related to the
    Xinetics Inc. purchase (see Note 5 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8).

Capital expenditures in 2008 were $681 million and include
    $23 million of capitalized software costs. Capital
    expenditure commitments at December 31, 2008 were
    approximately $554 million, which are expected to be paid
    with cash on hand.


– Cash used in investing activities was
    $1.4 billion in 2007. During 2007, the company acquired
    Essex Corporation, Xinetics and the remaining 61 percent of
    Scaled Composites, LLC for approximately $690 million (see
    Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8), paid $137 million for
    outsourcing costs related to newly acquired outsourcing services
    contracts, and released $70 million of restricted cash
    related to the Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial Development
    Revenue Bonds (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8) of which
    $60 million remained restricted as of December 31,
    2007. This was partially offset by $11 million new
    restrictions related to the Xinetics purchase.

Capital expenditures in 2007 were $682 million, including
    $118 million to replace property damaged by Hurricane
    Katrina and $47 million of capitalized software costs.


– Cash used in investing activities was
    $601 million in 2006. During 2006, the company received
    $209 million from the sale of the remaining
    9.7 million of its TRW Auto common shares, received
    $117 million of insurance proceeds related to Hurricane
    Katrina, received $43 million from the sales of the
    Interconnect Technologies assembly business unit and Winchester,
    paid $77 million for outsourcing costs related to newly
    acquired outsourcing services contracts, and paid
    $35 million for the purchase of an investment. Also during
    2006, Shipbuilding received access to $200 million from the
    issuance of Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial Development

Revenue Bonds (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8) of which
    $127 million remained restricted as of December 31,
    2006.

Capital expenditures in 2006 were $732 million, including
    $111 million to replace property damaged by Hurricane
    Katrina and $36 million of capitalized software costs.

Financing
    Activities

2008 –

Cash used in financing activities for
    the year ended December 31, 2008, was $2 billion
    compared to $1.5 billion in the same period of 2007. The
    $532 million increase is primarily due to $380 million
    more for common stock purchases and $171 million lower
    proceeds from stock option exercises. See Note 8 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8
    for a discussion concerning the company’s common stock
    repurchases.


– Cash used in financing activities for
    the year ended December 31, 2007, was $1.5 billion
    compared to $1.7 billion in the same period of 2006. The
    $233 million decrease is primarily due to $922 million
    lower net repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by
    $350 million more common stock repurchases,
    $119 million lower proceeds from stock option exercises,
    $113 million higher net payments under lines of credits,
    and $102 million for higher dividends paid.


– Cash used in financing activities for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 was $1.7 billion
    compared to $1.4 billion in the same period of 2005. The
    $348 million increase is primarily due to $980 million
    higher net

repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by
    $385 million lower common stock repurchases and
    $230 million higher proceeds from exercises of stock
    options.

Share repurchases take place at management’s discretion or
    under pre-established non-discretionary programs from time to
    time, depending on market conditions, in the open market, and in
    privately negotiated transactions. The company retires its
    common stock upon repurchase and has not made any purchases of
    common stock other than in connection with these publicly
    announced repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2008, the
    company has authorized $945 million for share repurchases.

Credit
    Ratings

The company’s credit ratings at December 31, 2008, are
    summarized below:

Fitch

Moody’s

Standard & Poors

Long-term: Northrop Grumman

BBB+

Baa1

BBB+

In June 2007, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded its
    ratings on debt securities issued by the company. The long term
    rating was changed to Baa1 from Baa2. In December 2007, Fitch
    revised its outlook on the company to stable from positive.

Credit
    Facility

The company has a revolving credit agreement which provides for
    a five-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal
    amount of $2 billion and a maturity date of August 10,
    2012. The credit facility permits the company to request
    additional lending commitments from the lenders under the
    agreement or other eligible lenders under certain circumstances,
    and thereby increase the aggregate principal amount of the
    lending commitments under the agreement by up to an additional
    $500 million. The company’s credit agreement contains
    certain financial covenants relating to a maximum debt to
    capitalization ratio, and certain restrictions on additional
    asset liens, unless permitted by the agreement. As of
    December 31, 2008, the company was in compliance with all
    covenants.

At December 31, 2008, and 2007, there was no balance
    outstanding under this facility. There was a maximum of
    $300 million and $350 million borrowed under this
    facility during 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Other
    Sources and Uses of Capital

Additional Capital

– To provide for long-term
    liquidity, the company believes it can obtain additional
    capital, if necessary, from such sources as the public or
    private capital markets, the sale of assets, sale and leaseback
    of operating assets, and leasing rather than purchasing new
    assets. The company has an effective shelf registration on file
    with the SEC.

Cash on hand at the beginning of the year plus cash generated
    from operations and cash available under credit lines are
    expected to be sufficient in 2009 to service debt, finance
    capital expansion projects, pay federal, foreign, and state
    income taxes, fund pension and other post retirement benefit
    plans, and continue paying dividends to shareholders. The
    company will continue to provide the productive capacity to
    perform its existing contracts, prepare for future contracts,
    and conduct research and development in the pursuit of
    developing opportunities.

-53-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

While these expenditures tend to limit short-term liquidity,
    they are made with the intention of improving the long-term
    growth and profitability of the company.

Financial Arrangements

– In the ordinary course
    of business, the company uses standby letters of credit and
    guarantees issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued by
    insurance companies principally to guarantee the performance on
    certain contracts and to support the company’s self-insured
    workers’ compensation plans. At December 31, 2008,
    there were $489 million of unused stand-by letters of
    credit, $134 million of bank guarantees, and
    $459 million of surety bonds outstanding.

In December 2006, the company guaranteed a $200 million
    loan made to Shipbuilding in connection with certain Gulf
    Opportunity Zone Industrial Revenue Bonds. Under the loan
    agreement the company guaranteed repayment by Shipbuilding of
    the principal and interest to the Trustee. The company also
    guaranteed payment of the principal and interest by the Trustee
    to the underlying bondholders.

A “purchase obligation” is defined as an agreement to
    purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally
    binding on the company and that specifies all significant terms,
    including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed,
    minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate
    timing of the transaction. These amounts are primarily comprised
    of open purchase order commitments to vendors and subcontractors
    pertaining to funded contracts.

(2)

Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of accrued
    workers’ compensation, deferred compensation, and other
    miscellaneous liabilities, but exclude obligations for uncertain
    tax positions of $395 million, as the timing of the
    payments cannot be reasonably estimated.

The table above also excludes estimated minimum funding
    requirements and expected voluntary contributions for retiree
    benefit plans as set forth by ERISA in relation to the
    company’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations
    totaling approximately $5.5 billion over the next five
    years: $804 million in 2009, $412 million in 2010,
    $1,233 million in 2011, $1,609 million in 2012, and
    $1,432 million in 2013. The company also has payments due
    under plans that are not required to be funded in advance, but
    are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. See Note 17 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8.

Further details regarding long-term debt and operating leases
    can be found in Notes 14 and 16, respectively, to the

Item 7A.  Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rates

– The company is exposed to
    market risk, primarily related to interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange rates. Financial instruments subject to
    interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt
    obligations, variable-rate short-term borrowings under the
    credit agreement, short-term investments, and long-term notes
    receivable. At December 31, 2008, substantially all
    outstanding borrowings were fixed-rate long-term debt
    obligations of which a significant portion are not callable
    until maturity. The company has a modest exposure to interest
    rate risk resulting from four interest rate swap agreements
    described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8. During 2008, the
    company entered into two forward-starting interest rate swap
    agreements with a notional value totaling $400 million. The
    company designated these swaps as cash flow hedges associated
    with future interest rate exposure on $400 million of
    financing expected to occur in 2009. The company’s
    sensitivity to a 1 percent change in interest rates is tied
    to its $2 billion credit agreement, which had no balance
    outstanding at December 31, 2008 or 2007, and the
    aforementioned interest rate swap agreements. See Note 14
    to the consolidated financial statements in Part II,
    Item 8.

Derivatives

– The company does not hold or
    issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The
    company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage
    its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31,
    2008, and 2007, four and two interest rate swap agreements,
    respectively, were in effect. See Notes 1 and 12 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8.

Foreign Currency

– The company enters into
    foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency
    exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and
    payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. At
    December 31, 2008, and 2007, the amount of foreign currency
    forward contracts outstanding was not material. The company does
    not consider the market risk exposure relating to foreign
    currency exchange to be material to the consolidated financial
    statements. See Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8.

Item 8.
    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON THE
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Northrop Grumman Corporation

Los Angeles, California

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of
    financial position of Northrop Grumman Corporation and
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,
    2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of
    operations and comprehensive (loss) income, changes in
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2008. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
    Index at Item 15. These financial statements and the
    financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on the financial statements and financial statement
    schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    Northrop Grumman Corporation and subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
    schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
    financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted, effective January 1, 2007,
    a new accounting standard for income taxes. As discussed in
    Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the
    Company adopted, effective December 31, 2006, a new
    accounting standard for retirement benefits.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 10, 2009 expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

– Northrop Grumman
    Corporation and its subsidiaries (Northrop Grumman or the
    company) provide technologically advanced, innovative products,
    services, and solutions in information and services, aerospace,
    electronics, and shipbuilding. At December 31, 2008, the
    company was aligned into seven reporting segments categorized
    into four primary businesses. The Mission Systems, Information
    Technology, and Technical Services segments are presented as
    Information & Services. The Integrated Systems and
    Space Technology segments are presented as Aerospace. The
    Electronics and Shipbuilding segments are each presented as
    separate businesses.

Information & Services

– Mission
    Systems is a leading global systems integrator of complex,
    mission-enabling systems for government, military, and business
    clients. Products and services are focused on the fields of
    Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence
    (C4I), missile and air defense, airborne reconnaissance,
    intelligence management and processing, and decision support
    systems.

Information Technology is a premier provider of information
    technology (IT) systems engineering and systems integration for
    the Department of Defense (DoD), national intelligence, federal,
    civilian, state and local agencies, and commercial customers.

Technical Services is a leading provider of logistics,
    infrastructure, and sustainment support, while also providing a
    wide array of technical services, including training and
    simulation.

Aerospace –

Integrated Systems is a leader in
    the design, development, and production of airborne early
    warning, electronic warfare and surveillance systems, and
    battlefield management systems, as well as manned and unmanned
    tactical and strike systems.

Space Technology develops and integrates a broad range of
    systems at the leading edge of space, defense, and electronics
    technology. The segment supplies products primarily to the
    U.S. Government that play an important role in maintaining
    the nation’s security and leadership in science and
    technology. Space Technology’s business areas focus on the
    design, development, manufacture, and integration of satellite
    systems and subsystems, electronic and communications payloads,
    intercontinental ballistic missile systems, and high energy
    laser systems and subsystems.

Electronics –

is a leading designer, developer,
    manufacturer and integrator of a variety of advanced electronic
    and maritime systems for national security and select
    non-defense applications. Electronics provides systems to
    U.S. and international customers for such applications as
    airborne surveillance, aircraft fire control, precision
    targeting, electronic warfare, automatic test equipment,
    inertial navigation, integrated avionics, space sensing,
    intelligence processing, air traffic control, air and missile
    defense, communications, mail processing, biochemical detection,
    ship bridge control, and shipboard components.

Shipbuilding –

is the nation’s sole
    industrial designer, builder, and refueler of nuclear-powered
    aircraft carriers and one of only two companies capable of
    designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the
    U.S. Navy. Shipbuilding is also one of the nation’s
    leading full service systems providers for the design,
    engineering, construction, and life cycle support of major
    surface ships for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard,
    international navies, and for commercial vessels of all types.

As prime contractor, principal subcontractor, partner, or
    preferred supplier, Northrop Grumman participates in many
    high-priority defense and non-defense technology programs in the
    U.S. and abroad. Northrop Grumman conducts most of its
    business with the U.S. Government, principally the DoD. The
    company is therefore affected by, among other things, the
    federal budget process. The company also conducts business with
    local, state, and foreign governments and makes domestic and
    international commercial sales.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Principles of Consolidation

– The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of Northrop Grumman
    and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts, transactions,
    and profits among Northrop Grumman and its subsidiaries are
    eliminated in consolidation.

Accounting Estimates

– The company’s
    financial statements are in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America
    (U.S. GAAP). The preparation thereof requires management to
    make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at
    the date of the financial statements as well as the reported
    amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
    Estimates have been prepared on the basis of the most current
    and best available information and actual results could differ
    materially from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

– As a defense contractor
    engaging in long-term contracts, the majority of the
    company’s business is derived from long-term contracts for
    the construction of facilities, production of goods, and
    services provided to the federal government. In accounting for
    these contracts, the company extensively utilizes the

cost-to-cost

and the

units-of-delivery

measures of the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting. Sales under cost-reimbursement contracts
    and construction-type contracts that provide for delivery at a
    low volume per year or a small number of units after a lengthy
    period of time over which a significant amount of costs have
    been incurred are accounted for using the

cost-to-cost

measure of the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting. Under this method, sales, including
    estimated earned fees or profits, are recorded as costs are
    incurred. For most contracts, sales are calculated based on the
    percentage that total costs incurred bear to total estimated
    costs at completion. For certain contracts with large up-front
    purchases of material, sales are calculated based on the
    percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total
    estimated direct labor costs. Sales under construction-type
    contracts that provide for delivery at a high volume per year
    are accounted for using the

units-of-delivery

measure of the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting. Under this method, sales are recognized as
    deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales
    values in accordance with the contract terms. The company
    estimates profit as the difference between total estimated
    revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes
    that profit over the life of the contract based on deliveries.
    The company classifies contract revenues as product sales or
    service revenues depending upon the predominant attributes of
    the relevant underlying contracts.

Certain contracts contain provisions for price redetermination
    or for cost

and/or

performance incentives. Such redetermined amounts or incentives
    are included in sales when the amounts can reasonably be
    determined and estimated. Amounts representing contract change
    orders, claims, requests for equitable adjustment, or
    limitations in funding are included in sales only when they can
    be reliably estimated and realization is probable. In the period
    in which it is determined that a loss will result from the
    performance of a contract, the entire amount of the estimated
    ultimate loss is charged against income. Loss provisions are
    first offset against costs that are included in inventories,
    with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities. Changes in
    estimates of contract sales, costs, and profits are recognized
    using the cumulative

catch-up

method of accounting. This method recognizes in the current
    period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior
    periods. Hence, the effect of the changes on future periods of
    contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate
    had been the original estimate. A significant change in an
    estimate on one or more contracts could have a material adverse
    effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or
    results of operations.

Revenue under contracts to provide services to non-federal
    government customers are generally recognized when services are
    performed. Service contracts include operations and maintenance
    contracts, and outsourcing-type arrangements, primarily in the
    Information Technology segment. Revenue under such contracts is
    generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of
    contract performance, unless evidence suggests that the revenue
    is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different
    pattern. Costs incurred under these service contracts are
    expensed as incurred, except that direct and incremental

set-up

costs
    are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement.
    Operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate
    from period to period, particularly in the earlier phases of the
    contract. Service contracts that include more than one type of
    product or service are accounted for under the provisions of
    Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

No. 00-21 –

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.

Accordingly, for applicable arrangements, revenue
    recognition includes the proper identification of separate units
    of accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements
    based on relative fair values.

General and Administrative Expenses

– In
    accordance with industry practice and the regulations that
    govern the cost accounting requirements for government
    contracts, most general corporate expenses incurred at both the
    segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and
    allocable costs on government contracts. For most components of
    the company, these costs are allocated to contracts in progress
    on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include
    this cost component as an element of cost. General and
    administrative expenses primarily relate to segment operations.

Research and Development –

Company-sponsored
    research and development activities primarily include
    independent research and development (IR&D) efforts related
    to government programs. IR&D expenses are included in
    general and administrative expenses and are generally allocated
    to U.S. Government contracts. Company-sponsored research
    and development expenses totaled $576 million,
    $534 million, and $569 million in 2008, 2007, and
    2006, respectively. Expenses for research and development
    sponsored by the customer are charged directly to the related
    contracts.

Product Warranty Costs –

The company provides
    certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of
    non-conforming items for a specified period of time. Most of the
    company’s product warranties are provided under government
    contracts, the costs of which are incorporated into contract
    pricing. Accrued product warranty costs of $71 million and
    $78 million were included in other current liabilities at
    December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Environmental Costs

– Environmental liabilities
    are accrued when the company determines it is responsible for
    remediation costs and such amounts are reasonably estimable.
    When only a range of amounts is established and no amount within
    the range is more probable than another, the minimum amount in
    the range is recorded. Environmental liabilities are recorded on
    an undiscounted basis. At sites involving multiple parties, the
    company accrues environmental liabilities based upon its
    expected share of liability, taking into account the financial
    viability of other jointly liable parties. Environmental
    expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
    Capitalized expenditures relate to long-lived improvements in
    currently operating facilities. The company does not anticipate
    and record insurance recoveries before collection is probable.
    At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the company did not have any
    accrued receivables related to insurance reimbursements or
    recoveries for environmental matters.

Derivative Financial Instruments –

Derivative
    financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in
    the financial statements and measured at fair value. Changes in
    the fair value of derivative financial instruments that qualify
    and are designated as fair value hedges are required to be
    recorded in income from continuing operations, while the
    effective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivative
    financial instruments that qualify and are designated as cash
    flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income. The
    company may use derivative financial instruments to manage its
    exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks
    and to balance its fixed and variable rate long-term debt
    portfolio. The company does not use derivative financial
    instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor does it use
    leveraged financial instruments. Credit risk related to
    derivative financial instruments is considered minimal and is
    managed by requiring high credit standards for its
    counterparties and periodic settlements.

For derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging
    instruments, gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair
    value are reported in Other, net in the consolidated statements
    of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.

Other, net

– For 2008, Other, net primarily
    consisted of royalty income from patent infringement settlements
    at Electronics of $59 million, partially offset by downward
    mark to market adjustments on investments in marketable
    securities. For 2007, Other, net was not significant. For 2006,
    Other, net primarily consisted of a

-69-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

pre-tax gain of $111 million related to the sale of the
    company’s remaining 9.7 million TRW Automotive (TRW
    Auto) shares. Other, net includes interest income for all
    periods presented.

Income Taxes

– Provisions for federal, foreign,
    state, and local income taxes are calculated on reported
    financial statement pre-tax income based on current tax law and
    include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from
    those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and
    liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently
    payable because certain items of income and expense are
    recognized in different time periods for financial reporting
    purposes than for income tax purposes. If a tax position does
    not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of
    penalties, the company recognizes an expense for the amount of
    the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed in the tax
    return of the company. The company recognizes interest accrued
    related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
    Penalties, if probable and reasonably estimable, are recognized
    as a component of income tax expense. State and local income and
    franchise tax provisions are allocable to contracts in process
    and, accordingly, are included in general and administrative
    expenses.

In accordance with the recognition standards established by
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No.
    (FIN) 48 –

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement 109

,
    the company makes a comprehensive review of its portfolio of
    uncertain tax positions regularly. In this regard, an uncertain
    tax position represents the company’s expected treatment of
    a tax position taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be
    taken in a future tax return or claim, that has not been
    reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial
    reporting purposes. Until these positions are sustained by the
    taxing authorities, the company has not recognized the tax
    benefits resulting from such positions and reports the tax
    effects as a liability for uncertain tax positions in its
    consolidated statements of financial position.

Cash and cash equivalents

– For cash and cash
    equivalents and amounts borrowed under the company’s
    short-term credit lines, the carrying amounts approximate fair
    value due to the short-term nature of these items. Cash and cash
    equivalents include short-term interest-earning debt instruments
    that mature in three months or less from the date purchased.

Marketable Securities

– At December 31,
    2008, and 2007, substantially all of the company’s
    investments in marketable securities were classified as

available-for-sale

or trading. For

available-for-sale

securities, any unrealized gains and losses are reported as a
    separate component of shareholders’ equity. Unrealized
    gains and losses on trading securities are included in Other,
    net in the consolidated statements of operations and
    comprehensive (loss) income. Investments in marketable
    securities are recorded at fair value.

Accounts Receivable

– Accounts receivable
    include amounts billed and currently due from customers, amounts
    currently due but unbilled (primarily related to contracts
    accounted for under the

cost-to-cost

measure of the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting), certain estimated contract changes,
    claims or requests for equitable adjustment in negotiation that
    are probable of recovery, and amounts retained by the customer
    pending contract completion.

Inventoried Costs

– Inventoried costs primarily
    relate to work in process under fixed-price,

units-of-delivery

contracts. These costs represent accumulated contract costs less
    the portion of such costs allocated to delivered items.
    Accumulated contract costs include direct production costs,
    factory and engineering overhead, production tooling costs, and,
    for government contracts, allowable general and administrative
    expenses. The ratio of inventoried general and administrative
    expenses to total inventoried costs is estimated to be the same
    as the ratio of total general and administrative expenses
    incurred to total contract costs incurred. According to the
    provisions of U.S. Government contracts, the customer
    asserts title to, or a security interest in, inventories related
    to such contracts as a result of contract advances,
    performance-based payments, and progress payments. General
    corporate expenses and IR&D allocable to commercial
    contracts are expensed as incurred. In accordance with industry
    practice, inventoried costs are classified as a current asset
    and include amounts related to contracts having production
    cycles longer than one year. Product inventory primarily
    consists of raw materials and is stated at the lower of cost or
    market, generally using the average cost method.

-70-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Outsourcing Contract Costs

– Costs on
    outsourcing contracts, including costs incurred for bid and
    proposal activities, are generally expensed as incurred.
    However, certain costs incurred upon initiation of an
    outsourcing contract are deferred and expensed over the contract
    life. These costs represent incremental external costs or
    certain specific internal costs that are directly related to the
    contract acquisition and transition/set-up. The primary types of
    costs that may be capitalized include labor and related fringe
    benefits, subcontractor costs, and travel costs.

Depreciable Properties

– Property, plant, and
    equipment owned by the company are depreciated over the
    estimated useful lives of individual assets. Costs incurred for
    computer software developed or obtained for internal use are
    capitalized and classified in machinery and other equipment.
    Most of these assets are depreciated using declining-balance
    methods, with the remainder using the straight-line method, with
    the following lives:

Years

Land improvements

2-45

Buildings and improvements

2-45

Machinery and other equipment

2-25

Capitalized software costs

3-5

Leasehold improvements

Length of lease

Restricted Cash

– Access to proceeds from the
    Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue Bonds (see
    Note 14) is restricted to certain capital
    expenditures. As such, the amount of unexpended proceeds
    available as of December 31, 2007, is recorded in
    miscellaneous other assets as restricted cash in the
    consolidated statements of financial position. At
    December 31, 2008, all proceeds were utilized, and no
    restricted cash related to the Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial
    Revenue Bonds remains.

Leases

– The company uses its incremental
    borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification as
    capital or operating and defines the initial lease term to
    include renewal options determined to be reasonably assured. The
    company conducts operations primarily under operating leases.

Most lease agreements contain incentives for tenant
    improvements, rent holidays, or rent escalation clauses. For
    incentives for tenant improvements, the company records a
    deferred rent liability and amortizes the deferred rent over the
    term of the lease as a reduction to rent expense. For rent
    holidays and rent escalation clauses during the lease term, the
    company records minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis
    over the term of the lease. For purposes of recognizing lease
    incentives, the company uses the date of initial possession as
    the commencement date, which is generally when the company is
    given the right of access to the space and begins to make
    improvements in preparation of intended use.

Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangible Assets

– The company performs impairment tests for
    goodwill as of November 30th of each year, or when
    evidence of potential impairment exits. When it is determined
    that impairment has occurred, a charge to operations is
    recorded. Goodwill and other purchased intangible asset balances
    are included in the identifiable assets of the business segment
    to which they have been assigned. Any goodwill impairment, as
    well as the amortization of other purchased intangible assets,
    is charged against the respective business segments’
    operating income. Purchased intangible assets are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (see
    Note 11).

Self-Insurance Accruals

– Included in other
    long-term liabilities is approximately $523 million and
    $519 million related to self-insured workers’
    compensation as of December 31, 2008, and 2007,
    respectively. The company estimates the required liability of
    such claims on a discounted basis utilizing actuarial methods
    based on various assumptions, which include, but are not limited
    to, the company’s historical loss experience and projected
    loss development factors.

Litigation, Commitments, and Contingencies

– Amounts associated with litigation, commitments,
    and contingencies are recorded as charges to earnings when
    management, after taking into consideration the facts and
    circumstances

-71-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

of each matter, including any settlement offers, has determined
    that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
    amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

Retirement Benefits

– The company sponsors
    various pension plans covering substantially all employees. The
    company also provides postretirement benefit plans other than
    pensions, consisting principally of health care and life
    insurance benefits, to eligible retirees and qualifying
    dependents. The liabilities and annual income or expense of the
    company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans
    are determined using methodologies that involve several
    actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the
    discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return (based on the
    market-related value of assets), and medical trend (rate of
    growth for medical costs). The fair values of plan assets are
    determined based on prevailing market prices or estimated fair
    value for investments with no available quoted prices. Not all
    net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in net
    earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to
    production as product costs, and a portion remains in inventory
    at the end of a reporting period. The company’s funding
    policy for pension plans is to contribute, at a minimum, the
    statutorily required amount to an irrevocable trust.

Stock Compensation

– The company accounts for
    stock compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R –

Share-Based Payment

. All of the company’s stock
    compensation plans are considered equity plans under
    SFAS No. 123R, and compensation expense recognized is
    net of estimated forfeitures over the vesting period. The
    company issues stock options and stock awards, in the form of
    restricted performance stock rights and restricted stock rights,
    under its existing plans. The fair value of stock option awards
    is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model and is expensed on a straight-line basis
    over the vesting period of the options, which is generally three
    to four years. The fair value of stock awards is determined
    based on the closing market price of the company’s common
    stock on the grant date and is adjusted at each reporting date
    based on the amount of shares ultimately expected to vest.
    Compensation expense for stock awards is expensed over the
    vesting period, usually three to five years.

Foreign Currency Translation

– For operations
    outside the U.S. that prepare financial statements in
    currencies other than the U.S. dollar, results of
    operations and cash flows are translated at average exchange
    rates during the period, and assets and liabilities are
    generally translated at

end-of-period

exchange rates. Translation adjustments are not material and are
    included as a separate component of accumulated other
    comprehensive loss in consolidated shareholders’ equity.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

– The
    components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are as
    follows:

Financial Statement Reclassification

– Certain
    amounts in the prior year financial statements and related notes
    have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation of
    the Electro-optical Systems (EOS) business, formerly reported in
    the Electronics segment, as discontinued operations (see
    Note 6) and the business operation realignments
    effective in 2008 (see Note 7).

2.

NEW
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Adoption
    of New Accounting Standards

There have been no significant changes in the company’s
    critical accounting policies during 2008.

-72-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

The disclosure requirements of
    SFAS No. 157 –

Fair Value
    Measurements

, which took effect on January 1, 2008, are
    presented in Note 12. On January 1, 2009, the company
    will implement the previously deferred provisions of
    SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities
    recorded at fair value, as required. Management does not believe
    that the remaining provisions will have a material effect on the
    company’s consolidated financial position or results of
    operations when they become effective.

Standards
    Issued But Not Yet Effective

In December 2007, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 141(R) –

Business
    Combinations

. SFAS No. 141(R) expands the
    definition of a business and establishes the use of the
    “acquisition method” for business combinations which
    requires the measurement and recognition of all assets and
    liabilities (including goodwill) of an acquired business at fair
    value on the acquisition date, which is the date that the
    acquirer obtains control of the business. Among other things,
    the standard establishes new guidelines for the expensing of
    transaction and restructuring costs, fair value measurement of
    contingent consideration in earnings, and capitalization of
    in-process research and development. The standard also modifies
    the presentation and recording of deferred taxes and establishes
    the conditions under which a bargain purchase could result in a
    gain. SFAS No. 141(R) will be applied prospectively to
    business combinations with acquisition dates on or after
    January 1, 2009. Adoption is not expected to materially
    impact the company’s consolidated financial position or
    results of operations directly when it becomes effective, as the
    only impact that the standard will have on recorded amounts at
    that time relates to disposition of uncertain tax positions
    related to prior acquisitions. Following adoption, the
    resolution of such items at values that differ from recorded
    amounts will be adjusted through earnings, rather than through
    goodwill. Adoption of this statement is, however, expected to
    have a significant effect on how acquisition transactions
    subsequent to January 1, 2009, are reflected in the
    financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 160 –

Noncontrolling Interests
    in Consolidated Financial Statements – an amendment of
    Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51.

SFAS No. 160 requires presentation of
    non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries
    separately within equity in the consolidated statements of
    financial position as well as the separate presentation within
    the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
    (loss) income attributable to the parent and non-controlling
    interest. Accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership
    interest, will generally be at fair value and if the parent
    retains control or significant influence of the subsidiary, any
    adjustments will be made through equity, while transactions
    where control changes will be accounted for through earnings.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective for the company beginning
    January 1, 2009. Adoption of this statement is not expected
    to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated
    financial position or results of operations when it becomes
    effective, but may significantly affect the accounting for
    noncontrolling (or minority) interests from that date forward.

Other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after
    December 31, 2008, are not expected to have a significant
    effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or
    results of operations.

GOODWILL
    IMPAIRMENT CHARGE

The company performs its annual impairment test for goodwill in
    accordance with SFAS No. 142 –

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

as of November 30 each year. The
    company’s testing approach utilizes a discounted cash flow
    analysis corroborated by comparative market multiples to
    determine the fair value of its businesses for comparison to
    their corresponding book values. If the book value exceeds the
    estimated fair value for a business, a potential impairment is
    indicated and SFAS No. 142 prescribes the approach for
    determining the impairment amount, if any. After conducting its
    2008 test, the company determined that goodwill at Space
    Technology was impaired by $570 million, and goodwill at
    Shipbuilding was impaired by $2,490 million, resulting in
    an aggregate goodwill impairment charge of $3,060 million
    that was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008. The goodwill
    impairment charge is primarily driven by adverse equity market
    conditions and the resulting decrease in current market
    multiples and the company’s stock price as of
    November 30, 2008. This non-cash charge reduces goodwill
    recorded in connection with acquisitions made in 2001 and 2002
    and does not impact the company’s

-73-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

overall business operations. The goodwill at these businesses
    has no tax basis, and accordingly, there is no tax benefit to be
    derived from recording the impairment charge.

Prior to recording the goodwill impairment charges at
    Shipbuilding and Space Technology, the company tested the
    purchased intangible assets and other long-lived assets at both
    of these businesses as required by
    SFAS No. 144 –

Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets,

and the
    carrying value of these assets were determined not to be
    impaired. See Note 11 for additional information relating
    to the company’s purchased intangible assets.

DIVIDENDS
    ON COMMON STOCK AND CONVERSION OF PREFERRED STOCK

Dividends on Common Stock

– In April 2008, the
    company’s board of directors approved an increase to the
    quarterly common stock dividend, from $.37 per share to $.40 per
    share, for shareholders of record as of June 2, 2008.

On February 21, 2007, the company’s Board of Directors
    approved an increase to the quarterly common stock dividend,
    from $.30 per share to $.37 per share, effective with the first
    quarter 2007 dividends.

On May 17, 2006, the company’s Board of Directors
    approved an increase to the quarterly common stock dividend,
    from $.26 per share to $.30 per share, effective with the second
    quarter 2006 dividends.

Conversion of Preferred Stock

– On
    February 20, 2008, the company’s board of directors
    approved the redemption of the 3.5 million shares of
    mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock on
    April 4, 2008. Prior to the redemption date, substantially
    all of the preferred shares were converted into common stock at
    the election of shareholders. All remaining unconverted
    preferred shares were redeemed by the company on the redemption
    date. As a result of the conversion and redemption, the company
    issued approximately 6.4 million shares of common stock.

5.

BUSINESS
    ACQUISITIONS


– In October 2008, the company acquired
    3001 International, Inc. (3001) for approximately
    $92 million in cash. 3001 provides geospatial data
    production and analysis, including airborne imaging, surveying,
    mapping and geographic information systems for U.S. and
    international government intelligence, defense and civilian
    customers. The operating results of 3001 are reported in the
    Information Technology segment from the date of acquisition. The
    assets, liabilities, and results of operations of 3001 are not
    material to the company’s consolidated financial position
    or results of operations, and thus pro-forma information is not
    presented. The consolidated financial statements reflect
    preliminary estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed and the related allocation of the
    purchase price for the entities acquired. Management does not
    expect adjustments to these estimates, if any, to have a
    material effect on the company’s consolidated financial
    position or results of operations.


– During the third quarter of 2007, the
    company acquired Xinetics Inc., reported in the Space Technology
    segment, and the remaining 61 percent of Scaled Composites,
    LLC, reported in the Integrated Systems segment, for an
    aggregate amount of approximately $100 million in cash. The
    assets, liabilities, and results of operations of these entities
    were not material to the company’s consolidated financial
    position or results of operations, and thus pro-forma
    information is not presented.

In July 2007, the company and Science Applications International
    Corporation (SAIC) reorganized the AMSEC, LLC joint venture
    (AMSEC), by dividing AMSEC along customer and product lines.
    AMSEC is a full-service supplier that provides engineering,
    logistics and technical support services primarily to Navy ship
    and aviation programs. Under the reorganization plan, the
    company retained the ship engineering, logistics and technical
    service businesses under the AMSEC name (the AMSEC Businesses)
    and, in exchange, SAIC received the aviation, combat systems and
    strike force integration services businesses from AMSEC (the
    Divested Businesses). This reorganization was treated as a step
    acquisition for the acquisition of SAIC’s interests in the
    AMSEC Businesses, with the company recognizing a pre-tax gain of
    $23 million for the effective sale of its interests in the

-74-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Divested Businesses. From the date of this reorganization, the
    operating results of the AMSEC Businesses, and transaction gain,
    have been reported on a consolidated basis in the Shipbuilding
    segment from the date of this reorganization. Prior to the
    reorganization, the company accounted for AMSEC, LLC under the
    equity method. The assets, liabilities, and results of
    operations of the AMSEC Businesses were not material to the
    company’s consolidated financial position or results of
    operations, and thus pro-forma information is not presented.

In January 2007, the company acquired Essex Corporation (Essex)
    for approximately $590 million in cash, including the
    assumption of debt totaling $23 million. Essex provides
    signal processing services and products, and advanced
    optoelectronic imaging for U.S. government intelligence and
    defense customers. The operating results of Essex are reported
    in the Mission Systems segment. The assets, liabilities, and
    results of operations of Essex were not material to the
    company’s consolidated financial position or results of
    operations, and thus pro-forma information is not presented.


– There were no significant acquisitions
    during 2006.

6.

BUSINESS
    DISPOSITIONS

2008 –

In April 2008, the company sold its
    Electro-Optical Systems (EOS) business for $175 million in
    cash to L-3 Communications Corporation and recognized a gain of
    $19 million, net of taxes of $39 million. EOS,
    formerly a part of the Electronics segment, produces night
    vision and applied optics products. Sales for this business in
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, were
    approximately $53 million, $190 million, and
    $122 million, respectively. Operating results of this
    business are reported as discontinued operations in the
    consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss)
    income for all periods presented.


– During the second quarter of 2007,
    management announced its decision to exit the remaining
    Interconnect Technologies (ITD) business reported within the
    Electronics segment. Sales for this business in the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, were $14 million and
    $35 million, respectively. The shut-down was completed
    during the third quarter of 2007 and costs associated with the
    shut-down were not material. The results of this business are
    reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated
    statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income for all
    periods presented.


– During the second quarter of 2006, the
    Enterprise Information Technology (EIT) business, formerly
    reported in the Information Technology segment, was shut down
    and costs associated with the exit activities were not material.
    The results of operations of this business are reported as
    discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of
    operations and comprehensive (loss) income for all periods
    presented.

The company sold the assembly business unit of ITD during the
    first quarter of 2006 and Winchester Electronics (Winchester)
    during the second quarter of 2006 for net cash proceeds of
    $26 million and $17 million, respectively, and
    recognized after-tax gains of $4 million and
    $2 million, respectively, in discontinued operations. Each
    of these business units was associated with the Electronics
    Segment. The results of operations of the assembly business unit
    of ITD are reported as discontinued operations in the
    consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss)
    income. The results of operations of Winchester were not
    material to any of the periods presented and have therefore not
    been reclassified as discontinued operations.

SEGMENT
    INFORMATION

At December 31, 2008, the company was aligned into seven
    reporting segments categorized into four primary businesses. The
    Mission Systems, Information Technology, and Technical Services
    segments are presented as Information & Services. The
    Integrated Systems and Space Technology segments are presented
    as Aerospace. The Electronics and Shipbuilding segments are each
    presented as separate businesses.

U.S. Government Sales

– Revenue from the
    U.S. Government (which includes Foreign Military Sales)
    includes revenue from contracts for which Northrop Grumman is
    the prime contractor as well as those for which the company is a
    subcontractor and the ultimate customer is the
    U.S. Government. All of the company’s segments derive
    substantial revenue from the U.S. Government. Sales to the
    U.S. Government amounted to approximately
    $30.9 billion, $28.8 billion, and $27.2 billion,
    or 91.2 percent, 90.6 percent, and 90.8 percent
    of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007, and 2006, respectively.

Foreign Sales –

Direct foreign sales amounted
    to approximately $1.7 billion, $1.7 billion, and
    $1.6 billion, or 5.1 percent, 5.5 percent, and
    5.2 percent of total revenue for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Discontinued Operations

– The company’s
    discontinued operations are excluded from all of the data
    elements in the following tables, except for assets by segment.

Assets –

Substantially all of the
    company’s assets are located or maintained in the US.

Realignments

– The company, from time to time,
    acquires or disposes of businesses, and realigns contracts,
    programs or business areas among and within its operating
    segments that possess similar customers, expertise, and
    capabilities. Internal realignments are designed to more fully
    leverage existing capabilities and enhance development and
    delivery of products and services. During the second quarter of
    2008, the company transferred certain programs and assets from
    the missiles business in the Mission Systems segment to the
    Space Technology segment. In January 2008, the Newport News and
    Ship Systems businesses were combined into a single operating
    segment called Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding. Previously, these
    businesses were separate operating segments which were
    aggregated into a single reporting segment for financial
    reporting purposes. In addition, certain Electronics businesses
    were transferred to Mission Systems during the first quarter of
    2008. The operating results for all periods presented have been
    revised to reflect these changes. See a description of the
    segment business areas and specific realignments located in
    Part I, Item 1.

Subsequent Realignments –

In January 2009, the
    company streamlined its organizational structure by reducing the
    number of reporting segments from seven to five. The five
    segments are Aerospace Systems, which combines the

-76-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

former Integrated Systems and Space Technology segments;
    Electronic Systems; Information Systems, which combines the
    former Information Technology and Mission Systems segments;
    Shipbuilding and Technical Services. The creation of the
    Aerospace Systems and Information Systems segments strengthens
    alignment with customers, improves the company’s ability to
    execute on programs and win new business, and enhances cost
    competitiveness. This subsequent realignment is not reflected in
    any of the accompanying financial information.

Goodwill Impairment Charge –

The operating
    losses for the year ended December 31, 2008 at Space
    Technology and Shipbuilding reflect goodwill impairment charges
    of $570 million and $2,490 million, respectively. See
    Note 3.

-77-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Shipbuilding Earnings Charge Relating to LHD-8 Contract
    Performance

– LHD-8 is an amphibious assault ship
    under construction at one of the Gulf Coast shipyards. The LHD-8
    contract features significant enhancements compared with earlier
    ships of the class and will incorporate major new systems,
    including a gas turbine engine propulsion system, a new
    electrical generation and distribution system, and a centralized
    machinery control system administered over a fiber optic
    network. The LHD-8 contract is a fixed-price incentive contract,
    and a substantial portion of the performance margin on the
    contract was previously consumed by the impact from Hurricane
    Katrina in 2005 and a charge of $55 million in the second
    quarter of 2007. Lack of progress in LHD-8 on-board testing
    preparatory to sea trials prompted the company to undertake a
    comprehensive review of the program, including a detailed
    physical audit of the ship. From this review, management became
    aware in March 2008 of the need for substantial re-work on the
    ship, primarily in electrical cable installations. As a result,
    during the first quarter of 2008, the company recorded a pre-tax
    charge of $272 million for cost growth on the LHD-8
    contract and an additional $54 million, primarily for
    schedule impacts on other ships and impairment of purchased
    intangibles at the Gulf Coast shipyards. The LHD-8 program
    achieved several important risk retirement milestones toward its
    planned delivery date, and as a result $63 million of the
    first quarter 2008 charge was reversed.

Unallocated Expenses

– Unallocated expenses
    include the portion of corporate expenses not considered
    allowable or allocable under applicable U.S. Government
    Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) regulations and the Federal
    Acquisition Regulation, and therefore not allocated to the
    segments, for costs related to management and administration,
    legal, environmental, certain compensation and retiree benefits,
    and other expenses.

Net Pension Adjustment –

The net pension
    adjustment reflects the difference between pension expense
    determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and pension expense
    allocated to the operating segments determined in accordance
    with CAS.

Royalty Income Adjustment

– Royalty income is
    included in segment operating income and reclassified to other
    income for financial reporting purposes. The royalty income
    adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes
    $59 million related to patent infringement settlements at
    Electronics.

(LOSS)
    EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic (Loss) Earnings Per Share

– Basic (loss)
    earnings per share from continuing operations are calculated by
    dividing (loss) earnings from continuing operations available to
    common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of
    common stock outstanding during each period.

Diluted (Loss) Earnings Per Share

– For the
    year ended December 31, 2008, the potential dilutive effect
    of 7.1 million shares from stock options, stock awards, and
    the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock were excluded from
    the computation of weighted average diluted common shares
    outstanding as the shares would have had an anti-dilutive
    effect. Diluted earnings per share for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, include the dilutive effect of
    stock options and other stock awards granted to employees under
    stock-based compensation plans, and 6.4 million dilutive
    shares from the company’s mandatorily redeemable
    convertible preferred stock (see Note 4). The dilutive
    effect of these potential common stock instruments totaled
    12.6 million and 12.9 million shares for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The
    weighted-average diluted shares outstanding for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, exclude stock options to
    purchase approximately 2.1 million, 59 thousand and 8
    thousand shares, respectively, because such options have an
    exercise price in excess of the average market price of the
    company’s common stock during the year.

Share repurchases take place at management’s discretion or
    under pre-established non-discretionary programs from time to
    time, depending on market conditions, in the open market, and in
    privately negotiated transactions. The company retires its
    common stock upon repurchase and has not made any purchases of
    common stock other than in connection with these publicly
    announced repurchase programs.

Under certain of its share repurchase authorizations, the
    company has entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements
    with banks to repurchase shares of common stock. Under these
    agreements, shares were immediately borrowed by the bank and
    then sold to and canceled by the company. Subsequently, shares
    were purchased in the open market by the bank to settle its
    share borrowings. The ultimate cost of the company’s share
    repurchases under these agreements was subject to adjustment
    based on the actual cost of the shares subsequently purchased by
    the bank. If an additional amount was owed by the company upon
    settlement, the price adjustment could have been settled, at the
    company’s option, in cash or in shares of common stock. The
    final price adjustments under these agreements have been
    immaterial. No accelerated share repurchase agreements were
    utilized in connection with the 2008 repurchases shown above.

As of December 31, 2008, the company has authorized
    $945 million for share repurchases.

ACCOUNTS
    RECEIVABLE, NET

Unbilled amounts represent sales for which billings have not
    been presented to customers at year-end. These amounts are
    usually billed and collected within one year. Progress payments
    are received on a number of firm fixed-price contracts. Unbilled
    amounts are presented net of progress payments of
    $4.7 billion and $3.9 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Accounts receivable at December 31, 2008, are expected to
    be collected in 2009, except for approximately $225 million
    due in 2010 and $53 million due in 2011 and later.

GOODWILL
    AND OTHER PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill

Goodwill and other purchased intangible assets are included in
    the identifiable assets of the segment to which they have been
    assigned. Impairment tests are performed at least annually and
    more often as circumstances require. Any goodwill impairment, as
    well as the amortization of other purchased intangible assets,
    is charged against the respective segment’s operating
    income. The annual impairment test for all segments was
    performed as of November 30, 2008. In performing the
    goodwill impairment tests, the company uses a discounted cash
    flow approach corroborated by comparative market multiples,
    where appropriate, to determine the fair value of its
    businesses. After conducting its 2008 test, the company
    determined that goodwill at Space Technology was impaired by
    $570 million, and goodwill at Shipbuilding was impaired by
    $2,490 million, resulting in an aggregate goodwill
    impairment charge of $3,060 million that was recognized in
    the fourth quarter of 2008. The goodwill impairment charge is
    primarily driven by adverse equity market conditions and the
    resulting decrease in current market multiples and the
    company’s stock price as of November 30, 2008 (See
    Note 3).

Segment Realignment

– During the second quarter
    of 2008, the company transferred certain programs and assets,
    including goodwill of $505 million, from the missiles
    business in the Mission Systems segment to the Space Technology
    segment.

In January 2008, the Newport News and Ship Systems businesses
    were combined into a single operating segment called Northrop
    Grumman Shipbuilding. In addition, certain Electronics
    businesses were transferred to Mission Systems during the first
    quarter of 2008, along with goodwill of $47 million.

Fair Value Adjustments to Net Assets Acquired

–
    For 2008, the fair value adjustments were primarily due to the
    final settlement of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
    examination of the

1999-2002

TRW income tax returns (see Note 13) and purchase
    price allocation related to the 3001 acquisition (see

    amortization and are being amortized on a straight-line basis
    over an aggregate weighted-average period of 21 years.
    Aggregate amortization expense for 2008, 2007, and 2006, was
    $136 million, $132 million, and $134 million,
    respectively. The 2008 amount includes $19 million of
    additional amortization recorded in the first quarter of 2008
    associated with the LHD-8 and other Gulf Coast Shipbuilding

FAIR
    VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The company adopted the disclosure requirements of
    SFAS No. 157 –

Fair Value Measurements

(SFAS No. 157) effective January 1,
    2008. SFAS No. 157 clarifies the definition of fair
    value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, establishes
    a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair
    value and expands disclosures about the use of fair value
    measurements.

The valuation techniques required by SFAS No. 157 are
    based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs
    reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while
    unobservable inputs reflect internal market assumptions. These
    two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:

Level 1 – Quoted prices for identical instruments
    in active markets.

Level 2 –

Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted
    prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are
    not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are
    observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.

Level 3 – Significant inputs to the valuation
    model are unobservable.

The following section describes the valuation methodologies used
    by the company to measure its financial instruments at fair
    value.

Investments in Marketable Securities

– The
    company holds a portfolio of marketable securities, primarily
    consisting of equity and debt securities that are classified as
    either trading or

available-for-sale.

When available, quoted market prices are used to determine the
    fair value of marketable securities. Quotes from independent
    pricing vendors based on recent trading activity and other
    relevant information are used when quoted market prices are
    unavailable. As of December 31, 2008, there were marketable
    equity securities of $44 million included in prepaid
    expenses and other current assets and $180 million of
    marketable equity securities included in other long-term assets,
    all of which were considered Level 1. The total fair value
    of investments in marketable securities as of December 31,
    2007, was $258 million.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging
    activities

–  In order to manage its exposure to
    interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk, the
    company utilized the following derivative financial instruments,
    all of which were considered Level 2 instruments.

The company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to
    manage foreign currency exchange risk related to receipts from
    customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign
    currencies. Gains and losses from such transactions are included
    as contract costs. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the total
    fair value of foreign

-83-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

currency forward contracts outstanding was a net asset of
    $25 million and $4 million, respectively. In October
    2008, the company designated a portion of its forward contracts
    as cash flow hedges of the forecasted revenue and related
    expenses associated with a long term contract. Each reporting
    period these cash flow hedges, which extend to 2013, are tested
    for effectiveness using regression testing. For 2008, the change
    in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts and
    gains and losses associated with hedge ineffectiveness
    recognized in the consolidated statements of results was
    immaterial.

The company enters into interest rate swap agreements to benefit
    from floating interest rates as an offset to the fixed-rate
    characteristic of certain of its long-term debt instruments. At
    December 31, 2008, two interest rate swap agreements were
    in effect and accounted for as fair value hedges designed to
    convert fixed rates to floating rates. These interest rate swaps
    each hedge a $200 million notional amount of
    U.S. dollar fixed-rate debt, and mature on October 15,
    2009, and February 15, 2011, respectively. Any changes in
    the fair value of the swaps are offset by an equal and opposite
    change in the fair value of the hedged item; therefore, there is
    no net impact to the company’s reported consolidated
    results of operations. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    aggregate net fair value of the swaps was not material. The
    company may also enter into interest rate swap agreements to
    offset the variable-rate characteristics of certain
    variable-rate term loans which may be outstanding from time to
    time under the company’s credit facility (see Note 14).

In October 2008, the company entered into two forward-starting
    interest rate swaps with a notional value totaling
    $400 million. The company designated these swaps as cash
    flow hedges of future interest payments on $400 million of
    financing expected to occur in 2009. There was no hedge
    ineffectiveness as of December 31, 2008, on these cash flow
    hedges. The change in the fair value of these swaps from
    inception generated a pre-tax liability of $58 million at
    December 31, 2008.

The carrying amounts of other financial instruments not listed
    in the table below approximate fair value due to the short-term
    nature of these items.

Carrying amounts and the related estimated fair values of the
    company’s financial instruments not measured at fair value
    on a recurring basis at December 31 are as follows:

Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance Policies –

The company maintains whole life insurance policies on a
    group of executives for use as a funding source for deferred
    compensation arrangements. These policies are recorded at their
    cash surrender value as determined by the insurance carrier.
    Additionally, the company has split-dollar life insurance
    policies on former officers and executives from acquired
    businesses which are recorded at the lesser of their cash
    surrender value or premiums paid. The policies are utilized as a
    partial funding source for supplemental employee retirement
    plans and amounts associated with these policies are recorded in
    miscellaneous other assets in the consolidated statements of
    financial position.

Long-Term Debt

– The fair value of the
    long-term debt was calculated based on interest rates available
    for debt with terms and due dates similar to the company’s
    existing debt arrangements.

Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock

– The
    fair value of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock was
    calculated based on the closing market price quoted on the New
    York Stock Exchange each year end. As discussed in Note 4,
    all preferred stock was converted or redeemed as of
    April 4, 2008.

INCOME
    TAXES

The company’s effective tax rate on earnings from
    continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    was 33.9 percent (excluding the non-cash, non-deductible
    goodwill impairment charge of $3.1 billion at Shipbuilding
    and Space Technology) as compared with 32.9 percent and
    31.2 percent in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    company’s effective tax rates reflect tax credits,
    manufacturing deductions and the reversal of previously
    established expense provisions as a result of favorable
    settlements with the IRS. During 2007, the company reached a
    partial settlement agreement with the IRS regarding its audit of
    the company’s tax years ended December 31, 2001
    through 2003 and recognized $22 million of benefit upon
    settlement. During 2006, the company reached final approval with
    the IRS regarding its audit of the company’s B-2 program
    for the years ended December 31, 1997 through 2000 and
    recognized $48 million of benefit upon settlement.

Uncertain Tax Positions

– The company adopted
    the provisions of FIN 48 in 2007. As a result of the
    implementation of FIN 48, the company made a comprehensive
    review of its portfolio of uncertain tax positions

-85-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

in accordance with recognition standards established by the
    interpretation. As a result of this review, the company adjusted
    the estimated value of its uncertain tax positions on
    January 1, 2007, by recognizing additional liabilities
    totaling $66 million through a charge to retained earnings
    and reducing the carrying value of uncertain tax positions
    resulting from prior acquisitions by $63 million through a
    reduction to goodwill.

During the third quarter of 2008, the company reached a
    settlement with the IRS and the Congressional Joint Committee on
    Taxation (Joint Committee) with respect to IRS’ audit of
    the TRW tax returns for the years

1999-2002.

As a result of this settlement, the company reduced its
    liability for uncertain tax positions by $126 million
    (including accrued interest of $44 million),
    $95 million of which was recorded as a reduction of
    goodwill.

As of December 31, 2008, the estimated value of the
    company’s uncertain tax positions was a liability of
    $461 million, which includes accrued interest of
    $47 million. If the company’s positions are sustained
    by the taxing authority in favor of the company, the reversal of
    the entire balance would reduce the company’s effective tax
    rate.

The change in unrecognized tax benefits during 2008, excluding
    interest, is as follows:

In 2008, the company reached a tentative partial settlement
    agreement with IRS Appeals on substantially all of the remaining
    issues from the IRS’ examination of the company’s tax
    returns for the years ended

2001-2003.

This agreement is subject to review by the Joint Committee.
    Although the final outcome is not determinable until the Joint
    Committee completes its review during 2009, it is reasonably
    possible that a reduction to unrecognized tax benefits of up to
    $59 million may occur.

The company’s federal tax returns for the years 2004
    through 2006 are currently under examination by the IRS. In
    addition, open tax years related to state and foreign
    jurisdictions remain subject to examination but are not
    considered material.

Although the company believes it has adequately provided for all
    tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be
    greater than the company’s accrued position. Accordingly,
    additional provisions on federal, foreign and state tax related
    matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are
    made or the underlying matters are effectively settled or
    otherwise resolved.

During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    company recorded approximately $29 million and
    $14 million for tax-related interest and penalties within
    income tax expense, respectively.

Deferred Income Taxes

– Deferred income taxes
    reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
    carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
    reporting purposes and tax purposes. Such amounts are classified
    in the consolidated statements of financial position as current
    or noncurrent assets or liabilities based upon the
    classification of the related assets and liabilities.

Foreign Income –

As of December 31, 2008,
    the company had approximately $474 million of accumulated
    undistributed earnings generated by its foreign subsidiaries. No
    deferred tax liability has been recorded on these earnings since
    the company intends to permanently reinvest these earnings,
    thereby indefinitely postponing their remittance. Should these
    earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise,
    the distributions would be subject to U.S. federal income
    tax at the statutory rate of 35 percent, less foreign tax
    credits available to offset such distributions, if any. In
    addition, such distributions would be subject to withholding
    taxes in the various tax jurisdictions.

Tax Carryforwards

– At December 31, 2008,
    the company had approximately $33 million of capital loss
    carryforwards that were fully offset by valuation allowance. As
    noted above, approximately $346 million of the capital loss
    carryforward was reduced in the tentative settlement agreement
    with the IRS for its audit of the tax years

2001-2003.

The majority of the remaining capital loss carryforward,
    approximately $210 million, expired unutilized.

NOTES PAYABLE
    TO BANKS AND LONG-TERM DEBT

Lines of Credit

– The company has available
    uncommitted short-term credit lines in the form of money market
    facilities with several banks. The amount and conditions for
    borrowing under these credit lines depend on the availability
    and terms prevailing in the marketplace. No fees or compensating
    balances are required for these credit facilities.

Credit Facility

– The company has a revolving
    credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of
    $2 billion that matures on August 10, 2012. The credit
    facility permits the company to request additional lending
    commitments of up to $500 million from the lenders under
    the agreement or other eligible lenders under certain
    circumstances. The agreement provides for swingline loans and
    letters of credit as

sub-facilities

for the credit facilities provided for in the agreement.
    Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at various
    rates, including the London Interbank Offered Rate, adjusted
    based on the company’s credit rating, or an alternate base
    rate plus an incremental margin. The credit facility also
    requires a facility fee based on the daily aggregate amount of
    commitments (whether or not utilized) and the company’s
    credit rating level, and contains certain financial covenants
    relating to a maximum debt to capitalization ratio, and certain
    restrictions on additional asset liens. There was a maximum of
    $300 million and $350 million borrowed under this
    facility during 2008 and 2007, respectively, and there was no
    balance outstanding under this facility at December 31,
    2008, and 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the company was in
    compliance with all covenants.

Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue
    Bonds –

As of December 31, 2008, Shipbuilding
    had $200 million outstanding from the issuance of Gulf
    Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue Bonds issued by
    the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation. These bonds accrue
    interest at a fixed rate of 4.55 percent per annum (payable
    semi-annually), and repayment of principal and interest is
    guaranteed by the company. In accordance with the terms of the
    bonds, the proceeds have been used to finance the construction,
    reconstruction, and renovation of the company’s interest in
    certain ship manufacturing and repair facilities, or portions
    thereof, located in the state of Mississippi. As of
    December 31, 2008, the company had utilized approximately
    $200 million of the bond proceeds, and no amount was
    recorded in miscellaneous other assets as restricted cash in the
    consolidated statements of financial position. As of
    December 31, 2007, the company had utilized approximately
    $140 million of the bond proceeds, and $60 million was
    recorded in miscellaneous other assets as restricted cash in the
    consolidated statements of financial position.

LITIGATION

U.S. Government Investigations and
    Claims

– Departments and agencies of the
    U.S. Government have the authority to investigate various
    transactions and operations of the company, and the results of
    such investigations may lead to administrative, civil or
    criminal proceedings, the ultimate outcome of which could be
    fines, penalties, repayments or compensatory or treble damages.
    U.S. Government regulations provide that certain findings
    against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from
    future U.S. Government contracts or the loss of export
    privileges for a company or an operating division or
    subdivision. Suspension or debarment could have a material
    adverse effect on the company because of its reliance on
    government contracts.

As previously disclosed, in October 2005, the
    U.S. Department of Justice and a restricted
    U.S. Government customer apprised the company of potential
    substantial claims relating to certain microelectronic parts
    produced by the Space and Electronics Sector of former TRW Inc.,
    now a part of the company. In the third quarter of 2006, the
    company proposed to settle the claims and any associated matters
    and recognized a pre-tax charge of $112.5 million to cover
    the cost of the settlement proposal and associated investigative
    costs. The U.S. Government has advised the company that if
    continuing settlement discussions are not successful it will
    pursue its claims through litigation. On November 26, 2008,
    the U.S. Department of Justice filed a Notice of
    Intervention in a False Claims Act case that remains under seal
    in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of
    California. Because of the highly technical nature of the issues
    involved and their restricted status, because of the significant
    disagreement of the company with the allegations of the
    underlying qui tam complaint, and because of the significant
    disagreement between the company and the U.S. Government as
    to the U.S. Government’s theories of liability and
    damages (including a material difference between the
    U.S. Government’s damage theories and the
    company’s offer), final resolution of this matter could
    take a considerable amount of time, particularly if litigation
    should ensue. If the U.S. Government were to be ultimately
    successful on its theories of liability and damages, which could
    be trebled under the Federal False Claims Act, the effect upon
    the company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations, and cash flows would materially exceed the amount
    provided by the company. Based upon the information available to
    the company to date, the company believes that it has
    substantive defenses but can give no assurance that its views
    will prevail. Accordingly, the ultimate disposition of this
    matter cannot presently be determined.

As previously disclosed, in the second quarter of 2007, the
    U.S. Coast Guard issued a revocation of acceptance under
    the Deepwater Program for eight converted 123-foot patrol boats
    (the vessels) based on alleged “hull buckling and shaft
    alignment problems” and alleged “nonconforming topside
    equipment” on the vessels. The company submitted a written
    response that argued that the revocation of acceptance was
    improper, and in late

-89-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

December 2007, the Coast Guard advised Integrated Coast Guard
    Systems (the contractors’ joint venture for performing the
    Deepwater Program) that the Coast Guard is seeking
    $96.1 million from the Joint Venture as a result of the
    revocation of acceptance of the eight vessels delivered under
    the 123-foot conversion program. The majority of the costs
    associated with the 123-foot conversion effort are associated
    with the alleged structural deficiencies of the vessels, which
    were converted under contracts with the company and a
    subcontractor to the company. In May 2008, the Coast Guard
    advised the Joint Venture that the Coast Guard would support an
    investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice of the
    Joint Venture and its subcontractors instead of pursuing its
    $96.1 million claim independently. The Department of
    Justice had previously issued subpoenas related to the Deepwater
    Program, pursuant to which the company has provided responsive
    documents. The company recently learned that a civil False
    Claims Act complaint naming it as a defendant was filed under
    seal. The relationship between the allegations in the complaint
    and the U.S. Department of Justice’s investigation is
    unclear to the company. Based upon the information available to
    the company to date, the company believes that it has
    substantive defenses to any potential claims but can give no
    assurance that its views will prevail.

In August 2008, the company disclosed to the Antitrust Division
    of the U.S. Department of Justice possible violations of
    federal antitrust laws in connection with the bidding process
    for certain maintenance contracts at a military installation in
    California. In February 2009, the company and the Department of
    Justice signed an agreement admitting the company into the
    Corporate Leniency Program. As a result of the company’s
    acceptance into the Program, the company will be exempt from
    federal criminal prosecution and criminal fines relating to the
    matters the company reported to the Department of Justice if the
    company complies with certain conditions, including its
    continued cooperation with the government’s investigation
    and its agreement to make restitution if the government was
    harmed by the violations.

Based upon the available information regarding matters that are
    subject to U.S. Government investigations, other than as
    set out above, the company believes, but can give no assurance,
    that the outcome of any such matters would not have a material
    adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results
    of operations, or cash flows.

Litigation

– Various claims and legal
    proceedings arise in the ordinary course of business and are
    pending against the company and its properties. Based upon the
    information available, the company believes that the resolution
    of any of these various claims and legal proceedings would not
    have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows.

As previously disclosed, the U.S. District Court for the
    Central District of California consolidated two separately filed
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) lawsuits, which
    the plaintiffs seek to have certified as class actions, into the
    In Re Northrop Grumman Corporation ERISA Litigation. On
    August 7, 2007, the Court denied plaintiffs’ motion
    for class certification, and the plaintiffs appealed the
    Court’s decision on class certification to the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On
    October 11, 2007, the Ninth Circuit granted appellate
    review, which delayed the commencement of trial previously
    scheduled to begin January 22, 2008. The company believes
    that the outcome of these matters would not have a material
    adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results
    of operations, or cash flows.

Insurance Recovery

– Property damage from
    Hurricane Katrina is covered by the company’s comprehensive
    property insurance program. The insurance provider for coverage
    of property damage losses over $500 million, Factory Mutual
    Insurance Company (FM Global), has advised management of a
    disagreement regarding coverage for certain losses above
    $500 million. As a result, the company has taken legal
    action against the insurance provider as the company believes
    that its insurance policies are enforceable and intends to
    pursue all of its available rights and remedies. In August 2007,
    the district court in which the litigation is pending issued an
    order finding that the excess insurance policy provided coverage
    for the company’s Katrina related loss. In November 2007,
    FM Global filed a notice of appeal of the district court’s
    order. On August 14, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals
    for the Ninth Circuit reversed the earlier summary judgment
    order in favor of the company, holding that the FM excess policy
    unambiguously excludes damage from the storm surge caused by
    Hurricane Katrina under its “Flood” exclusion. The
    Court of Appeals remanded the case to the district court to
    determine whether

-90-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

the California efficient proximate cause doctrine affords the
    company coverage under the policy even if the Flood exclusion of
    the policy is unambiguous. The company filed a Petition for
    Rehearing En Banc, or in the Alternative, For Panel Rehearing
    with the Court of Appeals on August 27, 2008. On
    January 6, 2009, the Court of Appeals ordered FM Global to
    respond to the Petition for Rehearing by January 30, 2009.
    FM Global filed its opposition to the Petition for Rehearing and
    the company now awaits the Court of Appeal’s decision.
    Based on the current status of the assessment and claim process,
    no assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome of this
    matter. No receivable has been recognized by the company in the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements for insurance
    recoveries from FM Global.

Provisions for Legal & Investigative
    Matters

– Litigation accruals are recorded as
    charges to earnings when management, after taking into
    consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter,
    including any settlement offers, has determined that it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate resolution of
    any exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as
    further facts and circumstances become known.

16.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Contract Performance Contingencies

– Contract
    profit margins may include estimates of revenues not
    contractually agreed to between the customer and the company for
    matters such as contract changes, negotiated settlements, claims
    and requests for equitable adjustment for previously
    unanticipated contract costs. These estimates are based upon
    management’s best assessment of the underlying causal
    events and circumstances, and are included in determining
    contract profit margins to the extent of expected recovery based
    on contractual entitlements and the probability of successful
    negotiation with the customer. As of December 31, 2008, the
    amounts related to the aforementioned items are not material
    individually or in the aggregate.

Environmental Matters

– In accordance with
    company policy on environmental remediation, the estimated cost
    to complete remediation has been accrued where it is probable
    that the company will incur such costs in the future to address
    environmental impacts at currently or formerly owned or leased
    operating facilities, or at sites where it has been named a
    Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) by the Environmental
    Protection Agency, or similarly designated by other
    environmental agencies. To assess the potential impact on the
    company’s consolidated financial statements, management
    estimates the total reasonably possible remediation costs that
    could be incurred by the company, taking into account currently
    available facts on each site as well as the current state of
    technology and prior experience in remediating contaminated
    sites. These estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted to
    reflect changes in facts and technical and legal circumstances.
    Management estimates that as of December 31, 2008, the
    range of reasonably possible future costs for environmental
    remediation sites is $186 million to $279 million, of
    which $231 million is accrued in other current liabilities.
    Factors that could result in changes to the company’s
    estimates include: modification of planned remedial actions,
    increases or decreases in the estimated time required to
    remediate, discovery of more extensive contamination than
    anticipated, changes in laws and regulations affecting
    remediation requirements, and improvements in remediation
    technology. Should other PRPs not pay their allocable share of
    remediation costs, the company may have to incur costs in
    addition to those already estimated and accrued. Although
    management cannot predict whether new information gained as
    projects progress will materially affect the estimated liability
    accrued, management does not anticipate that future remediation
    expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the
    company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows.

Hurricane Impacts –

During the third quarter of
    2008, the Gulf Coast shipyards were affected by Hurricane
    Gustav. As a result of the storm, the Gulf Coast shipyards
    experienced a shut-down for several days, and a resulting minor
    delay in ship construction throughout the yards; however the
    storm caused no significant physical damage to the yards.
    Shipbuilding’s sales and operating income in 2008 were
    reduced by approximately $100 million and $13 million,
    respectively, due to lost production and additional costs
    resulting from the shut-down.

Also during the third quarter of 2008, a subcontractor’s
    operations in Texas were severely impacted by Hurricane Ike. The
    subcontractor produces compartments for two of the LPD
    amphibious transport dock ships under

-91-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

construction at the Gulf Coast shipyards. As a result of the
    delays and cost growth caused by the subcontractor’s
    production delays, Shipbuilding’s 2008 operating income was
    reduced by approximately $23 million.

In August 2005, the company’s Gulf Coast operations were
    significantly impacted by Hurricane Katrina and the
    company’s shipyards in Louisiana and Mississippi sustained
    significant windstorm damage from the hurricane. As a result of
    the storm, the company incurred costs to replace or repair
    destroyed or damaged assets, suffered losses under its
    contracts, and incurred substantial costs to clean up and
    recover its operations. As of the date of the storm, the company
    had a comprehensive insurance program that provided coverage
    for, among other things, property damage, business interruption
    impact on net profitability, and costs associated with

clean-up

and
    recovery. The company has recovered a portion of its Hurricane
    Katrina claim and expects that its remaining claim will be
    resolved separately with the two remaining insurers, including
    FM Global (See Note 15).

The company has full entitlement to any insurance recoveries
    related to business interruption impacts on net profitability
    resulting from these hurricanes. However, because of
    uncertainties concerning the ultimate determination of
    recoveries related to business interruption claims, in
    accordance with company policy no such amounts are recognized
    until they are resolved with the insurers. Furthermore, due to
    the uncertainties with respect to the company’s
    disagreement with FM Global in relation to the Hurricane Katrina
    claim, no receivables have been recognized by the company in the
    accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for
    insurance recoveries from FM Global.

In accordance with U.S. Government cost accounting
    regulations affecting the majority of the company’s
    contracts, the cost of insurance premiums for property damage
    and business interruption coverage, other than “coverage of
    profit”, is an allowable expense that may be charged to
    long-term contracts. Because a substantial portion of long-term
    contracts at the shipyards are flexibly-priced, the government
    customer would benefit from a portion of insurance recoveries in
    excess of the net book value of damaged assets and

clean-up

and
    restoration costs paid by the company. When such insurance
    recoveries occur, the company is obligated to return a portion
    of these amounts to the government.

Co-Operative Agreements

– In 2003, Shipbuilding
    executed agreements with the states of Mississippi and Louisiana
    whereby Shipbuilding leases facility improvements and equipment
    from Mississippi and from a non-profit economic development
    corporation in Louisiana in exchange for certain commitments by
    Shipbuilding to these states. As of December 31, 2008,
    Shipbuilding has fully met its obligations under the Mississippi
    agreement and has met all but one requirement under the
    Louisiana agreement. Failure by Shipbuilding to meet the
    remaining Louisiana commitment would result in reimbursement by
    Shipbuilding to Louisiana in accordance with the agreement. As
    of December 31, 2008, Shipbuilding expects that the
    remaining commitment under the Louisiana agreement will be met
    based on its most recent business plan.

Financial Arrangements

– In the ordinary course
    of business, the company uses standby letters of credit and
    guarantees issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued by
    insurance companies principally to guarantee the performance on
    certain contracts and to support the company’s self-insured
    workers’ compensation plans. At December 31, 2008,
    there were $489 million of unused stand-by letters of
    credit, $134 million of bank guarantees, and
    $459 million of surety bonds outstanding.

The company has also guaranteed a $200 million loan made to
    Shipbuilding in connection with the Gulf Opportunity Zone
    Industrial Revenue Bonds issued in December 2006. Under the loan
    agreement the company guaranteed Shipbuilding’s repayment
    of the principal and interest to the Trustee. The company also
    guaranteed payment of the principal and interest by the Trustee
    to the underlying bondholders. See Note 14.

Indemnifications

– The company has retained
    certain warranty, environmental, income tax, and other potential
    liabilities in connection with certain divestitures. The
    settlement of these liabilities is not expected to have a
    material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

U.S. Government Claims

– During the second
    quarter of 2006, the U.S. Government advised the company of
    claims and penalties concerning certain potential disallowed
    costs. The parties are engaged in discussions to

-92-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

enable the company to evaluate the merits of these claims as
    well as to assess the amounts being claimed. The company does
    not believe, but can give no assurance, that the outcome of any
    such matters would have a material adverse effect on its
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows.

Operating Leases

– Rental expense for operating
    leases, excluding discontinued operations, was $584 million
    in 2008, $584 million in 2007, and $548 million in
    2006. These amounts are net of immaterial amounts of sublease
    rental income. Minimum rental commitments under long-term
    noncancellable operating leases as of December 31, 2008,
    total approximately $2.1 billion, which are payable as
    follows: 2009 – $459 million; 2010 –
    $366 million; 2011 – $270 million;
    2012 – $227 million; 2013 –
    $176 million; and thereafter – $562 million.

Related Party Transactions

– For all periods
    presented, the company had no material related party
    transactions.

RETIREMENT
    BENEFITS

Plan
    Descriptions

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

– The company
    sponsors several defined benefit pension plans in the
    U.S. covering the majority of its employees. Pension
    benefits for most employees are based on the employee’s
    years of service and compensation. It is the policy of the
    company to fund at least the minimum amount required for all
    qualified plans, using actuarial cost methods and assumptions
    acceptable under U.S. Government regulations, by making
    payments into benefit trusts separate from the company. The
    pension benefit for most employees is based upon criteria
    whereby employees earn age and service points over their
    employment period.

Defined Contribution Plans

– The company also
    sponsors 401(k) defined contribution plans in which most
    employees are eligible to participate, as well as certain
    bargaining unit employees. Company contributions for most plans
    are based on a cash matching of employee contributions up to
    4 percent of compensation. Certain hourly employees are
    covered under a target benefit plan. The company also
    participates in a multiemployer plan for certain of the
    company’s union employees. In addition to the 401(k)
    defined contribution benefit, non-union represented employees
    hired after June 30, 2008, are eligible to participate in a
    defined contribution program in lieu of a defined benefit
    pension plan. The company’s contributions to these defined
    contribution plans for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007, and 2006, were $311 million, $294 million, and
    $266 million, respectively.

Non-U.S. Benefit

Plans –

The company sponsors several benefit plans
    for

non-U.S. employees.

These plans are designed to provide benefits appropriate to
    local practice and in accordance with local regulations. Some of
    these plans are funded using benefit trusts separate from the
    company.

Medical and Life Benefits

– The company
    provides a portion of the costs for certain health care and life
    insurance benefits for a substantial number of its active and
    retired employees. Covered employees achieve eligibility to
    participate in these contributory plans upon retirement from
    active service if they meet specified age and years of service
    requirements. Qualifying dependents are also eligible for
    medical coverage. Approximately 65 percent of the
    company’s current retirees participate in the medical
    plans. The company reserves the right to amend or terminate the
    plans at any time. In November 2006, the company adopted plan
    amendments and communicated to plan participants that it would
    cap the amount of its contributions to substantially all of its
    remaining post retirement medical and life benefit plans that
    were previously not subject to limits on the company’s
    contributions.

In addition to a medical inflation cost-sharing feature, the
    plans also have provisions for deductibles, co-payments,
    coinsurance percentages,

out-of-pocket

limits, conformance to a schedule of reasonable fees, the use of
    managed care providers, and maintenance of benefits with other
    plans. The plans also provide for a Medicare carve-out, and a
    maximum lifetime benefit of $2 million per covered
    individual. Subsequent to January 1, 2005 (or earlier at
    some segments), newly hired employees are not eligible for post
    employment medical and life benefits.

The effect of the Medicare prescription drug subsidy from the
    Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
    2003 to reduce the company’s net periodic postretirement
    benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation

The discount rate is generally based on the yield on
    high-quality corporate fixed-income investments. At the end of
    each year, the discount rate is primarily determined using the
    results of bond yield curve models based on a portfolio of high
    quality bonds matching the notional cash inflows with the
    expected benefit payments for each significant benefit plan.

The assumptions used for pension benefits are consistent with
    those used for retiree medical and life insurance benefits. The
    long-term rate of return on plan assets used for the medical and
    life benefits are reduced to allow

for the impact of tax on expected returns as, unlike the pension
    trust, the earnings of certain Voluntary Employee Beneficiary
    Association (VEBA) trusts are taxable.

Through consultation with investment advisors, expected
    long-term returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset
    classes were developed. Several factors were considered,
    including survey of investment managers’ expectations,
    current market data such as yields/price-earnings ratios, and
    historical market returns over long periods. Using policy target
    allocation percentages and the asset class expected returns, a
    weighted-average expected return was calculated.

    ultimate health care cost trend rates would have the following

Plan assets are invested in various asset classes that are
    expected to produce a sufficient level of diversification and
    investment return over the long term. The investment goals are
    (1) to exceed the assumed actuarial rate of return over the
    long term within reasonable and prudent levels of risk, and
    (2) to preserve the real purchasing power of assets to meet
    future obligations. Liability studies are conducted on a regular
    basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an
    objective to balance risk. Risk targets are established and
    monitored against acceptable ranges.

All investment policies and procedures are designed to ensure
    that the plans’ investments are in compliance with ERISA.
    Guidelines are established defining permitted investments within
    each asset class. Derivatives are used for transitioning assets,
    asset class rebalancing, managing currency risk, and for
    management of fixed income and alternative investments. The
    investment policies for most of the pension plans were changed
    during 2008 and require that the asset allocation be maintained
    within the following ranges as of December 31, 2008:

Asset Allocation Ranges

At December 31, 2008, and 2007, plan assets included
    investments with non-readily determinable fair values comprised
    primarily of real estate, private equity, and hedge funds,
    totaling $4.4 billion and $4.1 billion,

-97-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

respectively. For these assets, estimates of fair value are
    determined using the best information available. At
    December 31, 2008, and 2007, the pension and health and
    welfare trusts did not hold any Northrop Grumman common stock.

In 2009, the company expects to contribute the required minimum
    funding level of approximately $126 million to its pension
    plans and approximately $178 million to its other
    postretirement benefit plans and also expects to make additional
    voluntary pension contributions of approximately
    $250 million in each of the first and third quarters.
    During 2008 and 2007, the company made voluntary pension
    contributions of $200 million in each year.

It is not expected that any assets will be returned to the
    company from the benefit plans during 2009.

STOCK
    COMPENSATION PLANS

Plan
    Descriptions

At December 31, 2008, Northrop Grumman had stock-based
    compensation awards outstanding under the following plans: the
    2001 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan (2001 LTISP), the 1993
    Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan (1993 LTISP), both applicable to
    employees, and the 1993 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors
    (1993 SPND) and 1995 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (1995
    SPND) as amended. All of these plans were approved by the
    company’s shareholders. The company has historically issued
    new shares to satisfy award grants.

Employee Plans

– The 2001 LTISP and the 1993
    LTISP permit grants to key employees of three general types of
    stock incentive awards: stock options, stock appreciation rights
    (SARs), and stock awards. Each stock option grant is made with
    an exercise price either at the closing price of the stock on
    the date of grant (market options) or at a premium over the
    closing price of the stock on the date of grant (premium
    options). Outstanding stock options granted prior to 2008
    generally vest in 25 percent increments over four years
    from the grant date under the 2001 LTISP and in years two to
    five under the 1993 LTISP, and grants outstanding expire ten
    years after the grant date. Stock options granted in 2008 vest
    in 33 percent increments over three years from the grant
    date, and grants outstanding expire seven years after the grant
    date. No SARs have been granted under either of the LTISPs.
    Stock awards, in the form of restricted performance stock rights
    and restricted stock rights, are granted to key employees
    without payment to the company.

Under the 2001 LTISP, recipients of restricted performance stock
    rights earn shares of stock, based on financial metrics
    determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with the
    plan. For grants prior to 2007, if the objectives have not been
    met at the end of the applicable performance period, up to
    100 percent of the original grant for the eight highest
    compensated employees and up to 70 percent of the original
    grant for all other recipients will be forfeited. If the
    financial metrics are met or exceeded during the performance
    period, all recipients can earn up to 150 percent of the
    original grant. Beginning in 2007, all members of the Corporate
    Policy Council could forfeit up to 100 percent of the
    original 2007 grant, and all recipients could earn up to

-98-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

200 percent of the original 2007 grant. Restricted stock
    rights issued under either plan generally vest after three
    years. Termination of employment can result in forfeiture of
    some or all of the benefits extended. Of the 50 million
    shares approved for issuance under the 2001 LTISP, approximately
    16 million shares were available for future grants as of
    December 31, 2008.

Non-Employee Plans

– Under the 1993 SPND, half
    of the retainer fee earned by each director must be deferred
    into a stock unit account. In addition, directors may defer
    payment of all or part of the remaining retainer fee, which is
    placed in a stock unit account until the conclusion of board
    service. The 1995 SPND provided for annual stock option grants.
    Effective June 1, 2005, no new grants have been issued from
    this plan. The 1995 SPND was amended in May 2007 to permit
    payment of the stock unit portion of the retainer fee described
    above. Each grant of stock options under the 1995 SPND was made
    at the closing market price on the date of the grant, was
    immediately exercisable, and expires ten years after the grant
    date. At December 31, 2008, approximately
    315,000 shares were available for future grants under the
    1995 SPND and 2,427 shares were available for future use
    under the 1993 SPND.

Compensation
    Expense

Total stock-based compensation for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, was $111 million,
    $196 million, and $202 million, respectively, of which
    $15 million, $12 million, and $11 million related
    to Stock Options and $96 million, $184 million, and
    $191 million, related to Stock Awards, respectively. Tax
    benefits recognized in the consolidated statements of operations
    and comprehensive (loss) income for stock-based compensation
    during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006,
    were $44 million, $77 million, and $71 million,
    respectively. In addition, the company realized tax benefits of
    $26 million from the exercise of Stock Options and
    $99 million from the issuance of Stock Awards in 2008.

Stock
    Options

The fair value of each of the company’s Stock Option awards
    is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the
    table below. The fair value of the company’s Stock Option
    awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting
    period of the options, which is generally three to four years.
    Expected volatility is based on an average of
    (1) historical volatility of the company’s stock and
    (2) implied volatility from traded options on the
    company’s stock. The risk-free rate for periods within the
    contractual life of the Stock Option award is based on the yield
    curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the
    award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of
    the award. The company uses historical data to estimate future
    forfeitures. The expected term of awards granted is derived from
    historical experience under the company’s stock-based
    compensation plans and represents the period of time that awards
    granted are expected to be outstanding.

The significant weighted-average assumptions relating to the
    valuation of the company’s Stock Options for the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, was as follows:

    2006, was $15, $15, and $17, per share, respectively.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, was
    $66 million, $153 million, and $149 million,
    respectively. Intrinsic value is measured using the fair market
    value at the date of exercise (for options exercised) or at
    December 31, 2008 (for outstanding options), less the
    applicable exercise price.

Stock Awards

– Compensation expense for Stock
    Awards is measured at the grant date based on fair value and
    recognized over the vesting period. The fair value of Stock
    Awards is determined based on the closing market price of the
    company’s common stock on the grant date. For purposes of
    measuring compensation expense, the amount of shares ultimately
    expected to vest is estimated at each reporting date based on
    management’s expectations regarding the relevant
    performance criteria. In the table below, the share adjustment
    resulting from the final performance measure is considered
    granted in the period that the related grant is vested. During
    the year ended December 31, 2008, 2.9 million shares
    of common stock were issued to employees in settlement of prior
    year Stock Awards that were fully vested, with a total value
    upon issuance of $233 million and a grant date fair value
    of $155 million. In 2009, the company expects to issue to
    employees an additional 2.5 million shares of common stock
    that were vested in 2008, with a grant date fair value of
    $162 million. During the year ended December 31, 2007,
    2.6 million shares of common stock were issued to employees
    in settlement of prior year stock awards that were fully vested,
    with a total value upon issuance of $199 million and a
    grant date fair value of $125 million. During the year
    ended December 31, 2006, 2.4 million shares were
    issued to employees in settlement of prior year Stock Awards
    that were fully vested, with a total value upon issuance of
    $143 million and a grant date fair value of
    $133 million. There were 3.6 and 4.2 million Stock
    Awards granted for the years ended December 31, 2007, and
    2006 with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $63 and
    $63 per share, respectively.

    $138 million relates to Stock Awards. These amounts are
    expected to be charged to expense over a weighted-average period
    of 1.4 years.

UNAUDITED
    SELECTED QUARTERLY DATA

Unaudited quarterly financial results are set forth in the
    following tables. The financial results for all periods
    presented have been revised to reflect the various business
    dispositions that occurred during the 2007 and 2008 fiscal years
    (see Note 6 for further details). The company’s common
    stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (trading symbol
    NOC). This unaudited quarterly information is labeled using a
    calendar convention; that is, first quarter is consistently
    labeled as ended on March 31, second quarter as ended on
    June 30, and third quarter as ended on September 30.
    It is the company’s long-standing practice to establish
    actual interim closing dates using a “fiscal”
    calendar, which requires the businesses to close their books on
    a Friday, in order to normalize the potentially disruptive
    effects of quarterly closings on business processes. The effects
    of this practice only exist within a reporting year.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Northrop Grumman Corporation (the company)
    prepared and is responsible for the consolidated financial
    statements and all related financial information contained in
    this Annual Report. This responsibility includes establishing
    and maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting. The company’s internal control over financial
    reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
    the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America.

To comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the
    Sarbanes – Oxley Act of 2002, the company designed and
    implemented a structured and comprehensive assessment process to
    evaluate its internal control over financial reporting across
    the enterprise. The assessment of the effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control –
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Because of its
    inherent limitations, a system of internal control over
    financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and
    may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management regularly
    monitors its internal control over financial reporting, and
    actions are taken to correct any deficiencies as they are
    identified. Based on its assessment, management has concluded
    that the company’s internal control over financial
    reporting is effective as of December 31, 2008.

Deloitte & Touche LLP issued an attestation report
    dated February 10, 2009, concerning the company’s
    internal control over financial reporting, which is contained in
    this Annual Report. The company’s consolidated financial
    statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    have been audited by the independent registered public
    accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States).

NORTHROP

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL
    CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Northrop Grumman Corporation

Los Angeles, California

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    Northrop Grumman Corporation and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2008, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 of
    the Company and our report dated February 10, 2009
    expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements
    and the financial statement schedule.

Corporate
    Governance

On September 17, 2008, the company’s Board of
    Directors approved amendments to the bylaws of the company,
    including amendments to Section 2.06. These amendments had
    the effect of changing the procedures by which security holders
    may recommend nominees to the company’s Board of Directors
    by:

n

Shortening the advance notice required for such nominations,
    such that, to be timely, a stockholder’s notice of a
    nomination must be received by the company’s secretary not
    less than 90 or more than 120 days prior to the one-year
    anniversary of the date on which the company first mailed its
    proxy materials for the preceding year’s annual meeting of
    stockholders; provided, however, that if the annual meeting is
    convened more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than
    30 days after the anniversary of the preceding year’s
    annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be
    so received not later than the close of business on the later of
    (i) the 135th day before such annual meeting or
    (ii) the 10th day following the day on which public
    announcement of the date of such meeting is first made;

n

Requiring a stockholder to update certain information included
    in a notice of nomination so that such information is
    supplemented by such stockholder or beneficial owner, as the
    case may be, not later than 10 days after the record date
    for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date;

n

Requiring that a stockholder’s notice provide any other
    information relating to the stockholder or beneficial owner, as
    applicable, that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy
    statement or other filing required to be made in connection with
    solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal

and/or

for
    the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to
    Section 14 of the Exchange Act; and

n

Requiring that, in the case of a special meeting held for the
    purpose of electing members of the company’s Board of
    Directors, the written notice required for nominations by
    stockholders be received by the company’s secretary not
    later than the close of business on the later of (i) the
    135th day prior to such special meeting or (ii) the
    10th day following the day on which public announcement is
    first made of the date of the special meeting and of the
    nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at
    such meeting.

The amendments also provide that in no event shall an
    adjournment of a special meeting commence a new time period for
    the giving of a record stockholder’s notice.

The foregoing description is a summary of the amendments to
    Section 2.06 of the bylaws, which is qualified in its
    entirety by reference to the bylaws, as amended, filed as
    Exhibit 3(b) to this report on
