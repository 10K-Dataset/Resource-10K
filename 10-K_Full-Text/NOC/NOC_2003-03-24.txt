NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

PART I

Item 1.

Business

Originally formed in California in 1939, Northrop Corporation was
reincorporated in Delaware in 1985. In 1994 the company purchased the outstanding common stock of Grumman Corporation and, effective May 18, 1994, Northrop Corporation was renamed Northrop Grumman Corporation (the company). On April 2, 2001, NNG,
Inc., a newly formed Delaware holding company, exchanged its common shares for all of the outstanding Northrop Grumman Corporation common shares on a one-for-one basis, through a merger in which Northrop Grumman Corporation became a subsidiary of
NNG, Inc. In connection with this merger, NNG, Inc. changed its name to Northrop Grumman Corporation and the former Northrop Grumman Corporation changed its name to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (Northrop Systems).

In April 2001, the company purchased approximately 97 percent of the common stock and approximately 59 percent of the preferred stock
of Litton Industries, Inc. (Litton). The company issued 13,000,000 shares of its common stock and 3,500,000 shares of its preferred stock and paid cash for the balance of the Litton shares. In May and June 2001, the company acquired all of the
remaining shares of Litton common and preferred stock for cash.

In November 2001, pursuant to a tender offer that expired on
November 29, 2001, the company purchased approximately 80.7 percent of the outstanding shares of Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. (Newport News). For the year ended December 31, 2001, the company accounted for the remaining 19.3 percent of Newport
News common shares as minority interest. On January 18, 2002, the company acquired the remaining 19.3 percent of Newport News shares not purchased in the tender offer.

On December 11, 2002, the company issued 69.4 million shares in exchange for all outstanding shares of TRW Inc. The company completed the sale of TRW’s Automotive business (Auto) to The
Blackstone Group on February 28, 2003. The company received approximately $4.7 billion, comprised of $3.9 billion in cash and debt retained by Auto, a $600 million payment-in-kind note and a 19.6 percent investment in the new enterprise. Cash
proceeds from the sale, along with cash received from completion of the TRW acquisition will be used primarily to pay down debt. In connection with the acquisition of TRW, the company entered into a formal stipulation and consent decree (Final
Judgment) with the United States Department of Justice that was filed in the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia on December 11, 2002. Key provisions of the consent decree are intended to assure that the merger will not impede fair and
open competition related to certain electronic satellite payloads. The consent decree does not require the divestiture of any businesses and will permit the company to operate its businesses and those of TRW as planned. The retained portions of TRW
represent the new Mission Systems and Space Technology sectors discussed more fully herein. Additional information describing the aforementioned mergers and acquisitions is contained in the “Acquisitions” footnote to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.

The company operates in seven business sectors: Electronic Systems, Newport News,
Ship Systems, Information Technology, Integrated Systems, Mission Systems and Space Technology. For financial reporting purposes the Electronic Systems, Information Technology, Integrated Systems, Mission Systems and Space Technology sectors are
each reportable segments. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131

– Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

, Newport News and Ship Systems results are
aggregated and reported as the Ships segment.

In 2002, the company decided to sell the majority of the businesses comprising
its Component Technologies operating sector, and also sold two of the businesses in its Electronic Systems sector, Ruggedized Displays and Electron Devices. These businesses, Auto and the aerostructures business sold in 2000 are reported as
discontinued operations. Additional information is contained in the “Dispositions and Discontinued Operations” footnote to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.

Item 3.    Legal
Proceedings

Various claims and legal
proceedings arise in the ordinary course of business and are pending against the company and its properties. Based upon the information available, the company does not believe that the resolution of any of these proceedings will have a material
adverse affect upon its operations or financial condition.

Departments and agencies of the U.S. Government have the
authority to investigate various transactions and operations of the company and the results of such investigations may lead to administrative, civil or criminal proceedings, the ultimate outcome of which could be fines, penalties, repayments,
compensatory or treble damages. U.S. Government regulations provide that certain findings against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from future U.S. Government contracts or the loss of export privileges for a company or an operating
division or subdivision. Suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company because of its

reliance on government contracts. Based on available information, the company does not believe, but can give no assurance,
that any matter resulting from a U.S. Government investigation would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition. Matters described below include cases in which the U.S. Government is a party. The company is
unable to predict whether or not adverse decisions in these matters would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition.

As previously reported, in October 1999

in U.S. ex rel. Jordan v. Northrop Grumman Corporation

, the company was served with a fifth amended complaint. The action was filed by the government in the
United States District Court of the Central District of California in May 1995. The complaint alleges that the company violated the civil False Claims Act by knowingly supplying BQM-74C aerial target drones that contained various defective
components between 1988 and 1998. The government seeks to recover damages up to approximately $210 million plus penalties under theories of fraud, payment by mistake, unjust enrichment, breach of warranty and breach of contract. Damages awarded
pursuant to the False Claims Act may be trebled by the court. The company denies the allegations and intends to vigorously defend this matter. Trial is set for April 1, 2003.

As previously reported, in August 1992 in U.S. ex rel. Rex Robinson v. Northrop Grumman Corporation, in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Illinois unsealed a complaint brought by four individuals in the name of the United States of America. The action was filed on August 10, 1989, seeking damages under the

qui

tam

provision of the
civil False Claims Act. On July 28, 1992, the government declined to intervene in this action. Plaintiffs seek damages of approximately $113 million, plus penalties. Damages under the False Claims Act can be trebled. In 2001, the Civil Division of
the U.S. Attorney’s Office filed a motion to intervene in the action, which motion was granted on October 12, 2001. The company denies the allegations and intends to vigorously defend the action.

During 1996, in U.S. ex rel. Bagley v. TRW Inc., the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) advised TRW Inc. (TRW) that it had been named as a
defendant in lawsuits brought by a former employee originally filed under seal in 1994 and 1995 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California under the

qui

tam

provisions of the civil False
Claims Act. The DOJ subsequently advised that it would intervene in the litigation. In a consolidated complaint filed jointly by the former employee and the DOJ, it is alleged that TRW misclassified various costs and improperly charged those costs
to certain of its federal contracts, that the United States has incurred substantial damages, and that TRW is liable for approximately $56 million in single damages, subject to trebling, plus penalties, post-judgment interest, costs (including
attorneys’ fees) and “all other proper relief.” All substantive allegations against TRW have been denied in its answer to the consolidated complaint. The company denies the allegations and intends to vigorously defend this matter.
Trial is scheduled for November 2003.

On February 3, 2003, the Department of Justice filed a civil False Claims Act case
against Newport News Shipbuilding, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in U.S. v. Newport News Shipbuilding, Inc. The government seeks single damages in an amount in excess of $72 million, plus penalties,
costs and interest. Damages may be trebled under the False Claims Act. The complaint alleges that the company improperly charged certain independent research and development costs to its government contracts with respect to the years 1994 through
1999. The company denies the allegations and intends to vigorously defend the matter.

The putative class action lawsuits
filed against TRW relating to the company’s then-proposed offer to acquire TRW, reported in TRW’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2002, have been dismissed with

-9-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

prejudice. The putative class action lawsuit filed against TRW on behalf of a proposed class of TRW shareholders in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Ohio was dismissed on October 3, 2002. The two putative class action lawsuits filed against TRW on behalf of a proposed class of TRW shareholders in Common Pleas Court, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, were
dismissed on December 2, 2002.

In July and August 1998, three shareholder derivative lawsuits, respectively encaptioned
Zabielski v. Kent Kresa, et al., Harbor Finance Partners v. Kent Kresa, et al., and Clarren v. Kent Kresa, et al., were filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of Los Angeles. These lawsuits each contain similar allegations that the
directors of the company and certain of its officers breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the shareholder vote approving the proposed acquisition of the company by Lockheed Martin Corporation, and that certain defendants engaged in
stock trades in violation of federal and state securities laws. The lawsuits are purportedly brought on the company’s behalf and do not seek relief against the company. On January 31, 2001, the State Court dismissed these actions with prejudice
and plaintiffs subsequently filed a timely appeal. Oral argument took place on February 18, 2003, and the matter stands submitted. The defendants deny the allegations made in these actions and intend to vigorously defend the actions.

Environmental Matters

On December 18, 2000, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) delivered to the Ingalls subsidiary of Litton, a notice of violation
alleging use of non-compliant coatings, opacity violations and VOC emissions violations. The MDEQ subsequently requested that Ingalls, now named Northrop Grumman Ship Systems, Inc., perform an air permit compliance review. In the course of
negotiations with respect to the review and required corrective actions the MDEQ has advised the company that it will seek penalties in excess of $100,000 in connection with these matters.

On March 13, 2002, Lucas Western Inc. received written notice from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) that
certain alleged violations of the Environmental Conservation Law of New York State by the Utica facility operated by Lucas Western had been referred for enforcement action. The alleged violations include discharge of pollutants to waters of the
State without a permit and the discharge of material to the waters of the State in contravention of established water quality standards. The DEC is seeking payment of a penalty as well as a compliance plan for the elimination of such alleged
discharges, including confirmatory sampling and sampling of any sediments and soil excavated during removal of the discharge. Lucas Western Inc. became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the company upon the acquisition of TRW Inc. in the fourth
quarter of 2002. The company believes the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Other Matters

The Company continues to cooperate with the previously disclosed SEC investigation pertaining to alleged failures to update disclosures in the joint proxy statement and prospectus issued by Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin
Corporation on January 22, 1998 in connection with a meeting of Northrop Grumman’s shareholders to approve the then-proposed (but subsequently abandoned) merger of the two companies.

Like many other industrial companies in recent years, and as a result of acquisition activities, the company is a defendant in lawsuits
alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos integrated into its premises and certain historical products. The company no longer incorporates asbestos in any currently manufactured products. Many of these claims have been dismissed
with no payment and the remaining resolved claims have involved amounts that were not material either singly or in the aggregate. Based on the information available to the company as of the date of filing of this report, the company does not believe
that disposition of any or all of these matters would have a material adverse effect upon it.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Company’s Financial Condition and Results of Operations

BUSINESS CONDITIONS

Northrop Grumman provides technologically advanced, innovative products, services, and solutions in defense and commercial electronics, information
technology, systems integration, space technology, mission systems, and nuclear and non-nuclear shipbuilding and systems. As a prime contractor, principal subcontractor, partner, or preferred supplier, Northrop Grumman participates in many
high-priority defense and commercial technology programs in the United States and abroad. While Northrop Grumman is subject to the usual vagaries of the marketplace, it is also affected by the unique characteristics of the defense industry and by
certain elements peculiar to its own business mix. Lockheed Martin Corporation, The Boeing Company and Raytheon Company are among the largest companies in the defense industry at this time. Northrop Grumman, the second largest defense contractor,
competes against these and other companies for a number of programs, both large and small. Intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of Northrop Grumman’s business and the defense industry. It is common in this
industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract, turn out to be a subcontractor. It is not uncommon to compete with customers and,
simultaneously on other contracts, to be either a supplier to or a customer of such competitor. The nature of major defense programs, conducted under binding contracts, allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity
unknown in many industries. Northrop Grumman conducts most of its business with the U.S. Government, principally the Department of Defense (DOD). The company also conducts business with foreign governments and makes domestic and international
commercial sales.

The defense requirements of the United States and NATO countries have shifted to being able to respond to
one or more regional conflicts, terrorist acts, homeland security, and proactive threat identification. Such engagements may require unilateral or cooperative initiatives, ranging from passive surveillance to active engagement, deterrence, policing
or peacekeeping. In addition, the DOD’s strategy continues to be affected by the general public’s concern for placing military or civilian personnel at risk. As a result of these trends, both the United States and NATO countries are
increasingly relying on sophisticated weapon systems that provide long-range surveillance and intelligence, battle management and precision strike capabilities combined with the ability to rapidly deploy complete defensive platforms around the
world. Accordingly, defense procurement spending is expected to be weighted towards the development and procurement of advanced electronics and software that enhance the capabilities of individual weapons systems and provide for the real-time
integration of individual surveillance, information management, strike and battle management platforms.

United States
defense contractors have benefited from the upward trend in overall defense spending over recent years. Defense spending in NATO countries has stabilized, while they continue to increase their focus upon the development and procurement of advanced
electronics and information systems capabilities. Although the ultimate size of future defense budgets remains uncertain, current indications are that the defense budget will increase over the next five years. U.S. Government programs in which
Northrop Grumman either participates, or strives to participate, must compete with other programs for consideration during our nation’s budget formulation and appropriation processes. Budget decisions made in this environment will have
long-term consequences for the size and structure of Northrop Grumman and the entire defense industry. While the ultimate distribution of the budget remains uncertain, the company believes that its technologies and programs will be viewed favorably
in the upcoming strategic review and budget process.

Northrop Grumman has historically concentrated its efforts in high
technology areas such as stealth, airborne surveillance, battle management, precision weapons, systems integration, defense electronics and information technology. Through its acquisitions of Litton Industries, Inc. (Litton), Newport News
Shipbuilding Inc. (Newport News) and TRW Inc. (TRW) the company now has a significant presence in space technology; command, control & intelligence; federal and civil information systems; missile systems; and the manufacture of a broad range of
ships including aircraft carriers and submarines. The company believes that its programs are a high priority for national defense, but there remains the possibility that one or more of them may be reduced, extended or terminated.

-15-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

In the event of termination for the government’s convenience, contractors are normally protected by
provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred subsequent to termination. The company received a termination for convenience notice on the Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile (TSSAM) program in February 1995. In December 1996 the company filed
a lawsuit against the U.S. Government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims seeking the recovery of approximately $750 million for uncompensated performance costs, investments and a reasonable profit on the program. In prior years the company had
charged to operations in excess of $600 million related to this program. Northrop Grumman is unable to predict whether it will realize some or all of its claims, none of which are recorded on its balance sheet, from the U.S. Government on the TSSAM
contract.

Prime contracts with various agencies of the U.S. Government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are
subject to numerous procurement regulations, including the False Claims Act and The International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act, with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in fines,
penalties, debarment or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all U. S. Government agencies. Given the company’s dependence on U.S. Government business, suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the
company’s future.

The company does not make use of business arrangements or other business activities that involve
so-called off-balance sheet, variable interest or special purpose entities.

An individual company’s success in
the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products, as well as its ability to provide the people, facilities, equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products with maximum efficiency. It is
necessary to maintain, as the company has, sources for raw materials, fabricated parts, electronic components and major subassemblies. In this manufacturing and systems integration environment, effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is
as vital to success as managing internal operations. Northrop Grumman’s operating policies are designed to achieve these objectives. The company also believes that it maintains good relations with its employees, approximately 19 percent of whom
are covered by 37 collective bargaining agreements. The company currently expects to complete negotiation of 11 collective bargaining agreements in 2003. Two of these agreements covering over 6,000 employees in the Ships segment are in current
negotiations which are expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2003. It is not expected that these negotiations will either individually or collectively cause a material adverse effect on the operations of the company.

The company provides certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of non-conforming items for a specified period of time.
Most of the company’s product warranties are provided under government contracts and are generally recoverable from the customer.

Critical Accounting Policies

The
company’s established policies are outlined in the footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) entitled “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”. As part of its oversight
responsibilities, management evaluates the propriety of its accounting methods as new events occur. Management believes that its policies are applied in a manner which provides the reader of the company’s financial statements a current,
accurate and complete presentation of information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Principal accounting practices that require the use of assumptions and judgments are outlined below:

Revenue Recognition

As a defense contractor engaging in long-term contracts, the company extensively utilizes the cost-to-cost type and the units-of-delivery type of
percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Application of this accounting method requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the design, manufacture and delivery of aircraft carriers, submarines, aircraft and subassemblies, radars,
intricate components and systems for space communications as well as the engineering, development and integration of software systems and other highly technical products. Such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and
estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment. The cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company’s engineers, program managers and financial professionals. Factors that are considered in
estimating the work to be

-16-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be
performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete. A
significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company’s results of operations. Contract cost estimates are updated at least annually and more frequently in certain circumstances. Sales under
cost-reimbursement contracts are recorded as costs are incurred. Certain contracts contain profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product. Incentives which
can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentives which cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded. Certain contracts contain provisions for the redetermination of price based upon future
economic conditions. Contract change orders and claims are included in sales when they can be reasonably estimated and realization is probable.

Purchase Accounting and Goodwill

The company applies the purchase method of accounting to its acquisitions. Under this method, the purchase price is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their
respective fair market values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates which can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time that may cause final amounts to differ
from original estimates. The company evaluates the recovery of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The evaluation requires judgment associated with factors used to test recoverability.

Litigation, Commitments and Contingencies

The company is subject to a range of claims, lawsuits, environmental matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.
Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel. In accordance with SFAS No. 5

– Accounting for
Contingencies

, amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure
to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known.

Retirement Benefits

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit
obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other post-retirement benefits plans are regularly evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries who are relied upon as experts. In the event
that the company determines that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long term rate of return, or health care cost, future pension and post-retirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease.

With respect to the previously described critical accounting policies, management believes that the application of judgments
and assessments has been consistently applied and has produced financial information which fairly depicts the results of operations for the years presented.

Acquisitions and Divestures

The
current composition of Northrop Grumman Corporation is the result of a series of strategic acquisitions, mergers and divestures. In 1998 and 1999, the company acquired several businesses that strategically fit within its operating sectors.
Inter-National Research Institute Inc. (INRI) was acquired in 1998 and was integrated into the Information Technology sector. In 1999, Ryan Aeronautical, an operating unit of Alleghany Teledyne Incorporated, the Information Systems Division of
California Microwave, Inc., and Data Procurement Corporation (DPC), were acquired and integrated into Integrated Systems, Electronic Systems and Information Technology, respectively.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

In 2000, the company acquired Navia Aviation AS, Comptek Research, Inc., Federal Data Corporation, and
Sterling Software, Inc., (known as Sterling’s Federal Systems Group). Navia was integrated into Electronic Systems. The Comptek units were integrated within the Integrated Systems, Electronic Systems and Information Technology sectors. Federal
Data and Sterling were both integrated into Information Technology.

On July 24, 2000, the company completed the sale of its
commercial aerostructures (Aerostructures) business to The Carlyle Group. Aerostructures was principally a major producer of commercial aircraft subassemblies, the majority of which were sold to The Boeing Company.

In 2001, the company purchased Litton Industries, Inc. (Litton), Electronics and Information Systems Group of Aerojet-General Corporation
(EIS) and 80.7 percent of Newport News. On January 18, 2002, the company completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of Newport News and now owns 100 percent of Newport News. Newport News is the nation’s sole designer, builder and
refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and one of only two domestic companies capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines. To complete the acquisition, the company issued an additional 3.2 million shares of its common stock
and paid cash for the balance of the Newport News shares. In total, the company issued 16.6 million shares of its common stock for the acquisition of Newport News. These shares were valued at $95.22 per share for purchase accounting purposes. In
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, this value was determined based on the average closing stock price of the company’s common stock from December 3, 2001, through December 7, 2001. Following the completion of the
acquisition, the company eliminated the 19.3 percent minority interest from its financial statements.

The Litton, Newport
News and EIS acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
their respective fair market values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. As of December 31, 2002, the company has completed the fair market value and accounting conformance evaluation process for these acquisitions and all related adjustments have
been reflected in these financial statements. The Litton business units operating results are included from the acquisition date in the company’s segment data as follows: Litton’s advanced electronics business is included in Electronic
Systems; Litton’s information systems business is included in Information Technology; Litton’s ship business is included in Ships. Litton’s electronic components and materials business, Component Technologies, is classified as
discontinued operations. EIS was integrated into Electronic Systems and Newport News is included in the Ships segment.

In
2001, the company accrued $119 million in restructuring costs related to the acquisition of Litton. These costs included $29 million to exit a business, $31 million to close down redundant facilities and $59 million to terminate and relocate
employees. Of the total amount accrued, $5 million was expensed directly to the income statement and $114 million was accounted for as purchase accounting adjustments to the opening balance sheet of Litton. For the period from April 2, 2001 to
December 31, 2001 the company utilized $25 million of the balance sheet accrual. In 2002, the company accrued an additional $13 million of costs to close down redundant facilities in relation to this acquisition. During 2002, the company utilized
$57 million of the balance sheet accrual. In addition, $1 million was reversed to the income statement as it is no longer required. At December 31, 2002, $49 million of accrued restructure costs remained, including $25 million in other current
liabilities, $20 million in other long-term liabilities and $4 million in liabilities of businesses held for sale.

In
December 2002, the company purchased 100 percent of the common stock of TRW Inc. (TRW). The company issued approximately 69.4 million shares of its common stock at an exchange ratio of .5357 for each TRW share, with cash paid in lieu of any
fractional share of the company’s stock which otherwise would be issued to the TRW shareholders. These shares were valued at $107.31 per share for purchase accounting purposes. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, this
value was determined based on the average closing stock price of the company’s common stock from October 15, 2002, through October 21, 2002. In connection with the acquisition of TRW, the company entered into a formal stipulation and consent
decree (Final Judgment) with the United States Department of Justice that was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on December 11, 2002. Key provisions of the consent decree are intended to assure that the merger will not
impede fair and open competition related to certain electronic satellite payloads. The consent decree does not

-18-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

require the divestiture of any businesses and will permit the company to operate its business and those of TRW as planned. TRW’s defense
business units will be operated as two separate sectors, Mission Systems and Space Technology. TRW’s automotive business (Auto) was sold in February, 2003.

The acquisition of TRW, which is valued at approximately $12.5 billion, including the assumption of TRW’s debt of $4.8 billion, is accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The
company is in the early stages of determining the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These financial statements reflect preliminary estimates of the fair market value for only purchased intangibles, retiree benefits assets
and liabilities and debt as well as preliminary estimates of adjustments necessary to conform TRW to the company’s accounting policies. Auto is included in the total TRW valuation and is valued and recorded at its estimated sale price, which
represents its fair market value. The final determination of the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and final allocation of the purchase price may differ significantly from the amounts included in these financial
statements. Adjustments to the purchase price allocations are expected to be finalized by the fourth quarter of 2003, and will be reflected in future filings. There can be no assurance that such adjustments will not be material.

Discontinued Operations

The company completed the sale of Auto to The Blackstone Group on February 28, 2003. The company received approximately $4.7 billion, comprised of $3.9
billion in cash and debt retained by Auto, a $600 million payment-in-kind note and a 19.6 percent investment in the new enterprise. Cash proceeds from the sale will be used primarily to reduce debt.

In October 2002, Northrop Grumman completed the sale of two Electronic Systems sector businesses, Electron Devices and Ruggedized Displays
for $135 million. During the third quarter of 2002, the company concluded that the Component Technologies businesses did not fit with the company’s long-term plan and decided to sell the businesses. The company completed the sale of the
Component Technologies VEAM business units in the first quarter of 2003 and expects to complete the sale of the remaining businesses by September 30, 2003. Therefore, in accordance with SFAS No. 144

– Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

, the results of operations of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations, net of applicable income taxes, for all periods presented. In addition, the assets and liabilities of these businesses and of
Auto have been classified as held for sale.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

The company is aligned into seven business sectors: Electronic Systems, Newport News, Ship Systems, Information Technology, Integrated
Systems, Mission Systems and Space Technology. For financial reporting purposes each business sector is a reportable segment with the exception of Newport News and Ship Systems which are aggregated and reported as the Ships segment in accordance

Newport News is one of two builders of U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarines. In February 1997, the sector and Electric Boat Corporation (Electric Boat), a wholly-owned subsidiary of General Dynamics Corporation, reached an
agreement to cooperatively build the first four new nuclear attack submarines of the

Virginia

-class. With Electric Boat serving as the prime contractor and lead designer, each company will construct certain portions of each submarine, with
final assembly, testing, outfitting, and delivery alternating between the two yards. The contract for the first flight of

Virginia-

class submarines was awarded to the Newport News/Electric Boat team in 1998. The period of performance on this
contract spans 10 years as submarines in this class typically have a 6 to 7 year build cycle. The current schedule calls for the delivery of the

Virginia

by Electric Boat in 2004 followed over the balance of the contract by the

Texas

(Newport News), the

Hawaii

(Electric Boat), and the

North

Carolina

(Newport News). Electric Boat and Newport News are currently in negotiation with the U.S. Navy for the second flight of 5

Virginia-

class submarines with
options for an additional two. The second flight of

Virginia

-class submarines will also be co-produced with Electric Boat. Management estimates that the

Virginia

-class program could total up to 30 submarines, although no assurances can
be given as to the number of submarines that ultimately will be built by the sector.

Ship Systems is under contract to
produce five Polar Tankers, included in Commercial and International; two ships have been delivered. These tankers will transport one million barrels of crude oil from Alaska to west coast refineries and are fully compliant with the Oil Pollution
Act of 1990. The remaining three ships are expected to be delivered in 2003, 2004, and 2005. In 2002, Ship Systems delivered two overhauled frigates to Venezuela with warranty the only remaining contractual obligation. Ship Systems is under contract
with the Israeli Government to perform feasibility studies to increase the size and capabilities of the SA’AR 5 Class corvettes. Ship Systems designed and built three ships of this class in the early 1990’s.

Space Technology

The Space Technology
sector develops a broad range of systems at the leading edge of space, defense and electronics technology. The sector creates products primarily for the U.S. government that contribute significantly to the nation’s security and leadership in
science and technology. This business primarily consists of the following major business areas: Civil Space; Missile Defense; Satellite Communications (SatCom); Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR); and Radio Systems.

The Civil Space business area produces spacecraft, instruments and services for some of our nation’s most challenging space science
missions, earth observation systems and weather satellite systems. A variety of products and services are provided, including mission and systems engineering services, spacecraft and instrument systems, mission operations and propulsion systems.
Customers include NASA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the DOD. Major programs include the recently awarded James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS),
Earth Observation System (EOS) and the legacy space telescope program Chandra, currently in operation.

Missile Defense
produces space-based systems that detect, track and destroy missiles and help to counter today’s widely proliferating ballistic threats. Key capabilities and products include system integration, spacecraft, directed energy and kinetic energy
weapons, and tactical lasers. The newly formed Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is the primary customer. Major programs include the Space Tracking Surveillance System (STSS formerly SBIRS-Low), Airborne Laser (ABL), and Mobile Tactical High Energy Laser
(MTHEL).

The SatCom business area demonstrates the sector’s leadership in complex satellite communication systems and
broadband payloads. Key customers are satellite prime contractors in support of the DOD and other government agencies. Major programs include Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) payload, and communication payload for the legacy Milstar program,
currently in operation.

In the ISR business area the sector’s capabilities give the nation’s monitoring systems a
global reach and enhance national security. Addressing requirements in space-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems, the sector provides mission and systems engineering, satellite systems and mission operations. Customers are
predominantly restricted, as are the major programs. Also part of this business area, Defense Support Program (DSP) has been monitoring ballistic missile launches for the Air Force for decades.

In the Radio Systems business area the sector has been pioneering software-defined radio technology and applying the results to advanced
integrated Communications, Navigation and Identification (CNI) systems, radios, and avionics integration software. The sector’s avionics system represents the “eyes and ears” of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, F/A-22 Raptor jet fighter
and Comanche attack/reconnaissance helicopter. Customers for these programs include Air Force, Army, Navy and prime government contractors.

In addition, the sector maintains a Technology business area that consists primarily of government funded Research and Development (R&D) contracts in support of the five business areas described above. Technology also includes
several small technology-based product areas that sell advanced electronics, mechanical devices, and laser products to both government and commercial customers.

SEGMENT FINANCIAL DATA

In the following table of segment and major customer data, revenue from the United States Government includes revenue from contracts on which Northrop Grumman is the prime contractor as well as those on which the company is a
subcontractor and the ultimate customer is the U.S. Government. The company’s discontinued operations are excluded from all of the data elements in this table, except for assets by segment. Northrop Grumman’s income statements do not
include TRW’s post-acquisition results because they were not material. Only the TRW backlog acquired and assets at December 31, 2002, are included in the following table.

-26-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

The company, effective December 31, 2002, revised the way it measures the profitability of its operating
segments to better reflect its operating results. Pension and other retiree benefit expenses are now included in the sectors’ cost of sales to the extent that these costs are currently recognized under government Cost Accounting Standards
(CAS). In order to reconcile from segment operating margin to total company operating margin, these amounts are reported under the caption “Reversal of CAS pension expense included above.” Total GAAP pension income or expense continues to
be reported separately as a reconciling item under the caption “Pension income or expense.” The reconciling item captioned “Unallocated expenses” includes unallocated corporate expenses, state tax provisions, and other retiree
benefit expenses. Segment results for all periods presented have been conformed to the new method of measuring profitability.

Foreign sales amounted to approximately $1.3 billion, $1.3 billion and $600 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. All of the company’s segments engage in international business, for which
the company maintains a large number of sales representatives and consultants who are not employees of the company. Foreign sales by their very nature are subject to greater variability in risk than the company’s domestic sales, particularly to
the U.S. government. International sales and services subject the company to numerous stringent U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to import-export control, repatriation of earnings, exchange
controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Failure by the company or its sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in
administrative, civil or criminal liabilities and could in the extreme case result in suspension of the company’s export privileges, which could have material adverse consequences.

MEASURES OF VOLUME

Certain prior year amounts in the tables titled “Contract Acquisitions”, “Net Sales” and “Backlog” have been reclassified to
conform to current year reporting.

Contract Acquisitions

Contract acquisitions tend to fluctuate from year to year
and are determined by the size and timing of new and add-on orders. The existing funded order backlog as of the purchase date of businesses acquired is reported as contract acquisitions. The variability resulting from multiyear orders and funding,
as well as acquiring businesses, are reflected in the following table.

Contract Acquisitions

-30-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Electronic Systems acquisitions
in 2002 were 7 percent higher than in 2001. Aerospace Electronic Systems (AES) includes funding in 2002 of $116 million for the F-35, $83 million for the Longbow missile multi-year contract, and $82 million for the BAT program. C4ISR&N reflects
increased awards for international air defense systems and $150 million of funding for the Trident program. Defensive Electronic Systems includes a $165 million award for ALQ-135 electronic countermeasures for the Korea F-15. Space Systems includes
$335 million of additional funding on the SBIRS High program.

Electronic Systems acquisitions in 2001 were 26 percent
higher than in 2000. Results reported in 2001 include opening backlog acquired in the purchases of Litton and EIS of $1.3 billion and $43 million, respectively. AES includes funding in 2001 of $255 million for the Wedgetail program, $148 million for
the BAT program and $124 million for the Longbow missile multi-year contract. In C


ISR&N higher awards for air
defense systems contributed to higher acquisitions in 2001 than in 2000. Navigation Systems in 2001 reflects $820 million in Litton opening backlog acquired. In 2000, AES reflected a $1.1 billion award for the radar, electronic warfare systems,
integrated Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIR) targeting systems and common testers for United Arab Emirates (UAE) F-16 Aircraft. AES includes funding for the Longbow missile multi-year contract of $245 million in 2000.

Ships segment acquisitions in 2002 include $875 million of funding for the DD(X) program, included in the Surface Combatants business
area, and $590 million for LHD, included in the Amphibious and Auxiliary area. Newport News 2002 acquisitions included $1.6 billion of aircraft carrier funding and $828 million of funding for the submarine program. Negative acquisitions in the
Commercial and International area incorporate a $39 million dollar de-acquisition on the Polar Tanker program. In June 2002 Ships signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the U.S. Navy and General Dynamics’ Bath Iron Works to reallocate
construction responsibilities for the San Antonio (LPD 17) class amphibious assault ships and certain USS Arleigh Burke (DDG 51) class Aegis guided missile destroyers. As a result of this agreement, Ship Systems sector will assume responsibility for
the construction of all 12 San Antonio class LPDs, and will also assume responsibility for the program’s life cycle support. In exchange, Bath Iron Works will construct DDG 102, a contract that was won by Ship Systems in December 2001. Bath
Iron Works will also be awarded future DDG work as determined by the Department of the Navy.

Ships segment acquisitions in
2001 include backlog acquired in the Litton and Newport News transactions of $10.5 billion. In 2001, Surface Combatants included a $370 million contract award for an Aegis class large destroyer. Amphibious and Auxiliary for 2001 included a contract
for $113 million for the advanced procurement of material for Landing Platform Dock (LPD) 21, the fifth ship of the class. Commercial and International reported the 2001 de-acquisition of the Project America cruise ship program.

Information Technology acquisitions increased by 3 percent in 2002 over 2001. Government Information Technology (GIT) secured a major
contract win with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to provide Information Technology infrastructure and support services, key elements in assisting the border enforcement and immigration benefits missions of the agency. The $228
million INS contract positions the company to assist the new Department of Homeland Security with its Information Technology needs. In 2002, Technology Services funding for the Joint Base Operations Support Contract (J-BOSC) contract of $268 million
was received. Under this contract, which was won in 1998 and has a five-year basic performance period with a five-year option, the segment provides base operations support for NASA’s Kennedy Space Center and the U.S. Air Force’s 45th Space
Wing, which includes Cape Canaveral Air Station and Patrick Air Force Base.

Technology Services also received a $100 million contract win to provide electronic benefits transfer services to the state of Illinois which positions the
company as a key provider to state government.

Information Technology acquisitions were 108 percent higher in 2001 over 2000
which reflected Litton opening backlog acquired of $585 million. Government Information Technology acquisitions in 2001 include the effect of acquired backlog of $513 million and contract awards for the three businesses acquired in 2000.
Technology services includes acquisitions of $322 million in 2001 for J-BOSC.

Integrated Systems acquisitions in 2002
were 56 percent higher than 2001. Funding in 2002 reflects $784 million of funding for the F/A-18 contracts and $271 million for the F-35 SDD contract. ACS continues to record incremental B-2 bomber funding which increased to $388 million
in 2002 from $346 million

-31-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

in 2001 for ongoing development work, spares and other customer support for the operational aircraft program. ACS still expects to receive
future post production business, such as airframe depot maintenance, repair of components, operational software changes, and product improvement modifications.

Integrated Systems acquisitions in 2001 were 25 percent lower compared with the 2000 fiscal year principally due to the timing of contract awards on major programs. Acquisitions in 2000 included
funding of $1.1 billion for the multi-year buy for 72 F/A-18E/F shipsets. AEW/EW includes funding for the multi-year buy for twenty five E-2C aircraft of $133 million in 2002, $231 million in 2001 and $247 million in 2000. AGS/BM includes orders for
two

,

one, and one Joint STARS aircraft in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Backlog acquired and included in
acquisitions for 2002 as a result of completion of the TRW transaction was $2.7 billion for the Mission Systems segment and $1.3 billion for the Space Technology segment.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Sales

Year-to-year sales vary less than contract acquisitions and reflect
performance under new and ongoing contracts.

Net Sales

Electronics Systems segment sales increased by $752 million or 16 percent in 2002 as compared with 2001. Growth in 2002 principally reflects a $184 million increase at AES due to increased volume on the F-22, F-35, BAT, Firefinder
and Longbow missile programs. C


ISR&N sales increased by $239 million in 2002 principally due to higher volume
on international programs. The Space Systems business area contributed an additional $192 million as a result of increased volume on SBIRS High.

-33-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Electronics Systems segment sales in 2001 reflect the addition of the Litton and EIS businesses which
accounted for approximately $1.2 billion of increased sales as compared with 2000, contributing $101 million to AES, $194 million to C


ISR&N, $641 million to Navigation Systems, $159 million to Defensive Electronic Systems and $66 million to Space Systems. AES increased sales in 2001 also reflect higher F-16 block 60 combat avionics systems, Longbow and
BAT sales. Defensive Electronic Systems reflects higher EO/IR and targeting systems sales. Higher sales in “Other” are due to increased automation and information systems sales. For 2003, the company expects Electronic Systems segment
sales to be between $5.9 billion and $6.1 billion.

Ships segment sales increased substantially in 2002 as compared with
2001, principally due to inclusion of the two ship businesses acquired in 2001 for a full year. In 2003 the company expects Ships sales to be just over $5 billion.

Information Technology sales increased by 12 percent in 2002 as compared with 2001. This increase principally results from inclusion of a full year of Litton operations in 2002. Information Technology
sales increased by $2.1 billion in 2001 over 2000. The Litton business acquired in 2001 and the three businesses acquired in 2000 accounted for approximately $2 billion of the increase, contributing $1.3 billion to Government Information Technology
and $457 million to Enterprise Information Technology. For 2003, the company expects Information Technology sales to be between $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion.

Integrated Systems segment sales increased 9 percent in 2002 over 2001 principally from a $143 million increase in F-35 sales and a $145 million increase in Global Hawk sales. Integrated Systems sales
in 2001 declined 5 percent as compared to 2000, primarily as a result of lower B-2 revenue which decreased by $273 million. The production phase of the B-2 program was substantially completed in 2000. Ongoing development work, spares and other
customer support for the operational aircraft program continues. Integrated Systems revenue for 2003 is expected to be approximately $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion.

For 2003, Mission Systems sales are expected to be approximately $3.9 billion and Space Technology sales are expected to be approximately $2.5 billion.

Funded Order Backlog

The year-end funded order backlog is the sum of the previous year-end funded
order backlog plus the year’s contract acquisitions minus the year’s sales. Backlog is converted into the following years’ sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made. It is expected that approximately 68 percent of the 2002
year-end backlog will be converted into sales in 2003.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Total
U.S. Government orders, including those made on behalf of foreign governments (FMS), comprised

84 percent of the backlog at the end of 2002 compared with 82 percent at the end of 2001 and 75 percent at the end of 2000. Total foreign
customer orders, including FMS, accounted for

13 percent of the backlog in 2002 compared with 13 percent of the backlog at the end of 2001 and 22 percent at the end of 2000. Domestic commercial business in backlog was

MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE

Effective January 1, 2002, the company adopted SFAS No. 142

– Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,

which changes the accounting for goodwill
from an amortization method to an impairment-only approach and eliminates amortization of goodwill. In order to report on a comparable basis, operating results discussed herein have been adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization and are presented
below. Further details are contained in the “Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangible Assets” footnote contained in the notes to the financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

The
company’s operating margin for 2002 was $1,391 million compared with adjusted operating margin of $1,234 in 2001 and adjusted operating margin of $1,212 million in 2000. During 2001, the company’s operations substantially changed as a
result of the Litton, EIS and Newport News acquisitions. The 2002 results reflect the first full year with these acquired businesses. These acquisitions have significantly increased the size of the company in the two year period and produced one of
the largest defense contractors in the nation. The TRW acquisition was completed on December 11, 2002. The company’s 2002 income statement does not include TRW’s post-acquisition results because they were not material. The company is
continuing the integration of the various businesses acquired to optimize operating performance.

Electronic Systems segment
operating margin in 2002 was $435 million compared with adjusted operating margin of $430 million in 2001 and $220 million in 2000. Operating margin for 2002 includes a pre-tax charge of $65 million for the F-16 Block 60 fixed price combat avionics
program, offsetting margin improvements across the sector. The charge resulted from increased costs associated with the complexity of the final design for the integrated electronic warfare system portion of the sensor suite being delivered for the
Block 60 aircraft. The complexity of the design, finalized during the third quarter, and the associated material costs, exceeded that of the originally proposed configuration. The contract, which is currently in the EMD and transition to production
phases, is expected to be completed in 2007. Development work inherently has more uncertainty as to future events than production work and therefore more variability in estimates of costs to complete the work. As work on these contracts progresses
through the development stage into production, the risks associated with estimating the costs of development are reduced. While management has used its best judgment to estimate costs, future events could result in either upward or downward
adjustments to those estimates. Approximately half of the increase in 2001 operating margin over 2000 is due to the addition of the Litton and EIS businesses. The remainder of the increase is primarily due to improved performance in land combat
systems and automation and information. For 2003 management expects operating margin of nearly 10 percent of sales.

Ships
segment operating margin was $306 million in 2002 compared with adjusted operating margin of $50 million in 2001. The increase is principally due to the Newport News and Litton acquisitions. Results in 2002

-36-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

include a third-quarter pretax charge of $87 million recorded upon completion of a comprehensive review of the estimated costs to complete
the three remaining Polar Tanker ships. The increased estimate-to-complete reflects a reduced learning curve experience ship to ship as well as one-time schedule penalties. The remaining three ships are scheduled for delivery in 2003, 2004 and 2005.
The 2002 results also reflect an $11 million increase in operating margin in the LPD program as a result of improved performance and completion of the assessment of the LPD/DDG swap agreement with Bath Iron Works. Also during the year the company
reached an agreement to sell the partially complete structures and material associated with its cancelled commercial cruise ship program to Norwegian Cruise Line and successfully concluded negotiations on the majority of the program’s vendor
terminations resulting in a positive pretax third-quarter adjustment of $69 million recorded to reverse previously established reserves. Following American Classic Voyages Co.’s (AMCV) bankruptcy filing on October 19, 2001, Ships stopped work
on Project America, an AMCV cruise ship program to build two 1,900-passenger cruise ships. This decision followed negotiations with the U.S. Maritime Administration, which had decided not to continue the guaranteed funding necessary to complete the
construction of the ships. As a result, Ships recorded a pretax charge to operating margin totaling $60 million in 2001. Ships also reported a downward operating margin adjustment of $13 million on the Polar Tanker program in 2001. For 2003
management expects operating margin as a percent of sales in the mid-6 percent range.

Information Technology segment
operating margin in 2002 was $249 million compared with adjusted operating margin of $231 million in 2001 and $123 million in 2000. Operating margin for 2002 includes a $20 million favorable pretax adjustment resulting from the
restructuring of a Technology Services contract and a $16 million charge recorded on the contract with Oracle relating to Oracle’s Enterprise License Agreement with the State of California. In an effort to maintain solid customer
relations, in July 2002 Northrop Grumman and Oracle rescinded the contract with the state. The increase in operating margin in 2001 over 2000 reflects the addition of the Litton business and the three businesses acquired in late 2000 as well as
higher Enterprise Information Technology operating margin. For 2003, management expects operating margin as a percent of sales to be nearly 6 percent.

Integrated Systems segment operating margin in 2002 was $331 million compared with adjusted operating margin of $297 million in 2001 and $337 million in 2000. The 2002 results reflect improved
performance on the B-2 and E-2C programs as well as higher F-35 sales. In 2001, Integrated Systems reported a $20 million positive adjustment for Joint STARS contract closeouts, improved Joint STARS operating margin, and downward cumulative
margin rate adjustments on unmanned vehicle contracts totaling $10 million. Results for 2001 also reflect lower B-2 volume. In 2000, the last three B-2’s were delivered under the production contract. Following the award of the last
increment of production funding for the B-2, the company began recording future operating margin increases on all production aircraft as these units were delivered and accepted by the customer. At the time each unit was delivered, an assessment was
made of the status of the production contract to estimate the amount of any probable additional margin available beyond that previously recognized. That unit’s proportionate share of any such unrecognized remaining balance was then recorded.
The company believes that this method allowed margin improvements to be recognized on a more demonstrable basis. All 15 production units have been delivered. Integrated Systems 2000 results reflect upward cumulative margin rate adjustments
totaling $16 million on the F/A-18E/F program and the effect of nonrecurring relocation and realignment costs associated with the sale of the commercial aerostructures business and the relocation of the sector’s headquarters. For 2003
operating margin as a percent of sales is expected to be between 8 percent and 8.5 percent.

For 2003, management estimates
operating margin as a percent of sales to be approximately 6 percent for Mission Systems and between 6.5 percent and 7 percent for Space Technology. These estimates were developed using preliminary estimates for fair value and conformance
adjustments, including an estimate for annual purchased intangibles amortization expense of $52 million for each sector. Management is still in the preliminary stages of determining fair value and conformance adjustments and the actual results could
differ significantly from the estimates used.

Operating margin in 2002 includes pension income of $90 million compared with
$335 million in 2001 and $538 million in 2000. The lower pension income in 2002 and 2001 is principally the result of negative asset

-37-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

returns in 2001 and 2000. While in both years the company’s pension fund returns exceeded benchmark indices, they posted a negative
return of 4.9 percent in 2001 and a negative return at slightly less than breakeven in 2000. In 2002 the funds posted a negative return of 10 percent. For 2003, the company has lowered its assumption for expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets from 9.5 percent to 9 percent to better reflect current long-term expectations for the plans’ portfolios. The company has also lowered its assumption for the discount rate for obligations from 7 percent to 6.5 percent to reflect current
rates as of December 31, 2002 for high-quality corporate long term bonds. As a result of the negative return on assets in 2002, the change in assumptions, and the inclusion of the TRW pension plans, the company expects to record pension expense, in
accordance with SFAS No. 87

– Employers Accounting for Pensions

, in 2003 of approximately $600 million. Pension expense recognized under government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), and which is therefore generally recoverable under
government contracts, is estimated to be $260 million for 2003. The company estimates pension plan contributions in 2003 to be approximately $350 million. Starting in July 2003 the pension benefit for most employees, principally those participating
in Northrop and Litton heritage plans, will be based upon new criteria, whereby employees earn age and service points over the employment period. Subsequent to the 2003 initial phase in, other exempt and non-exempt plans will be conformed to the new
model. No settlement or curtailments will arise as a result of these changes. Union plans will not be affected by these plan modifications. Pension estimates for 2003 contemplate the plan changes.

Interest income in 2002 declined to $11 million compared with $33 million in 2001 and $29 million in 2000. Interest income
in 2001 and 2000 included interest earned on the note received in partial payment for the sale of Aerostructures. The note was collected in 2001. Interest income in all years includes interest earned on the temporary investment of excess cash.

Interest expense for 2002 was $422 million as compared with $373 million in 2001 and $175 million in 2000. The 2002 increase
as compared with 2001 reflects higher average debt levels resulting from the acquisitions completed in 2001. The increase in 2001 as compared with 2000 resulted from the company’s initial financing activities related to the acquisitions of
Litton, EIS and Newport News. Total debt was $9.6 billion at the end of 2002 compared to $5.5 billion at the end of 2001 and $1.6 billion at the end of 2000. The 2002 year end balance includes $4.8 billion of debt acquired upon completion
of the TRW transaction on December 11, 2002. Following the sale of Auto in the first quarter of 2003, the company has commenced the first phase of its debt reduction plan. Interest expense net of interest income for 2003 is estimated to be
approximately $470 million.

The company’s effective federal income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 31
percent in 2002, 37 percent in 2001, and 36 percent in 2000. The lower rate in 2002 reflects the elimination of goodwill amortization, most of which is non-deductible, upon adoption of SFAS No. 142

– Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

In 2003, the company’s effective federal income tax rate is expected to decrease to 28 percent, due to increased research and development credits.

Income (loss) from discontinued operations in 2002 and 2001 includes the results of operations of the Electron Devices and Ruggedized Displays businesses, which were sold in 2002, and the Component
Technologies sector. Loss from discontinued operations in 2002 includes a goodwill impairment loss of $186 million. The amount reported for 2000 includes the commercial aerostructures business, which was sold in that year.

The loss on disposal of discontinued operations includes any gain or loss from completed dispositions as well as the estimated loss from
those businesses expected to be sold at a loss, where the sale has not yet been completed. Gains realized on the sale of any discontinued businesses are reported in the period in which their divestiture is complete.

Effective January 1, 2002, the company adopted SFAS No. 142

– Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,

implemented required
disclosure provisions and eliminated the amortization of goodwill. During the second quarter of 2002, the company completed the first step of the required initial test for potential impairment of goodwill on the balance sheet at January 1, 2002. The
company used a discounted cash flow approach, corroborated by comparative market multiples, where appropriate, to determine the fair value of reporting units. The results indicated potential impairment only in the reporting units of the Component
Technologies sector due

-38-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

to unfavorable market conditions. During the third quarter of 2002, the company completed the measurement of the Component Technologies
goodwill impairment as of January 1, 2002, and recorded a noncash charge of $432 million, or $3.67 per diluted share, which is reported in the caption “Cumulative effect of accounting change”. For additional information see the
“Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangible Assets” footnote to the consolidated condensed financial statements contained in this report on Form 10-K.

from customers and cash to employees and suppliers of services and materials are included in cash from operating activities; cash from buyers of assets and cash to sellers of assets and suppliers of facilities are included in cash from investing
activities; and cash from and to lenders and cash to shareholders are included in cash from financing activities.

In 2002
cash provided from operating activities was $1,689 million as compared with the $817 million generated in 2001 and the $1,010 million generated in 2000. The increased level of cash provided in 2002 principally results from inclusion of the
Litton and Newport News acquisitions for a full year, increased operating margin over 2001 and accelerated cash collections. The lower level of cash provided by operating activities in 2001 primarily reflected nonrecurring cash payments of
approximately $700 million related to the Litton, Newport News and EIS acquisitions, including change in control payments to employees and funding of pension plans. Also in 2001, the company reached a settlement agreement for antitrust and
patent infringement lawsuits filed by Litton against Honeywell, Inc. Under the agreement, Honeywell agreed to pay the company $440 million in cash, $220 million of which was paid equally in 2001 and 2002. The entire $440 million balance due was
recorded as a fair value purchase accounting adjustment to accounts receivable on the Litton opening balance sheet. Interest expense payments increased by $168 million in 2001 over 2000 as a result of the increase in debt to fund the business
acquisitions. In 2000 cash from operations benefited from lower interest payments, reflecting the lower level of debt, and higher cash advances from customers.

Net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) at December 31, 2002, includes amounts reported as assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale which encompasses the assets and
liabilities of discontinued businesses, Component Technologies sector and Auto. Applicable amounts for the prior year have been revised to conform to the 2002 presentation. Excluding these items, net adjusted working capital at December 31, 2002,
was a negative $566 million, primarily due to increased current taxes payable and customer advances.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Adjusted net working capital at December 31, 2001 was a negative $604 million mainly due to valuation
reserves established in purchase accounting and an increase in the current portion of long-term debt arising from the company’s financing activities. One of the largest components of the change in tax liabilities is the tax expense related to
long-term contracts. With the completion of the B-2 EMD contract, federal and state income taxes that have been deferred during the performance of this contract will become payable. The contract was completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 with
associated federal taxes of approximately $1 billion paid in March 2003.

In accordance with SFAS No. 87

–
Employers’ Accounting for Pension

the company’s balance sheet at December 31, 2002, includes the recognition of an additional minimum pension liability. This adjustment was a non-cash $994 million after-tax reduction of equity,
which did not effect earnings and is potentially reversible should the performance of the capital markets improve or interest rates increase.

In 2002, cash generated from operating activities was sufficient to finance capital expenditures, pay dividends to shareholders, and reduce debt prior to completion of the TRW acquisition which included the assumption of
$4.8 billion of short-term and long-term obligations. In 2001, cash generated from operating activities, combined with cash from financing activities, was sufficient to finance capital expenditures, pay dividends to shareholders, and acquire new
businesses. In 2000, cash generated by operating activities and the sale of Aerostructures provided sufficient cash flows to finance capital expenditures, pay dividends to shareholders, reduce debt and acquire new businesses. For 2003, the company
expects cash from operating activities to be approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, before the $1 billion B-2 tax payment.

Cash used in investing activities was $118 million in 2002 compared to $3.2 billion in 2001 and $78 million in 2000. In 2002, the company sold two businesses for cash of $135 million, incurred $55 million for transaction costs
pertaining to the acquisition of TRW, and spent approximately $166 million in cash to complete the Newport News acquisition. In 2002 the company acquired TRW in an all stock transaction. In 2001, three businesses were acquired, two for cash and
stock and one for cash, for a total cash expenditure of $3,061 million. Four businesses were acquired in 2000, three for cash and one for stock, for a total cash expenditure of $510 million. In 2002, capital expenditures were $538 million,
including $30 million for capitalized software costs. In 2001, capital expenditures were $393 million, including $47 million for capitalized software costs, up from $274 million in 2000, including $32 million for capitalized software costs.
Increasing levels of capital expenditures are primarily due to the acquired companies and to provide the productive capacity to perform existing contracts, prepare for future contracts, and conduct R&D in the pursuit of developing opportunities.
Capital expenditure commitments at December 31, 2002, were approximately $250 million, including $6 million for environmental control and compliance purposes. For 2003 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $720 million, including
approximately $60 million for capitalized software costs. In 2001, the company received $148 million, collecting in full the note received in the sale of Aerostructures. The sale of this operation generated $668 million in cash in 2000. The
company completed the sale of Auto to The Blackstone Group on February 28, 2003. The company received approximately $4.7 billion, comprised of $3.9 billion in cash and debt retained by Auto, a $600 million payment-in-kind note and a 19.6
percent investment in the new enterprise. In March, 2003 the company commenced the first phase of its debt reduction plan by offering to purchase a range of debt securities, due 2004 to 2021, with interest rates ranging from 6.05 percent to 9.375
percent and a outstanding value of approximately $2.85 billion. The offers were extended with a fixed spread over market of 35 to 95 basis points. The company will use a portion of the cash proceeds from the recent sale of Auto to finance the
purchase of securities tendered pursuant to the offers. As of March 18, 2003 the company had repurchased 85.7 percent of the face value of the debt securities offered. The company has retained certain liabilities associated with the Auto business as
well as the Aeronautical Systems business that TRW divested in 2002. The settlement of these liabilities is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Cash of $623 million was used in financing activities in 2002 as compared to $2,532 million provided in 2001 and $755 million used in
2000. The use of cash in 2002 results from principal payments of long-term debt of $500 million and dividends paid to shareholders of $205 million. In December 2002, the company issued approximately 69.4 million shares of common stock in
exchange for all of the outstanding shares of TRW in a transaction valued at approximately $12.5 billion dollars, including the assumption of long-term debt of $4.8 billion. For further discussion see the Acquisitions and Divestures section
contained elsewhere in the Management Discussion and Analysis.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

In February 2001, Northrop Systems issued $1.5 billion of indebtedness pursuant to its senior debt indenture
consisting of $750 million of 7.125 percent notes due 2011 and $750 million of 7.75 percent debentures due 2031. In connection with the closing of the Litton acquisition, the company entered into unsecured senior credit facilities with lenders which
initially provided for borrowings of up to $5 billion (the “Credit Facilities”) and which replaced the company’s previous credit agreement. The Credit Facilities consisted of a $2.5 billion 364-day revolving credit facility and a $2.5
billion five-year revolving credit facility. The 364-day facility was terminated in December 2001. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, $2.5 billion was available under the five-year revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities,
together with the proceeds of the February 2001 issuance of notes and debentures, were used to finance the Litton acquisition and to pay related expenses, to retire and refinance a portion of the Litton debt, and to finance continuing operations.
Borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at various rates, including adjusted LIBOR, or an alternate base rate plus, in each case, an incremental margin based on the company’s credit rating. The Credit Facilities also provide for a
facility fee on the daily aggregate amount of commitments under the revolving facilities (whether or not utilized). The facility fee is also based on the company’s credit rating level

.

In connection with the Litton acquisition the company issued 3.5 million shares of mandatorily redeemable Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock in April 2001. Each share of Series B preferred stock has a liquidation value of $100 per share. The liquidation value, plus accrued but unpaid dividends, is payable on April 4, 2021, the mandatory redemption date. The company has the option
to redeem all, but not less than all, of the shares of Series B preferred stock at any time after seven years from the date of issuance for a number of shares of the company’s common stock equal to the liquidation value plus accrued and unpaid
dividends divided by the current market price of common stock determined in relation to the date of redemption. Each share of preferred stock is convertible, at any time, at the option of the holder into the right to receive shares of the
company’s common stock. Initially, each share is convertible into .911 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment. Holders of preferred stock are entitled to cumulative annual cash dividends of $7 per share, payable quarterly. In any
liquidation of the company, each share of preferred stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference before any distribution may be made on the company’s common stock or any series of capital stock that is junior to the Series B preferred
stock. In the event of a fundamental change in control of the company, holders of Series B preferred stock also have specified exchange rights into common stock of the company or into specified securities or property of another entity participating
in the change in control transaction.

Upon the acquisition of TRW on December 11, 2002, TRW Automotive Inc. (TAI) became a
subsidiary of Northrop Grumman Corporation. As of December 31, 2002, TAI has outstanding 100,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (TAI Series A) and 30,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock (TAI Series B) (of which 14,000 shares are
owned by Northrop Grumman) with a per share liquidation preference of $1,000 plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The dividend rate of TAI Series A and B is 12 percent per year, payable quarterly, subject to increase if certain financial covenants are
not maintained. TAI Series A and B shares are redeemable at the holders’ option upon the sale of substantially all of the assets of TAI. The redemption, at the liquidation preference price, would be on May 29, 2003 or the holders may elect to
defer such redemption until December 10, 2004. TAI Series B shares are redeemable at the holders’ option on each of the 6

th

through 19

th

anniversaries and at any time after the 20

th

anniversary of the original issuance date. TAI may redeem the Series B shares on the 5

th

, 10

th

, 15

th

, and 20

th

anniversary dates. Holders of TAI Series B stock also may require Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems Corp. (formerly TRW Inc.) to repurchase the shares at the second anniversary of issuance and Northrop
Grumman Space & Mission Systems Corp. may redeem these shares on the third anniversary of issuance.

On February 28,
2003, the company sold all the assets of TAI to the Blackstone Group and TAI Series A and Series B became redeemable at the holders option. The company received notification that the holder of all TAI Series A shares and 2,000 TAI Series B
shares has elected to have these shares redeemed on May 29, 2003. The company has also received notification that the holder of 14,000 TAI Series B shares intends to exercise its sale redemption election on December 10, 2004. These instruments are
reported as “Minority interest” in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2002.

In
November 2001, the company issued 9.2 million shares of common stock and 6.9 million equity security units, generating cash proceeds of $1.45 billion. The proceeds were used to reduce existing debt and for general corporate purposes. Each equity
security unit, issued at $100 per unit, initially consists of a contract to purchase

-41-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

shares of Northrop Grumman common stock on November 16, 2004, and a $100 senior note due 2006. The senior notes due 2006 are reported as
long-term debt. The senior notes initially bear interest at 5.25 percent per annum, and each equity security unit also pays a contract adjustment payment of 2.0 percent per annum, for a combined yield on the equity security unit of 7.25 percent per
annum. Each purchase contract which is part of the equity security units will obligate the holder thereof to purchase, for $100, the following number of shares of the company’s common stock based on the average closing price of the
company’s common stock over the 20 day trading period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding November 16, 2004: (i) 0.9262 shares if the average closing price equals or exceeds $107.97, (ii) a number of shares having a value
equal to $100.00 if the average closing price is less than $107.97 but greater than $88.50 and (iii) 1.1299 shares if the average closing price is less than or equal to $88.50. Prior to November 16, 2004, holders of equity security units have the
opportunity to participate in a remarketing of the senior note component.

During 1996, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)
advised TRW that it had been named as a defendant in lawsuits brought by a former employee originally filed under seal in 1994 and 1995 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California under the quitam provisions of the
civil False Claims Act. The DOJ subsequently advised that it would intervene in the litigation. In a consolidated complaint filed jointly by the former employee and the DOJ, it alleged that TRW misclassified various costs and improperly charged
those costs to certain of its federal contracts, that the United States has incurred substantial damages, and that TRW is liable for approximately $56 million in single damages, subject to trebling, plus penalties, post-judgment interest, costs
(including attorney’s fees) and “all other proper relief.” All substantive allegations against TRW have been denied in its answer to the consolidated complaint. The company intends to vigorously defend this matter. Trial is scheduled
for November 2003.

On February 3, 2003, the Department of Justice filed a civil False Claims Act case against Newport News
Shipbuilding, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The government seeks single damages in an amount in excess of $72 million, plus penalties, costs and interest. Damages may be trebled under the False Claims
Act. The complaint alleges that the company improperly charged certain independent research and development cost to its government contracts with respect to the years 1994 through 1999. The company denies the allegations and intends to vigorously
defend the matter.

The IRS is presently completing its audits of the B-2 program through the tax years ending December 31,
2000. Upon completion of these audits, the IRS may adopt a position that the B-2 program was completed in a year prior to 2002, which would create the potential for additional interest expense. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of
the tax audits at this time, management believes that its tax accounting for the B-2 program reflects the appropriate timing of contract completion.

In the ordinary course of business, the company utilizes standby letters of credit and other arrangements with financial institutions, principally to guarantee the future performance on certain company contracts. Such
financial arrangements supporting contract performance totaled $841 million at December 31, 2002 and $684 million at December 31, 2001. Increases in the 2002 period over 2001 reflect the effect of the TRW acquisition described elsewhere in this
Form 10-K. The company also maintains self-insured workers’ compensation plans, which are secured by surety bonds and a general agreement of indemnity with the surety. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, there were $439 million and $287 million
of such instruments outstanding, respectively. For all years presented the company had no material related party transactions.

To provide for long-term liquidity the company believes it can obtain additional capital from such sources as: the public or private capital markets, the further sale of assets, sale and leaseback of operating assets, and leasing
rather than purchasing new assets. Cash on hand at the beginning of the year plus cash generated from operations and cash available under credit lines are expected to be sufficient in 2003 to service debt, finance capital expansion projects, pay
federal income taxes and continue paying dividends to the shareholders. The company will continue to provide the productive capacity to perform its existing contracts, prepare for future contracts, and conduct R&D in the pursuit of developing
opportunities. While these expenditures tend to limit short-term liquidity, they are made with the intention of improving the long-term growth and profitability of the company.

OTHER MATTERS

Environmental Issues

Federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment affect the company’s manufacturing operations. The company has provided
for the estimated cost to complete remediation where the company has determined that it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future, including those for which it has been named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) by the
Environmental Protection Agency or similarly designated by other environmental agencies. The company has been designated a PRP under federal and state Superfund laws. It is difficult to estimate the timing and ultimate amount of environmental
cleanup costs to be incurred in the future due to the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup and the status of the law, regulations and their interpretations. Nonetheless, to assess the potential impact on the company’s
financial statements, management estimates the total reasonably possible remediation costs that could be incurred by the company. Such estimates take into consideration the professional judgment of the company’s environmental engineers and,
when necessary, consultation with outside environmental specialists. In most instances, only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated. However, in the determination of accruals, the most probable amount is used when determinable and the
minimum is used when no single amount is more probable. The company records accruals for environmental cleanup costs in the accounting period in which the company’s responsibility is established and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The
company does not anticipate and record insurance recoveries before collection is probable. Management estimates that at December 31, 2002, the range of reasonably possible future costs for environmental remediation, including Superfund sites, is
$146 million to $202 million, of which $156 million has been accrued. Should other PRP’s not pay their allocable share of remediation costs, the company may have to incur costs in addition to those already estimated and accrued. The
company makes the investments it believes will be necessary in order to comply with environmental laws; the amounts, while not insignificant, are not considered material to the company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense regulate and control various
matters relating to nuclear materials handled by the company. Subject to certain requirements and limitations, the company’s government contracts generally provide for indemnity by the U.S. Government for any loss arising out of or resulting
from certain nuclear risks.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 148 –

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation –
Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of SFAS No. 123

which is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. This statement, which revises the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No. 123, will have no
effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The provisions of this statement were adopted for the year ended December 31, 2002.

In November 2002, Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FIN 45

– Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others

. This Interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required
to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken by issuing the guarantee. Adoption of this statement is not expected to have a significant effect on the company’s financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 146 –

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,

which requires a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity to be recognized and measured at its fair value in the period in which the liability is
incurred. This statement will be adopted January 1, 2003, and is not expected to have a significant effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 145 –

Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64,
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections

. This statement clarifies

-43-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

guidance related to the reporting of gains and losses from extinguishment of debt and resolves inconsistencies related to the required
accounting treatment of certain lease modifications. The provisions of this statement relating to extinguishment of debt become effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The provisions of this statement
relating to lease modification are effective for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. Adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 144 –

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets,

which replaces SFAS No. 121 –

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of

. SFAS No. 144 resolves implementation issues previously experienced under SFAS No. 121
and broadens the reporting of discontinued operations. This statement became effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company’s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
SFAS No. 143 –

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.

SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs.
This statement becomes effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Management is currently evaluating the effect that adoption of this standard will have on the company’s results of operations and
financial position.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141

– Business
Combinations

, and SFAS No. 142

– Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. SFAS No. 141 requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and eliminates the pooling-of-interests method.
Adoption of SFAS No. 141 did not have a significant effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. SFAS No. 142 changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment-only approach.
Upon adoption of this statement, amortization of goodwill, including goodwill recorded in past business combinations, ceased and an initial impairment assessment of goodwill was performed. Annual impairment tests are required thereafter. The company
adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002 and recorded an initial goodwill impairment charge of $432 million, which is reported under the income statement caption “Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change”.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND IMPORTANT
FACTORS

Certain statements and assumptions in this report contain or are based on “forward-looking” information (that Northrop
Grumman believes to be within the definition in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) and involve risks and uncertainties, and include, among others, statements in the future tense, and all statements accompanied by terms such as
“project,” “expect,” “estimate,” “assume,” “intend”, “anticipate”, and variations thereof and similar terms. This information reflects the company’s best estimates when made, but the
company expressly disclaims any duty to update this information if new data becomes available or estimates change after the date of this report. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the
company’s forward-looking statements include:

§

The company depends on a limited number of customers. The company is heavily dependent on government contracts many of which are only partially funded; the
termination or failure to fund one or more significant contracts could have a negative impact on our operations. The company is a supplier, either directly or as a subcontractor or team member, to the U.S. Government and its agencies as well as
foreign governments and agencies. These contracts are subject to each customers’ political and budgetary constraints, changes in short-range and long-range plans, the timing of contract awards, the congressional budget authorization and
appropriation processes, the government’s ability to terminate contracts for convenience or for default, as well as other risks such as contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal and regulatory requirements.

§

Many of the company’s contracts are fixed-price contracts. While firm, fixed-price contracts allow the company to benefit from cost savings, they also expose
the company to the risk of cost overruns. If the company’s initial estimates used for calculating contract prices are incorrect, the company can incur losses on those contracts. In addition, some of the company’s contracts have provisions
relating to cost controls and audit rights and if the company fails to meet the terms specified in those contracts then the company may not realize their full benefits. The company’s ability to manage costs on these contracts may affect its
financial condition. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns would have an adverse effect on the company’s financial results.

§

The company is subject to significant competition. The company’s markets include defense and commercial areas where it competes with companies of substantial
size and resources. The company’s success or failure in winning new contracts or follow on orders for its existing or future products may cause material fluctuations in the company’s future revenues and operating results.

§

The company’s operations may be subject to events that cause adverse effects on its ability to meet contract obligations within anticipated cost and time
constraints. The company may encounter internal problems and delays in delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor or materials and components that prevent the company from achieving contract
requirements. The company may be affected by delivery or performance issues with key suppliers and subcontractors, as well as other factors inherent in the company’s businesses that may cause operating results to be adversely affected. Changes
in inventory requirements or other production cost increases may also have a negative impact on the company’s operating results.

§

The company must integrate its acquisitions successfully. Acquiring businesses is a significant challenge. If the company does not execute its acquisition and
integration plans for these businesses in accordance with the company’s strategic timetable, the company’s operating results may be adversely affected. The company acquired TRW in 2002 and several businesses in 2001 including Litton and
Newport News. The company believes its integration processes are well-suited to achieve the anticipated strategic and operating benefits of these acquisitions, but if the company does not perform its plans as intended, or if the company encounters
unforeseen problems in the acquired businesses, or problems in those businesses subsequently develop, the company’s operating results may be adversely affected. Among the factors that may be involved would be unforeseen costs and expenses,
overvalued assets, inflated contract values, previously undisclosed or undervalued liabilities, diversion of management focus, and any effects of complying with government-imposed organizational conflicts of interest rules as a result of the
acquisitions.

-45-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

§

The company relies on continuous innovation. The company is dependent upon its ability to anticipate changing needs for defense products, military and civilian
electronic systems and support, naval vessels, space technologies, and information technology. The company’s success is dependent on designing new products that will respond to such requirements within customers’ price limitations.

§

The company faces significant challenges in the international marketplace. The company’s international business is subject to changes in import and export
policies, technology transfer restrictions, limitations imposed by United States law that are not applicable to foreign competitors, and other legal, financial and governmental risks.

§

The company assumes that any divestiture of non-core businesses and assets will be completed successfully. The company’s performance may be affected by its
inability to successfully dispose of assets and businesses that do not fit with, or are no longer appropriate to, the company’s strategic plan. If any sales of such businesses or assets can be made only at a loss, the company’s earnings
will be reduced.

§

The company is subject to environmental litigation and other litigation, which, if not resolved within the company’s expectation, could reduce future operating
results.

§

The company’s pension income (expense) may fluctuate significantly. Pension income (expense) is based on assumptions of future market performance and actual
performance may differ. If an event requires the company to reestimate its pension income (expense) during the year, its reported earnings could vary significantly.

§

The indebtedness of the company has increased as a result of the acquisitions of Litton, EIS, Newport News, and TRW. The increase in debt has increased demands on
the cash resources of the company.

§

The company’s tax filings are regularly examined by federal and state taxing authorities. Results of these examinations can result in tax deficiencies,
cumulative interest payments, fines and penalties. Such assessments could negatively affect the company’s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flow.

§

The company intends that all forward-looking statements it makes will be subject to safe harbor protection of the federal securities laws as found in Section 27A of
the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Accordingly, you should not rely on the accuracy of predictions contained in forward-looking statements. These statements speak only as of the date when they are made. The company cannot undertake any
obligation to update its forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances, and changes in expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events occurring after the date of those statements.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk

The company is exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
Financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt obligations, variable-rate short-term debt outstanding under the credit agreement, short-term investments, and long-term notes receivable. At December 31, 2002,
the company had an immaterial amount of variable rate debt outstanding. Substantially all borrowings were fixed-rate long-term debt obligations of which a significant portion are not callable until maturity. The company’s sensitivity to a 1
percent charge in interest rates is tied to its $2.5 billion credit agreement, which has no balance outstanding at December 31, 2002. The estimated expense would be 1 percent of any outstanding balance. The company may enter into interest rate swap
agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2002, no interest rate swap agreements were in effect. The company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related
to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign currencies are traditionally

-46-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

converted to U.S. dollars upon receipt to limit currency fluctuation exposures. At December 31, 2002, the amount of foreign currency forward
contracts outstanding was not material. The company does not consider the market risk exposure relating to foreign currency exchange to be material. The company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Standby
letters of credit are sometimes used by the company to guarantee future performance on its contracts. All letters of credit are short-term and denominated in U.S. dollars to avoid market risk exposures.

In connection with the TRW acquisition, the company has acquired investments in RF Micro Devices, Inc. (RFMD) and Applera
Corporation—Celera Genomics Group (Celera), two publicly traded companies. The company has also acquired certain hedges that are designed to protect the forecasted cash flows resulting from the future sale of shares in these investments. These
hedges also mitigate any downside risk of loss and provide for additional gain depending on market conditions at maturity.

In 2000, TRW monetized a portion of its holdings in RFMD through the execution of three forward share sale agreements. The company is now obligated under these agreements to deliver up to 4 million shares of RFMD common stock, in the
aggregate, upon maturity of the contracts. Also in 2000, TRW similarly monetized its holdings of 229,354 shares in Celera through an agreement maturing in December 2003. The company is obligated under this agreement to deliver up to 229,354 shares
of Celera common stock, in the aggregate, upon maturity of the contract. The actual number of shares to be delivered will be determined on the basis of a formula in the agreements. Through the setting of a floor and ceiling price, these agreements
eliminate the company’s exposure to downside market risk, while enabling the company to retain potential market appreciation up to the respective ceiling price. Certain terms of the agreements are summarized below:

The
investments in RFMD and Celera and the related hedge portion of the forward share sale agreements are carried at fair market value. Changes in fair market value of the company’s shares of RFMD and Celera, including the shares monetized, are
recorded in the other comprehensive income (loss) component of shareholders’ equity. Any gains or losses reported in other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified to net income at the maturity of these agreements.

The fair value of the RFMD shares at December 31, 2002, excluding the effect of the forward share sale agreements, was approximately $30
million. The fair value of the Celera shares at December 31, 2002, excluding the effect of the forward share sale agreement, was approximately $2 million.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation and Significant Accounting
Estimates

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany
accounts, transactions and profits are eliminated in consolidation.

The company’s financial statements are in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation thereof requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the
financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates have been prepared on the basis of the most current and best available information and actual results could differ materially from
those estimates.

Nature of Operations

Northrop Grumman provides technologically advanced, innovative products, services and solutions in defense and commercial electronics, information
technology, systems integration, mission systems, space technology and nuclear and non-nuclear shipbuilding and systems. As prime contractor, principal subcontractor, partner, or preferred supplier, Northrop Grumman participates in many
high-priority defense and commercial technology programs in the United States and abroad. The majority of the company’s products and services are ultimately sold to the U. S. Government and the company is therefore affected by, among other
things, the federal budget process.

Revenue Recognition

As a defense contractor engaging in long-term contracts, the company extensively utilizes the cost-to-cost type and the
units-of-delivery type of percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Sales under cost-reimbursement contracts and construction-type contracts that provide for delivery at a low volume per year or a small number of units after a lengthy period of
time over which a significant amount of costs have been incurred are accounted for using the cost-to-cost type of percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under this method sales are recorded as costs are incurred and include estimated earned
fees or profits calculated on the basis of the relationship between costs incurred and total estimated costs. Sales under construction-type contracts that provide for delivery at a high volume per year are accounted for using the units-of-delivery
type of percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under this method sales are recognized as deliveries are made and are computed on the basis of the estimated final average unit cost plus profit. Revenue on service contracts is recognized as
the services are performed.

Certain contracts contain provisions for price redetermination or for cost and/or performance
incentives. Such redetermined amounts or incentives are included in sales when the amounts can reasonably be determined. In the case of the B-2 bomber production contract, changes in operating margin were recognized on a units-of-delivery basis and
recorded as each equivalent production unit was delivered. Amounts representing contract change orders, claims or limitations in funding, are included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable. In the period in
which it is determined that a loss will result from the performance of a contract, the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is charged against income. Loss provisions are first offset against costs that are included in assets, with any
remaining amount reflected in liabilities. Other changes in estimates of sales, costs and profits are recognized using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. This method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on
current and prior periods. Hence, the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimates had been the original estimates.

Contract Research and Development

Customer-sponsored research and development costs (direct and indirect costs incurred pursuant to contractual arrangements) are accounted for like other contracts.

-55-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Noncontract Research and Development

This category includes independent research and development costs and company-sponsored research and development costs (direct and
indirect costs not recoverable under contractual arrangements). Independent research and development (IR&D) costs are included in administrative and general expenses (indirect costs allocable to U. S. government contracts) whereas
company-sponsored research and development costs are not allocable to U. S. government contracts and are therefore charged against income as incurred.

Product Warranty Costs

The company
provides certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of non-conforming items for a specified period of time. Most of the company’s product warranties are provided under government contracts and are generally recoverable from
the customer.

Environmental Costs

Environmental liabilities are accrued when the company determines it is responsible for remediation costs and such amounts are reasonably estimable. When
only a range of amounts is established and no amount within the range is more probable than another, the minimum amount in the range is recorded. The company does not anticipate and record insurance recoveries before collection is probable.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts

The company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exchange risk related to receipts from customers and payments to
suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. Gains and losses from such transactions are included as contract costs. At December 31, 2002, the amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was not material.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

The company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to offset the variable-rate characteristic of certain variable-rate term loans which may be
outstanding from time to time under the company’s Credit Facilities. Interest on these interest rate swap agreements is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in the period incurred. Unrealized gains(losses) on interest rate swap
agreements are included in income in the period incurred. No interest rate swap agreements were in effect during the year ended December 31, 2002.

Income Taxes

Provisions for federal,
foreign, state and local income taxes are calculated on reported financial statement pretax income based on current tax law and also include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax
assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes.

The company accounts for certain contracts in process using different methods of accounting for financial statements and tax reporting and
thus provides deferred taxes on the difference between the financial and taxable income reported during the performance of such contracts.

In accordance with industry practice, state and local income and franchise tax provisions are included in administrative and general expenses.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and
cash equivalents include interest-earning debt instruments that mature in three months or less from the date purchased.

-56-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable include amounts billed and currently due from customers, amounts currently due but unbilled (primarily related to contracts accounted
for under the cost-to-cost type of percentage-of-completion method of accounting), certain estimated contract changes, claims in negotiation that are probable of recovery, and amounts retained by the customer pending contract completion.

Inventoried Costs

Inventoried costs primarily relate to work in process under fixed-price type contracts (excluding those included in unbilled accounts receivable as
previously described). They represent accumulated contract costs less the portion of such costs allocated to delivered items. Accumulated contract costs include direct production costs, factory and engineering overhead, production tooling costs, and
allowable administrative and general expenses (except for general corporate expenses and IR&D allocable to commercial contracts, which are charged against income as incurred).

In accordance with industry practice, inventoried costs are classified as a current asset and include amounts related to contracts having
production cycles longer than one year.

Product inventory primarily consists of raw materials and is stated at the lower of
cost or market, generally using the average cost method.

Depreciable Properties

Property, plant and equipment owned by the company are depreciated over the estimated useful
lives of individual assets. Capital leases are amortized over the estimated useful lives of individual assets. Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and classified in machinery and other
equipment. Capitalized software costs are amortized over no more than three years. Most of these assets are depreciated using declining-balance methods, with the remainder using the straight-line method, with the following lives:

Goodwill and Other
Purchased Intangible Assets

Effective January 1, 2002, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142
–

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, which changed the accounting for goodwill and “indefinite lived” intangibles from an amortization method to an impairment-only approach. Accordingly, amortization of goodwill, including
goodwill recorded in past business combinations, ceased on December 31, 2001. Beginning in 2002, impairment tests are performed at least annually as of April 30, and more often as circumstances require. When it is determined that an impairment has
occurred, an appropriate charge to operations is recorded.

Goodwill and other purchased intangible assets balances are
included in the identifiable assets of the industry segment to which they have been assigned. Any goodwill impairment, as well as the amortization of other purchased intangible assets, is charged against the respective industry segment operating
margin.

Forward Share Sale Agreements

The company hedges certain equity investments in publicly traded companies. These instruments protect the forecasted cash flows resulting from the
contractual sale of shares in certain of the company’s investments in unconsolidated affiliates. These instruments are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133 –

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, as
amended. The investments and the related hedge instruments are carried at fair market value. Changes in fair market value of the investments, including the shares monetized, are

-57-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

recorded in the other comprehensive income (loss) component of shareholders’ equity. Any gains or losses reported in other comprehensive
income (loss) will be reclassified to net earnings at the maturity of these agreements.

Foreign Currency Translation

For operations outside the U. S. that prepare financial statements in
currencies other than the U. S. dollar, results of operations and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates during the period, and assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period exchange rates. Translation adjustments are included
as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.

Stock Compensation Plans

The company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25
–

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

and related Interpretations in accounting for awards made under the plans. When stock options are exercised, the amount of the cash proceeds to the company is recorded as an increase to paid-in
capital. No compensation expense is recognized in connection with the company’s original issue stock options. Compensation for restricted performance stock rights is estimated and accrued over the vesting period.

Had
compensation expense been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for stock option awards, consistent with the method of SFAS No. 123

–Accounting for Stock Based Compensation

, net income, basic earnings per share, and
diluted earnings per share would have been as shown in the table above. These amounts were determined using weighted-average per share fair values for market options granted in 2002, 2001, and 2000 of $39, $26 and $25 respectively. The fair value of
each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on an expected life of six years and for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively, the following additional assumptions: dividend yield; 1.4 percent,
2.0 percent and 2.2 percent; expected volatility; 35 percent, 33 percent and 32 percent; and risk-free interest rate; 3.5 percent, 4.7 percent and 6.6 percent.

Financial Statement Reclassification

Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements and related notes have been reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 148 –

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and
Disclosure, an amendment of SFAS No. 123

which is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. This statement, which revises the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No. 123, will have no effect on the
company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The provisions of this statement were adopted for the year ended December 31, 2002.

In November 2002, Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FIN 45

– Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others

. This Interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required
to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken by issuing the guarantee. Adoption of this statement is not expected to have a significant effect on the company’s financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 146 –

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,

which requires a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity to be recognized and measured at its fair value in the period in which the liability is
incurred. This statement will be adopted January 1, 2003, and is not expected to have a significant effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 145 –

Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64,
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections

. This statement clarifies guidance related to the reporting of gains and losses from extinguishment of debt and resolves inconsistencies related to the required accounting treatment
of certain lease modifications. The provisions of this statement relating to extinguishment of debt become effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The provisions of this statement relating to lease
modification are effective for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. Adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 144 –

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets,

which replaces SFAS No. 121 –

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of

. SFAS No. 144 resolves implementation issues previously experienced under SFAS No. 121
and broadens the reporting of discontinued operations. This statement became effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company’s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
SFAS No. 143 –

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.

SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs.
This statement becomes effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Management is currently evaluating the effect that adoption of this standard will have on the company’s results of operations and
financial position.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141

– Business
Combinations

, and SFAS No. 142

– Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. SFAS No. 141 requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and eliminates the pooling-of-interests method.
Adoption of SFAS No. 141 did not have a significant effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. SFAS No. 142 changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment-only approach.
Upon adoption of this statement, amortization of goodwill, including goodwill recorded in past business combinations, ceased and an initial impairment assessment of goodwill was performed. Annual impairment tests are required thereafter. The company
adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002 and recorded an initial goodwill impairment charge of $432 million, which is reported under the income statement caption “Cumulative effect of accounting change”.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

DISPOSITIONS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In October 2002, Northrop Grumman completed the sale of two Electronic Systems sector businesses, Electron Devices and Ruggedized
Displays for $135 million. During the third quarter of 2002, the company concluded that the Component Technologies businesses did not fit with the company’s long-term plan and decided to sell the businesses. The company concluded the sale of
the Component Technologies VEAM business units in the first quarter of 2003 and intends to conclude the sale of the remaining businesses by September 30, 2003. Therefore, the results of operations of these businesses are reported as discontinued
operations, net of applicable income taxes, for all periods presented in accordance with SFAS No. 144 –

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

. The company completed its agreement to sell TRW’s automotive
business (Auto) to The Blackstone Group on February 28, 2003. The company received approximately $4.7 billion, comprised of $3.9 billion in cash and debt retained by Auto, a $600 million payment-in-kind note and a 19.6 percent
investment in the new enterprise. Cash proceeds from the sale will be used primarily to reduce debt. The company has retained certain liabilities associated with the Auto business as well as the Aeronautical Systems business that TRW divested in
2002. The settlement of these liabilities is not expected to have a a material effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Effective July 24, 2000, the company completed the sale of its commercial aerostructures (Aerostructures) business to The Carlyle Group. Aerostructures was principally a major producer of commercial
aircraft subassemblies, the majority of which were sold to The Boeing Company. The sale price was composed of $668 million in cash and a promissory note for $175 million, which was paid in full in 2001. A $56 million after-tax loss on
the sale, which includes the settlement and curtailment of various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, the write-off of goodwill, and final assessment of the value of the promissory note, was recorded in 2000. The results of operations
from Aerostructures, prior to its disposal, are reported as discontinued operations.

The company’s Consolidated
Statements of Income and related footnote disclosures have been restated to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations for the periods presented. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for 2002 and 2001 have been restated, however the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for 2000 has not been restated.

Operating results of the discontinued businesses are
as follows:

Tax
rates vary between discontinued operations and the company’s effective tax rate due to the non-deductibility of goodwill for tax purposes.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

ACQUISITIONS

In December 2002, the company purchased 100 percent of the common stock of TRW Inc. (TRW). The company issued 69.4 million shares of its common stock
at an exchange ratio of .5357 for each TRW share, with cash paid in lieu of any fractional share of the company’s stock which otherwise would be issued to the TRW shareholders. These shares were valued at $107.31 per share for purchase
accounting purposes. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, this value was determined based on the average closing stock price of the company’s common stock from October 15, 2002, through October 21, 2002. TRW’s
defense business units will be operated as two separate sectors, Mission Systems and Space Technology. In connection with the acquisition of TRW, the company entered into a formal stipulation and consent decree (Final Judgment) with the United
States Department of Justice that was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on December 11, 2002. Key provisions of the consent decree are intended to assure that the merger will not impede fair and open competition related
to certain electronic satellite payloads. The consent decree does not require the divestiture of any businesses and will permit the company to operate its businesses and those of TRW as planned.

The major classes of assets and liabilities for TRW, including auto as business held for sale were as follows:

The
acquisition of TRW, which is valued at approximately $12.5 billion, including the assumption of TRW’s debt of $4.8 billion, is accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price is
allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair market values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. The company is in the early stages of determining the fair market value
of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These financial statements reflect preliminary estimates of the fair market value for only purchased intangibles, retiree benefits assets and liabilities and debt as well as preliminary estimates of
adjustments necessary to conform TRW to the company’s accounting policies. Auto is included in the total TRW valuation and is valued and recorded at its sale price which represents its fair market value. The final determination of the fair
market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and final allocation of the purchase price may differ significantly from the amounts included in these financial statements. Adjustments to the purchase price allocations are expected to be
finalized by the fourth quarter of 2003, and will be reflected in future filings. There can be no assurance that such adjustments will not be material.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

In 2001, the company purchased Litton Industries, Inc. (Litton), Electronics and Information Systems Group of
Aerojet-General Corporation (EIS) and 80.7 percent of Newport News. On January 18, 2002, the company completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of Newport News and now owns 100 percent of Newport News. Newport News is the nation’s sole
designer, builder and refueler of nuclear powered aircraft carriers and one of only two domestic companies capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines. To complete the acquisition, the company issued an additional 3.2 million shares
of its common stock and paid cash for the balance of the Newport News shares. In total, the company issued 16.6 million shares of its common stock in relation to the acquisition of Newport News. These shares were valued at $95.22 per share for
purchase accounting purposes. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, this value was determined based on the average closing stock price of the company’s common stock from December 3, 2001, through December 7, 2001.
Following the completion of the acquisition, the company eliminated the 19.3 percent minority interest from its financial statements.

The Litton, Newport News and EIS acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. As of December 31, 2002, the company has completed the fair market value and accounting conformance evaluation process for
these acquisitions and all related adjustments have been reflected in these financial statements. The Litton business units operating results are included from the acquisition date in the company’s segment data as follows: Litton’s
advanced electronics business is included in Electronic Systems; Litton’s information systems business is included in Information Technology; Litton’s ship business is included in Ships. Litton’s electronic components and materials
business comprised Component Technologies, which is classified as discontinued operations. EIS was integrated into Electronic Systems and Newport News is included in the Ships segment.

In 2001, the company accrued $119 million in restructuring costs related to the acquisition of Litton. These costs included $29 million to
exit a business, $31 million to close down redundant facilities and $59 million to terminate and relocate employees. Of the total amount accrued, $5 million was expensed directly to the income statement and $114 million was accounted for as purchase
accounting adjustments to the opening balance sheet of Litton. For the period from April 2, 2001 to December 31, 2001 the company utilized $25 million of the balance sheet accrual. In 2002, the company accrued an additional $13 million of costs to
close down redundant facilities in relation to this acquisition. During 2002, the company utilized $57 million of the balance sheet accrual. In addition, $1 million was reversed to the income statement as it is no longer required. At December 31,
2002, $49 million of accrued restructure costs remained, including $25 million in other current liabilities, $20 million in other long-term liabilities and $4 million in liabilities of businesses held for sale.

The unaudited pro forma financial information contained herein for 2002 reflects the results of the company for the year ended December
31, 2002, combined with the pro forma results of TRW as if it had been acquired on January 1, 2002. The 2001 pro forma information reflects the results of the company for the year ended December 31, 2001, combined with the pro forma results of
Litton, Newport News, and TRW as if they were acquired on January 1, 2001. Each year has been adjusted for TRW’s sale of its Aeronautical Systems business to Goodrich Corporation and the company’s divestiture of Auto. These combined
results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results of the company. Pro forma amounts are presented below:

In 2000,
the company acquired Navia Aviation AS, Comptek Research, Inc., Federal Data Corporation, and Sterling Software, Inc., (known as Sterling’s Federal Systems Group) for a total of $643 million in cash and stock, net of cash acquired. The
purchase method of accounting was used to record all four acquisitions. Navia was integrated into Electronic Systems. The Comptek units were integrated within the Integrated Systems, Electronic Systems and Information Technology sectors. Federal
Data and Sterling were both integrated into Information Technology.

California, Space Technology has approximately 9,000 employees in more than 25 locations around the world.

In the following
table of segment and major customer data, revenue from the United States Government includes revenue from contracts on which Northrop Grumman is the prime contractor as well as those on which the company is a subcontractor and the ultimate customer
is the U.S. Government. The company’s discontinued operations are excluded from all of the data elements in this table, except for assets by segment. Northrop Grumman’s income statements do not include TRW’s post-acquisition results
because they were not material. Only the TRW assets at December 31,2002, are included in the following table.

The company,
effective December 31, 2002, revised the way it measures the profitability of its operating segments to better reflect its operating results. Pension and other retiree benefit expenses are now included in the sectors’ cost of sales to the
extent that these costs are currently recognized under government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). In order to reconcile from segment operating margin to total company operating margin, these amounts are reported under the caption “Reversal of
CAS pension expense included above.” Total GAAP pension income or expense continues to be reported separately as a reconciling item under the caption “Pension income or expense.” The reconciling item captioned “Unallocated
expenses” includes unallocated corporate expenses, state tax provisions, and other retiree benefit expenses. Segment results for all periods presented have been conformed to the new method of measuring profitability.

Foreign sales amounted to approximately $1.3 billion, $1.3 billion and $600 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. All of the company’s segments engage in international business, for which the company maintains a large number of sales representatives and consultants who are not employees of the company. Foreign sales by their very nature are
subject to greater variability in risk than the company’s domestic sales, particularly to the U.S. government. International sales and services subject the company to numerous stringent U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without
limitation, regulations relating to import-export control, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Failure by the company or its sales
representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities and could in the extreme case result in suspension of the company’s export privileges, which could have a
material adverse consequence.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change are calculated by dividing income available to common
shareholders from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period, after giving recognition to stock splits and stock dividends. Income
available to common shareholders from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change is calculated by reducing income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change by the amount of dividends accrued on
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change reflect the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock awards granted to employees under stock-based
compensation plans and the dilutive effect of the equity security units as applicable. Shares issuable pursuant to mandatorily redeemable preferred stock have not been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because their effect is
currently anti-dilutive.

Basic and diluted
earnings per share from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change are calculated as follows:

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

Unbilled amounts represent sales for which billings have not been presented to customers at year end, including differences between actual and estimated
overhead and margin rates. These amounts are usually billed and collected within one year. Progress payments are, however, received on a number of fixed-price contracts accounted for using the cost-to-cost type percentage-of-completion method.

Accounts receivable at December 31, 2002, are expected to be collected in 2003 except for approximately $74 million due
in 2004 and $105 million due in 2005 and later.

Allowances for doubtful amounts mainly represent estimates of overhead type
costs which may not be successfully negotiated and collected. Increases in 2002 reflect the acquisition of TRW.

Accounts
receivable were composed of the following:

INVENTORIED COSTS

Inventoried costs were composed of the following:

Inventoried costs relate to long-term contracts in process and include expenditures for raw materials and work in process beyond what is required for recorded orders. These expenditures are incurred to help maintain stable and
efficient production schedules. The ratio of inventoried administrative and general expenses to total inventoried costs is estimated to be the same as the ratio of total administrative and general expenses incurred to total contract costs incurred.
According to the provisions of U. S. Government contracts, the customer asserts title to, or a security interest in, substantially all inventories related to such contracts. Product inventory primarily consists of raw materials and is stated at the
lower of cost or market, generally using the average cost method.

GOODWILL AND OTHER PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Effective January 1, 2002, the company adopted SFAS No. 142 –

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, which changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment-only approach. In accordance with the statement, amortization of goodwill, including goodwill recorded in past business
combinations, ceased December 31, 2001. The statement also required an initial impairment assessment of goodwill and annual impairment tests thereafter. During the second quarter of 2002, the company completed the first step of the required initial
test for potential impairment of goodwill recorded at January 1, 2002. The company used a discounted cash flow approach, corroborated by comparative market multiples, where appropriate, to determine the fair value of reporting units. The results
indicated potential impairment only in the reporting units of the Component Technologies sector due to unfavorable market conditions. During the third quarter of 2002, the company completed the measurement of the Component Technologies goodwill
impairment as of January 1, 2002, and recorded a noncash charge of $432 million, which, in accordance with GAAP, is reported in the 2002 first quarter under the caption “Cumulative effect of accounting change.”

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of 35 years in 2001, with the
exception of approximately $1.9 billion of goodwill resulting from the fourth quarter 2001 acquisitions of Newport News and EIS, which was not amortized pursuant to the transitional guidance of SFAS No. 142. The changes in the carrying amount of
goodwill for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, are summarized below. Amounts allocated to Mission Systems and Space Technology represent preliminary estimates.

In
connection with the Newport News acquisition the company assigned an estimated value of $137 million as of December 31, 2001 of the purchase price to purchased intangible assets in the Ships segment, which was initially amortized on a straight-line
basis over a weighted average period of 11 years. During the second quarter of 2002, the company completed its evaluation of the fair value of these purchased intangible assets, which resulted in a value of $768 million and a weighted average useful
life of 47 years. In connection with the acquisition of TRW, the company has recorded a preliminary estimate of $1,032 million of the purchase price to purchased intangible assets using a preliminary weighted average life of 10 years. See the
“Acquisitions” footnote contained herein for additional information. The table below summarizes the company’s aggregate purchased intangible assets as of December 31, 2002.

All of
the company’s purchased intangible assets are subject to amortization and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over an aggregate weighted average period of 20 years. Aggregate amortization expense for the twelve months ended December
31, 2002, was $178 million, including $14 million of amortization expense reported in discontinued operations. The table below shows expected amortization for purchased intangibles as of December 31, 2002, for the next five years:

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Carrying amounts and the related estimated fair values of the company’s financial instruments at December 31 of each year are as
follows:

For cash
and cash equivalents and amounts borrowed under the company’s short-term credit lines, the carrying amounts approximate fair value, due to the short-term nature of these items. The fair value of the long-term debt at the respective year-ends
was calculated based on interest rates available for debt with terms and due dates similar to the company’s existing debt arrangements.

The company makes limited use of derivative financial instruments and does not hold or issue them for trading purposes. To mitigate the variable rate characteristic of its term loans, the company has from time to time entered into
interest rate swap agreements. No interest rate swap agreements were in effect as of the years ended December 31, 2002, or December 31, 2001. If any interest rate swap agreements had existed, unrealized gains (losses) would be calculated based upon
the amounts at which they could have been settled at then current interest rates.

The company enters into foreign currency
forward contracts to manage foreign currency exchange risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. Gains and losses from such transactions are included as contract costs. At December 31, 2002,
the amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was not material.

In connection with the TRW
acquisition, the company has acquired investments in RF Micro Devices, Inc. (RFMD) and Applera Corporation – Celera Genomics Group (Celera), two publicly traded companies. The company has also acquired certain hedges that are designed to
protect the forecasted cash flows resulting from the future sale of shares in these investments.

In 2000, TRW monetized a
portion of its holdings in RFMD through the execution of three forward share sale agreements. The company is now obligated under these agreements to deliver up to 4 million shares of RFMD common stock, in the aggregate, upon maturity of the
contracts. Also in 2000, TRW similarly monetized its holdings of 229,354 shares in Celera through an agreement maturing in December 2003. The company is obligated under this agreement to deliver up to 229,354 shares of Celera common stock, in the
aggregate, upon maturity of the contract. The actual number of shares to be delivered will be determined on the basis of a formula in the agreements. Through the setting of a floor and ceiling price, these agreements eliminate the company’s
exposure to downside market risk, while enabling the company to retain potential market appreciation up to the respective ceiling price. Certain terms of the agreements are summarized below:

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

The investments in RFMD and
Celera and the related hedge portion of the forward share sale agreements are carried at fair market value. Changes in fair market value of the company’s shares of RFMD and Celera, including the shares monetized, are recorded in the other
comprehensive income (loss) component of shareholders’ equity. Any gains or losses reported in other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified to net income at the maturity of these agreements.

The fair value of the RFMD shares at December 31, 2002, excluding the effect of the forward share sale agreements, was approximately $30
million. The fair value of the Celera shares at December 31, 2002, excluding the effect of the forward share sale agreement, was approximately $2 million.

INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense, both
federal and foreign, consisted of the following:

Income
tax expense differs from the amount computed by multiplying the statutory federal income tax rate times the income from continuing operations before income taxes and 2002’s cumulative effect of accounting change due to the following:

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax purposes. Such amounts are classified as current or deferred based upon the balance
sheet classification of the related assets and liabilities. The company’s principal temporary differences stem from the recognition of income on contracts and retiree benefit plan income/expense under different methods for tax purposes than for
financial reporting.

-74-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

The tax effects of significant temporary differences and carryforwards that gave rise to year-end deferred
federal and state tax balances, as categorized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, were as previously:

At
December 31, 2002 and 2001 the company had net current deferred tax assets of $662 million and $36 million, respectively, and non-current net deferred tax assets of $174 million and $2 million, respectively. At December 31,
2001, the company had net current deferred tax liabilities of $344 million and non-current net deferred tax liabilities of $669 million.

Consolidated year-end deferred tax balances include amounts acquired in the TRW transaction, net of deferred tax balances related to

Auto which have been classified as assets/liabilities of businesses held for sale.
Deferred U.S. income taxes were provided (net of foreign income tax credits), with respect to undistributed earnings from Northrop Grumman and Litton non-U.S. subsidiaries’ pre-acquisition years, to the extent that it was anticipated that
dividend payments from such earnings were expected to result in an additional liability. There has been no provision for U. S. income taxes for the remaining undistributed earnings of approximately $78 million at December 31, 2002, because
the company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the U. S. Should these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, the distributions would be subject to U. S. federal income tax at the statutory
rate of 35 percent, less foreign tax credits applicable to the distributions, if any. In addition, such distributions would be subject to withholding taxes in the various jurisdictions.

The company has foreign income tax credit carryforward items of $7 million at December 31, 2002, to offset future federal income
tax liabilities. These credits will expire in 2003 and 2004. The company utilized $27 million of carryforward credits attributable to research activities during 2002. The company also utilized $53 million in alternative minimum tax credit
carryforwards during 2002. The company also has at December 31, 2002, other credit forwards from TRW in the amount of $29 million available for future tax offsets.

As of December 31, 2002, the company had approximately $960 million of goodwill amortizable over periods of approximately
8 years which arose in connection with the acquisition of Westinghouse defense electronics operations in 1996 and are reported in the Eletronics Systems sector.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

NOTES PAYABLE TO BANKS AND LONG-TERM DEBT

The company has available short-term credit lines in the form of money market facilities with several banks. The amount and conditions
for borrowing under these credit lines depend on the availability and terms prevailing in the marketplace. No fees or compensating balances are required for these credit facilities. In connection with the acquisition of TRW, the company assumed
various notes and debentures amounting to approximately $4.8 billion.

In March, 2003 the company commenced the first
phase of its debt reduction plan by offering to purchase a range of debt securities, due 2004 to 2021, with interest rates ranging from 6.05 percent to 9.375 percent and an outstanding value of approximately $2.85 billion. The offers were extended
with a fixed spread over market of 35 to 95 basis points. The company will use a portion of the cash proceeds from the recent sale of Auto to finance the purchase of securities tendered pursuant to the offers. As of March 18, 2003 the company had
repurchased 85.7 percent of the face value of the debt securities offered.

In February 2001, Northrop Systems issued
$1.5 billion of indebtedness pursuant to its senior debt indenture consisting of $750 million of 7.125 percent notes due 2011 and $750 million of 7.75 percent debentures due 2031. In connection with the closing of the Litton acquisition, the company
entered into unsecured senior credit facilities with lenders which initially provided for borrowings of up to $5 billion (the “Credit Facilities”) and which replaced the company’s previous credit agreement. The Credit Facilities
consisted of a $2.5 billion 364-day revolving credit facility and a $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility. The 364-day revolving credit facility was terminated in December 2001. At December 31, 2001, $2.5 billion was available under the
five-year revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities, together with the proceeds of the February 2001 issuance of notes and debentures, were used to finance the Litton acquisition and to pay related expenses, to retire and
refinance a portion of the Litton debt, and to finance continuing operations. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at various rates, including adjusted LIBOR, or an alternate base rate plus, in each case, an incremental margin based
on the company’s credit rating. The Credit Facilities also provide for a facility fee on the daily aggregate amount of commitments under the revolving facilities (whether or not utilized). The facility fee is also based on the company’s
credit rating level. The company’s credit agreements contain various restrictive covenants relating to the payment of dividends, acquisition of the company’s stock, minimum fixed charges, aggregate indebtedness for borrowed money, interest
coverage, as well as customary covenants, representations and warranties, funding conditions and events of default. Under the most restrictive provision of the Credit Facilities, the estimated amount available for common stock dividend declaration,
while maintaining financial agreement covenant compliance, was $507 million at December 31, 2002.

In November
2001, the company issued $690 million of equity security units. Each equity security unit, issued at $100 per unit, initially consists of a contract to purchase shares of Northrop Grumman common stock on November 16, 2004, and a $100 senior note due
2006. The senior notes due 2006 are reported as long-term debt. The senior notes initially bear interest at 5.25 percent per annum, and each equity security unit also pays a contract adjustment payment of 2.0 percent per annum, for a combined yield
on the equity security unit of 7.25 percent per annum. Each purchase contract which is part of the equity security units will obligate the holder thereof to purchase on November 16, 2004, for $100, the following number of shares of the
company’s common stock based on the average closing price of the company’s common stock over the 20 day trading period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding November 16, 2004: (i) 0.9262 shares if the average closing price
equals or exceeds $107.97, (ii) a number of shares having a value equal to $100 if the average closing price is less than $107.97 but greater than $88.50 and (iii) 1.1299 shares if the average closing price is less than or equal to $88.50. Prior to
November 16, 2004, holders of equity security units have the opportunity to participate in a remarketing of the senior note component.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Long-term debt at December 31, consisted of the following:

Indentures underlying long-term debt issued by the company or its subsidiaries contain various restrictions with respect to the issuer, including one or more restrictions relating to limitations on liens, sale and leaseback
arrangements and funded debt of subsidiaries.

Long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2002 matures as follows:

The
premium on long-term debt primarily represents non-cash fair market value adjustments resulting from the acquisitions of Litton and TRW.

MINORITY INTEREST

As of
December 31, 2002, the minority interest balance is primarily comprised of preferred shares of a subsidiary totaling $116 million. Upon the acquisition of TRW on December 11, 2002, TRW Automotive Inc. (TAI) became a subsidiary of
Northrop Grumman Corporation. As of December 31, 2002, TAI has outstanding 100,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (TAI Series A) and 30,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock (TAI Series B) (of
which 14,000 shares are owned by Northrop Grumman) with a per share liquidation preference of $1,000 plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The dividend rate of TAI Series A and B is 12 percent per year, payable quarterly, subject to
increase if certain financial covenants are not maintained. TAI Series A and B shares are redeemable at the holders’ option upon the sale of substantially all of the assets of TAI. The redemption, at the liquidation preference price, would be
on May 29, 2003 or the holders may elect to defer such redemption until December 10, 2004. TAI Series B shares are redeemable at the holders option on each of the 6

th

through 19

th

anniversaries and at any time after the 20

th

anniversary of the original issuance date.
TAI may redeem the Series B shares on the 5

also may require Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems Corp. (formerly TRW Inc.) to repurchase the shares at the second anniversary of issuance and Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems Corp. may redeem these shares on the
third anniversary of issuance.

-77-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

On February 28, 2003, the company sold all the assets of TAI to the Blackstone Group and TAI
Series A and Series B became redeemable at the holders option. The company received notification that the holder of all TAI Series A shares and 2,000 TAI Series B shares has elected to have these shares redeemed on May 29, 2003. The
company has also received notification that the holder of 14,000 TAI Series B shares intends to exercise its sale redemption election on December 10, 2004.

At December 31, 2001, the minority interest balance was principally comprised of the 19.3 percent minority share in Newport News which the company did not own. On January 18, 2002, the
company completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of Newport News and now owns 100 percent of Newport News. Following the completion of the acquisition, the company eliminated the 19.3 percent minority interest from its financial
statements.

MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE SERIES B CONVERTIBLE
PREFERRED STOCK

The company issued 3.5 million shares of mandatorily redeemable Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in April 2001. Each
share of Series B preferred stock has a liquidation value of $100 per share. The liquidation value, plus accrued but unpaid dividends, is payable on April 4, 2021, the mandatory redemption date. The company has the option to redeem all but not less
than all the shares of Series B preferred stock at any time after seven years from the date of issuance for a number of shares of the company’s common stock equal to the liquidation value plus accrued and unpaid dividends divided by the current
market price of common stock determined in relation to the date of redemption. Each share of preferred stock is convertible, at any time, at the option of the holder into the right to receive shares of the company’s common stock. Initially,
each share is convertible into . 911 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment. Holders of preferred stock are entitled to cumulative annual cash dividends of $7 per share, payable quarterly. In any liquidation of the company, each share of
preferred stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference before any distribution may be made on the company’s common stock or any series of capital stock that is junior to the Series B preferred stock. In the event of a change in control of
the company, holders of Series B preferred stock also have specified exchange rights into common stock of the company or into specified securities or property of another entity participating in the change in control transaction.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The company sponsors several defined-benefit pension plans covering over 80 percent of its employees. Pension benefits for most employees are based on the
employee’s years of service and compensation during the last ten years before retirement. It is the policy of the company to fund at least the minimum amount required for all qualified plans, using actuarial cost methods and assumptions
acceptable under U. S. Government regulations, by making payments into benefit trusts separate from the company. Starting in July, 2003 the pension benefit for most employees, principally those participating in Northrop and Litton heritage plans,
will be based upon new criteria, whereby employees earn age and service points over the employment period. Subsequent to the 2003 initial phase in, other exempt and non-exempt plans will be conformed to the new model. No settlement or curtailments
will arise as a result of these changes. Union plans will not be affected by these plan modifications. Nine of the company’s 21 qualified plans, which cover approximately 60 percent of all employees, were in a legally defined full-funding
limitation status at December 31, 2002.

The company and subsidiaries also sponsor defined–contribution plans in which
most employees are eligible to participate. Company contributions for most plans are based on a cash matching of employee contributions up to 4 percent of compensation.

In addition, the company and its subsidiaries provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Certain employees achieve eligibility to participate in these contributory
plans upon retirement from active service and if they meet specified age and years of service requirements. Election to participate must be made at the date of retirement. Qualifying dependents are also eligible for medical coverage. Approximately
70 percent of the company’s current retirees participate in the medical plans. Plan documents reserve the company’s right to amend or terminate the plans at any time. Premiums charged retirees for medical coverage are based on years
of service and are adjusted annually for changes in the cost of the plans as determined by an

-78-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

independent actuary. In addition to this medical inflation cost–sharing feature, the plans also have provisions for deductibles,
copayments, coinsurance percentages, out–of–pocket limits, schedule of reasonable fees, managed care providers, maintenance of benefits with other plans, Medicare carve-out and a maximum lifetime benefit of from $250,000 to $1,000,000 per
covered individual. It is the policy of the company to fund the maximum amount deductible for income taxes into the Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust established for the Northrop Retiree Health Care Plan for Retired
Employees for payment of benefits.

The cost to the company of these plans in each of the last three years is shown in the
following table.

Major
assumptions as of each year–end used in the accounting for the defined–benefit plans are shown in the following table. Pension cost is determined using all three factors as of the end of the preceding year, whereas the funded status of the
plans, shown later, uses only the first two factors as of the end of each year.

These
assumptions also were used in retiree health care and life insurance benefit calculations with one modification. Since, unlike the pension trust, the earnings of the VEBA trust are taxable, the above expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
was reduced accordingly to an after tax rate. A significant factor used in estimating future per capita cost of covered health care benefits for the company and its retirees is the health care cost trend rate assumption. The rate used was 10 percent
for 2003 and is assumed to decrease gradually to 5 percent for 2008 and thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in that rate would have the following effects:

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

For pension plans with benefit
obligations in excess of assets as of December 31, 2002, the projected benefit obligation was $19,344 million, the accumulated benefit obligation was $17,649 million, and the fair value of assets was $15,922 million. As of December 31, 2001, the
projected benefit obligation was $1,402 million, the accumulated benefit obligation was $1,080 million, and the fair value of assets was $680 million.

Pension plan assets at December 31, 2002, comprised 43 percent domestic equity investments in listed companies (including 7 percent in Northrop Grumman common stock); 17 percent equity investments
listed on international exchanges; 29 percent in fixed income investments; 9 percent in venture capital and real estate investments; and 2 percent in cash and cash equivalents. The investment in Northrop Grumman represents 10,854,939 shares, or
5.95 percent of the company’s total shares outstanding.

Retiree health care and life insurance plan assets at December
31, 2002, comprised 57 percent domestic equity investments in listed companies; 21 percent equity investments on international exchanges; 15 percent in fixed income investments and 7 percent in cash and equivalents.

LITIGATION, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The company is subject to a range of claims, lawsuits, environmental matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.
Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its internal and external legal counsel. In accordance with SFAS No.

–Accounting for Contingencies

, amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate
resolution of any exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known. Based upon available information, it is the company’s expectation that known legal actions are either without merit or
will have no material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position. For newly acquired businesses, management applies judgment in estimating the fair value of liabilities assumed, including those related to
claims, lawsuits, environmental matters and administrative proceedings, as part of its purchase accounting activities. While the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, resolution of one or more of these matters individually or
in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations, but resolution of these matters may have a material effect on cash flows.

The company, as a government contractor, is from time to time subject to U. S. Government investigations relating to its operations.
Government contractors that are found to have violated the False Claims Act, or are indicted or convicted for violations of other federal laws, or are considered not to be responsible contractors may be suspended or debarred from government
contracting for some period of time. Such convictions could also result in fines. Given the company’s dependence on government contracting, suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company.

During 1996, in U.S. exrel, Bagley v. TRW Inc., the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) advised TRW that it had been named as a defendant in
lawsuits brought by a former employee originally filed under seal in 1994 and 1995 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California under the

qui tam

provisions of the civil False Claims Act. The DOJ subsequently
advised that it would intervene in the litigation. In a consolidated complaint filed jointly by the former employee and the DOJ, it is alleged that TRW misclassified various costs and improperly charged those costs to certain of its federal
contracts, that the United States has incurred substantial damages, and that TRW is liable for approximately $56 million in single damages, subject to trebling, plus penalties, post-judgment interest, costs (including attorneys’ fees) and
“all other proper relief.” All substantive allegations against TRW have been denied in its answer to the consolidated complaint. The company denies the allegations and intends to vigorously defend this matter. Trial is scheduled for
November 2003.

On February 3, 2003, the Department of Justice filed a civil False Claims Act case against Newport News
Shipbuilding, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The government seeks single damages in an amount in excess of $72 million, plus penalties, costs and interest. Damages may be trebled under the False Claims
Act. The complaint alleges that the company improperly charged certain independent research and development costs to its government contracts with respect to the years 1994 through 1999. The company denies the allegations and intends to vigorously
defend the matter.

The IRS is presently completing its audits of the B-2 program through the tax years ending December 31, 2000.
Upon completion of these audits, the IRS may adopt a position that the B-2 program was completed in a year prior to 2002, which would create the potential for additional interest expense. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the tax
audits at this time, management believes that its tax accounting for the B-2 program reflects the appropriate timing of contract completion.

In accordance with company policy on environmental remediation, the estimated cost to complete remediation has been accrued where it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future, including those for which it has
been named a Potentially Responsible Party by the Environmental Protection Agency or similarly designated by other environmental agencies. To assess the potential impact on the company’s financial statements, management estimates the total
reasonably possible remediation costs that could be incurred by the company, taking into account currently available facts on each site as well as the current state of technology and prior experience in remediating contaminated sites. These
estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect changes in facts and technical and legal circumstances. Management estimates that at December 31, 2002, the range of reasonably possible future costs for environmental remediation is $146
million to $202 million, of which $156 million has been accrued. Although management cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will materially affect the estimated liability accrued, management does not anticipate that
future remediation expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

The company does not make use of business arrangements or other business activities that involve so-called off balance sheet, variable interest or special purpose entities. In the ordinary course of business, the company
utilizes standby letters of credit and other arrangements with financial institutions principally to guarantee the future performance on certain company contracts. Such financial arrangements supporting performance totaled $841 million at December
31, 2002 and $684 million at December 31, 2001. Increases in 2002 over 2001 reflect the effect of the TRW acquisition. For all years presented, the company had no material related party transactions. The company also maintains self-insured
workers’ compensation plans, which are secured by surety bonds and a general agreement of indemnity with the surety. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, there were $439 million and $287 million of such instruments outstanding, respectively.

Rental expense for operating leases was $233 million for 2002, $219 million for 2001 and $122 million for 2000. Minimum
rental commitments under long-term noncancellable operating leases total $1.7 billion which is payable as follows: 2003 - $367 million, 2004 - $297 million, 2005 - $236 million, 2006 - $181 million, 2007 - $149 million, and 2008 and thereafter -
$459 million.

PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS

The company has a rights plan pursuant to which a preferred share purchase right is attached to each share of its common stock that is
or becomes outstanding prior to October 31, 2008. The rights become exercisable 10 days after the public announcement that any person or group has (i) acquired 15 percent more of the outstanding shares of the company’s common stock, or (ii)
initiated a tender offer for shares of the company’s common stock, which, if consummated, would result in any person or group acquiring 15 percent or more of the outstanding shares of the company’s common stock. Once exercisable, each
right will entitle the holder to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of the company’s Series A junior participating preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share, at a price of $250.00 per one one-thousandth of a share, subject to adjustment.
Alternatively, under certain circumstances involving an acquisition of 15 percent or more of the company’s common stock outstanding, each right will entitle its holder to purchase, at a fifty percent discount, a number of shares of the
company’s common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the right. The company may (i) exchange the rights at an exchange ratio of one share of its common stock per right, or (ii) redeem the rights, at a price of $0.01
per right, at any time prior to an acquisition of 15 percent or more of the outstanding shares of the company’s common stock by any person or group.

STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS

At December 31, 2002, Northrop Grumman had three stock-based compensation plans–the 2001 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan (2001 LTISP) and the 1993
Long–Term Incentive Stock Plan (1993 LTISP), both applicable to employees, and the 1995 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (SOPND).

The 2001 and 1993 LTISP’s permit grants to key employees of three general types of stock incentive awards: stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs) and stock awards. Each stock option grant is made with an
exercise price either at the closing price of the stock on the date of grant (market options) or at a premium over the closing price of the stock on the date of grant (premium options). Options generally vest in 25 percent increments one, two, three
and four years from the grant date under the 2001 LTISP and two, three, four and five years from the grant date under the 1993 LTISP. Under both plans options expire ten years after the grant date. No SARs have been granted under either the
LTISP’s. Stock awards, in the form of restricted performance stock rights, are granted to key employees without payment to the company. Under the 2001 LTISP, recipients of the rights earn shares of stock based on an economic value added (EVA)
metric over a three-year performance period with distributions made entirely at the end of the third year. Under the 1993 LTISP, recipients of the rights earn shares of stock based on a total-shareholder-return measure of performance over a
five-year performance period with interim distributions three and four years after grant. If at the end of the applicable performance period objectives have not been met, unearned rights up to 100 percent of the original grant for five elected
officers, and up to 70 percent of the original grant for all other recipients, will be forfeited. Termination of employment can result in forfeiture of some or all of the benefits extended under the plan. Each year, through 2001, 1.5 percent of the
company’s total issued and outstanding common stock at the end of the preceding fiscal year became available for issuance pursuant to incentive awards. At December 31, 2002, 2.8 million shares were available for future grants under
the 2001 LTISP.

The SOPND permits grants of stock options to nonemployee directors. Each grant of a stock option is made at
the closing market price on the date of the grant, is immediately exercisable, and expires ten years after the grant date. At December 31, 2002, 204,000 shares were available for future grants under the SOPND.

In connection with the acquisition of Litton, the company converted Litton stock options to company stock options. For Litton options
only, a reduction of equity was recorded which is being amortized as compensation expense. Acquired TRW options were converted to the company’s options and fully vested on the date of acquisition. Compensation expense for restricted performance
stock rights is estimated and accrued over the vesting period. The fixed 30 percent minimum distribution portion is recorded at grant value and the variable portion is recorded at market value. Compensation expense recognized for stock awards was
$63 million in 2002, $21 million in 2001, and $14 million in 2000.

MANAGEMENT’S STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY

The management of Northrop Grumman prepared and is responsible for the consolidated financial statements and all related
financial information contained in this Annual Report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on estimates and judgments, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.

In recognition of its responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of data in the financial statements, Northrop
Grumman maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly executed and recorded. The system includes policies and procedures, examinations by an
internal audit staff and officer review.

Northrop Grumman is dedicated to the highest standards of business conduct. This
dedication is reflected in written policy statements covering, among other subjects, environmental protection, potentially conflicting outside interests of employees, compliance with regulations and laws, ethical business practices, and adherence to
the highest standards of conduct and practices in transactions and relationships with customers, including the U.S. government. Ongoing education and communication programs and review activities are designed to create a strong compliance
culture—one that encourages employees to raise their policy questions and concerns and that forbids retribution for doing so.

Northrop Grumman’s financial statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP. Their audit was conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Their report for 2002
appears herein.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors periodically meets with and reviews the activities of the
independent auditors, internal auditors and management. Both the independent auditors and the internal auditors have unrestricted access to members of the Audit Committee, with or without management representatives present.

Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Northrop Grumman Corporation

Los Angeles, California

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Northrop Grumman Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and the financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,
such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Northrop Grumman Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets effective January 1, 2002, to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142 –
