HISTORY
    AND ORGANIZATION

History

Northrop Grumman Corporation (“Northrop Grumman” or
    the “company”) is an integrated enterprise consisting
    of some 25 formerly separate businesses that cover the entire
    defense spectrum, from undersea to outer space and into
    cyberspace. The companies that have become part of today’s
    Northrop Grumman achieved historic accomplishments, from
    transporting Charles Lindbergh across the Atlantic to carrying
    astronauts to the moon’s surface and back.

From 1994 through 2002, the company entered a period of
    significant expansion through acquisitions of other businesses,
    most notably:

n

In 1994, Northrop Corporation acquired Grumman Corporation
    (Grumman) and was renamed Northrop Grumman. Grumman was a
    premier military aircraft systems integrator and builder of the
    Lunar Module that first delivered men to the surface of the moon.

n

In 1996, the company acquired the defense and electronics
    businesses of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, a world leader
    in the development and production of sophisticated radar and
    other electronic systems for the nation’s defense, civil
    aviation, and other international and domestic applications.

n

In 1997, the company acquired Logicon, a provider of military
    and commercial information systems and services that met the
    needs of its national defense, civil and industrial customers.

n

In 1999, the company acquired Teledyne Ryan (Ryan), a world
    leader in the design, development and manufacture of unmanned
    airborne reconnaissance, surveillance, deception and target
    systems. In 1927, Ryan produced the

Spirit of
    St. Louis

, which Charles Lindbergh flew across the
    Atlantic. Ryan was also a pioneer in the development of Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).

n

In 2001, the company acquired Litton Industries (Litton), a
    global electronics and information technology enterprise, and
    one of the nation’s leading full-service design,
    engineering, construction, and life cycle supporters of major
    surface ships for the United States (U.S.) Navy, U.S. Coast
    Guard, and international navies.

n

Also in 2001, Newport News Shipbuilding (Newport News) was added
    to the company. Newport News is the nation’s sole designer,
    builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and
    one of only two companies capable of designing and building
    nuclear-powered submarines.

n

In 2002, Northrop Grumman acquired the space and mission systems
    businesses of TRW, a leading developer of military and civil
    space systems and satellite payloads, as well as a leading
    global integrator of complex, mission-enabling systems and
    services.

The acquisition of these and other businesses have shaped the
    company into its present position as a premier provider of
    technologically advanced, innovative products, services and
    solutions in information and services, aerospace, electronics
    and shipbuilding. As prime contractor, principal subcontractor,
    partner, or preferred supplier, Northrop Grumman participates in
    many high-priority defense and non-defense technology programs
    in the U.S. and abroad. The company conducts most of its
    business with the U.S. Government, principally the
    Department of Defense (DoD), and it also conducts business with
    foreign governments as well as other domestic and international
    customers.

Organization

The company is aligned into seven reportable segments
    categorized into four primary businesses. The Mission Systems,
    Information Technology, and Technical Services segments are
    presented as Information & Services. The

SHIPS

The Ships segment includes the following areas of business:
    Aircraft Carriers; Expeditionary Warfare; Surface Combatants;
    Submarines; Coast Guard & Coastal Defense; Services;
    and Commercial & Other.

Aircraft Carriers

– Ships is the nation’s
    sole industrial designer, builder, and refueler of
    nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. The U.S. Navy’s
    newest carrier, the

USS Ronald Reagan

, was delivered to
    the fleet in May 2004. Construction on the last carrier in the
    Nimitz class, the

George H. W. Bush

, continues. The

Bush

christening occurred in the fall of 2006 and
    delivery to the U.S. Navy is expected in 2008. Advanced
    design and preparation continues for the new generation carrier,
    CVN 21, which will incorporate transformational
    technologies that will result in manning reductions, improved
    war fighting capability, and a new nuclear propulsion plant
    design. The construction award for the first ship of the CVN 21
    program, the

Gerald R. Ford

, is expected in early 2008.
    The company also provides ongoing maintenance for the
    U.S. Navy aircraft carrier fleet through overhaul,
    refueling, and repair work. Ships is currently performing the
    refueling and complex overhaul of the

USS Carl Vinson

with redelivery to the U.S. Navy anticipated in early 2009.
    Planning for the

USS Theodore Roosevelt

refueling and
    complex overhaul began in the fall of 2006. The ship is expected
    to arrive at Newport News, Virginia in the fall of 2009.

Expeditionary Warfare

– Expeditionary Warfare
    programs include the design and construction of amphibious
    assault ships for the U.S. Navy, including the WASP LHD 1
    class and the San Antonio LPD 17 class. Ships is the sole
    provider for the LHD class of large-deck, 40,500-ton
    multipurpose amphibious assault ships, which serve as the
    centerpiece of an Amphibious Ready Group. Currently, the LHD 8
    is under construction and is a significant upgrade from the
    preceding seven ships of its class. The design and production of
    the LHD 8 is a $1.8 billion program with delivery scheduled
    for 2008. In 2006, design & long lead construction
    funding was awarded for the LHA 6, the first in a new class
    of enhanced amphibious assault ships, and the construction award
    is anticipated in the first half of 2007. Ships is also the sole
    provider of the LPD 17 class of ships, which function as
    amphibious transports. The initial two ships were delivered in
    2005 and 2006, and five LPD 17 ships are currently under
    construction. Also, one additional ship is in backlog and long
    lead funding has been received on the ninth ship.

Surface Combatants

– Surface Combatants
    includes the design and construction of the Arleigh Burke DDG 51
    class Aegis guided missile destroyers, and the design of
    DDG 1000 (previously DD(X)), the Navy’s future
    transformational surface combatant class. Ships is one of two
    prime contractors designing and building DDG 51 class
    destroyers, which provide primary anti-aircraft and anti-missile
    ship protection for the U.S. Navy fleet. Three Arleigh
    Burke class destroyers are currently under construction with an
    additional ship in backlog. In 2006, Ships was awarded
    Phase IV detail design & long lead construction
    funding for the initial DDG 1000. The contract calls for an
    equal split of ship detail design efforts between the company
    and Bath Iron Works, a wholly owned subsidiary of General
    Dynamics Corporation. The construction award for the initial
    ship is anticipated in the first half of 2007. The advanced
    technologies developed on DD(X) Phase III are being
    incorporated into DDG 1000 and are expected to be incorporated
    into the next generation guided missile cruiser CG(X).

Submarines

– Northrop Grumman is one of only
    two U.S. companies capable of designing and building
    nuclear-powered submarines. In February 1997, the company and
    Electric Boat, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Dynamics
    Corporation, reached an agreement to cooperatively build

Virginia

Class nuclear attack submarines. The lead ship,

USS Virginia

, was delivered by Electric Boat to the
    U.S. Navy and commissioned into the fleet in October 2004.
    The

USS Texas

was delivered by Ships in the spring of
    2006. The

Hawaii

was delivered in December 2006, and
    progress continues on the

North Carolina

, the final block
    one ship. Electric Boat and Ships were awarded a construction
    contract in August 2003, which was subsequently modified in
    January 2004, for the second block of six

Virginia

Class
    submarines. Planning and long lead material procurement is
    underway on all six boats of the second block; construction
    has begun on the first four.

Coast Guard & Coastal Defense

– Ships
    is a joint venture partner along with Lockheed Martin for the
    Coast Guard’s Deepwater Modernization Program. Ships has
    design and production responsibility for all surface ships,
    including three new classes of cutters. The program is a

20-year

program with the surface ship content having an estimated
    revenue value of over $8 billion. In 2006, the
    Ships/Lockheed Martin joint venture was selected for a
    43 month contract extension for the Deepwater program.

Services

– Ships provides after-market
    services, including on-going maintenance and repair work, for a
    wide array of naval and commercial vessels. The company has ship
    repair facilities in the U.S. Navy’s largest homeports
    of Norfolk, Virginia, and San Diego, California.

Commercial & Other

– Under the Polar
    Tanker program, Ships was under contract to produce five
    double-hulled tankers. These tankers each transport one million
    barrels of crude oil from Alaska to west coast refineries and
    are fully compliant with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. The last
    ship under this program was delivered in mid-2006.

Unallocated Expenses

– The reconciling item
    captioned “Unallocated expenses” includes the portion
    of corporate expenses such as management and administration,
    legal, environmental, certain compensation and retiree benefits,
    and other expenses not considered allowable or allocable under
    applicable U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS)
    regulations and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and
    therefore not allocated to the segments.

Net Pension Expense Adjustment

– The net
    pension expense adjustment reflects the excess pension expense
    determined in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) over the pension
    expense allocated to the operating segments under CAS.

Realignments

The company, from time to time, acquires or disposes of
    businesses, and realigns contracts, programs or business areas
    among its operating segments that possess similar customers,
    expertise, and capabilities. These realignments are designed to
    more fully leverage existing capabilities and enhance
    development and delivery of products and services. The operating
    results for all periods presented have been revised to reflect
    these changes.

Patents developed while under contract with the
    U.S. Government may be subject to use by the
    U.S. Government. In addition the company licenses
    intellectual property to, and from, third parties. Management
    believes the company’s ability to conduct its operations
    would not be materially affected by the loss of any particular
    intellectual property right.

SEASONALITY

No material portion of the company’s business is considered
    to be seasonal. The timing of revenue recognition is determined
    upon several factors including the timing of contract awards,
    the incurrence of contract costs, cost estimation, and unit
    deliveries. See “Revenue Recognition” in Part II,
    Item 7.

RAW
    MATERIALS

The most significant raw material required by the company is
    steel, used primarily for ship building. The company has
    mitigated supply risk by negotiating long-term agreements with a
    number of steel suppliers. In addition, the company has
    mitigated price risk related to its steel purchases through
    certain contractual arrangements with the U.S. Government.
    While the company has generally been able to obtain key raw
    materials required in its production processes in a timely
    manner, a significant delay in receipt of these supplies by the
    company could have a material effect on the company’s
    results of operations. See “Risk Factors” in
    Part I, Item 1A.

GOVERNMENT
    REGULATION

The company’s business is affected by numerous laws and
    regulations relating to the award, administration and
    performance of U.S. Government contracts. See “Risk
    Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.

Certain programs with the U.S. Government that are
    prohibited by the customer from being publicly discussed in
    detail are referred to as “restricted” in this

Form 10-K.

The consolidated financial statements and financial information
    contained within this

Form 10-K

reflect the operating results of restricted programs under GAAP.
    See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.

RESEARCH
    AND DEVELOPMENT

Company-sponsored research and development activities primarily
    include independent research and development (IR&D) efforts
    related to government programs. IR&D expenses are included
    in general and administrative expenses and are allocated to
    U.S. Government contracts. Company-sponsored research and
    development expenses totaled $574 million,
    $538 million, and $504 million in 2006, 2005, and
    2004, respectively. Expenses for research and development
    sponsored by the customer are charged directly to the related
    contracts.

-13-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

EMPLOYEE
    RELATIONS

The company believes that it maintains good relations with its
    122,200 employees, of which approximately 19 percent are
    covered by 32 collective bargaining agreements. The company
    expects to re-negotiate two of its larger collective bargaining
    agreements and 15 of its smaller agreements in 2007. It is not
    expected that these negotiations will, either individually or in
    the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
    company’s results of operations. See “Risk
    Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    MATTERS

Federal, state, and local laws relating to the protection of the
    environment affect the company’s manufacturing operations.
    The company has provided for the estimated cost to complete
    environmental remediation where the company has determined it is
    probable that the company will incur such costs in the future to
    address environmental impacts at currently or formerly owned or
    leased operating facilities, or at sites where it has been named
    a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) by the Environmental
    Protection Agency or similarly designated by other environmental
    agencies. These estimates may change given the inherent
    difficulty in estimating environmental cleanup costs to be
    incurred in the future due to the uncertainties regarding the
    extent of the required cleanup, determination of legally
    responsible parties, and the status of laws, regulations, and
    their interpretations.

In order to assess the potential impact on the company’s
    financial statements, management estimates the possible
    remediation costs that reasonably could be incurred by the
    company on a

site-by-site

basis. Such estimates take into consideration the professional
    judgment of the company’s environmental engineers and, when
    necessary, consultation with outside environmental specialists.
    In most instances, only a range of reasonably possible costs can
    be estimated. However, in the determination of accruals, the
    most probable amount is used when determinable, and the minimum
    is used when no single amount is more probable. The company
    records accruals for environmental cleanup costs in the
    accounting period in which the company’s responsibility is
    established and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The
    company does not anticipate and record insurance recoveries
    before it has determined that collection is probable.

Management estimates that at December 31, 2006, the range
    of reasonably possible future costs for environmental
    remediation sites is $224 million to $319 million, of
    which $257 million is accrued in “Other current
    liabilities” in the consolidated statements of financial
    position. Environmental accruals are recorded on an undiscounted
    basis. At sites involving multiple parties, the company provides
    environmental accruals based upon its expected share of
    liability, taking into account the financial viability of other
    jointly liable parties. Environmental expenditures are expensed
    or capitalized as appropriate. Capitalized expenditures relate
    to long-lived improvements in currently operating facilities. In
    addition, should other PRPs not pay their allocable share of
    remediation costs, the company may have to incur costs in
    addition to those already estimated and accrued, which could
    have a material effect on the company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The
    company has made the investments it believes necessary in order
    to comply with environmental laws.

COMPETITIVE
    CONDITION

Northrop Grumman, along with Lockheed Martin Corporation, The
    Boeing Company, Raytheon Company, and General Dynamics
    Corporation are among the largest companies in the
    U.S. defense industry at this time. Northrop Grumman
    competes against these and other companies for a number of
    programs, both large and small. Intense competition and long
    operating cycles are both key characteristics of Northrop
    Grumman’s business and the defense industry. It is common
    in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a
    number of companies. A company competing to be a prime
    contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to another
    party, turn out to be a subcontractor for the ultimate prime
    contracting party. It is not uncommon to compete for a contract
    award with a peer company and, simultaneously perform as a
    supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts.
    The nature of major defense programs, conducted under

-14-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

binding contracts, allows companies that perform well to benefit
    from a level of program continuity not common in many industries.

The company’s success in the competitive defense industry
    depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and
    services, as well as its ability to provide the people,
    technologies, facilities, equipment, and financial capacity
    needed to deliver those products and services with maximum
    efficiency. It is necessary to maintain, as the company has,
    sources for raw materials, fabricated parts, electronic
    components, and major subassemblies. In this manufacturing and
    systems integration environment, effective oversight of
    subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing
    internal operations. See “Risk Factors” in
    Part I, Item 1A.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

The company’s financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not
    exclusively within the company’s control that may cause
    actual performance to differ materially from historical or
    projected future performance. Information contained within this

Form 10-K

should be carefully considered by investors in light of the risk
    factors described below.

n

The Company Depends Heavily on a Single Customer, the
    U.S. Government, for a Substantial Portion of the
    Company’s Business, Including Programs Subject to Security
    Classification Restrictions on Information. Changes Affecting
    this Customer’s Capacity to Do Business with the Company or
    the Effects of Competition in the Defense Industry Could Have a
    Material Adverse Effect On the Company or Its Prospects.

Approximately 90 percent of the company’s revenues
    during 2006 were derived from products and services ultimately
    sold to the U.S. Government and are therefore affected by,
    among other things, the federal budget process. The company is a
    supplier, either directly or as a subcontractor or team member,
    to the U.S. Government and its agencies as well as foreign
    governments and agencies. These contracts are subject to the
    respective customers’ political and budgetary constraints
    and processes, changes in customers’ short-range and
    long-range strategic plans, the timing of contract awards, and
    in the case of contracts with the U.S. Government, the
    congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes,
    the Government’s ability to terminate contracts for
    convenience or for default, as well as other risks such as
    contractor

-15-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of
    legal and regulatory requirements. The termination or failure to
    fund one or more significant contracts by the
    U.S. Government could have a material adverse effect on the
    company’s results of operations or prospects.

In the event of termination for the government’s
    convenience, contractors are normally protected by provisions
    covering reimbursement for costs incurred subsequent to
    termination. The company is involved in a lawsuit concerning a
    contract terminated for convenience. See “Other
    Matters” in Part I, Item 3. Termination resulting
    from the company’s default could expose the company to
    liability and have a material adverse effect on its ability to
    compete for contracts.

In addition, a material amount of the company’s revenues
    and profits is derived from programs that are subject to
    security classification restrictions (restricted business),
    which could limit the company’s ability to discuss details
    about these programs, their risks or any disputes or claims
    relating to such programs. As a result, investors might have
    less insight into the company’s restricted business than
    other businesses of the company or could experience less ability
    to evaluate fully the risks, disputes or claims associated with
    restricted business.

The company’s success in the competitive defense industry
    depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and
    services, as well as its ability to provide the people,
    technologies, facilities, equipment, and financial capacity
    needed to deliver those products and services with maximum
    efficiency. A loss of business to our competitors could have a
    material adverse affect on the company’s ability to
    generate favorable financial results and maintain market share.

n

Many of The Company’s Contracts Contain Performance
    Obligations That Require Innovative Design Capabilities, Are
    Technologically Complex, Require

State-Of-The-Art

Manufacturing Expertise or Are Dependent Upon Factors Not Wholly
    Within The Company’s Control. Failure to Meet These
    Obligations Could Adversely Affect The Company’s
    Profitability and Future Prospects.

The company designs, develops and manufactures technologically
    advanced and innovative products and services applied by our
    customers in a variety of environments. Problems and delays in
    development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to
    design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning
    curve assumptions, or materials and components could prevent the
    company from achieving contractual requirements.

In addition, the company’s products cannot be tested and
    proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen
    problems. Examples of unforeseen problems which could negatively
    affect revenue and profitability include loss on launch of
    spacecraft, premature failure, problems with quality, country of
    origin, delivery of subcontractor components or services, and
    unplanned degradation of product performance. These failures
    could result, either directly or indirectly, in loss of life or
    property. Among the factors that may affect revenue and profits
    could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance
    or indemnification from the customer, diversion of management
    focus in responding to unforeseen liabilities, loss of follow-on
    work, and, in the case of certain contracts, repayment to the
    government customer of contract cost and fee payments previously
    received by the company.

Certain contracts, primarily involving space satellite systems,
    contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in
    the event of partial or complete failure of the system upon
    launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period
    of time. Under such terms, the company could be required to
    forfeit fees previously recognized

and/or

collected. The company has not experienced any material losses
    in the last decade in connection with contract performance
    incentive provisions. However, if the company were to experience
    launch failures or complete satellite system failures in the
    future, such events could have a material adverse impact on the
    company’s financial position or results of operations.

Contract Cost Growth on Fixed-Price and Other Contracts
    That Cannot Be Justified as an Increase In Contract Value Due
    From Customers Exposes The Company to Reduced Profitability and
    the Potential Loss of Future Business.

Operating margin is adversely affected when contract costs that
    cannot be billed to customers are incurred. This cost growth can
    occur if estimates to complete increase due to technical
    challenges or if initial estimates used for calculating the
    contract price were incorrect. The cost estimation process
    requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost
    growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the
    nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of
    change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any
    delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from
    the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover
    any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant
    change in cost estimates on one or more programs could have a
    material effect on the company’s consolidated financial
    position or results of operations.

Due to their nature, fixed-price contracts inherently have more
    risk than flexibly priced contracts and therefore generally
    carry higher profit margins. Approximately 34 percent of
    the company’s annual revenues are derived from fixed-price
    contracts – see “Contracts” in Part II,
    Item 7. Flexibly priced contracts may carry risk to the
    extent of their specific contract terms and conditions relating
    to performance award fees and negative performance incentives.
    The company typically enters into fixed-price contracts where
    costs can be reasonably estimated based on experience. In
    addition, certain contracts other than fixed-price contracts
    have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights.
    Should the terms specified in those contracts not be met, then
    profitability may be reduced.

Fixed-price development work comprises a small portion of the
    company’s fixed-price contracts and inherently has more
    uncertainty as to future events than production contracts and
    therefore more variability in estimates of the costs to complete
    the development stage. As work progresses through the
    development stage into production, the risks associated with
    estimating the total costs of the contract are generally
    reduced. In addition, successful performance of fixed-price
    development contracts, which include production units, is
    subject to the company’s ability to control cost growth in
    meeting production specifications and delivery rates. While
    management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated
    with fixed-price development programs, future events could
    result in either upward or downward adjustments to those
    estimates. Examples of the company’s significant
    fixed-price development contracts include the F-16 Block 60
    combat avionics program and the MESA radar system program for
    the Wedgetail and Peace Eagle contracts, both of which are
    performed by the Electronics segment. It is also not unusual in
    the Ships business for the company to negotiate fixed-price
    production follow-on contracts before the development effort has
    been completed and learning curves fully realized on existing
    flexibly priced development contracts.

n

The Company Uses Estimates When Accounting for Contracts.
    Changes In Estimates Could Affect The Company’s
    Profitability and Its Overall Financial Position.

Contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing
    risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making
    assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size
    and nature of many of the company’s contracts, the
    estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is
    complicated and subject to many variables. For example,
    assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to
    complete the contract because costs also include expected
    increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly,
    assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of
    efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives,
    awards, or penalties related to performance on contracts are
    considered in estimating revenue and profit rates, and are
    recorded when there is sufficient information to assess
    anticipated performance.

Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation
    processes described above, it is possible that materially
    different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions
    were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change.
    Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates
    may have a

-17-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting
    and performance. See “Critical Accounting Policies,
    Estimates, and Judgments” in Part II, Item 7.

n

The Company’s Operations Are Subject to Numerous
    Domestic and International Laws, Regulations and Restrictions,
    and Noncompliance With These Laws, Regulations and Restrictions
    Could Expose The Company to Fines, Penalties, Suspension or
    Debarment, Which Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on The
    Company’s Profitability and Its Overall Financial
    Position.

The company has thousands of contracts and operations in many
    parts of the world subject to U.S. and foreign laws and
    regulations. Prime contracts with various agencies of the
    U.S. Government and subcontracts with other prime
    contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations,
    including the False Claims Act and the International Traffic in
    Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act,
    with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in
    fines, penalties, debarment, or suspension from receiving
    additional contracts with all U.S. Government agencies.
    Given the company’s dependence on U.S. Government
    business, suspension or debarment could have a material adverse
    effect on the company.

In addition, international business subjects the company to
    numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including,
    without limitation, regulations relating to import-export
    control, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of
    earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,
    and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export
    Administration Act. Failure by the company or its sales
    representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and
    regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal
    liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension
    or debarment from government contracts or suspension of the
    company’s export privileges, which could have a material
    adverse effect on the company. Changes in regulation or
    political environment may affect the company’s ability to
    conduct business in foreign markets including investment,
    procurement, and repatriation of earnings.

The company operates in a highly regulated environment and is
    routinely audited by the U.S. Government and others. On a
    regular basis, the company monitors its policies and procedures
    with respect to its contracts to ensure consistent application
    under similar terms and conditions and to assess compliance with
    all applicable government regulations. Negative audit findings
    could result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of
    profits, or suspension of payments. From time to time the
    company is subject to U.S. Government investigations
    relating to its operations. Government contractors that are
    found to have violated the law such as the False Claims Act or
    the Arms Export Control Act, or are indicted or convicted for
    violations of other federal laws, or are found not to have acted
    responsibly as defined by the law, may be subject to significant
    fines. Such convictions could also result in suspension or
    debarment from government contracting for some period of time.
    Given the company’s dependence on government contracting,
    suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on
    the company.

n

The Company’s Business Is Subject to Disruption
    Caused By Issues With Its Suppliers, Subcontractors, Workforce,
    Natural Disasters and Other Factors That Could Adversely Affect
    the Company’s Profitability and Its Overall Financial
    Position.

The company may be affected by delivery or performance issues
    with key suppliers and subcontractors, as well as other factors
    that may cause operating results to be adversely affected.
    Changes in inventory requirements or other production cost
    increases may also have a negative effect on the company’s
    consolidated results of operations.

Performance failures by a subcontractor of the company or
    difficulty in maintaining complete alignment of the
    subcontractor’s obligations with the company’s prime
    contract obligations may adversely affect the company’s
    ability to perform its obligations on the prime contract, which
    could reduce the company’s profitability due to damages or
    other costs that may not be fully recoverable from the
    subcontractor or from the customer and could result in a
    termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on
    the company’s ability to compete for future contracts.

-18-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Operating results are heavily dependent upon the company’s
    ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with
    requisite skill sets

and/or

security clearances. The successful negotiation of collective
    bargaining agreements and avoidance of organized work stoppages
    are also critical to the ongoing operations of the company.

The company has significant operations located in regions of the
    U.S. where damaging storms and other natural disasters are
    somewhat common. While preventative measures typically help to
    minimize harm to the company, the damage and disruption
    resulting from certain storms or other natural disasters may be
    significant. Although no assurances can be made, the company
    believes it can recover costs associated with natural disasters
    through insurance or its contracts.

Natural disasters such as storms and earthquakes can disrupt
    electrical and other power distribution networks and cause
    adverse effects on profitability and performance, including
    computer and internet operation and accessibility. Computer
    viruses and similar harmful software programs, as well as
    network outages, disruptions and attacks also may have a
    material adverse affect on the company’s profitability and
    performance unless quarantined or otherwise prevented.

n

Changes In Future Business Conditions Could Cause Business
    Investments

and/or

Recorded Goodwill to Become Impaired, Resulting In Substantial
    Losses and Write-Downs That Would Reduce The Company’s
    Operating Income.

As part of its overall strategy, the company will, from time to
    time, acquire a minority or majority interest in a business.
    These investments are made upon careful target analysis and due
    diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or
    strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain
    assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price. After
    acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely
    affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not
    recoverable as an adjustment to the purchased price. Even after
    careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary
    significantly from initial estimates.

Goodwill accounts for approximately half of the company’s
    recorded total assets. The company evaluates the recoverability
    of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of
    potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based
    on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease
    in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market
    conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded
    goodwill. See “Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and
    Judgments” in Part II, Item 7.

n

The Company Is Subject to Various Claims and Litigation
    That Could Ultimately Be Resolved Against The Company Requiring
    Material Future Cash Payments

and/or

Future Material Charges Against The Company’s Operating
    Income and Materially Impairing The Company’s Financial
    Position.

The size and complexity of the company’s business make it
    highly susceptible to claims and litigation. The company is
    subject to environmental claims, income tax matters and other
    litigation, which, if not resolved within established accruals,
    could have a material adverse effect on the company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows. See “Legal Proceedings” in Part I,
    Item 3, and “Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates,
    and Judgments” in Part II, Item 7.

n

Pension and Medical Expense Associated with the
    Company’s Retirement Benefit Plans May Fluctuate
    Significantly Depending Upon Changes in Actuarial Assumptions
    and Future Market Performance of Plan Assets.

A substantial portion of the company’s current and retired
    employee population is covered by pension and post-retirement
    benefit plans, the costs of which are dependent upon the
    company’s various assumptions, including estimates of rates
    of return on benefit related assets, discount rates for future
    payment obligations, rates of future cost growth and trends for
    future costs. Variances from these estimates could have a
    material adverse affect on the company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

n

The Company’s Insurance Coverage May Be Inadequate to
    Cover All of Its Significant Risks or Its Insurers May Deny
    Coverage of Material Losses Incurred By The Company, Which Could
    Adversely Affect The Company’s Profitability and Overall
    Financial Position.

Primarily as a result of the major hurricanes in 2004 and 2005
    (including Hurricanes Katrina and Rita), market conditions have
    substantially changed, resulting in an overall reduced amount of
    total available coverage. The company endeavors to identify and
    obtain in established markets insurance agreements to cover
    significant risks and liabilities (including, among others,
    natural disasters, products liability and business
    interruption). Not every risk or liability can be protected
    against by insurance, and, for insurable risks, the limits of
    coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be
    sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred.
    In some, but not all, circumstances the company may receive
    indemnification from the U.S. Government. Because of the
    reduction in overall available coverage referred to above, the
    company may have to bear substantial costs for uninsured losses
    that could have an adverse effect upon its consolidated results
    of operations and its overall consolidated financial position.
    Additionally, disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may
    affect the timing of cash flows and, where litigation with the
    carrier becomes necessary, an outcome unfavorable to the company
    may have a material adverse affect on the company’s
    consolidated results of operations. See Note 15 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8.

n

Current Trends in U.S. Government Procurement May
    Adversely Affect Cash Flows or Program Profitability.

The company, like others in the defense industry, is aware of a
    potential problem presented by strict compliance with the
    Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement
    preference for enumerated specialty metals sourced domestically
    or from certain foreign countries. Subcontractors and lower-tier
    suppliers have made disclosures indicating inability to comply
    with the rule as written, particularly for low-value parts such
    as washers, screws, nuts, bolts, resistors and capacitors.
    Subject to limitations, inability to certify that all enumerated
    specialty metals in a product comply with sourcing requirements
    can lead to U.S. Government customers withholding a portion
    of a payment on delivery or may prevent delivery altogether of
    materiel and products critical to national defense.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

U.S. Government Investigations and
    Claims

– Departments and agencies of the
    U.S. Government have the authority to investigate various
    transactions and operations of the company, and the results of
    such investigations may lead to administrative, civil, or
    criminal proceedings, the ultimate outcome of which could be
    fines, penalties, repayments or compensatory or treble damages.
    U.S. Government regulations provide that certain findings
    against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from
    future U.S. Government contracts or the loss of export
    privileges for a company or an operating division or
    subdivision. Suspension or debarment could have a material
    adverse effect on the company because of its reliance on
    government contracts.

As previously disclosed, in October 2005, the
    U.S. Department of Justice and a classified
    U.S. Government customer apprised the company of potential
    substantial claims relating to certain microelectronic parts
    produced by the Space and Electronics Sector of former TRW Inc.,
    now a component of the company. The relationship, if any,
    between the potential claims and a civil False Claims Act case
    that remains under seal in the U.S. District Court for the
    Central District of California remains unclear to the company.
    In the third quarter of 2006, the parties commenced settlement
    discussions. While the company continues to believe that it did
    not breach the

-22-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

contracts in question and that it acted appropriately in this
    matter, the company proposed to settle the claims and any
    associated matters and recognized a pre-tax charge of
    $112.5 million in 2006 to cover the cost of the settlement
    proposal and associated investigative costs. The charge has been
    recorded within “General and administrative expenses”
    in the consolidated statements of income in Part II,
    Item 8. The company extended the offer in an effort to
    avoid litigation and in recognition of the value of the
    relationship with this customer. The U.S. Government has
    advised the company that if settlement is not reached it will
    pursue its claims through litigation. Because of the highly
    technical nature of the issues involved and their classified
    status and because of the significant disagreement between the
    company and the U.S. Government as to the
    U.S. Government’s theories of liability and damages
    (including a material difference between the
    U.S. Government’s damage theories and the
    company’s offer), final resolution of this matter could
    take a considerable amount of time particularly if litigation
    should ensue. If the U.S. Government were to pursue
    litigation and were to be ultimately successful on its theories
    of liability and damages, which could be trebled under the
    Federal False Claims Act, the effect upon the company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash
    flows would materially exceed the amount provided by the
    company. Based upon the information available to the company to
    date, the company believes that it has substantive defenses but
    can give no assurance that its views will prevail. Accordingly,
    the ultimate disposition of this matter cannot presently be
    determined.

Based upon the available information regarding matters that are
    subject to U.S. Government investigations, other than as
    set out above, the company does not believe, but can give no
    assurance, that the outcome of any such matters would have a
    material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows.

Litigation

– Various claims and legal
    proceedings arise in the ordinary course of business and are
    pending against the company and its properties. Based upon the
    information available, the company does not believe that the
    resolution of any of these various claims and legal proceedings
    will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

The company is a defendant in litigation brought by Cogent
    Systems, Inc. (Cogent) in Los Angeles Superior Court in
    California on April 20, 2005, for unspecified damages for
    alleged unauthorized use of Cogent technology relating to
    fingerprint recognition. During discovery in the second quarter
    of 2006, Cogent asserted entitlement to in excess of
    $50 million for lost profits, in excess of
    $100 million for loss of goodwill and business
    opportunities, in excess of $6 million in royalties,
    doubling of actual damages and other amounts, including, without
    limitation, attorneys’ fees. The trial date has been set
    for May 22, 2007. The company does not believe, but can
    give no assurance, that the outcome of this matter would have a
    material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows.

On September 28, 2006, various individual plaintiffs filed
    a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court, Central
    District of California, against the company, certain of its
    administrative and Board committees, all members of the
    company’s Board of Directors, and certain company officers
    and employees (Waldbuesser, et al. v. Northrop Grumman
    Corporation, et al.). The lawsuit alleges two alternative
    counts of fiduciary duty breaches under the Employee Retirement
    Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) with respect to alleged
    excessive, hidden

and/or

otherwise improper fee and expense charges to the Northrop
    Grumman Savings Plan and the Northrop Grumman Financial Security
    and Savings Plan (both of which are 401(k) plans). Among other
    things, the lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, removal of
    individuals acting as fiduciaries to such plans, payment of
    attorney fees and costs, and an accounting. The company does not
    believe, but can give no assurance, that the outcome of this
    matter would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

On January 3, 2007, a class action lawsuit was filed in the
    U.S. District Court, Central District of California,
    against the company, certain of its administrative and Board
    committees, certain members of its Board of Directors, and
    certain company officers and employees (Heidecker v.
    Northrop Grumman Corporation, et al.). The lawsuit alleges
    two alternative counts of fiduciary duty breaches under ERISA
    with respect to the investment

-23-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

and administrative management of the Northrop Grumman Savings
    Plan, including allegations of excessive, hidden

and/or

otherwise improper fee and expense charges. Among other things,
    the lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, removal of individuals
    acting as fiduciaries to such plans, payment of attorney fees
    and costs, and an accounting. The company does not believe, but
    can give no assurance, that the outcome of this matter would
    have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Other
    Matters

In the event of contract termination for the government’s
    convenience, contractors are normally protected by provisions
    covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the program. The
    company received a termination for convenience notice on the
    Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile (TSSAM) program in 1995. In
    December 1996, the company filed a lawsuit against the
    U.S. Government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims
    seeking the recovery of approximately $750 million for
    uncompensated performance costs, investments and a reasonable
    profit on the program. Prior to 1996, the company had charged to
    operations in excess of $600 million related to this
    program. Northrop Grumman is unable to predict whether it will
    realize some or all of its claims, none of which are recorded on
    its balance sheet, from the U.S. Government related to the
    TSSAM program.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

OVERVIEW

Business

Northrop Grumman provides technologically advanced, innovative
    products, services, and integrated solutions in information and
    services, aerospace, electronics, and shipbuilding to its global
    customers. As a system integrator, prime contractor, principal
    subcontractor, partner, or preferred supplier, Northrop Grumman
    participates in many high-priority defense and commercial
    technology programs in the United States (U.S.) and abroad.
    Northrop Grumman conducts most of its business with the
    U.S. Government, principally the Department of Defense
    (DoD). The company also conducts business with foreign
    governments and makes domestic and international commercial
    sales.

Outlook

U.S. defense contractors have benefited from the upward
    trend in overall defense spending over recent years. Certain
    programs in which the company participates may be subject to
    potential reductions due to a slower rate of growth in the
    U.S. Defense Budget forecasts and funds being diverted to
    support the on-going Global War on Terrorism and the reordering
    of  priorities by the DOD. Despite this trend, the company
    believes that its portfolio of technologically advanced,
    innovative products, services, and integrated solutions in
    systems integration, defense electronics, information
    technology, advanced aircraft, shipbuilding, technical services
    and space technology will generate revenue growth in 2007 and
    beyond. In 2007, based on total backlog (funded and unfunded) of
    approximately $61 billion as of December 31, 2006, the
    company expects sales to range between $31 and $32 billion
    and forecasts improvement in net income over 2006. The major
    industry and economic factors that may affect the company’s
    future performance are described in the following paragraphs.

Industry
    Factors

While Northrop Grumman is subject to the usual vagaries of the
    defense marketplace, it is also affected by the unique
    characteristics of the defense industry as a monopsony, and by
    certain elements peculiar to its own business mix. Northrop
    Grumman, along with Lockheed Martin Corporation, The Boeing
    Company, Raytheon Company, and General Dynamics Corporation are
    among the largest companies in the U.S. defense industry at
    this time. Northrop Grumman competes against these and other
    companies for a number of programs, both large and small.
    Intense competition and long operating cycles are both key
    characteristics of Northrop Grumman’s business and the
    defense industry. It is common in this industry for work on
    major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A
    company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate
    award of the contract to another party, turn out to be a
    subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting party. It is
    not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company
    and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of
    such competitor on other contracts. The nature of major defense
    programs, conducted under binding contracts, allows companies
    that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity
    not common in many industries.

The company’s success in the competitive defense industry
    depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and
    services, as well as its ability to provide the people,
    technologies, facilities, equipment, and financial capacity
    needed to deliver those products and services with maximum
    efficiency. It is necessary to maintain, as the company has,
    sources for raw materials, fabricated parts, electronic
    components, and major subassemblies. In this manufacturing and
    systems integration environment, effective oversight of
    subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing
    internal operations.

Economic
    Opportunities, Challenges, and Risks

The defense of the U.S. and its allies requires the ability to
    respond to one or more regional conflicts, terrorist acts, or
    threats to homeland security, and is increasingly dependent upon
    early threat identification. National responses to those threats
    may require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from
    dissuasion, deterrence, active defense, security and stability
    operations, or peacekeeping. The U.S. government continues
    to place a high priority on the protection of its engaged forces
    and citizenry, and in minimizing collateral damage when force

-28-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

must be applied in pursuit of national objectives. As a result,
    the U.S. and its military coalitions increasingly rely on
    sophisticated systems providing long-range surveillance and
    intelligence, battle management, and precision strike
    capabilities combined with the ability to rapidly deploy
    effective force to any region. Accordingly, defense procurement
    spending is expected to be weighted toward the development and
    procurement of military platforms and systems demonstrating the
    stealth, long-range, survivability, persistence and standoff
    capabilities that can overcome such obstacles to access.
    Additionally, advanced electronics and software that enhance the
    capabilities of individual systems and provide for the real-time
    integration of individual surveillance, information management,
    strike, and battle management platforms will also be required.

While the upward trend in overall defense spending may slow,
    U.S. budgets are expected to continue to exhibit real
    growth in the coming years. While defense spending in allied
    countries may not match that growth, many of those allies are
    focusing their development and procurement efforts on advanced
    electronics and information systems capabilities to enhance
    their interoperability with U.S. forces. Of note, the 2006
    Quadrennial Defense Review increased the DoD focus on
    intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), and joint
    command and control, in support of future budget submissions.
    The size of future U.S. and international defense budgets is
    expected to remain responsive to the international security
    environment. The 2008 budget submitted by the President requests
    $481.4 billion in discretionary authority for the DoD base
    budget (including $141.7 billion to continue the fight in
    the Global War on Terrorism), representing an 11.3 percent
    increase over the projected enacted level for fiscal 2007. While
    this budget includes proposed reductions in certain programs in
    which the company participates or for which the company expects
    to compete, the company believes that spending on
    recapitalization and transformation of homeland security and
    defense assets will continue to be a national priority, with
    particular emphasis on areas involving intelligence and
    non-conventional warfare capabilities.

U.S. Government programs in which Northrop Grumman either
    participates, or strives to participate, must compete with other
    programs for consideration during our nation’s budget
    formulation and appropriation processes. Budget decisions made
    in this environment will have long-term consequences for the
    size and structure of Northrop Grumman and the entire defense
    industry. Despite significant growth in the defense budget since
    2001, the percent of Gross Domestic Product dedicated to the
    nation’s defense has remained relatively constant.

Substantial new competitive opportunities for the company
    include a new aerial refueling tanker, the next-generation
    long-range bomber, space radar, unmanned vehicles,
    transformational satellite communications systems, restricted
    space-based programs, technical services and information
    technology contracts, and several international and homeland
    security programs. In pursuit of these opportunities, Northrop
    Grumman continues to focus on operational and financial
    performance for continued growth in 2007 and beyond.

Northrop Grumman has historically concentrated its efforts in
    high technology areas such as stealth, airborne surveillance,
    battle management, systems integration, defense electronics, and
    information technology. The company has a significant presence
    in federal and civil information systems; the manufacture of
    combatant ships including aircraft carriers and submarines;
    space technology; command, control, communications, computers,
    intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) and
    missile systems. The company believes that its programs are a
    high priority for national defense. Nevertheless, under
    budgetary pressures and emphasis on capabilities to conduct
    non-conventional warfare, there remains the possibility that one
    or more of them may be reduced, extended, or terminated by our
    U.S. Government customers.

The company provides certain product warranties that require
    repair or replacement of non-conforming items for a specified
    period of time. Most of the company’s product warranties
    are provided under government contracts, the costs of which are
    generally incorporated into contract pricing.

Prime contracts with various agencies of the
    U.S. Government and subcontracts with other prime
    contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations,
    including the False Claims Act and The International Traffic in
    Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act,
    with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in
    fines, penalties, debarment, or suspension from receiving
    additional contracts with all

-29-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

U.S. Government agencies. Given the company’s
    dependence on U.S. Government business, suspension or
    debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company.

BUSINESS
    ACQUISITIONS


– In October the company announced its
    intent to acquire Essex Corporation (Essex). On January 25,
    2007, the company completed its purchase of 100 percent of
    the common stock of Essex, valued at approximately
    $600 million, including the assumption of debt totaling
    $23 million and estimated transaction costs of
    $14 million. Essex provides signal processing services and
    products, and advanced optoelectronic imaging for
    U.S. government intelligence and defense customers. The
    operating results of Essex will be included as part of the
    Mission Systems segment from the date of acquisition. The
    assets, liabilities, and results of operations of Essex were not
    material.


– The company acquired Confluent RF
    Systems Corporation (Confluent) for $42 million, which
    included transaction costs of $2 million, and Integic
    Corporation (Integic) for $319 million, which included
    transaction costs of $6 million. The assets, liabilities,
    and results of operations of these acquired businesses were not
    material individually or in the aggregate, and thus pro-forma
    information is not presented.


– There were no significant acquisitions
    during 2004.

BUSINESS
    DISPOSITIONS


– The company sold the assembly business
    unit of Interconnect Technologies (Interconnect) and Winchester
    Electronics (Winchester) for net cash proceeds of
    $26 million and $17 million, respectively, and
    recognized an after-tax gain of $4 million and
    $3 million, respectively, in discontinued operations. The
    results of operations of Interconnect and Winchester, reported
    in the Electronics segment, were not material to any of the
    periods presented and have therefore not been reclassified as
    discontinued operations.

The Enterprise Information Technology (EIT) business, formerly
    reported in the Information Technology segment, was shut down
    and costs associated with the exit activities were not material.
    The results of operations of this business are reported as
    discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of
    income, net of applicable income taxes, for all periods
    presented.


– The company sold Teldix GmbH (Teldix)
    for $57 million in cash and recognized an after-tax gain of
    $14 million in discontinued operations. The results of
    operations of Teldix, reported in the Electronics segment, were
    not material to any of the periods presented and have therefore
    not been reclassified as discontinued operations.


– The company’s Canadian navigation
    systems and space sensors systems business and Kester were sold
    for cash of $65 million and $60 million, respectively,
    and the company recorded an after-tax gain of $12 million
    and $2 million, respectively, in discontinued operations.
    The results of operations of these businesses were not material
    to any of the periods presented and have therefore not been
    reclassified as discontinued operations.

CONTRACTS

The majority of the company’s business is generated from
    long-term government contracts for development, production, and
    service activities. Government contracts typically include the
    following cost elements: direct material, labor and
    subcontracting costs, and certain indirect costs including
    allowable general and administrative costs. Unless otherwise
    specified in a contract, costs billed to contracts with the
    U.S. Government are determined under the requirements of
    the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Cost Accounting
    Standards (CAS) regulations as allowable and allocable costs.
    Examples of costs incurred by the company and not billed to the
    U.S. Government in accordance with the requirements of the
    FAR and CAS regulations include, but are not limited to, certain
    legal costs, lobbying costs, charitable donations, and
    advertising costs.

The company’s long-term contracts typically fall into one
    of two broad categories:

Flexibly Priced Contracts

– Includes both
    cost-type and fixed-price incentive contracts. Cost-type
    contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s
    allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit.
    Cost-type contracts generally require that the contractor use
    its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some
    specified time and some stated dollar limitation. Fixed-price
    incentive contracts also provide for reimbursement of the
    contractor’s allowable costs, but are subject to a
    cost-share limit which affects profitability. Fixed-price
    incentive contracts effectively become firm fixed-price
    contracts once the cost-share limit is reached.

Firm Fixed-Price Contracts

– A firm fixed-price
    contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is
    agreed to for a price that is a pre-determined, negotiated
    amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of
    costs incurred by the contractor.

Contract Fees

– Negotiated contract fee
    structures, for both flexibly priced and fixed-price contracts
    may include, but are not limited to: fixed-fee amounts, cost
    sharing arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or
    over cost target performance, positive award fees, and negative
    penalty arrangements. Profit margins may vary materially
    depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements,

percentage-of-completion

of the contract, the achievement of performance objectives, and
    the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees,
    particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally
    determined.

Positive Award Fees

– Certain contracts contain
    provisions consisting of award fees based on performance
    criteria such as: cost, schedule, quality, and technical
    ingenuity. Award fees are determined and earned based on the
    subjective evaluation by the customer of the company’s
    performance against such negotiated criteria. Award fee
    contracts are widely used throughout the company’s
    operating segments. Examples of significant long-term contracts
    with substantial negotiated award fee amounts are the Kinetic
    Energy Interceptor (KEI), F-35 SDD,

E-2D

SDD,
    LPD, and DDG-1000 programs.

Compliance and Monitoring

– On a regular basis,
    the company monitors its policies and procedures with respect to
    its contracts to ensure consistent application under similar
    terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable
    government regulations. In addition, costs incurred and
    allocated to contracts with the U.S. Government are
    routinely audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS

The company’s significant accounting policies are outlined
    in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements (see in
    Part II, Item 8 of this

Form 10-K).

The preparation of these financial statements requires
    management to make estimates and judgments that affect the
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses,
    as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
    As part of its oversight responsibilities, management evaluates
    the propriety of its estimates, judgments, and accounting
    methods as new events occur. Management believes that its
    policies, judgments, and assessments have been consistently
    applied in a manner that provides the reader of the
    company’s consolidated financial statements with a fair
    presentation of information, in all material respects, in
    accordance with GAAP. Management periodically reviews the
    company’s critical accounting policies and estimates with
    the audit committee of its board of directors. Principal
    accounting practices that involve a higher degree of judgment or
    complexity are outlined below.

    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Revenue
    Recognition

Overview

– The majority of the company’s
    business is derived from long-term contracts for the
    construction of facilities, production of goods, and services
    provided to the federal government, which are accounted for
    under the provisions of Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 45 –

Accounting for
    Long-Term Construction-Type Contracts

, American Institute of
    Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP)

No. 81-1 –

Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain
    Production-Type Contracts

, and the AICPA Audit and
    Accounting Guide,

Audits of Federal Government
    Contractors

. The Company classifies contract revenues as
    product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant
    attributes of the relevant underlying contracts.

The company also enters into contracts that are not associated
    with the construction of facilities, production of goods, and
    services provided to the federal government, such as contracts
    to provide certain services to non-federal government customers.
    The company accounts for those contracts in accordance with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

, and
    other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature.

The company considers the nature of these contracts and the
    types of products and services provided when it determines the
    proper accounting method for a particular contract.

Percentage-of-Completion Accounting

– The
    company generally recognizes revenue from its long-term
    contracts under the cost-to-cost and the units-of-delivery
    measures of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.
    The percentage-of-completion method recognizes income as work on
    a contract progresses. For most contracts, sales are calculated
    based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to
    total estimated costs at completion of the contract. For certain
    contracts with large up-front purchases of material, primarily
    in the Ships segment, sales are generally calculated based on
    the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total
    estimated direct labor costs. The units-of-delivery measure is a
    modification of the percentage-of-completion method, which
    recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer
    generally using unit sales value in accordance with the contract
    terms. The company estimates profit as the difference between
    total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract
    and recognizes that profit evenly over the life of the contract
    based on deliveries.

The use of the

percentage-of-completion

method depends on the ability of the company to make reasonably
    dependable cost estimates for the design, manufacture, and
    delivery of its products and services. Such costs are typically
    incurred over a period of several years, and estimation of these
    costs requires the use of judgment. Sales under cost-type
    contracts are recorded as costs are incurred.

Many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives
    based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that
    may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product. These
    incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be
    earned or penalties to be incurred. Incentives and award fees
    that can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the
    performance period of the contract. Incentives and award fees
    that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or
    at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made.

Other changes in estimates of contract sales, costs, and profits
    are recognized using the cumulative

catch-up

method of accounting. This method recognizes in the current
    period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior
    periods. Hence, the effect of the changes on future periods of
    contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimates
    had been the original estimates. A significant change in an
    estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on
    the company’s financial position or results of operations.

Certain Service Contracts

– Revenue under
    contracts to provide services to non-federal government
    customers are generally recognized when services are performed.
    Service contracts include operations and maintenance contracts,
    and outsourcing-type arrangements, primarily in the Information
    and Services business. Revenue under such contracts is generally
    recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of contract
    performance, unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned
    or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Costs
    incurred under these service contracts are expensed as incurred,
    except that direct and incremental

set-up

costs

-32-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement.
    Operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate
    from period to period, particularly in the earlier phases of the
    contract.

Service contracts that include more than one type of product or
    service are accounted for under the provisions of Emerging
    Issues Task Force Issue

No. 00-21 –

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

.
    Accordingly, for applicable arrangements, revenue recognition
    includes the proper identification of separate units of
    accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements
    based on relative fair values.

Cost Estimation

– The cost estimation process
    requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional
    knowledge and experience of the company’s engineers,
    program managers, and financial professionals. Factors that are
    considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate
    contract recovery include the availability and productivity of
    labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed,
    the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the
    effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of
    funding from the customer, and the recoverability of any claims
    included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in
    an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect
    on the company’s financial position or results of
    operations. Contract cost estimates are updated at least
    annually and more frequently as determined by events or
    circumstances. Cost and revenue estimates for each significant
    contract are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly.

When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract
    exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned, a provision for
    the entire loss on the contract is recorded to cost of sales in
    the period the loss is determined. Loss provisions are first
    offset against costs that are included in inventoried assets,
    with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities.

Purchase
    Accounting and Goodwill

Overview

– The purchase price of an acquired
    business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their
    respective fair market values, with the excess recorded as
    goodwill. Such fair market value assessments require judgments
    and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and
    other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ
    materially from original estimates. Adjustments to fair value
    assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price
    allocation period (typically not exceeding a twelve month
    period) with the exception of certain adjustments related to
    income tax uncertainties or restructuring activities, the
    resolution of which may extend beyond the purchase price
    allocation period.

Acquisition Accruals

– The company has
    established certain accruals in connection with indemnities and
    other contingencies from its acquisitions and divestitures.
    These accruals and subsequent adjustments have been recorded
    during the purchase price allocation period for acquisitions and
    as events occur for divestitures. The accruals were determined
    based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and, in
    most cases, involve a significant degree of judgment. Management
    has recorded these accruals in accordance with its
    interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements,
    known facts, and an estimation of probable future events based
    on management’s experience and consultation with outside
    valuation specialists.

Goodwill

– The company evaluates the
    recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually in
    November, or when evidence of potential impairment exists, in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 142 –

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets

. In order to test for potential impairment, the
    company uses a discounted cash flow analysis, corroborated by
    comparative market multiples where appropriate.

The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis
    requiring judgment are the projected results of operations,
    weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and terminal value
    growth rate assumptions. The WACC takes into account the
    relative weights of each component of the company’s
    consolidated capital structure (equity and debt) and represents
    the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to
    consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term
    contracts and barriers to market entry. The terminal value
    growth rates are applied to the final year of the discounted
    cash flow model.

-33-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a
    reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of the
    company’s recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions may
    have a material effect on the results of the company’s
    impairment analysis.

Litigation,
    Commitments, and Contingencies

Overview

– The company is subject to a range of
    claims, lawsuits, environmental and income tax matters, and
    administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these
    matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional
    knowledge and experience of management and its internal and
    external legal counsel. In accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies,

amounts are recorded as
    charges to earnings when management, after taking into
    consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter,
    including any settlement offers, has determined that it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate resolution of
    any such exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates
    as further facts and circumstances become known.

While the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these
    matters, resolution of one or more of these matters, either
    individually or in the aggregate, could have a material effect
    on the company’s financial position, results of operations,
    or cash flows.

Environmental Accruals

– The company is subject
    to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions
    in which it conducts operations. The company records an accrual
    to provide for the costs of expected environmental obligations
    when management becomes aware that an expenditure will be
    incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably
    estimated. Factors which could result in changes to the
    company’s assessment of probability, range of loss, and
    environmental accruals include: modification of planned remedial
    actions, increase or decrease in the estimated time required to
    remediate, discovery of more extensive contamination than
    anticipated, results of efforts to determine legally responsible
    parties, changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation
    requirements, and improvements in remediation technology.

Litigation Accruals

– Litigation accruals are
    recorded as charges to earnings when management, after taking
    into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter,
    including any settlement offers, has determined that it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate resolution of
    any exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as
    further facts and circumstances become known.

Tax Contingency Accruals –

The company records
    accruals for tax contingencies and related interest when it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    the contingency can be reasonably estimated based on specific
    events such as an audit or inquiry by a taxing authority.
    Changes in accruals associated with uncertainties arising from
    pre-acquisition years for acquired businesses are charged or
    credited to goodwill. Adjustments to other tax accruals are
    generally recorded in earnings in the period they are
    determined. Effective January 1, 2007, the company will
    measure and record tax contingency accruals in accordance with
    Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation
    No. 48 –

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes – an Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8.

Retirement
    Benefits

Overview

– Assumptions used in determining
    projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets
    for the company’s pension plans and other postretirement
    benefits plans are evaluated annually by management in
    consultation with its outside actuaries. In the event that the
    company determines that plan amendments or changes in the
    assumptions are warranted, future pension and postretirement
    benefit expenses could increase or decrease.

Assumptions

– The principal assumptions that
    have a significant effect on the company’s financial
    position and results of operations are the discount rate, the
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and the health
    care cost trend rates.

-34-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Discount Rate

– The discount rate represents
    the interest rate that should be used to determine the present
    value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to
    settle the pension and postretirement benefit obligations. The
    discount rate is generally based on the yield on high-quality
    corporate fixed-income investments. At the end of each year, the
    discount rate is primarily determined based on the results of a
    hypothetical long-term bond portfolio matching the expected cash
    inflows with the expected benefit payments for each benefit
    plan. Taking into consideration the factors noted above, the
    company’s composite discount rate was 6 percent at
    December 31, 2006, and 5.75 percent at
    December 31, 2005.

Expected Long-Term Rate of Return

– The
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets represents the
    average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to
    provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations. For
    2006 and 2005, the company assumed an expected long-term rate of
    return on plan assets of 8.5 percent.

Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of
    return on plan assets within the range indicated below would
    have had the following impacts on 2006 pension and other
    postretirement benefits results:

Health Care Cost Trend Rates

– The health care
    cost trend rates represent the annual rates of change in the
    cost of health care benefits based on estimates of health care
    inflation, changes in health care utilization or delivery
    patterns, technological advances, and changes in the health
    status of the plan participants. For 2006, the company assumed
    an expected initial health care cost trend rate of
    8.75 percent and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of
    5 percent. In 2005, the company assumed an expected initial
    health care cost trend rate of 10 percent and an ultimate
    health care cost trend rate of 5 percent.

Differences in the initial through the ultimate health care cost
    trend rates within the range indicated below would have had the

MANAGEMENT
    FINANCIAL MEASURES

The company manages and assesses the performance of its business
    primarily through the following measures:

Contract Acquisitions

– Contract acquisitions
    represent orders received during the period for which funding
    has been contractually obligated by the customer. Contract
    acquisitions tend to fluctuate from year to year and are
    determined by the size and timing of new and follow-on orders.
    In the year that a business is purchased, its existing funded
    order backlog as of the purchase date is reported as contract
    acquisitions. In the year that a business is sold, its existing
    funded order backlog as of the divestiture date is deducted from
    contract acquisitions.

Sales

–

Year-to-year

sales vary less than contract acquisitions and reflect
    performance under new and ongoing contracts. For further
    information related to revenue recognition, refer to the Revenue
    Recognition discussion included in the “Critical Accounting
    Policies, Estimates, and Judgments” section of this
    Part II, Item 7.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Segment Operating Margin

– Segment operating
    margin reflects the performance of segment contracts and
    programs. Excluded from this measure are certain costs not
    directly associated with contract performance, including the
    portion of corporate expenses such as management and
    administration, legal, environmental, certain compensation and
    retiree benefits, and other expenses not considered allowable or
    allocable under applicable CAS regulations and the Federal
    Acquisition Regulation, and therefore not allocated to the
    segments.

Backlog

– Funded backlog represents unfilled
    orders for which funding has been contractually obligated by the
    customer. Unfunded backlog represents firm orders for which
    funding is not contractually obligated by the customer. Unfunded
    backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded
    Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) orders. For
    multi-year services contracts with non-federal government
    customers having no stated contract values, backlog includes
    only the amounts committed by the customer.

Sales and
    Service Revenues


– Sales in 2006 increased $81 million
    as compared with 2005. The increase was primarily due to
    increased revenues in the Information Technology and Technical
    Services segments, partially offset by decreased revenues at the
    Ships segment. Information Technology segment sales increased
    $260 million due to new business primarily from the
    Virginia and San Diego County information technology
    outsourcing contracts and higher sales volume in the United
    Kingdom Whole Life Support Programme and the Systems and
    Software Engineering Services program. Technical Services
    segment revenues increased $256 million primarily due to
    new business from the Nevada Test Site program. Ships segment
    sales decreased $465 million due primarily to decreased
    volume in the DDG 1000 program (formerly known as the DD(X)
    program) and continued recovery from the impact of Hurricane
    Katrina (See Note 17 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8).


– Sales in 2005 increased
    $1.1 billion, or 4 percent, over 2004 due to increased
    revenue in each of the company’s operating segments except
    Ships, including sales growth of 19 percent at Integrated
    Systems. The increase at Integrated Systems was due primarily to
    higher volume in the

E-2D

Advanced Hawkeye, EA-18G, Unmanned Systems, B-2, and
    Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP)
    programs, partially offset by lower volume in the

F/A-18

and
    Joint STARS programs. Ships segment sales decreased
    7 percent in 2005 due primarily to decreased volume in the
    DDG 1000 and LHD programs and Hurricane Katrina-related work
    delays.

Unallocated Expenses

– Unallocated expenses
    increased $97 million, or 51 percent, in 2006 as
    compared with 2005. The increase in unallocated expenses is
    primarily due to a $112.5 million pre-tax legal provision
    recorded in 2006 (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8). Unallocated expenses
    decreased $92 million, or 33 percent, in 2005 as
    compared with 2004. The decrease was primarily due to lower
    legal costs in 2005, as the 2004 legal costs included provisions
    related to the resolution of the Allison Gas Turbine and
    Robinson litigations.

Also included in unallocated expenses is the cost of medical and
    life benefits to the extent not currently recoverable under CAS.
    In November 2006, the company adopted plan amendments and
    communicated to plan participants that it would cap the amount
    of its contributions to substantially all of its remaining post
    retirement medical and life benefit plans that were previously
    not subject to limits on the company’s contributions. The
    change in benefits announced in November 2006 reduced benefit
    costs by approximately $17 million in 2006. In addition,
    this change reduced the company’s aggregate benefit
    obligation by approximately $465 million at
    December 31, 2006. Subsequent to January 1, 2005 (or
    earlier at some sectors), newly hired employees are not eligible
    for post employment medical and life benefits.

Net Pension Expense Adjustment

– The net
    pension expense adjustment reflects the excess pension expense
    determined in accordance with GAAP over the pension expense
    allocated to the operating segments under CAS. The net pension
    expense adjustment increased to $37 million in 2006, as
    compared with $21 million in 2005, and increased
    $9 million in 2005 as compared with 2004. Both increases
    reflect the timing of cost recognition between GAAP and CAS.

For 2007, subject to refinements for participant census data and
    pay-as-you-go plans, management expects the net pension expense
    adjustment to total approximately $70 million in income
    primarily due to an increase in the discount rate, voluntary
    pre-funding during 2006, and higher than expected return on plan
    assets during 2006. The 2007 pension plan assumptions include an
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of
    8.5 percent and a composite discount rate of 6 percent.

Reversal of Royalty Income

– Royalty income is
    included in segment operating margin for internal reporting
    purposes. This amount is reversed in the table above to arrive
    at operating margin as determined in accordance with GAAP as
    royalty income is included in the “Other, net” line
    item discussed below.

Net
    Interest Expense


– Net interest expense decreased
    $31 million, or 9 percent, in 2006 as compared with
    2005. The decrease was primarily due to a lower average debt
    balance in 2006 resulting from debt maturities totaling
    $1.2 billion in 2006.

2005 – Net interest expense decreased
    $39 million, or 10 percent, in 2005 as compared with
    2004. The decrease was primarily due to a lower average debt
    balance in 2005 resulting from a $600 million reduction in
    debt in the fourth quarter of 2004.

    Acquisitions


– Electronics contract acquisitions
    increased $821 million, or 13 percent, in 2006 as
    compared with 2005. Significant acquisitions in 2006 included
    $270 million for the Vehicular Intercommunications program,
    $261 million for the Space-Based Infrared System program,
    $160 million for the F-22 program, $153 million for
    the Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder program,
    $150 million for the Bio-Detection program,
    $148 million for the Mark VII program, and
    $125 million for the AFSM-ai Follow On program.


– Electronics contract acquisitions
    decreased $196 million, or 3 percent, in 2005 as
    compared with 2004. This decrease is primarily due to a
    $205 million backlog reduction resulting from the sale of
    Teldix. Significant acquisitions in 2005 included
    $202 million for the F-22 program and $186 million for
    the Space-Based Infrared System program.

Sales and
    Service Revenues


– Electronics revenue decreased
    $24 million, or less than 1 percent, in 2006 as
    compared with 2005. The decrease was primarily due to lower
    sales volume in the F-16 Block 60 and Longbow Missile
    programs as these programs near completion, partially offset by
    higher sales in automated flat sorting machines to the
    U.S. Postal Service, vehicle intercommunications systems
    and infrared countermeasures programs. Sales for 2006 also
    included adjustments resulting from charges for the MESA
    Wedgetail and Peace Eagle fixed-price development airborne
    surveillance programs.


– Electronics revenue increased
    $212 million, or 3 percent, in 2005 as compared with
    2004. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth in
    infrared countermeasure programs and bio-detection and vehicle
    intercommunications systems.

Segment
    Operating Margin


– Electronics operating margin increased
    $42 million, or 6 percent, in 2006 as compared with
    2005. The increase was primarily due to $55 million lower
    amortization expense and includes net performance improvements
    totaling $44 million on various programs. Operating margin
    for 2006 included a $51 million

pre-tax

charge for the Wedgetail contract and a $42 million pre-tax
    charge for the Peace Eagle contract (both under the MESA
    program), and a $28 million pre-tax charge for the
    ASPIS II program. These charges primarily reflect the
    impact of development, test & evaluation schedule
    extension, required hardware modifications and related
    retrofits. Operating margin for 2005 included a $65 million
    pre-tax charge for the F-16 Block 60 fixed-price
    development combat avionics program. The charge reflected a
    higher estimate of costs to complete the Falcon Edge electronic
    warfare suite, including rework of the mission software.


– Electronics operating margin increased
    $41 million, or 6 percent, in 2005 as compared with
    2004. The increase includes net performance improvements
    totaling $19 million primarily from Homeland Security
    programs. Volume changes contributed $23 million to the
    2005 operating margin increase, primarily driven by higher sales
    volume in infrared countermeasure programs and bio-detection and
    vehicle intercommunications systems. Operating margin for 2005
    also included a $65 million pre-tax charge for the F-16
    Block 60 fixed-price development combat avionics program.
    Operating margin for 2004 included a $60 million pre-tax
    charge for

F-16

Block 60 and a $52 million pre-tax charge for the
    Wedgetail program. The F-16 Block 60 charge reflected a
    higher estimate of costs to complete the Falcon Edge electronic
    warfare suite, including the results of qualification testing
    and the impact of delays in supplies of integrated
    microelectronic assemblies. The Wedgetail charge reflected
    increased projected costs due to analysis of technical issues
    following systems engineering modeling and qualification testing
    for the MESA program.

    $172 million for the Toledo Depot Modernization Period
    program, $168 million for the LHD program, and
    $116 million for the LHA program.


– Ships segment contract acquisitions
    decreased $2.9 billion, or 52 percent, in 2005,
    compared with 2004. The decrease was primarily due to fiscal
    year funding delays impacting

USS Carl Vinson

RCOH and
    CVN 21, as well as decreased funding for the

Virginia

Class Block II program and the DDG 1000 program.
    The principal acquisitions in 2005 included $535 million
    for the LPD program, $469 million for the

Virginia

class Block II program, $236 million for the
    DDG 1000 program, $232 million for the

USS George
    Washington

Docking Planned Incremental Availability (DPIA)
    program, and $160 million for the Deepwater program.

Sales and
    Service Revenues


– Ships revenue decreased
    $465 million, or 8 percent, in 2006 as compared with
    2005. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume in
    the DDG 1000 program driven by the transition from
    Phase III to Phase IV and changes in the Navy
    acquisition strategy regarding major

sub-contractors,

as well as continued recovery from the impact of Hurricane
    Katrina in the LPD program. The decrease was partially offset by
    higher sales in the

USS Carl Vinson

, DDG 51, WMSL (NSC),
    and LHA programs.


– Ships revenue decreased
    $466 million, or 7 percent, in 2005, as compared with
    2004, partially due to a $158 million reduction of sales
    from Hurricane Katrina-related work delays, an $82 million
    adjustment of prior sales to account for Hurricane
    Katrina-related cost growth across several Ships programs, and a
    slow build rate, as a result of property damage following
    Hurricane Katrina. The decrease also included lower volume in
    the DDG 1000 program. These decreases were partially offset by
    increased sales volume in the

Virginia

class Block II,

USS George Washington

DPIA, CVN 21, and WMSL (NSC) programs.

Segment
    Operating Margin


– Ships operating margin increased
    $144 million, or 58 percent, in 2006 as compared with
    2005. The increase was primarily due to a prior year charge of
    $150 million to account for Hurricane Katrina-related cost
    growth, as well as a $15 million impact from Hurricane
    Katrina-related work delays (see Note 17 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8).
    The 2006 operating margin includes a pension benefit resulting
    from the Pension Protection Act of 2006. These increases were
    partially offset by lower sales volume in the DDG 1000 program.


– Ships operating margin decreased
    $146 million, or 37 percent, in 2005, as compared with
    2004. The decrease included a $150 million charge to
    account for Hurricane Katrina-related cost growth, as well as a
    $15 million impact from Hurricane Katrina-related work
    delays (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8). This decrease was
    partially offset by performance improvement on the

USS Dwight D. Eisenhower

program.

BACKLOG

Total backlog at December 31, 2006, was approximately
    $61 billion. Total backlog includes both funded backlog
    (unfilled orders for which funding is contractually obligated by
    the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which
    funding is not currently contractually obligated by the
    customer). Unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract
    options and unfunded IDIQ orders. For multi-year services
    contracts with non-federal government customers having no stated
    contract values, backlog includes only the amounts committed by
    the customer. Major components in unfunded backlog as of
    December 31, 2006, included various restricted programs,
    the Kinetic Energy Interceptors program in the Mission Systems
    segment; the F-35,

F/A-18,

and

E-2

Advanced
    Hawkeye programs in the Integrated Systems segment; the NPOESS
    program in the Space Technology segment; and Block II of
    the

Operating
    Activities


– In 2006, cash provided by operating
    activities was $1.8 billion as compared with
    $2.6 billion in 2005. The decrease was primarily due to
    contributions to the company’s pension plans totaling
    $1.2 billion, of which $800 million was voluntarily
    pre-funded in the fourth quarter, as compared to contributions
    of $415 million in 2005, of which $203 million was
    voluntarily pre-funded in the fourth quarter. In August 2006,
    the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Act) was enacted into
    law. While the impact of the Act is still being evaluated, the
    company does not expect it to have any significant effect on its
    current funding strategy for its U.S. pension plans.

Cash collected from customers decreased by $231 million,
    and cash paid to suppliers and employees increased by
    $302 million. Net cash from operating activities for 2006
    included the receipt of $100 million of insurance proceeds
    related to Hurricane Katrina, $60 million of federal and
    state income tax refunds, and $45 million of interest.

At December 31, 2006, net working capital deficit (current
    assets less current liabilities) was $34 million, primarily
    reflecting a lower cash balance offset by a lower current
    portion of long-term debt.


– In 2005, cash provided by operating
    activities was $2.6 billion as compared with
    $1.9 billion in 2004. The increase was primarily due to the
    timing of cash receipts and payments. Cash collected from
    customers increased by $1.5 billion, and cash paid to
    suppliers and employees increased by $1.2 billion.

Net cash from operating activities for 2005 included the receipt
    of $89 million of insurance proceeds related to Hurricane
    Katrina, $88 million of federal and state income tax
    refunds, and $78 million of interest, including

-48-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

interest on a state tax refund for research and development
    credits for the years 1988 through 1990. These cash inflows were
    offset by a payment of $99 million for a litigation
    settlement.

Employer contributions to the company’s pension plans were
    $415 million in 2005 as compared with $624 million in
    2004. The contributions include voluntary pre-funding payments
    of $203 million and $250 million in 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. Interest payments decreased $39 million in
    2005 as compared with 2004, due to further reduction in
    fixed-rate debt.

At December 31, 2005, net working capital deficit (current
    assets less current liabilities) was $423 million,
    primarily driven by an increased current portion of long-term
    debt.


– In 2004, cash provided by operating
    activities was $1.9 billion as compared with
    $798 million in 2003. In 2003, cash used in operations
    included $1 billion of taxes paid upon completion of the
    B-2 EMD contract.

In 2004, the company’s appeal to the Supreme Court of
    Indiana in connection with the Allison Gas Turbine case was
    denied and the company paid $81 million in settlement of
    the judgment and interest.

In 2004, the company and Goodrich agreed to a settlement to
    resolve certain post-closing liabilities that related to
    warranty, customer claims, and certain other matters in exchange
    for a payment to Goodrich of $99 million. The company also
    resolved an indemnification of other post-employment benefits,
    pursuant to the TRW Auto sale agreement, and paid an affiliate
    of The Blackstone Group $52.5 million.

Employer contributions to the company’s pension plans
    increased $295 million from $329 million in 2003 to
    $624 million in 2004. The increase reflects a voluntary
    pre-funding of $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.
    No such pre-funding payment was made in 2003. Interest payments
    decreased $150 million in 2004 as compared with 2003,
    primarily due to a reduction in fixed-rate debt.

Investing
    Activities


– Cash used in investing activities was
    $601 million in 2006. During 2006, the company received
    $209 million from the sale of the remaining
    9.7 million of its TRW Auto common shares. Also during
    2006, Ship Systems received access to $200 million from the
    issuance of Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue
    Bonds (see discussion in “Financing Activities” below)
    of which $127 million remained restricted as of
    December 31, 2006. In addition, the company received
    $117 million of insurance proceeds related to Hurricane
    Katrina, paid $77 million for

set-up

costs
    in relation to initiation of outsourcing contracts, and paid
    $35 million for the purchase of an investment.

During 2006, the company also received $43 million from the
    sales of Interconnect and Winchester.

Capital expenditures in 2006 were $737 million, including
    $111 million to replace property damaged by Hurricane
    Katrina and $36 million of capitalized software costs.
    Capital expenditure commitments at December 31, 2006 were
    approximately $443 million, which are expected to be paid
    with cash on hand and restricted cash.


– Cash used in investing activities was
    $855 million in 2005. During 2005, the company paid
    $361 million to acquire two businesses. This includes the
    acquisition of Confluent in September 2005 and Integic in March
    2005. The company received $238 million from the sale of
    investments, including $95 million for 3.4 million
    common shares of Endwave and $143 million for
    7.3 million common shares of TRW Auto. During 2005, the
    company also received $57 million from the sale of Teldix.

The company received insurance proceeds of $38 million in
    2005 to replace damaged property at the Ships segment as a
    result of Hurricane Katrina.

Capital expenditures in 2005 were $824 million, including
    $80 million to replace property damaged by Hurricane
    Katrina and $41 million of capitalized software costs.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION


– Cash provided by investing activities
    was $9 million in 2004. On November 12, 2004, the
    company received $493.5 million, from the repurchase of the
    TRW Auto

payment-in-kind

note, which was net of $40.5 million for settlement of
    certain contractual issues arising from the sale of TRW Auto.

During 2004, the company received $125 million from the
    sale of businesses including Kester, one of the former
    Components Technologies businesses, in February 2004 for
    approximately $60 million, and Northrop Grumman Canada in
    December 2004 for approximately $65 million.

Capital expenditures in 2004 were $672 million, including
    $53 million for capitalized software costs.

Financing
    Activities


– Cash used in financing activities in
    2006 was $1.7 billion comprised primarily of
    $1.2 billion in repayments of long-term debt,
    $825 million in share repurchases, and $402 million of
    dividends paid to shareholders, partially offset by
    $393 million in proceeds from exercises of stock options
    and $200 million of debt incurred in relation to the Gulf
    Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue Bonds.

In March 2006, the company repaid a $400 million
    7.0 percent debenture at maturity and a $35 million
    7.625 percent debenture at maturity. In May 2006, the
    company repaid an $85 million 8.75 percent debenture
    at maturity. In November 2006, the company repaid a
    $690 million 4.08 percent senior note at maturity.

Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue
    Bonds

– In December 2006, Ship Systems entered
    into a loan agreement with the Mississippi Business Finance
    Corporation (MBFC) under which Ship Systems received access to
    $200 million from the issuance of Gulf Opportunity Zone
    Industrial Development Revenue Bonds by the MBFC. The loan
    accrues interest payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of
    4.55 percent per annum. The bonds are subject to redemption
    at the company’s discretion on or after December 1,
    2016, and mature on December 1, 2028. The bonds will be
    repaid by Ship Systems in accordance with the terms stipulated
    in the loan agreement. The bond issuance proceeds must be used
    to finance the construction, reconstruction, and renovation of
    the company’s interest in certain ship manufacturing and
    repair facilities, or portions thereof, located in the state of
    Mississippi. As of December 31, 2006, $73 million was
    used by Ship Systems and the remaining $127 million was
    recorded in miscellaneous other assets as restricted cash in the
    consolidated statements of financial position in Part II,
    Item 8. Repayment of the bonds is guaranteed by the company.

Share Repurchases

– On October 24, 2005,
    the company’s board of directors authorized a share
    repurchase program of up to $1.5 billion of its outstanding
    common stock, which commenced in November 2005 and under which
    $176 million is remaining.

Under this program, the company entered into an initial
    agreement with Credit Suisse, New York Branch (Credit Suisse) on
    November 4, 2005, to repurchase approximately
    9.1 million shares of common stock at an initial price of
    $55.15 per share for a total of $500 million. Credit Suisse
    immediately borrowed shares that were sold to and canceled by
    the company. Subsequently, Credit Suisse purchased shares in the
    open market to settle its share borrowings. On March 1,
    2006, Credit Suisse completed its purchases under this
    agreement, and the company paid $37 million for the final
    price adjustment under the terms of the agreement. The final
    average purchase price was $59.05 per share.

The company entered into a second agreement with Credit Suisse
    on March 6, 2006, to repurchase approximately
    11.6 million shares of common stock at an initial price of
    $64.78 per share for a total of $750 million. Under
    this agreement, Credit Suisse immediately borrowed shares that
    were sold to and canceled by the company. Subsequently, Credit
    Suisse purchased shares in the open market to settle its share
    borrowings. On May 26, 2006, Credit Suisse completed its
    purchases under this agreement, and the company paid
    $37 million for the final price adjustment under the terms
    of the agreement. The final average purchase price was
    $68.01 per share.

On December 14, 2006, the company’s board of directors
    authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion
    of its outstanding common stock. This new authorization is in
    addition to $176 million remaining

-50-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

on the company’s previous share repurchase authorization
    for a total of $1.176 billion authorized for share
    repurchases.

Share repurchases take place at management’s discretion and
    under pre-established non-discretionary programs from time to
    time, depending on market conditions, in the open market, and in
    privately negotiated transactions. The company retires its
    common stock upon repurchase and has not made any purchases of
    common stock other than in connection with these publicly
    announced repurchase programs.


– Cash used in financing activities in
    2005 was $1.4 billion comprised primarily of
    $1.2 billion in share repurchases and $359 million in
    dividends paid to shareholders, partially offset by
    $163 million in proceeds from exercises of stock options.


– Cash of $1 billion was used in
    financing activities in 2004, comprised primarily of
    $786 million in share repurchases, $725 million in
    principal payments of long-term debt, and $322 million in
    dividends paid to shareholders, partially offset by
    $834 million in proceeds from exercises of stock options.

Debt Reduction

– On October 15, 2004, the
    company redeemed all of its outstanding $250 million
    9.375 percent debentures due 2024. The redemption price was
    104.363 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and
    unpaid interest through the redemption date. As a result of the
    redemption, the company recorded a $13 million pre-tax
    charge in 2004. Also, on October 15, 2004,
    $350 million of 8.625 percent notes matured.

Equity Security Units

– In November 2001, the
    company issued 6.9 million equity security units. Each
    equity security unit, issued at $100 per unit, initially
    consisted of a contract to purchase shares of Northrop Grumman
    common stock on November 16, 2004, and a $100 senior note
    due 2006. The senior notes due 2006 were reported as long-term
    debt in 2005. The senior notes initially bore interest at
    5.25 percent per annum, and each equity security unit paid
    a contract adjustment payment of 2.0 percent per annum
    through November 16, 2004, for a combined yield on the
    equity security unit of 7.25 percent per annum through
    November 16, 2004. On August 11, 2004, the company
    remarketed the senior notes as required by the original terms of
    the equity security units. As a result of this remarketing, the
    interest rate on the senior notes was reset to 4.08 percent
    per annum effective August 16, 2004. Proceeds from the
    remarketed notes were used to purchase U.S. Treasury
    securities that were pledged to secure the stock purchase
    obligations of the unit holders and held with a collateral
    agent. The notes were repaid on November 16, 2006. On
    November 16, 2004, the company received $690 million
    and issued 13.2 million shares of common stock in
    settlement of the stock purchase contracts. The number of shares
    issued was calculated using a conversion ratio of
    1.9171 shares per each equity security unit, which was
    determined in accordance with the original terms of the stock
    purchase contracts.

Credit
    Facility

On August 5, 2005, the company entered into a new credit
    agreement which provides for a five-year revolving credit
    facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2 billion.
    The credit facility permits the company to request additional
    lending commitments from the lenders under the agreement or
    other eligible lenders under certain circumstances, and thereby
    to increase the aggregate principal amount of the lending
    commitments under the agreement by up to an additional
    $500 million. The agreement provides for swingline loans
    and letters of credit as

sub-facilities

for the credit facilities provided for in the agreement.
    Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at various
    rates, including the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR),
    adjusted based on the company’s credit rating, or an
    alternate base rate plus an incremental margin. The credit
    facility also requires a facility fee based on the daily
    aggregate amount of commitments (whether or not utilized) and
    the company’s credit rating level. The company’s
    credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that are
    less restrictive than those contained in the prior credit
    agreement. At December 31, 2006, and 2005, there was no
    balance outstanding under this facility and there were no
    borrowings under this facility at any time during 2006 or 2005.

Concurrent with the effectiveness of the new credit agreement,
    the 2001 credit agreement, for $2.5 billion, terminated on
    August 5, 2005. No principal or interest was outstanding or
    accrued and unpaid under the 2001

-51-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

credit agreement on that date. During 2004, the company borrowed
    $100 million under this facility for a period of
    27 days.

Mandatorily
    Redeemable Series B Convertible Preferred Stock

In connection with the Litton acquisition, the company issued
    3.5 million shares of mandatorily redeemable Series B
    convertible preferred stock in April 2001. Each share of
    Series B preferred stock has a liquidation value of $100
    per share. The liquidation value, plus accrued but unpaid
    dividends, is payable on April 4, 2021, the mandatory
    redemption date. The company has the option to redeem all, but
    not less than all, of the shares of Series B preferred
    stock at any time after seven years from the date of issuance
    for a number of shares of the company’s common stock equal
    to the liquidation value plus accrued and unpaid dividends
    divided by the current market price of common stock determined
    in relation to the date of redemption. Under this option, had
    the redemption taken place at December 31, 2006, each share
    would have been converted into 1.494 shares of common
    stock. Each share of preferred stock is convertible, at any
    time, at the option of the holder into the right to receive
    shares of the company’s common stock. Initially, each share
    was convertible into .911 shares of common stock, subject
    to adjustment in the event of certain dividends and
    distributions, a stock split, a merger, consolidation or sale of
    substantially all of the company’s assets, a liquidation or
    distribution, and certain other events. Had the conversion taken
    place at December 31, 2006, each share would have been
    converted into 1.822 shares of common stock. Holders of
    preferred stock are entitled to cumulative annual cash dividends
    of $7 per share, payable quarterly. In any liquidation of
    the company, each share of preferred stock is entitled to a
    liquidation preference before any distribution may be made on
    the company’s common stock or any series of capital stock
    that is junior to the Series B preferred stock. In the
    event of a change in control of the company, holders of
    Series B preferred stock also have specified exchange
    rights into common stock of the company or into specified
    securities or property of another entity participating in the
    change in control transaction. As of December 31, 2006,
    10 million shares of preferred stock are authorized, of
    which 3.5 million shares designated as Series B
    preferred are issued and outstanding.

Other
    Sources and Uses of Capital

Additional Capital

– To provide for long-term
    liquidity, the company believes it can obtain additional
    capital, if necessary, from such sources as the public or
    private capital markets, the sale of assets, sale and leaseback
    of operating assets, and leasing rather than purchasing new
    assets. Cash on hand at the beginning of the year plus cash
    generated from operations and cash available under credit lines
    are expected to be sufficient in 2007 to service debt, finance
    capital expansion projects, pay federal income taxes, and
    continue paying dividends to shareholders. The company will
    continue to provide the productive capacity to perform its
    existing contracts, prepare for future contracts, and conduct
    research and development in the pursuit of developing
    opportunities. While these expenditures tend to limit short-term
    liquidity, they are made with the intention of improving the
    long-term growth and profitability of the company.

Financial Arrangements

– In the ordinary course
    of business, the company uses standby letters of credit and
    guarantees issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued by
    insurance companies principally to guarantee the performance on
    certain contracts and to support the company’s self-insured
    workers’ compensation plans. At December 31, 2006,
    there were $460 million of unused stand-by letters of
    credit, $152 million of bank guarantees, and
    $615 million of surety bonds outstanding.

Co-Operative Agreements

– In 2003, Ships
    executed agreements with the states of Mississippi and Louisiana
    whereby Ships leases facility improvements and equipment from
    Mississippi and from a non-profit economic development
    corporation in Louisiana in exchange for certain commitments by
    Ships to these states.

As of December 31, 2006, Ships has met its obligations
    under the Mississippi agreement and remains obligated under the
    Louisiana agreement to maintain a minimum average of
    5,200 full-time employees at the end of any four-year
    period occurring between January 1, 2003, and
    December 31, 2010, upon assembly and installation of
    certain equipment.

-52-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Failure by Ships to meet the Louisiana commitment would result
    in reimbursement by Ships to Louisiana in accordance with the
    agreement. As of December 31, 2006, Ships expects that all
    future commitments under the Louisiana agreement will be met
    based on its most recent business plan.

OTHER
    MATTERS

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

New accounting pronouncements have been issued by the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board which are not effective until after
    December 31, 2006. For further discussion of new accounting
    standards, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2006, the company had no significant
    off-balance sheet arrangements.

Item 7A. Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rates

– The company is exposed to
    market risk, primarily related to interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange rates. Financial instruments subject to
    interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt
    obligations, variable-rate short-term debt outstanding under the
    credit agreement, short-term investments, and long-term notes
    receivable. At December 31, 2006, substantially all
    borrowings were fixed-rate long-term debt obligations of which a
    significant portion are not callable until maturity. The
    company’s sensitivity to a 1 percent change in
    interest rates is tied to its $2 billion credit agreement,
    which had no balance outstanding at December 31, 2006, or
    2005. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements
    in Part II, Item 8.

Derivatives

– The company does not hold or
    issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The
    company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage
    its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31,
    2006, and 2005, two interest rate swap agreements were in
    effect. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8.

Foreign Currency

– The company enters into
    foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency
    exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and
    payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. At
    December 31, 2006, and 2005, the amount of foreign currency
    forward contracts outstanding was not material. The company does
    not consider the market risk exposure relating to foreign
    currency exchange to be material to the consolidated financial
    statements.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON THE
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Northrop Grumman Corporation

Los Angeles, California

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of
    financial position of Northrop Grumman Corporation and
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,
    2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
    income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 2006. Our audits also included the
    financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
    Item 15. These financial statements and the financial
    statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    Northrop Grumman Corporation and subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
    schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
    financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted, effective December 31,
    2006, a new accounting standard for retirement benefits.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the
    criteria established in

Internal Control –
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
    February 20, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an
    unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

– Northrop Grumman
    Corporation and its subsidiaries (Northrop Grumman or the
    company) provide technologically advanced, innovative products,
    services, and solutions in information and services, aerospace,
    electronics, and shipbuilding. As prime contractor, principal
    subcontractor, partner, or preferred supplier, Northrop Grumman
    participates in many high-priority defense and non-defense
    technology programs in the United States (U.S.) and abroad.
    Northrop Grumman conducts most of its business with the
    U.S. Government, principally the Department of Defense. The
    company is therefore affected by, among other things, the
    federal budget process. The company also conducts business with
    foreign governments and makes domestic and international
    commercial sales.

Principles of Consolidation

– The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of Northrop Grumman
    Corporation and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts,
    transactions, and profits among Northrop Grumman and its
    subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation.

Accounting Estimates

– The company’s
    financial statements are in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
    The preparation thereof requires management to make estimates
    and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of
    the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates
    have been prepared on the basis of the most current and best
    available information and actual results could differ materially
    from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

– As a defense contractor
    engaging in long-term contracts, the majority of the
    company’s business is derived from long-term contracts for
    the construction of facilities, production of goods, and
    services provided to the federal government. In accounting for
    these contracts, the company extensively utilizes the

cost-to-cost

and the

units-of-delivery

measures of the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting. Sales under cost-reimbursement contracts
    and construction-type contracts that provide for delivery at a
    low volume per year or a small number of units after a lengthy
    period of time over which a significant amount of costs have
    been incurred are accounted for using the

cost-to-cost

measure of the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting. Under this method, sales, including
    estimated earned fees or profits, are recorded as costs are
    incurred. For most contracts, sales are calculated based on the
    percentage that total costs incurred bear to total estimated
    costs at completion. For certain contracts with large up-front
    purchases of material, sales are calculated based on the
    percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total
    estimated direct labor costs. Sales under construction-type
    contracts that provide for delivery at a high volume per year
    are accounted for using the

units-of-delivery

measure of the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting. Under this method, sales are recognized as
    deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales
    value in accordance with the contract terms. The company
    estimates profit as the difference between total estimated
    revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes
    that profit evenly over the life of the contract based on
    deliveries. The company classifies contract revenues as product
    sales or service revenues depending upon the predominant
    attributes of the relevant underlying contracts.

Certain contracts contain provisions for price redetermination
    or for cost

and/or

performance incentives. Such redetermined amounts or incentives
    are included in sales when the amounts can reasonably be
    determined and estimated. Amounts representing contract change
    orders, claims, requests for equitable adjustment, or
    limitations in funding are included in sales only when they can
    be reliably estimated and realization is probable. In the period
    in which it is determined that a loss will result from the
    performance of a contract, the entire amount of the estimated
    ultimate loss is charged against income. Loss provisions are
    first offset against costs that are included in inventories,
    with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities. Changes in
    estimates of contract sales, costs, and profits are recognized
    using the cumulative

catch-up

method of accounting. This method recognizes in the current
    period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior
    periods. Hence, the effect of the changes on future periods of
    contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimates
    had been the original

-62-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

estimates. A significant change in an estimate on one or more
    programs could have a material adverse effect on the
    company’s consolidated financial position or results of
    operations.

Revenue under contracts to provide services to non-federal
    government customers are generally recognized when services are
    performed. Service contracts include operations and maintenance
    contracts, and outsourcing-type arrangements, primarily in the
    Information Technology segment. Revenue under such contracts is
    generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of
    contract performance, unless evidence suggests that the revenue
    is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different
    pattern. Costs incurred under these service contracts are
    expensed as incurred, except that direct and incremental

set-up

costs
    are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement.
    Operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate
    from period to period, particularly in the earlier phases of the
    contract.

Service contracts that include more than one type of product or
    service are accounted for under the provisions of Emerging
    Issues Task Force Issue

No. 00-21 –

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.

Accordingly, for applicable arrangements, revenue recognition
    includes the proper identification of separate units of
    accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements
    based on relative fair values.

Research and Development

– Company-sponsored
    research and development activities primarily include
    independent research and development (IR&D) efforts related
    to government programs. IR&D expenses are included in
    general and administrative expenses and are generally allocated
    to U.S. Government contracts. Company-sponsored research
    and development expenses totaled $574 million,
    $538 million, and $504 million in 2006, 2005, and
    2004, respectively. Expenses for research and development
    sponsored by the customer are charged directly to the related
    contracts.

Product Warranty Costs

– The company provides
    certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of
    non-conforming items for a specified period of time. Most of the
    company’s product warranties are provided under government
    contracts, the costs of which are incorporated into contract
    pricing. Accrued product warranty costs of $81 million and
    $86 million were included in other current liabilities at
    December 31, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Environmental Costs

– Environmental liabilities
    are accrued when the company determines it is responsible for
    remediation costs and such amounts are reasonably estimable.
    When only a range of amounts is established and no amount within
    the range is more probable than another, the minimum amount in
    the range is recorded. Environmental liabilities are recorded on
    an undiscounted basis. At sites involving multiple parties, the
    company accrues environmental liabilities based upon its
    expected share of liability, taking into account the financial
    viability of other jointly liable parties. Environmental
    expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
    Capitalized expenditures relate to long-lived improvements in
    currently operating facilities. The company does not anticipate
    and record insurance recoveries before collection is probable.
    At December 31, 2006, and 2005, the company did not accrue
    any assets related to insurance reimbursements or recoveries for
    environmental matters.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts

– The
    company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to manage
    foreign currency exchange risk related to receipts from
    customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign
    currencies. Gains and losses from such transactions are included
    as contract costs. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
    amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was not
    material.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

– The company may
    enter into interest rate swap agreements to offset the
    variable-rate characteristic of certain variable-rate term loans
    which may be outstanding from time to time under the
    company’s credit facility (see Note 13). The company
    may also enter into interest rate swap agreements to benefit
    from floating interest rates as an offset to the fixed-rate
    characteristic of certain of its long-term debt instruments. Two
    interest rate swap agreements were entered into during 2004 and
    are in effect as of December 31, 2006 (see Note 20).

-63-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Other, net

– For 2006, Other, net primarily
    consists of a pre-tax gain of $111 million income related
    to the sale of the company’s remaining 9.7 million TRW
    Automotive (TRW Auto) shares. For 2005, Other, net primarily
    consists of the sale of 7.3 million TRW Auto shares and
    approximately 3.4 million Endwave shares, which generated
    pre-tax gains of $70 million and $95 million,
    respectively.

Income Taxes

– Provisions for federal, foreign,
    state, and local income taxes are calculated on reported
    financial statement pre-tax income based on current tax law and
    also include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates
    from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets
    and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts
    currently payable because certain items of income and expense
    are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting
    purposes than for income tax purposes. State and local income
    and franchise tax provisions are allocable to contracts in
    process and, accordingly, are included in general and
    administrative expenses.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

– Cash and cash
    equivalents include interest-earning debt instruments that
    mature in three months or less from the date purchased.

Marketable Securities

– At December 31,
    2006, and 2005, substantially all of the company’s
    investments in marketable securities were classified as

available-for-sale

or trading. For

available-for-sale

securities, any unrealized gains and losses are reported as a
    separate component of shareholders’ equity. Unrealized
    gains and losses on trading securities are included in Other,
    net in the consolidated statements of income and were not
    material to any period presented. The fair values of these
    marketable securities are determined based on prevailing market
    prices.

Accounts Receivable

– Accounts receivable
    include amounts billed and currently due from customers, amounts
    currently due but unbilled (primarily related to contracts
    accounted for under the

cost-to-cost

measure of the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting), certain estimated contract changes,
    claims or requests for equitable adjustment in negotiation that
    are probable of recovery, and amounts retained by the customer
    pending contract completion.

Inventoried Costs

– Inventoried costs primarily
    relate to work in process under fixed-price contracts (excluding
    those included in unbilled accounts receivable as previously
    described). They represent accumulated contract costs less the
    portion of such costs allocated to delivered items. Accumulated
    contract costs include direct production costs, factory and
    engineering overhead, production tooling costs, and, for
    government contracts, allowable general and administrative
    expenses. The ratio of inventoried general and administrative
    expenses to total inventoried costs is estimated to be the same
    as the ratio of total administrative and general expenses
    incurred to total contract costs incurred. According to the
    provisions of U.S. Government contracts, the customer
    asserts title to, or a security interest in, inventories related
    to such contracts as a result of contract advances,
    performance-based payments, and progress payments. General
    corporate expenses and IR&D allocable to commercial
    contracts are expensed as incurred. Inventoried costs are
    classified as a current asset and include amounts related to
    contracts having production cycles longer than one year. Product
    inventory primarily consists of raw materials and is stated at
    the lower of cost or market, generally using the average cost
    method.

Outsourcing Contract Costs

– Costs on
    outsourcing contracts, including costs incurred for bid and
    proposal activities, are generally expensed as incurred.
    However, certain costs incurred upon initiation of an
    outsourcing contract are deferred and expensed over the contract
    life. These costs represent incremental external costs or
    certain specific internal costs that are directly related to the
    contract acquisition and transition/set-up. The primary types of
    costs that may be capitalized include labor and related fringe
    benefits, subcontractor costs, and travel costs.

Depreciable Properties

– Property, plant, and
    equipment owned by the company are depreciated over the
    estimated useful lives of individual assets. Costs incurred for
    computer software developed or obtained for internal use are
    capitalized and classified in machinery and other equipment.
    Capitalized software costs are amortized over a

-64-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

period of three to five years. Most of these assets are
    depreciated using declining-balance methods, with the remainder
    using the straight-line method, with the following lives:

Years

Land improvements

2-45

Buildings

2-45

Machinery and other equipment

2-25

Leasehold improvements

Length of lease

Restricted Cash

– Access to proceeds from the
    Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue Bonds is
    restricted to certain capital expenditures. As such, the amount
    of unexpended proceeds available is recorded in miscellaneous
    other assets as restricted cash in the consolidated statements
    of financial position (see Note 13).

Leases

– The company uses its incremental
    borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification as
    capital or operating and defines the initial lease term to
    include renewal options determined to be reasonably assured.

The company conducts operations primarily under operating
    leases. Most lease agreements contain incentives for tenant
    improvements, rent holidays, or rent escalation clauses. For
    incentives for tenant improvements, the company records a
    deferred rent liability in other long-term liabilities in the
    consolidated statements of financial position and amortizes the
    deferred rent over the term of the lease as reductions to rent
    expense. For rent holidays and rent escalation clauses during
    the lease term, the company records minimum rental expenses on a
    straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

For purposes of recognizing incentives for tenant improvements
    and minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis, the
    company uses the date of initial possession to begin
    amortization, which is generally when the company is given the
    right of access to the space and begins to make improvements in
    preparation of intended use.

Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangible
    Assets

– The company performs impairment tests at
    least annually for goodwill, and more often as circumstances
    require. When it is determined that impairment has occurred, an
    appropriate charge to operations is recorded. Goodwill and other
    purchased intangible asset balances are included in the
    identifiable assets of the business segment to which they have
    been assigned. Any goodwill impairment, as well as the
    amortization of other purchased intangible assets, is charged
    against the respective business segments’ operating margin.
    Purchased intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line
    basis over their estimated useful lives.

Self-Insurance Accruals

– Included in other
    long-term liabilities is approximately $485 million and
    $464 million related to self-insured workers’
    compensation as of December 31, 2006, and 2005,
    respectively. The company estimates the required liability of
    such claims on a discounted basis utilizing actuarial methods
    based on various assumptions, which include, but are not limited
    to, the company’s historical loss experience and projected
    loss development factors.

Litigation, Commitments, and Contingencies

–
    Amounts associated with litigation, commitments, and
    contingencies are recorded as charges to earnings when
    management, after taking into consideration the facts and
    circumstances of each matter, including any settlement offers,
    has determined that it is probable that a liability has been
    incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

Retirement Benefits

– The company sponsors
    various pension plans covering substantially all employees. The
    company also provides postretirement benefit plans other than
    pensions, consisting principally of health care and life
    insurance benefits, to eligible retirees and qualifying
    dependents. The liabilities and annual income or expense of the
    company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans
    are determined using methodologies that involve several
    actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the
    discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return (based on the
    market related value of assets), and medical trend (rate of
    growth for medical costs). The fair values of plan assets are
    determined based on prevailing market prices or estimated fair
    value for investments with no available quoted prices. Not all
    net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in net
    earnings in the

-65-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

year incurred because it is allocated to production as product
    costs, and a portion remains in inventory at the end of a
    reporting period. The company’s funding policy for pension
    plans is to contribute, at a minimum, the statutorily required
    amount to an irrevocable trust.

Foreign Currency Translation

– For operations
    outside the U.S. that prepare financial statements in
    currencies other than the U.S. dollar, results of
    operations and cash flows are translated at average exchange
    rates during the period, and assets and liabilities are
    generally translated at

end-of-period

exchange rates. Translation adjustments are not material and are
    included as a separate component of accumulated other
    comprehensive loss in consolidated shareholders’ equity.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

– The
    company’s accumulated other comprehensive loss consists of
    cumulative translation and minimum pension liability
    adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on certain investments
    in equity securities (including reclassification adjustments),
    and effective in 2006, unamortized benefit plan costs resulting
    from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 158 –

Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.

The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss at year
    end were as follows:

Financial Statement Reclassification

– Certain
    amounts in the prior year financial statements and related notes
    have been reclassified to conform to the 2006 presentation of
    the Enterprise Information Technology (EIT) business, formerly
    reported in the Information Technology segment, as discontinued
    operations and the establishment of the Technical Services
    segment on January 1, 2006 (see Note 6).

2.

NEW
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued SFAS No. 159 –

The Fair
    Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities – Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115.

SFAS No. 159 permits
    entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at
    specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses
    on items for which the fair value option has been elected in
    earnings at each subsequent reporting date.
    SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007. Management is currently evaluating
    the effect that adoption of this statement will have on the
    company’s consolidated financial position and results of
    operations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 157 –

Fair Value
    Measurements

, which defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for consistently measuring fair value under generally
    accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about
    fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for
    the company beginning January 1, 2008, and the provisions
    of SFAS No. 157 will be applied prospectively as of
    that date. Management is currently evaluating the effect that
    adoption of this statement will have on the company’s
    consolidated financial position and results of operations when
    it becomes effective in 2008.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN)
    48 –

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109.

FIN 48 prescribes a threshold for the
    financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Only tax
    positions meeting the

-66-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date
    may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of
    this Interpretation. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
    accounting for derecognition, interest and penalties, and
    classification and disclosure of matters related to uncertainty
    in income taxes. FIN 48 will be effective for the company
    January 1, 2007, and will require adjustment to the opening
    balance of retained earnings (or other components of
    shareholders’ equity in the statement of financial
    position) for the cumulative effect of the difference in the net
    amount of assets and liabilities for all open tax positions at
    the effective date. Management expects that the effect of
    adoption of this interpretation on the company’s
    consolidated financial position and results of operations will
    not be material.

3.

COMMON
    STOCK DIVIDEND

Common Stock Dividend

– On May 17, 2006,
    the company’s board of directors approved a 15 percent
    increase to the quarterly common stock dividend, from
    $.26 per share to $.30 per share, effective with the second
    quarter 2006 dividend.

On March 23, 2005, the company’s board of directors
    approved a 13 percent increase to the quarterly common
    stock dividend, from $.23 per share to $.26 per share,
    effective with the second quarter 2005 dividend.

4.

BUSINESS
    ACQUISITIONS


– In October the company announced its
    intent to acquire Essex Corporation (Essex). On January 25,
    2007, the company completed its purchase of 100 percent of
    the common stock of Essex, valued at approximately
    $600 million, including the assumption of debt totaling
    $23 million and estimated transaction costs of
    $14 million. Essex provides signal processing services and
    products, and advanced optoelectronic imaging for
    U.S. government intelligence and defense customers. The
    operating results of Essex will be included as part of the
    Mission Systems segment from the date of acquisition. The
    assets, liabilities, and results of operations of Essex were not
    material and thus pro-forma information is not presented.


– The company acquired Confluent RF
    Systems Corporation (Confluent) for $42 million, which
    included transaction costs of $2 million, and Integic
    Corporation (Integic) for $319 million, which included
    transaction costs of $6 million. The assets, liabilities,
    and results of operations of these acquired businesses were not
    material individually or in the aggregate, and thus pro-forma
    information is not presented. The company completed its purchase
    accounting activities for these businesses during 2005 and
    recorded an aggregate increase to goodwill of $37 million
    for Confluent and $254 million for Integic.


– There were no significant acquisitions
    during 2004.

SEGMENT
    INFORMATION

Organization,
    Products, and Services

Effective January 1, 2006, the company established a new
    reportable segment, Technical Services, to leverage existing
    business strengths and synergies in the rapidly expanding areas
    of logistics support, sustainment and technical services. The
    Technical Services segment was established through the
    consolidation of multiple programs in logistics operations from
    the Electronics, Integrated Systems, Mission Systems and
    Information Technology segments. On July 1, 2006,
    additional programs from Electronics, Integrated Systems,
    Mission Systems, and Space Technology were transferred to
    Technical Services. The sales and segment operating margin in
    the following tables have been revised, where applicable, to
    reflect these realignments for all periods presented.

Effective January 1, 2006, in order to provide a more
    relevant depiction of the management and performance of the
    company’s businesses, sales and segment operating margin in
    the following tables were revised to include

-68-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

margin on intersegment sales for all periods presented.
    Intersegment amounts are then eliminated upon consolidation of
    the segments.

For presentation and discussion purposes, the company’s
    seven reportable segments are categorized into four primary
    businesses. The Mission Systems, Information Technology and
    Technical Services segments are presented as
    Information & Services. The Integrated Systems and
    Space Technology segments are presented as Aerospace. The
    Electronics and Ships segments are each presented as separate
    businesses. In accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 131

– Disclosures about Segments
    of an Enterprise and Related Information

, Newport News and
    Ship Systems results are aggregated and reported as the Ships
    segment.

    U.S. Government. The company’s discontinued operations
    are excluded from all of the data elements in this table, except
    for assets by segment.

Adjustments to Reconcile to Total Operating
    Margin

– Pension expense is included in the
    segments’ cost of sales to the extent that these costs are
    currently recognized under U.S. Government Cost Accounting
    Standards (CAS). In order to reconcile from segment operating
    margin to total company operating margin, these amounts are
    reported under the caption “Reversal of CAS pension expense
    included above.” Total pension expense accounted for under
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America is reported separately as a reconciling item under the
    caption “Pension expense.” The reconciling item
    captioned “Unallocated expenses” includes the portion
    of corporate expenses such as management and administration,
    legal, environmental, certain compensation and retiree benefits,
    and other expenses not considered allowable or allocable under
    applicable CAS regulations and the Federal Acquisition
    Regulation, and therefore not allocated to the segments.

Foreign Sales

– Foreign sales amounted to
    approximately $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion, and
    $1.6 billion during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

EARNINGS
    PER SHARE

Basic Earnings Per Share

– Basic earnings per
    share from continuing operations are calculated by dividing
    income available to common shareholders from continuing
    operations by the weighted-average number of shares of common
    stock outstanding during each period.

Diluted Earnings Per Share

– Diluted earnings
    per share include the dilutive effect of stock options and other
    stock awards granted to employees under stock-based compensation
    plans, equity security units outstanding, and the
    3.5 million mandatorily redeemable preferred stock (see
    Note 14), unless their inclusion is anti-dilutive for the
    period presented. The dilutive effect of these potential common
    stock instruments totaled 12.9 million (including
    6.4 million shares from the mandatorily redeemable
    convertible Series B preferred stock), 6.7 million,
    and 5.3 million shares for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. For the
    periods in which the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock are
    dilutive, the related dividends are added back to the numerator
    to arrive at income available to common shareholders from
    continuing operations. The weighted-average diluted shares
    outstanding for the years ended 2006, 2005, and 2004, exclude
    stock options to purchase approximately 8 thousand shares,
    4 million shares, and 12.6 million shares,
    respectively, since such options have an exercise price in
    excess of the average market price of the company’s common
    stock during the year.

Share Repurchases

– On October 26, 2004,
    the company’s board of directors authorized a share
    repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion of its outstanding
    common stock. This share repurchase program was completed in the
    third quarter of 2005, and resulted in the retirement of
    18.2 million shares of common stock.

On October 24, 2005, the company’s board of directors
    authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1.5 billion
    of its outstanding common stock, which commenced in November
    2005 and under which $176 million is remaining. Through
    December 31, 2006, the company had repurchased and retired
    20.6 million shares of common stock under this share
    repurchase program.

The company entered into an initial agreement with Credit
    Suisse, New York Branch (Credit Suisse) on November 4,
    2005, to repurchase approximately 9.1 million shares of
    common stock at an initial price of $55.15 per share for a
    total of $500 million. Credit Suisse immediately borrowed
    shares that were sold to and canceled by the company.
    Subsequently, Credit Suisse purchased shares in the open market
    to settle its share borrowings. On March 1, 2006, Credit
    Suisse completed its purchases under this agreement, and the
    company paid $37 million for the final price adjustment
    under the terms of the agreement. The final average purchase
    price was $59.05 per share.

The company entered into a second agreement with Credit Suisse
    on March 6, 2006, to repurchase approximately
    11.6 million shares of common stock at an initial price of
    $64.78 per share for a total of $750 million. Credit
    Suisse immediately borrowed shares that were sold to and
    canceled by the company. Subsequently, Credit Suisse purchased
    shares in the open market to settle its share borrowings. On
    May 26, 2006, Credit Suisse completed its purchases under
    this agreement, and the company paid $37 million for the
    final price adjustment under the terms of the agreement. The
    final average purchase price was $68.01 per share.

On December 14, 2006, the company’s board of directors
    authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion
    of its outstanding common stock. This new authorization is in
    addition to $176 million remaining on the company’s
    previous share repurchase authorization. In total, the company
    now has $1.176 billion authorized for share repurchases.

With the exception of the accelerated share repurchase
    agreements with Credit Suisse noted above, share repurchases
    take place at management’s discretion and under
    pre-established non-discretionary programs from time to time,
    depending on market conditions, in the open market, and in
    privately negotiated transactions. The company retires its
    common stock upon repurchase and has not made any purchases of
    common stock other than in connection with these publicly
    announced repurchase programs.

ACCOUNTS
    RECEIVABLE, NET

Unbilled amounts represent sales for which billings have not
    been presented to customers at year-end, including amounts
    representing differences between actual and estimated contract
    cost elements. These amounts are usually billed and collected
    within one year. Progress payments are received on a number of
    fixed-price contracts.

Accounts receivable at December 31, 2006, are expected to
    be collected in 2007 except for approximately $419 million
    due in 2008 and $120 million due in 2009 and later.

Allowances for doubtful amounts mainly represent estimates of
    overhead costs which may not be successfully negotiated and
    collected.

GOODWILL
    AND OTHER PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill

Goodwill and other purchased intangible assets are included in
    the identifiable assets of the segment to which they have been
    assigned. Impairment tests are performed at least annually and
    more often as circumstances require. Any goodwill impairment, as
    well as the amortization of other purchased intangible assets,
    is charged against the respective segment’s operating
    margin. The annual impairment test for all sectors was performed
    as of November 30, 2006, with no indication of impairment.
    In performing the goodwill impairment tests, the company uses a
    discounted cash flow approach corroborated by comparative market
    multiples, where appropriate, to determine the fair value of
    reporting units.

The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill during 2006 and
    2005, are as follows:

Segment Realignment

– Effective January 1,
    2006, the company realigned businesses among four of its
    operating segments to form a new segment. As a result of this
    realignment, goodwill of approximately $792 million was
    reallocated among these five segments.

Fair Value Adjustments to Net Assets Acquired

–
    For 2005, the change in the Information Technology segment
    primarily consisted of purchase price allocation to reflect
    adjustments to the fair value of the assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed in relation to the acquisition of Integic
    (see Note 4). The remaining adjustments were primarily
    related to the recognition of a portion of the capital loss
    carryforward associated with the company’s acquisition of
    TRW Inc. (TRW). Due to the uncertainty related to the
    company’s ability to fully utilize the deferred tax asset
    related to this capital loss carryforward as of the acquisition
    date, a valuation allowance equal to the full amount of the
    related tax benefit was recorded. Any subsequent realization of
    this tax benefit was recorded as a reduction of goodwill. For
    2006, the fair value adjustments were primarily due to the
    resolution of pre-acquisition tax uncertainties resulting from
    the completion of audits by the Internal Revenue Service and the
    realization of additional capital loss carryforward tax assets.

    purchased intangible assets with a weighted average life of
    5 years. Also, approximately $7 million of the
    Confluent purchase price was allocated to purchased intangible
    assets with a life of 8 years. The company’s purchased
    intangible assets are subject to amortization and are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over an aggregate
    weighted-average period of 22 years. Aggregate amortization
    expense for 2006, 2005, and 2004, was $134 million,

Short-Term Instruments

– For cash and cash
    equivalents and amounts borrowed under the company’s
    short-term credit lines, the carrying amounts approximate fair
    value, due to the short-term nature of these items.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Investments in Marketable Securities

– The
    company holds a portfolio of securities, primarily consisting of
    equity securities that are classified as trading.

Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance

– The
    company maintains whole life insurance policies on several of
    our senior executives in connection with deferred compensation
    arrangements. These policies are recorded at their cash
    surrender value as determined by the insurance carrier. The
    amounts associated with these policies are recorded in
    “Miscellaneous other assets” in the consolidated
    statements of financial position.

Investment in TRW Auto

– At December 31,
    2005, the company owned 9.7 million common shares of TRW
    Auto with a carrying value of $97 million. The investment
    was carried at cost and included in “Miscellaneous other
    assets” as of December 31, 2005, due to certain
    restrictions on the sale of the company’s investment.
    During 2006, the company received a waiver of the restrictions
    and sold all of its TRW Auto shares for $209 million,
    resulting in an after-tax gain of $72 million.

Long-Term Debt

– The fair value of the
    long-term debt was calculated based on interest rates available
    for debt with terms and due dates similar to the company’s
    existing debt arrangements.

Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock

– The
    fair value of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock was
    calculated based on the closing market price quoted on the New
    York Stock Exchange (trading symbol

NOC-pb)

at
    December 31, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Interest Rate Swaps

– The company has from time
    to time entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate
    interest rate risk. As described in Note 20, two interest
    rate swap agreements were in effect at December 31, 2006,
    and 2005.

Foreign Currency

– The company enters into
    foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency
    exchange risk related to receipts from customers and payments to
    suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. Gains and losses
    from such transactions are included as contract costs.

Deferred Income Taxes

– Deferred income taxes
    reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
    carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
    reporting purposes and tax purposes. Such amounts are classified
    as current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based upon the
    balance sheet classification of the related assets and
    liabilities.

The tax effects of significant temporary differences and
    carryforwards that gave rise to year-end deferred federal, state
    and foreign tax balances, as presented in the consolidated

Foreign Income

– Deferred income taxes have not
    been provided on accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign
    subsidiaries of $259 million at December 31, 2006, as
    the company intends to permanently reinvest these earnings,
    thereby indefinitely postponing their remittance. Should these
    earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise,
    the distributions would be subject to U.S. federal income
    tax at the statutory rate of 35 percent, less foreign tax
    credits applicable to such distributions, if any. In addition,
    such distributions would be subject to withholding taxes in the
    various tax jurisdictions.

Tax Carryforwards

– The company has a capital
    loss tax carryforward of $1.1 billion at December 31,
    2006, against which a full valuation allowance of
    $1.1 billion has been recorded. The majority of the capital
    loss carryforward, which primarily arose from the sale of TRW
    Auto, will expire in 2008. Future reductions to the valuation
    allowance resulting from the recognition of tax benefits, if
    any, will reduce goodwill. In addition, the company has foreign
    income tax credit carryforward items of $180 million at
    December 31, 2006, to offset future federal income tax
    liabilities, against which a valuation allowance of
    $180 million has been recorded. The $180 million
    foreign income tax credit carryforward arose from the
    acquisition of TRW, and from the sale of TRW Auto and other
    discontinued operations, and will expire in 2009 through 2012.
    In 2004, the company extended its foreign tax credit
    carryforward period from five to ten years based on the American
    Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

NOTES PAYABLE
    TO BANKS AND LONG-TERM DEBT

Credit Facility

– On August 5, 2005, the
    company entered into a new credit agreement which provides for a
    five-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal
    amount of $2 billion. The credit facility permits the
    company to request additional lending commitments from the
    lenders under the agreement or other eligible lenders under
    certain circumstances, and thereby to increase the aggregate
    principal amount of the lending commitments under the agreement
    by up to an additional $500 million. The agreement provides
    for swingline loans and letters of credit as

sub-facilities

for the credit facilities provided for in the agreement.
    Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at various
    rates, including the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR),
    adjusted based on the company’s credit rating, or an
    alternate base rate plus an incremental margin. The credit
    facility also requires a facility fee based on the daily
    aggregate amount of commitments (whether or not utilized) and
    the company’s credit rating level. The company’s
    credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that are
    less restrictive than those contained in the prior credit
    agreement. At December 31, 2006, and 2005, there was no
    balance outstanding under this facility and there were no
    borrowings under this facility at any time during 2006 or 2005.

Concurrent with the effectiveness of the new credit agreement,
    the 2001 credit agreement, for $2.5 billion, terminated on
    August 5, 2005. No principal or interest was outstanding or
    accrued and unpaid under the 2001 credit agreement on that date.
    During 2004, the company borrowed $100 million under this
    facility for a period of 27 days.

Equity Security Units

– In November 2001, the
    company issued 6.9 million equity security units. Each
    equity security unit, issued at $100 per unit, initially
    consisted of a contract to purchase shares of Northrop Grumman
    common stock on November 16, 2004, and a $100 senior note
    due 2006. The senior notes due 2006 were reported as long-term
    debt in 2005. The senior notes initially bore interest at
    5.25 percent per annum, and each

-80-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

equity security unit paid a contract adjustment payment of
    2.0 percent per annum through November 16, 2004, for a
    combined yield on the equity security unit of 7.25 percent
    per annum through November 16, 2004.

On August 11, 2004, the company remarketed the senior notes
    as required by the original terms of the equity security units.
    As a result of this remarketing, the interest rate on the senior
    notes was reset to 4.08 percent per annum effective
    August 16, 2004. Proceeds from the remarketed notes were
    used to purchase U.S. Treasury securities that were pledged
    to secure the stock purchase obligations of the unit holders and
    held with a collateral agent.

On November 16, 2004, the company received
    $690 million and issued 13.2 million shares of common
    stock in settlement of the stock purchase contracts. The number
    of shares issued was calculated using a conversion ratio of
    1.9171 shares per each equity security unit, which was
    determined in accordance with the original terms of the stock
    purchase contracts.

On November 16, 2006, the company repaid the
    $690 million 4.08 percent senior note at maturity.

Debt Redemption

– On October 15, 2004, the
    company redeemed all of its outstanding $250 million
    9.375 percent debentures due 2024. The redemption price was
    104.363 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and
    unpaid interest through the redemption date. As a result of the
    redemption, the company recorded a $13 million pre-tax
    charge in 2004 included in “Other, net” in the
    consolidated statements of income.

Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue
    Bonds

– In December 2006, Ship Systems entered
    into a loan agreement with the Mississippi Business Finance
    Corporation (MBFC) under which Ship Systems received access to
    $200 million from the issuance of Gulf Opportunity Zone
    Industrial Development Revenue Bonds by the MBFC. The loan
    accrues interest payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of
    4.55 percent per annum. The bonds are subject to redemption
    at the company’s discretion on or after December 1,
    2016, and mature on December 1, 2028. The bonds will be
    repaid by Ship Systems in accordance with the terms stipulated
    in the loan agreement. The bond issuance proceeds must be used
    to finance the construction, reconstruction, and renovation of
    the company’s interest in certain ship manufacturing and
    repair facilities, or portions thereof, located in the state of
    Mississippi. As of December 31, 2006, $73 million was
    used by Ship Systems and the remaining $127 million was
    recorded in miscellaneous other assets as restricted cash in the
    consolidated statement of financial position. Repayment of the
    bonds is guaranteed by the company.

Lines of Credit

– The company has available
    short-term credit lines in the form of money market facilities
    with several banks. The amount and conditions for borrowing
    under these credit lines depend on the availability and terms
    prevailing in the marketplace. No fees or compensating balances
    are required for these credit facilities.

MANDATORILY
    REDEEMABLE SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

The company issued 3.5 million shares of mandatorily
    redeemable Series B convertible preferred stock in April
    2001. Each share of Series B preferred stock has a
    liquidation value of $100 per share. The liquidation value,
    plus accrued but unpaid dividends, is payable on April 4,
    2021, the mandatory redemption date. The company has the option
    to redeem all, but not less than all, of the shares of
    Series B preferred stock at any time after seven years from
    the date of issuance for a number of shares of the
    company’s common stock equal to the liquidation value plus
    accrued and unpaid dividends divided by the current market price
    of common stock determined in relation to the date of
    redemption. Under this option, had the redemption taken place at
    December 31, 2006, each share would have been converted
    into 1.494 shares of common stock. Each share of preferred
    stock is convertible, at any time, at the option of the holder
    into the right to receive shares of the company’s common
    stock. Initially, each share was convertible into
    .911 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment in the
    event of certain dividends and distributions, a stock split, a
    merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of the
    company’s assets, a liquidation or distribution, and
    certain other events. Had the conversion taken place at
    December 31, 2006, each share would have been converted
    into 1.822 shares of common stock. Holders of preferred
    stock are entitled to cumulative annual cash dividends of
    $7 per share, payable quarterly. In any liquidation of the
    company, each share of preferred stock is entitled to a
    liquidation preference before any distribution may be made on
    the company’s common stock or any series of capital stock
    that is junior to the Series B preferred stock. In the
    event of a change in control of the company, holders of
    Series B preferred stock also have specified exchange
    rights into common stock of the company or into specified
    securities or property of another entity participating in the
    change in control transaction.

As of December 31, 2006, 10 million shares of
    preferred stock are authorized, of which 3.5 million shares
    designated as Series B preferred are issued and outstanding.

15.

LITIGATION

U.S. Government Investigations and
    Claims

– Departments and agencies of the
    U.S. Government have the authority to investigate various
    transactions and operations of the company, and the results of
    such investigations may lead to administrative, civil, or
    criminal proceedings, the ultimate outcome of which could be
    fines, penalties, repayments or compensatory or treble damages.
    U.S. Government regulations provide that certain findings
    against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from
    future U.S. Government contracts or the loss of export
    privileges for a company or an operating division or
    subdivision. Suspension or debarment could have a material
    adverse effect on the company because of its reliance on
    government contracts.

-82-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

As previously disclosed, in October 2005, the
    U.S. Department of Justice and a classified
    U.S. Government customer apprised the company of potential
    substantial claims relating to certain microelectronic parts
    produced by the Space and Electronics Sector of former TRW Inc.,
    now a component of the company. The relationship, if any,
    between the potential claims and a civil False Claims Act case
    that remains under seal in the U.S. District Court for the
    Central District of California remains unclear to the company.
    In the third quarter of 2006, the parties commenced settlement
    discussions. While the company continues to believe that it did
    not breach the contracts in question and that it acted
    appropriately in this matter, the company proposed to settle the
    claims and any associated matters and recognized a pre-tax
    charge of $112.5 million in 2006 to cover the cost of the
    settlement proposal and associated investigative costs. The
    charge has been recorded within “General and administrative
    expenses” in the consolidated statements of income. The
    company extended the offer in an effort to avoid litigation and
    in recognition of the value of the relationship with this
    customer. The U.S. Government has advised the company that
    if settlement is not reached it will pursue its claims through
    litigation. Because of the highly technical nature of the issues
    involved and their classified status and because of the
    significant disagreement between the company and the
    U.S. Government as to the U.S. Government’s
    theories of liability and damages (including a material
    difference between the U.S. Government’s damage
    theories and the company’s offer), final resolution of this
    matter could take a considerable amount of time, particularly if
    litigation should ensue. If the U.S. Government were to
    pursue litigation and were to be ultimately successful on its
    theories of liability and damages, which could be trebled under
    the Federal False Claims Act, the effect upon the company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash
    flows would materially exceed the amount provided by the
    company. Based upon the information available to the company to
    date, the company believes that it has substantive defenses but
    can give no assurance that its views will prevail. Accordingly,
    the ultimate disposition of this matter cannot presently be
    determined.

Based upon the available information regarding matters that are
    subject to U.S. Government investigations, other than as
    set out above, the company does not believe, but can give no
    assurance, that the outcome of any such matters would have a
    material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows.

Litigation

– Various claims and legal
    proceedings arise in the ordinary course of business and are
    pending against the company and its properties. Based upon the
    information available, the company does not believe that the
    resolution of any of these various claims and legal proceedings
    will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

The company is a defendant in litigation brought by Cogent
    Systems, Inc. (Cogent) in Los Angeles Superior Court in
    California on April 20, 2005, for unspecified damages for
    alleged unauthorized use of Cogent technology relating to
    fingerprint recognition. During discovery in the second quarter
    of 2006, Cogent asserted entitlement to in excess of
    $50 million for lost profits, in excess of
    $100 million for loss of goodwill and business
    opportunities, in excess of $6 million in royalties,
    doubling of actual damages and other amounts, including, without
    limitation, attorneys’ fees. The trial date has been set
    for May 22, 2007. The company does not believe, but can
    give no assurance, that the outcome of this matter would have a
    material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows.

On September 28, 2006, various individual plaintiffs filed
    a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court, Central
    District of California, against the company, certain of its
    administrative and Board committees, all members of the
    company’s Board of Directors, and certain company officers
    and employees (Waldbuesser, et al. v. Northrop Grumman
    Corporation, et al.). The lawsuit alleges two alternative
    counts of fiduciary duty breaches under the Employee Retirement
    Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) with respect to alleged
    excessive, hidden

and/or

otherwise improper fee and expense charges to the Northrop
    Grumman Savings Plan and the Northrop Grumman Financial Security
    and Savings Plan (both of which are 401(k) plans). Among other
    things, the lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, removal of
    individuals acting as fiduciaries to such plans, payment of
    attorney fees and costs, and an accounting. The company does not
    believe, but can give no assurance, that the outcome of this

-83-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

matter would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

On January 3, 2007, a class action lawsuit was filed in the
    U.S. District Court, Central District of California,
    against the company, certain of its administrative and Board
    committees, certain members of its Board of Directors, and
    certain company officers and employees (Heidecker v.
    Northrop Grumman Corporation, et al.). The lawsuit alleges
    two alternative counts of fiduciary duty breaches under ERISA
    with respect to the investment and administrative management of
    the Northrop Grumman Savings Plan, including allegations of
    excessive, hidden

and/or

otherwise improper fee and expense charges. Among other things,
    the lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, removal of individuals
    acting as fiduciaries to such plans, payment of attorney fees
    and costs, and an accounting. The company does not believe, but
    can give no assurance, that the outcome of this matter would
    have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Insurance Recovery

– Property damage from
    Hurricane Katrina is covered by the company’s comprehensive
    property insurance program. The insurance provider for coverage
    of property damage losses over $500 million has advised
    management of a disagreement regarding coverage for certain
    losses above $500 million. As a result, the company has
    taken legal action against the insurance provider as the company
    believes that its insurance policies are enforceable and intends
    to pursue all of its available rights and remedies. However,
    based on the current status of the assessment and claim process,
    no assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome of this
    matter.

16.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Contract Performance Contingencies

– Contract
    profit margins may include estimates of costs not contractually
    agreed to between the customer and the company for matters such
    as contract changes, negotiated settlements, claims and requests
    for equitable adjustment for previously unanticipated contract
    costs. These estimates are based upon management’s best
    assessment of the underlying causal events and circumstances,
    and are included in determining contract profit margins to the
    extent of expected recovery based on contractual entitlements
    and the probability of successful negotiation with the customer.
    As of December 31, 2006, the amounts are not material
    individually or in the aggregate.

Environmental Matters

– In accordance with
    company policy on environmental remediation, the estimated cost
    to complete remediation has been accrued where it is probable
    that the company will incur such costs in the future to address
    environmental impacts at currently or formerly owned or leased
    operating facilities, or at sites where it has been named a
    Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) by the Environmental
    Protection Agency, or similarly designated by other
    environmental agencies. To assess the potential impact on the
    company’s consolidated financial statements, management
    estimates the total reasonably possible remediation costs that
    could be incurred by the company, taking into account currently
    available facts on each site as well as the current state of
    technology and prior experience in remediating contaminated
    sites. These estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted to
    reflect changes in facts and technical and legal circumstances.
    Management estimates that at December 31, 2006, the range
    of reasonably possible future costs for environmental
    remediation sites is $224 million to $319 million, of
    which $257 million is accrued in other current liabilities.
    Factors that could result in changes to the company’s
    estimates include: modification of planned remedial actions,
    increase or decrease in the estimated time required to
    remediate, discovery of more extensive contamination than
    anticipated, changes in laws and regulations affecting
    remediation requirements, results of efforts to determine
    legally responsible parties, and improvements in remediation
    technology. Should other PRPs not pay their allocable share of
    remediation costs, the company may have to incur costs in
    addition to those already estimated and accrued. Although
    management cannot predict whether new information gained as
    projects progress will materially affect the estimated liability
    accrued, management does not anticipate that future remediation
    expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the
    company’s financial position, results of operations, or
    cash flows.

– The company has exposure
    related to income tax filings in the ordinary course of
    business, including matters related to pre-acquisition periods
    of acquired businesses. The company periodically assesses these
    exposures for all tax years that are open under the applicable
    statute of limitations and records a liability, including
    related interest charges, where it has determined that a
    liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be
    reasonably estimated. Based upon the information available,
    management does not believe that the resolution of any of these
    income tax exposures will have a material adverse effect on the
    company’s consolidated financial position or results of
    operations.

Co-Operative Agreements

– In 2003, Ships
    executed agreements with the states of Mississippi and Louisiana
    whereby Ships leases facility improvements and equipment from
    Mississippi and from a non-profit economic development
    corporation in Louisiana in exchange for certain commitments by
    Ships to these states.

As of December 31, 2006, Ships has met its obligations
    under the Mississippi agreement and remains obligated under the
    Louisiana agreement to maintain a minimum average of
    5,200 full-time employees at the end of any four-year
    period occurring between January 1, 2003, and
    December 31, 2010, upon assembly and installation of
    certain equipment.

Failure by Ships to meet the Louisiana commitment would result
    in reimbursement by Ships to Louisiana in accordance with the
    agreement. As of December 31, 2006, Ships expects that all
    future commitments under the Louisiana agreement will be met
    based on its most recent Ships business plan.

Financial Arrangements

– In the ordinary course
    of business, the company uses standby letters of credit and
    guarantees issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued by
    insurance companies principally to guarantee the performance on
    certain contracts and to support the company’s self-insured
    workers’ compensation plans. At December 31, 2006,
    there were $460 million of unused stand-by letters of
    credit, $152 million of bank guarantees, and
    $615 million of surety bonds outstanding.

In December 2006, the company guaranteed a $200 million
    loan made to Ship Systems in connection with the Gulf
    Opportunity Zone Industrial Revenue Bonds. Under the loan
    agreement the company guaranteed repayment by Ship Systems of
    the principal and interest to the Trustee. The company also
    guaranteed payment of the principal and interest by the Trustee
    to the underlying bondholders. See Note 13.

Indemnifications

– The company has retained
    certain warranty, environmental, income tax, and other
    liabilities in connection with certain divestitures. Except as
    discussed in the following paragraph, the settlement of these
    liabilities is not expected to have a material effect on the
    company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows.

In May 2006, Goodrich Corporation (Goodrich) notified the
    company of its claims under indemnities assumed by the company
    in its December 2002 acquisition of TRW that related to the sale
    by TRW of its Aeronautical Systems business in October 2002.
    Goodrich seeks relief from increased costs and other damages of
    approximately $118 million. The parties are engaged in
    discussions to enable the company to evaluate the merits of the
    claims as well as to assess the amounts being claimed. If the
    parties are unable to reach a negotiated resolution of the
    claims, Goodrich will have the right to commence litigation and
    may seek significant additional damages relating to allegations
    of other incurred costs and lost profits. The ultimate
    disposition of any litigation could take an extended period of
    time due to the nature of the claims. The company does not have
    sufficient information to assess the probable outcome of the
    disposition of this matter. If Goodrich were to pursue
    litigation and ultimately be successful on its claims, the
    effect upon the company’s consolidated financial position,
    results of operations, and cash flows could be material.

U.S. Government Claims

– During the second
    quarter of 2006, the U.S. Government advised the company of
    claims and penalties concerning certain potential disallowed
    costs. The parties are engaged in discussions to enable the
    company to evaluate the merits of these claims as well as to
    assess the amounts being claimed. The company does not believe,
    but can give no assurance, that the outcome of any such matters
    would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

IMPACT
    FROM HURRICANE KATRINA

During the third quarter of 2005, the company’s operations
    in the Gulf Coast area of the U.S. were significantly
    impacted by Hurricane Katrina. As a result of the hurricane, the
    Ships segment suffered property damage, contract cost growth,
    and work delays.

As of December 31, 2006, management estimates that the
    costs to

clean-up

and
    restore its operations will total approximately
    $850 million, which includes $590 million to repair or
    replace assets damaged by the storm. Substantially all of the
    estimated cost is expected to be recovered through the
    company’s comprehensive property damage insurance. As of
    December 31, 2006, the company had received
    $344 million in insurance proceeds.

Through December 31, 2006, the company has expended
    $393 million in cash to

clean-up

and
    restore its facilities, including $192 million in capital
    expenditures. During 2006 and 2005, the company incurred

clean-up

and
    restoration costs of $100 million and $101 million and
    capital expenditures of $111 million and $81 million,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2006, the company has
    written off $98 million in assets that were completely
    destroyed by the storm, of which $37 million was written
    off during 2006. During 2005, the company recorded a pre-tax
    adjustment to reduce the earned margin on its contracts in
    process by $150 million ($98 million after-tax) to
    recognize the effects of hurricane-related contract cost growth.

The company has submitted estimated expenditures for recovery to
    its insurance carriers that are substantially in excess of the
    insurance proceeds received to date, and is awaiting resolution
    of its submissions. The company is continuing to assess its
    damage estimates as the process of repairing its operations is
    performed. The company estimates this process will continue
    through 2008.

The company’s comprehensive property insurance includes
    coverage for business interruption effects caused by the storm,
    however, the company is unable to currently estimate the amount
    of any recovery or the period in which its claims related to
    business interruption will be resolved. Accordingly, no such
    amounts have been recognized by the company in the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements.

In accordance with cost accounting regulations relating to
    U.S. Government contractors, recovery of property damages
    in excess of the net book value of the damaged assets as well as
    losses on property damage that are not recovered through
    insurance are required to be included in the company’s
    overhead pools and allocated to current contracts under a
    systematic process. The company is currently in discussions with
    its government customers regarding the allocation methodology to
    be used to account for these differences. Depending upon the
    outcome of these discussions and the ultimate resolution of the
    company’s damage claims with its insurance providers, the
    company may be required to recognize additional cost growth on
    its contracts and cumulative downward adjustment to its contract
    profit rates at a future date.

The insurance provider for coverage of damages over
    $500 million advised management of a disagreement regarding
    coverage of losses in excess of $500 million, and this
    matter is currently being litigated by the company as described
    in Note 15. The company believes that its insurance
    policies are enforceable and intends to pursue all of its
    available rights and remedies. However, based on the current
    status of the litigation between the company and its insurance
    provider, no assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome
    of this matter. To the extent that its insurance recoveries are
    inadequate to fund the repair and restoration costs that the
    company deems necessary, the company will pursue other means for
    funding the shortfall, including funding from its current
    operations.

RETIREMENT
    BENEFITS

Plan
    Descriptions

Pension Benefits

– The company sponsors several
    defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. covering
    approximately 95 percent of its employees. Pension benefits
    for most employees are based on the employee’s years of
    service and compensation. It is the policy of the company to
    fund at least the minimum amount required for all qualified
    plans, using actuarial cost methods and assumptions acceptable
    under U.S. Government regulations, by making payments into
    benefit trusts separate from the company. The pension benefit
    for most employees is based upon criteria whereby employees earn
    age and service points over their employment period. Nine of the
    company’s 21 domestic qualified plans, which cover more
    than 60 percent of all employees, were in a legally defined
    full-funding limitation status at December 31, 2006.

Defined Contribution Plans

– The company also
    sponsors 401(k) defined contribution plans in which most
    employees are eligible to participate. Company contributions for
    most plans are based on a cash matching of employee
    contributions up to 4 percent of compensation. Certain
    hourly employees are covered under a target benefit plan. The
    company also participates in a multiemployer plan for certain of
    the company’s union employees. The company’s
    contributions to these plans for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, were $266 million,
    $248 million and $219 million respectively.

Non-U.S. Benefit

Plans

– The company sponsors several benefit plans
    for

non-U.S. employees.

These plans are designed to provide benefits appropriate to
    local practice and in accordance with local regulations. Some of
    these plans are funded using benefit trusts separate from the
    company.

Medical and Life Benefits

– The company
    provides a portion of the costs for certain health care and life
    insurance benefits for a substantial number of its active and
    retired employees. Covered employees achieve eligibility to
    participate in these contributory plans upon retirement from
    active service if they meet specified age and years of service
    requirements. Qualifying dependents are also eligible for
    medical coverage. Approximately 65 percent of the
    company’s current retirees participate in the medical
    plans. The company reserves the right to amend or terminate the
    plans at any time. In November 2006, the company adopted plan
    amendments and communicated to plan participants that it would
    cap the amount of its contributions to substantially all of its
    remaining post retirement medical and life benefit plans that
    were previously not subject to limits on the company’s
    contributions. Premiums charged for medical coverage are based
    on age and years of service and are adjusted annually for
    changes in the cost of the plans as determined by an independent
    actuary.

In addition to this medical inflation cost-sharing feature, the
    plans also have provisions for deductibles, co-payments,
    coinsurance percentages,

out-of-pocket

limits, conformance to a schedule of reasonable fees, the use of
    managed care providers, and maintenance of benefits with other
    plans. The plans also provide for a Medicare carve-out, and a
    maximum lifetime benefit of $2 million per covered
    individual. It is the policy of the company to fund the maximum
    amount deductible for income tax purposes utilizing Voluntary
    Employees’ Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts for
    payment of benefits. The change in benefits announced in
    November 2006 reduced benefit costs by approximately
    $17 million in 2006. In addition, this change reduced the
    company’s aggregate benefit obligation by approximately
    $465 million at December 31, 2006. Subsequent to
    January 1, 2005 (or earlier at some sectors), newly hired
    employees are not eligible for post employment medical and life
    benefits.

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization
    Act of 2003 (Act) introduced a prescription drug benefit under
    Medicare Part D as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of
    retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is
    at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. During
    the third quarter of 2004, the company recorded the effects of
    the Act retroactively to January 1, 2004, in accordance
    with the guidelines of FSP

FAS 106-2 –

Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
    Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
    2003.

The effect of the Medicare prescription drug subsidy
    on the company’s net periodic postretirement benefit cost
    for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, was a
    reduction of $26 million, $36 million and
    $17 million, respectively. The reduction in the accumulated
    postretirement benefit

-87-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

obligation as a result of the subsidy is $76 million as of
    December 31, 2006, and $225 million as of
    December 31, 2005, based on the impact of the subsidy on
    the eligible plans.

Effective December 31, 2006, the company adopted
    SFAS No. 158, which requires the recognition of the
    funded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement
    plan in the consolidated statements of financial position. On
    adoption, the company’s net unamortized benefit plan costs
    of $1.2 billion (net of tax of $838 million) was
    recorded as an adjustment to shareholders’ equity in
    accumulated other comprehensive loss. This amount represents
    previously unrecorded items to be amortized in the future to net
    periodic benefit cost, as shown in the following table:

    adoption of SFAS No. 158, were net actuarial losses
    and a transition obligation of $3.6 billion and prior
    service costs of $203 million. Amounts recognized in the
    statement of financial position at December 31, 2005,
    included a pension and postretirement benefits asset (prepaid
    benefit cost and intangible pension asset) of $2.9 billion,
    a pension and postretirement benefits liability (accrued retiree
    benefits) of $3.7 billion, and accumulated other
    comprehensive loss of $142 million (net of income taxes of
    $92 million).

The discount rate is determined by calculating, for the most
    significant plans, the weighted-average yield available on a
    portfolio of appropriately-rated corporate bonds whose proceeds
    match the expected benefit payment stream from the plan.

The assumptions used for pension benefits are consistent with
    those used for retiree medical and life insurance benefits. The
    long-term rate of return on plan assets used for the medical and
    life benefits are reduced to allow for the impact of tax on
    expected returns as, unlike the pension trust, the earnings of
    certain VEBA trusts are taxable.

Through consultation with investment advisors, expected
    long-term returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset
    classes were developed. Several factors were considered,
    including survey of investment managers’ expectations,
    current market data such as yields/price-earnings ratios, and
    historical market returns over long periods. Using policy target
    allocation percentages and the asset class expected returns, a
    weighted-average expected return was calculated.

Plan assets are invested in various asset classes that are
    expected to produce a sufficient level of diversification and
    investment return over the long term. The investment goals are
    (1) to exceed the assumed actuarial rate of return over the
    long term within reasonable and prudent levels of risk, and
    (2) to preserve the real purchasing power of assets to meet
    future obligations. Liability studies are conducted on a regular
    basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an
    objective to balance risk. Risk targets are established and
    monitored against acceptable ranges.

All investment policies and procedures are designed to ensure
    that the plans’ investments are in compliance with ERISA.
    Guidelines are established defining permitted investments within
    each asset class. Derivatives are used for transitioning assets,
    asset class rebalancing, managing currency risk, and for
    management of fixed income and alternative investments. The
    investment policies for most of the pension plans require that
    the asset allocation be maintained within the following ranges:

Asset Allocation Ranges

U.S. equity securities

30 – 40%

International equity securities

15 – 25%

Debt securities

25 – 35%

Real estate and other

10 – 20%

Current policies of the plans target an asset mix of
    70 percent in total equity securities and 30 percent
    in debt securities.

At December 31, 2006, and 2005, plan assets included
    investments with non-readily determinable fair values, comprised
    primarily of real estate, private equity, and hedge funds,
    totaling $2.7 billion and $2 billion, respectively. At
    December 31, 2006, and 2005, the pension trust and VEBA
    trusts did not hold any Northrop Grumman common stock.

In 2007, the company expects to contribute approximately
    $155 million to its pension plans and approximately
    $217 million to its other postretirement benefit plans.

    COMPENSATION PLANS

Plan
    Descriptions

At December 31, 2006, Northrop Grumman had stock-based
    compensation awards outstanding under the following plans: the
    2001 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan (2001 LTISP), the 1993
    Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan (1993 LTISP), both applicable to
    employees, and the 1993 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors
    (1993 SPND) and 1995 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee
    Directors (1995 SOPND). All of these plans were approved by the
    company’s shareholders.

Employee Plans –

The 2001 LTISP and the
    1993 LTISP permit grants to key employees of three general types
    of stock incentive awards: Stock Options, Stock Appreciation
    Rights (SARs), and Stock Awards. Each Stock Option grant is made
    with an exercise price either at the closing price of the stock
    on the date of grant (market options) or at a premium over the
    closing price of the stock on the date of grant (premium
    options). Stock Options generally vest in 25 percent
    increments over four years from the grant date under the 2001
    LTISP and in years two to five under the 1993 LTISP. Under both
    plans, options expire ten years after the grant date. No SARs
    have been granted under either of the LTISPs. Stock Awards, in
    the form of restricted performance stock rights and restricted
    stock rights, are granted to key employees without payment to
    the company. Under the 2001 LTISP, recipients of restricted
    performance stock rights earn shares of stock, based on
    financial metrics determined by the board of directors in
    accordance with the plan, over a three-year performance period
    with distributions made entirely at the end of the third year.
    If the objectives have not been met at the end of the applicable
    performance period, up to 100 percent of the original grant
    for the eight highest compensated employees and up to
    70 percent of the original grant for all other recipients
    will be forfeited. If the financial metrics are met or exceeded
    during the performance period, all recipients can earn up to
    150 percent of the original grant. Restricted stock rights
    issued under either plan generally vest after three years.
    Termination of employment can result in forfeiture of some or
    all of the benefits extended under the plan. Of the
    50 million shares approved for issuance under the 2001
    LTISP, approximately 20 million shares were available for
    future grants as of December 31, 2006.

Non-Employee Plans

– Under the 1993 SPND,
    half of the retainer fee earned by each director is paid in
    shares of common stock. In addition, directors may defer payment
    of all or part of the remaining retainer fee, which is placed in
    a stock unit account until the conclusion of board service. The
    1995 SOPND provided for annual stock option grants. Effective
    June 1, 2005, no new grants have been issued from this
    plan. Each grant of stock options under the 1995 SOPND was made
    at the closing market price on the date of the grant, was
    immediately exercisable, and expires ten years after the grant
    date. At December 31, 2006, approximately
    318,000 shares were

-92-

    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

available for future grants under the 1995 SOPND and
    45,920 shares were available for future use under the 1993
    SPND.

Adoption
    of New Standard

Prior to January 1, 2006, the company applied Accounting
    Principles Board Opinion No. 25 –

Accounting
    for Stock Issued to Employees

and related interpretations in
    accounting for awards made under the company’s stock-based
    compensation plans. Stock Options granted under the plans had an
    exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of the
    common stock on the date of the grant, and accordingly, no
    compensation expense was recognized. Stock Awards were valued at
    their fair market value measured at the date of grant, updated
    periodically using the

mark-to-market

method, and compensation expense was recognized over the vesting
    period of the award.

Effective January 1, 2006, the company adopted the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123R –

Share-Based
    Payment

(SFAS No. 123R), using the
    modified-prospective transition method. Under this transition
    method, compensation expense recognized during the year ended
    December 31, 2006, included: (a) compensation expense
    for all share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested
    as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
    SFAS No. 123 –

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

(SFAS No. 123), and
    (b) compensation expense for all share-based awards granted
    or modified on or after January 1, 2006, based on the grant
    date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123R. In accordance with the
    modified-prospective transition method, results for prior
    periods have not been restated. All of the company’s stock
    award plans are considered equity plans under
    SFAS No. 123R, and compensation expense recognized as
    previously described is net of estimated forfeitures of share
    based awards over the vesting period. The effect of adopting
    SFAS No. 123R was not material to the company’s
    income from continuing operations and net income for the year
    ended December 31, 2006, and the cumulative effect of
    adoption using the modified-prospective transition method was
    similarly not material.

Compensation
    Expense

Total stock-based compensation for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, was $202 million,
    $180 million, and $178 million, respectively, of which
    $11 million, $4 million, and $4 million related
    to Stock Options and $191 million, $176 million, and
    $174 million related to Stock Awards, respectively. Tax
    benefits recognized in the consolidated statements of income for
    stock-based compensation during the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, were $71 million,
    $63 million, and $62 million, respectively. In
    addition, the company realized excess tax benefits of
    $52 million from the exercise of Stock Options and
    $5 million from the vesting of Stock Awards in 2006.
    SFAS 123R requires that cash flows resulting from excess
    tax benefits be classified as financing cash flows in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.

Effective January 1, 2006, compensation expense for
    restricted performance stock rights is estimated based on the
    grant date fair value and recognized over the vesting period.
    The fixed 30 percent minimum distribution portion for all
    but the eight highest compensated employees is measured at the
    grant date fair value and the variable portion is adjusted to
    the expected distribution at the end of each accounting period.
    Compensation expense for restricted stock rights is measured at
    the grant date fair value and recognized over the vesting period.

Accelerated Vesting

– On May 16, 2005, in
    connection with an evaluation of the company’s overall
    incentive compensation strategy, the Compensation and Management
    Development Committee of the company’s board of directors
    approved accelerating the vesting for all outstanding unvested
    employee Stock Options (excluding options held by elected
    officers), effective September 30, 2005. As part of its
    evaluation, management considered the amount of compensation
    expense that would otherwise have been recognized in the
    company’s results of operations upon the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R. The accelerated options had a weighted
    average exercise price of $51 with original vesting dates
    through April 2009. The charge associated with the acceleration
    of vesting was not material.

Stock
    Options

The fair value of each of the company’s Stock Option awards
    is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the
    table below. The fair value of the company’s Stock Option
    awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting
    period of the options, which is generally four years. Expected
    volatility is based on an average of (1) historical
    volatility of the company’s stock and (2) implied
    volatility from traded options on the company’s stock. The
    risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the
    Stock Option award is based on the yield curve of a zero-coupon
    U.S. Treasury bond on the date the award is granted with a
    maturity equal to the expected term of the award. The company
    uses historical data to estimate forfeitures. The expected term
    of awards granted is derived from historical experience under
    the company’s stock-based compensation plans and represents
    the period of time that awards granted are expected to be
    outstanding.

The significant weighted average assumptions relating to the
    valuation of the company’s Stock Options for the years
    ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, were as follows:

The weighted average grant date fair value of Stock Options

    2004, was $17, $15, and $18 per share, respectively.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years
    ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, was
    $149 million, $50 million, and $54 million,
    respectively. Intrinsic value is measured using the fair market
    value at the date of exercise (for options exercised) or at
    December 31, 2006 (for outstanding options), less the
    applicable exercise price.

Stock Awards

– The fair value of Stock Awards
    is determined based on the closing market price of the
    company’s common stock on the grant date. Compensation
    expense for Stock Awards is measured at the grant date and
    recognized over the vesting period. For purposes of measuring
    compensation expense, the amount of shares ultimately expected
    to vest is estimated at each reporting date based on
    management’s expectations regarding the relevant
    performance criteria. In the table below, the share adjustment
    resulting from the final performance measure is considered
    granted in the period that the related grant is vested. There
    were 1.9 million and 1 million Stock Awards that
    vested in the years ended December 31, 2005, and 2004,
    respectively, with a total fair value of

-94-

$104 million and $53 million, respectively. There were
    2.3 million and 126,900 Stock Awards granted during the
    years ended December 31, 2005, and 2004, respectively, with
    a weighted average grant date fair value of $54 and $52 per

Unrecognized Compensation Expense

– At
    December 31, 2006, there was $239 million of
    unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested awards
    granted under the company’s stock-based compensation plans,
    of which $16 million relates to Stock Options and
    $223 million relates to Stock Awards. These amounts are
    expected to be charged to expense over a weighted-average period
    of 2 years.

Pro-forma Compensation Expense

– Had
    compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2005,
    and 2004, been determined based on the fair value at the grant
    dates for Stock Awards and Stock Options, consistent with
    SFAS No. 123, net income, basic earnings per share,

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

All derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or
    liabilities in the financial statements and measured at fair
    value. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial
    instruments that qualify and are designated as fair value hedges
    are required to be recorded in income from continuing
    operations, while changes in the fair value of derivative
    financial instruments that qualify and are designated as cash
    flow hedges are recorded as other comprehensive income.

The company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its
    exposure to interest rate risk and to balance its fixed and
    variable rate long-term debt portfolio. The company does not use
    derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, nor does
    it use leveraged financial instruments. Credit risk related to
    derivative financial

-95-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

instruments is considered minimal and is managed by requiring
    high credit standards for its counterparties and periodic
    settlements.

During 2004, the company entered into two interest rate swap
    agreements designed to convert fixed rates associated with
    long-term debt obligations to floating rates. These interest
    rate swaps each hedge a $200 million notional amount of
    U.S. dollar fixed rate debt, and mature on October 15,
    2009, and February 15, 2011, respectively.

These swap agreements hedge the company’s risk related to
    changes in interest rates on the fair value of the
    company’s fixed rate debt. The critical terms of the
    interest rate swaps are aligned with those of the hedged items
    and the swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges. Any
    changes in the fair value of the swaps are offset by an equal
    and opposite change in the fair value of the hedged item,
    therefore there is no net impact to the company’s reported
    results of operations. The aggregate net fair value of the swaps
    at December 31, 2006, and 2005, was a liability of
    approximately $8 million, and $7 million,
    respectively, which were included in “Other long-term
    liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated statements of
    financial position.

UNAUDITED
    SELECTED QUARTERLY DATA

Unaudited quarterly financial results are set forth in the
    following tables together with dividend and common stock price
    data. The company’s common stock is traded on the New York
    Stock Exchange (trading symbol NOC). This unaudited quarterly
    information is labeled using a calendar convention; that is,
    first quarter is consistently labeled as ended on March 31,
    second quarter as ended on June 30, and third quarter as
    ended on September 30. It is our long-standing practice to
    establish actual interim closing dates using a
    “fiscal” calendar, which requires our businesses to
    close their books on a Friday, in order to normalize the
    potentially disruptive effects of quarterly closings on business
    processes. The effects of this practice only exist within a
    reporting year.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Northrop Grumman Corporation (the company)
    prepared and is responsible for the consolidated financial
    statements and all related financial information contained in
    this Annual Report. This responsibility includes establishing
    and maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting. The company’s internal control over financial
    reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
    the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America.

To comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the
    Sarbanes – Oxley Act of 2002, the company designed and
    implemented a structured and comprehensive assessment process to
    evaluate its internal control over financial reporting across
    the enterprise. The assessment of the effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control –
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Because of its
    inherent limitations, a system of internal control over
    financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and
    may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management regularly
    monitors its internal control over financial reporting, and
    actions are taken to correct any deficiencies as they are
    identified. Based on its assessment, management has concluded
    that the company’s internal control over financial
    reporting is effective as of December 31, 2006.

Deloitte & Touche LLP issued an audit report dated
    February 20, 2007, concerning management’s assessment
    of the company’s internal control over financial reporting,
    which is contained in this Annual Report. The company’s
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, have been audited by the independent
    registered public accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche
    LLP in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL
    CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Northrop Grumman Corporation

Los Angeles, California

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting, that Northrop Grumman Corporation and
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal
    Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria
    established in

Internal Control – Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
