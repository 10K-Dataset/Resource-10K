PART I

Item 1.

Business.

(a) General Development of Business

General

Philip Morris International Inc. is a Virginia holding company incorporated in 1987. Our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are engaged
in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products in markets outside of the United States of America. Our products are sold in approximately 180 countries and, in many of these countries, they hold the number one or number two
market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands.

Our portfolio of international and local brands is led by

Marlboro

, the world’s best selling international cigarette, which accounted
for approximately 33% of our total 2011 shipment volume.

Marlboro

is complemented in the premium-price category by

Merit

,

Parliament

and

Virginia Slims

. Our leading mid-price brands are

L&M

and

Chesterfield

. Other leading international brands include

Bond Street

,

Lark

,

Muratti

,

Next

,

Philip Morris

and

Red & White

.

We also own a number of important local cigarette brands, such as

Sampoerna A

,

Dji Sam Soe

and

Sampoerna Kretek

in Indonesia,

Fortune

,

Champion

and

Hope

in the Philippines,

Diana

in Italy,

Optima

and

Apollo-Soyuz

in Russia,

Morven Gold

in
Pakistan,

Boston

in Colombia,

Belmont, Canadian Classics

and

Number 7

in Canada,

Best

and

Classic

in Serbia,

f6

in Germany,

Delicados

in Mexico,

Assos

in Greece and

Petra

in the Czech
Republic and Slovakia. While there are a number of markets where local brands remain important, international brands are expanding their share in numerous markets. With international brands contributing approximately 70% of our shipment volume in
2011, we are well-positioned to continue to benefit from this trend.

Separation from Altria Group, Inc.

We were a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”) until the distribution of all of our shares owned by Altria (the
“Spin-off”) was made on March 28, 2008 (the “Distribution Date”).

Acquisitions and Other Business Arrangements

During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we expanded our business with the following transactions:

2011:

In June 2011, we completed the acquisition of a cigarette business in Jordan, consisting primarily of cigarette manufacturing assets and
inventories, for $42 million. In January 2011, we acquired a cigar business, consisting primarily of trademarks in the Australian and New Zealand markets, for $20 million.

Effective January 1, 2011, we established a new business structure
with Vietnam National Tobacco Corporation (“Vinataba”) in Vietnam, further developing our existing joint venture with Vinataba through the licensing of

Marlboro

and establishing a PMI-controlled branch for the building of our
brands.

-1-


2010:

In February 2010, our affiliate, Philip Morris Philippines
Manufacturing Inc. (“PMPMI”), and Fortune Tobacco Corporation (“FTC”) combined their respective business activities by transferring selected assets and liabilities of PMPMI and FTC to a new company called PMFTC Inc.
(“PMFTC”). PMPMI and FTC hold equal economic interests in PMFTC, while we manage the day-to-day operations of PMFTC and have a majority of its Board of Directors. The establishment of PMFTC permits both parties to benefit from their
complementary brand portfolios, as well as cost synergies from the resulting integration of manufacturing, distribution and procurement, and the further development and advancement of tobacco growing in the Philippines.

In June 2010, we announced that our affiliate, Philip Morris Brasil
Industria e Comercio Ltda. (“PMB”), would begin directly sourcing tobacco leaf from approximately 17,000 tobacco farmers in Southern Brazil. This initiative has enhanced PMI’s direct involvement in the supply chain and provides
approximately 10% of PMI’s global leaf requirements. The vertically integrated structure was made possible following separate agreements with two leaf suppliers in Brazil, Alliance One Brasil Exportadora de Tabacos Ltda. (“AOB”) and
Universal Leaf Tabacos Ltda. (“ULT”). These agreements resulted in AOB and ULT assigning approximately 9,000 and 8,000 contracts with tobacco farmers to PMB, respectively. As a result, PMB offered employment to more than 200 employees,
most of them agronomy specialists, and acquired related assets in Southern Brazil. The purchase price for the net assets and the contractual relationships was $83 million.

2009:

In September 2009, we acquired Swedish Match South Africa
(Proprietary) Limited for ZAR 1.93 billion (approximately $256 million based on exchange rates prevailing at the time of the acquisition), including acquired cash.

In February 2009, we purchased the

Petterøes

tobacco
business for $209 million, which included fine-cut trademarks primarily sold in Norway and Sweden.

In February 2009, we also entered into an agreement with Swedish Match AB (“SWMA”) to establish an exclusive joint venture to
commercialize Swedish style snus and other smoke-free tobacco products worldwide, outside of Scandinavia and the United States. We and SWMA licensed an agreed list of trademarks and intellectual property exclusively to the joint venture. The joint
venture started operations on April 1, 2009.

Source
of Funds — Dividends

We are a legal entity
separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior
claims of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized. As a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from
the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other
distributions with respect to their common stock.

(b) Financial Information About Segments

We divide our markets into four geographic regions, which constitute our segments for financial reporting purposes:

•

The European Union (“EU”) Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland and covers all the EU countries except for Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania,
and also comprises Switzerland, Norway and Iceland, which are linked to the EU through trade agreements;

•

The Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa (“EEMA”) Region is also headquartered in Lausanne and covers the Balkans (including Slovenia,
Bulgaria and Romania), the former Soviet Union (excluding Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), Mongolia, Turkey, the Middle East and Africa and our international duty free business;

•

The Asia Region is headquartered in Hong Kong and covers all other Asian markets as well as Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands; and

•

The Latin America & Canada Region is headquartered in New York and covers the South American continent, Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean and
Canada.

Net revenues
and operating companies income

*

(together with a reconciliation to
operating income) attributable to each such segment for each of the last three years are set forth in Note 12.

Segment Reporting

to our consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2011 Annual
Report. See Part II, Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

for a discussion of our operating results by business segment.

The relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to
each reportable segment were as follows:

We use the term net revenues to refer
to our operating revenues from the sale of our products, net of sales and promotion incentives. Our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in
currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell. Mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium-price brands to mid-price or low-price brands in any given market (product mix). Mix can also refer to the proportion of
shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets (geographic mix). We often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to local governments, and, in those circumstances, we include excise
taxes in our net revenues and excise taxes on products. Our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs.

Our marketing, administration and research costs include the costs of
marketing our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate

expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products. The most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing expenses and general and administrative
expenses.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

Our subsidiaries and affiliates and their
licensees manufacture, market and sell tobacco products outside the United States.

Our total cigarette shipments increased 1.7% in 2011 to 915.3 billion units. We estimate that international cigarette market shipments were approximately 5.7 trillion units in 2011, a 1.1% increase over 2010.
We estimate that our reported share of the international cigarette market (which is defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the United States) was approximately 16.0% in each of 2011 and 2010 and 15.4% in 2009. Including the 2010 business
combination with FTC on a pro-forma basis, our total share of the international cigarette market was 16.2% and 16.5% in 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Excluding the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), we estimate that our reported share of the international cigarette market was
approximately 28.1%, 27.5%, and 25.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Including the 2010 business combination with FTC on a pro-forma basis, our total share of the international cigarette market, excluding the PRC, was 27.8% and 27.7% in 2010
and 2009, respectively.

Shipments of our principal
cigarette brand,

Marlboro

, increased 0.9% in 2011, and represented approximately 9.2% of the international cigarette market, excluding the PRC, in 2011, 9.1% in 2010 and 9.0% in 2009.

We have a cigarette market share of at least 15%, and, in a number of instances substantially more than 15%, in 97
markets, including Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland,
Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey and Ukraine.

References to total international cigarette market, total cigarette market, total market and market shares in this Form 10-K are our estimates based
on a number of internal and external sources.

Distribution and Sales

The distribution and sales strategy for our products
is tailored to the characteristics of each market, including retailer needs and capabilities, the wholesale infrastructure, our competitive position, costs and the regulatory framework. Our goal is to achieve speed, efficiency and widespread
availability of our products, while contributing to the success of our direct and indirect trade partners. The four main types of distribution that we use across the globe, often simultaneously in a given market, are:

•

Direct Sales and Distribution (“DSD”), where we have set up our own distribution directly to retailers;

•

Distribution through single independent distributors who are responsible for distribution in a single market;

•

Exclusive Zonified Distribution (“EZD”), where distributors have an exclusive territory within a market to enable them to obtain a suitable return on
their investment; and

•

Distribution through wholesalers, where we supply either national or regional wholesalers that then service the retail trade.

-4-


In many countries we also directly service key accounts, including gas stations, retail chains and
supermarkets.

Our distribution and sales systems are
supported by sales forces that total approximately 16,700 employees worldwide. Our sales forces are well trained and recognized by trade surveys for their professionalism. They have over time developed a long-lasting relationship with the wholesale
and retail trade, thus providing us with a superior presence at the point of sale, reflected by our leading market share position in many markets. In addition, our consumer engagement teams work together with the sales forces to engage adult smokers
in promotional activities and to support new product launches where permitted by law.

Our products are marketed and promoted through various media and channels, including, where permitted by law, point of sale communications, brand events, access-restricted Web sites, print, new digital technologies
and direct communication to verified adult smokers. Our direct communication with verified adult smokers utilizes mail, email and other electronic communication tools. Promotional activities include, where permitted by law, competitions, invitations
to events, interactive programs, consumer premiums and price promotions. To support advertising and promotional activities in the markets, we have a dedicated consumer engagement group that develops innovative engagement tools based on the latest
technologies and consumer trends.

Competition

We are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our
business. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, innovation, packaging, service, marketing, advertising and retail price. Our competitors include three large international tobacco companies and
several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, the PRC, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Industry consolidation and privatizations of state-owned enterprises have led
to an overall increase in competitive pressures. Some competitors have different profit and volume objectives, and some international competitors are less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates. We compete predominantly with American type
blended cigarette brands, such as

Marlboro

,

L&M

and

Chesterfield

, which are the most popular across many of our markets. We seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories, although our brand portfolio is weighted
towards the premium category.

Procurement and Raw Materials

We purchase tobacco leaf of various grades and styles
throughout the world, the majority through independent tobacco suppliers. We also contract directly with farmers in several countries including Brazil, the United States, Pakistan, Argentina, the Philippines, Poland, Italy, Colombia, Ecuador,
Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Kazakhstan.

As discussed
above, in June 2010, we announced that our affiliate, PMB, began directly sourcing tobacco leaf from tobacco farmers in Southern Brazil. This initiative enhances PMI’s direct involvement in the supply chain and provides approximately 10% of
PMI’s global leaf requirements.

Our largest sources of
supply are:

•

The United States for Virginia (flue-cured) and Burley tobaccos, particularly higher quality varieties for use in leading international brands;

•

Brazil, particularly for Virginia tobaccos but also for Burley;

•

Indonesia, mostly for domestic use in kretek products;

-5-


•

Turkey and Greece, mostly for Oriental; and

•

Argentina and Malawi, mostly for Burley.

We believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements.

In addition to tobacco leaf, we purchase a wide variety of
direct materials from a total of approximately 430 suppliers. Our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represent more than 55% of our total direct materials purchases. The three most significant direct materials that we purchase are
printed paper board used in packaging, acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in cigarette manufacturing. In addition, the supply of cloves is of particular importance to our Indonesian business.

Business Environment

Information called for by this Item is hereby incorporated by reference to the paragraphs captioned
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Operating Results by Business Segment—Business Environment” on pages 24 to 32 of the 2011 Annual Report and made a part hereof.

Other Matters

Customers

None of our business segments is dependent upon a single customer or a
few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.

Employees

As of
December 31, 2011, we employed approximately 78,100 people worldwide, including employees under temporary contracts and hourly paid part-time staff. Our businesses are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to our relationship
with our employees. Generally, these laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business. In addition, in accordance with European Union requirements, we have established a European Works Council composed of management and elected
members of our workforce. We believe that our relations with our employees and their representative organizations are excellent.

Executive Officers of the Registrant

The disclosure regarding executive officers is set forth under the heading “Executive Officers as of February 24, 2012” in
Item 10 of Part III of this Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

Research and Development

One of the top priorities of our research efforts is the development of a variety of innovative Next Generation Products (NGPs) that have the potential to reduce the risk of smoking-related diseases in comparison
to conventional cigarettes. In developing these products in its state-of-the-art R&D facilities, PMI draws upon a team of world-class scientists from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines. In 2011, we further enhanced our product
development capabilities by acquiring the global patent rights for a new technology that employs a unique method for delivering a nicotine-containing aerosol. Prior to commercialization, we are employing rigorous scientific methodologies to evaluate
and substantiate the ability of these products to reduce the individual risk of smoking-related diseases

-6-


compared to conventional tobacco products and their impact on the population as a whole. We cannot predict whether we will succeed in developing commercially viable NGPs or whether regulators
will permit the marketing of NGPs with claims of reduced risk.

We also conduct research to support and reinforce our conventional product business. We seek to be at the forefront of innovation. Significant investments have been made in new product development efforts for
conventional products, resulting in a wide range of product enhancements and the launch of innovative new products. Further, with the increase in product regulations, support for the conventional cigarette business has expanded and is expected to
become more complex, requiring additional capacity for analysis and testing in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Finally, working through biotechnology partners, we are conducting research and development on technology platforms that can potentially lead to the
development of alternative uses of tobacco.

The research
and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 is set forth in Note 14.

Additional Information

to our consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2011 Annual Report.

Intellectual Property

Our trademarks are valuable assets and their protection and reputation
are essential to us. We own the trademark rights to all of our principal brands, including

Marlboro

, or have the right to use them in all countries where we use them.

In addition, we have more than 2,700 granted patents worldwide and
about as many pending patent applications. Our patent portfolio, as a whole, is material to our business. However, no one patent, or group of related patents, is material to us. We also have proprietary secrets, technology, know-how, processes and
other intellectual property rights that are not registered.

Effective January 1, 2008, PMI entered into an Intellectual Property Agreement with Philip Morris USA Inc. (“PM USA”). The
Intellectual Property Agreement governs the ownership of intellectual property between PMI and PM USA. Ownership of the jointly funded intellectual property has been allocated as follows:

•

PMI owns all rights to the jointly funded intellectual property outside the United States, its territories and possessions; and

•

PM USA owns all rights to the jointly funded intellectual property in the United States, its territories and possessions.

Ownership of intellectual property related to patent applications and
resulting patents based solely on the jointly-funded intellectual property, regardless of when filed or issued, will be exclusive to PM USA in the United States, its territories and possessions and exclusive to PMI everywhere else in the world.

The Intellectual Property Agreement contains provisions
concerning intellectual property that is independently developed by us or PM USA following the Distribution Date. For the first two years following the Distribution Date, if we or PM USA independently developed new intellectual property that
satisfied certain conditions and was incorporated into a new product or included in a patent application, the new intellectual property is subject to the geographic allocation described above. For ten years following the Distribution Date,
independently developed intellectual property may be subject to rights under certain circumstances that would allow either us or PM USA a priority position to obtain the rights to the new intellectual property from the other party, with the price
and other terms to be negotiated.

-7-


In the event of a dispute between us and PM USA under the Intellectual Property Agreement, we have
agreed with PM USA to submit the dispute first to negotiation between our and PM USA’s senior executives and then to binding arbitration.

Seasonality

Our business segments are not significantly affected by seasonality, although in certain markets cigarette consumption trends rise during the summer
months due to longer daylight time and tourism.

Environmental Regulation

We are subject to applicable international, national
and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. We have specific programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements and reduce wastage as well as water and
energy consumption. We have developed and implemented a consistent environmental and occupational health and safety (“EHS”) management system, which involves policies, standard practices and procedures at all our manufacturing centers. We
also conduct regular safety assessments at our offices, warehouses and car fleet organizations. Furthermore, we have engaged an external certification body to validate the effectiveness of our EHS management system at all our manufacturing centers
around the world, in accordance with internationally recognized standards. Our subsidiaries expect to continue to make investments in order to drive improved performance and maintain compliance with environmental laws and regulations. We assess and
report the compliance status of all our legal entities on a regular basis. Based on the management and controls we have in place, environmental expenditures have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated
results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position, earnings or competitive position.

(d) Financial Information About Geographic Areas

The amounts of net revenues and long-lived assets attributable to each of our geographic segments for each of the last three fiscal years are set
forth in Note 12.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in
this Annual Report. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual
Report.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements

We may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking
statements, including statements contained in filings with the SEC, in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts. You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as “strategy,”
“expects,” “continues,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “will,” “estimates,” “intends,” “projects,” “goals,” “targets” and other words
of similar meaning. You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.

We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions.
Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from
those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made
by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. We elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document, particularly in the “Business Environment” section. You should understand
that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement
that we may make from time to time except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations.

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry

Cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. Significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. These
tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors.

Tax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of manufactured cigarettes versus
other tobacco products, or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our manufactured cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. Because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium-price
manufactured cigarette category, tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets. As a result, our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets.

Increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an
adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premium-price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories, where we may
be under-represented, from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products, or to illicit products such as contraband and counterfeit.

-9-


Our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of
preventing the use of tobacco products.

Governmental
actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets, and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels
and will increase downtrading and the risk of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases. Significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the World Health
Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (“FCTC”). The FCTC is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation. The FCTC has led to
increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to reduce the palatability and attractiveness of tobacco products to adult smokers. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include:

•

the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges;

•

restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship;

•

the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements;

•

restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors, and plain packaging;

•

restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines;

•

requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents;

•

disclosure, restrictions, or bans of tobacco product ingredients;

•

increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors;

•

elimination of duty free allowances for travelers; and

•

encouraging litigation against tobacco companies.

Our operating income could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands, in
particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products, as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements.

Litigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke
(“ETS”) could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity.

There is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions. Damages claimed in some tobacco-related litigation are significant
and, in certain cases in Brazil, Canada, Israel and Nigeria, range into the billions of U.S. dollars. We anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed. The FCTC encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers. It is possible that
our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. See Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

of this Form 10-K.

We face intense competition, and our
failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, innovation, packaging, service, marketing,
advertising and price. We are subject to highly competitive

-10-


conditions in all aspects of our business. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence,
competitors’ introduction of lower-price products or innovative products, higher tobacco product taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate
tobacco products. Competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, the PRC, Taiwan, Thailand and
Vietnam. Industry consolidation and privatizations of state-owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures. Some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are less
susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates.

Because we have
operations in numerous countries, our results may be influenced by economic, regulatory and political developments in many countries.

Some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes. In others, nationalization,
terrorism, conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment. Economic, political, regulatory or other developments could disrupt our supply chain or our distribution capabilities. In addition, such
developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations, which could reduce our volumes, revenues and net earnings. In certain markets, we
are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes.

In addition, despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct, given the breadth and scope of our international operations, we may
not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and international partners.

We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns.

Our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences,
which may be influenced by local economic conditions. To be successful, we must:

•

promote brand equity successfully;

•

anticipate and respond to new consumer trends;

•

develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios;

•

improve productivity; and

•

be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases.

In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may tend to purchase
lower-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly.

We lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases.

Large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the
international market. We believe that

Marlboro

is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand, although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity. In addition, our revenues are reduced by contraband
and legal cross-border purchases.

-11-


From time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of
matters.

Investigations include allegations of
contraband shipments of cigarettes, allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets, allegations of underpayment of customs duties and/or excise taxes, and allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors such as
“lights” and “ultra lights.” We cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced, and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome
of pending or future investigations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Operating Results by Business Segment—Business Environment—Governmental Investigations” for
a description of governmental investigations to which we are subject.

We
may be unsuccessful in our attempts to produce products with the potential to reduce the risk of smoking-related diseases.

We continue to seek ways to develop commercially viable new product technologies that may reduce the risk of smoking. Our goal is to develop
products whose potential for risk reduction can be substantiated and meet adult smokers’ taste expectations. We may not succeed in these efforts. If we do not succeed, but others do, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, we
cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of tobacco products with claims of reduced risk to consumers, which could significantly undermine the commercial viability of these products.

Our reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange
rates, and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness.

We conduct our business primarily in local currency and, for purposes of financial reporting, the local currency results are translated into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a
reporting period. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. During periods of local economic crises, foreign
currencies may be devalued significantly against the U.S. dollar, reducing our margins. Actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position.

The repatriation of our foreign earnings, changes in the earnings mix, and changes
in U.S. tax laws may increase our effective tax rate.

Because we are a U.S. holding company, our most significant source of funds is distributions from our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Under current U.S. tax
law, in general we do not pay U.S. taxes on our foreign earnings until they are repatriated to the U.S. as distributions from our non-U.S. subsidiaries. These distributions may result in a residual U.S. tax cost. It may be advantageous to us in
certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions, which could result in a material increase in our overall effective tax rate. Additionally, the Obama Administration has indicated that it favors changes in U.S. tax
law that would fundamentally change how our earnings are taxed in the U.S. If enacted and depending upon its precise terms, such legislation could increase our overall effective tax rate.

Our ability to grow may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or to improve our margins through
higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.

Our profitability may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise prices or maintain an acceptable proportion of our sales of higher margin products and sales in
higher margin geographies.

-12-


We may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions and the development of strategic
business relationships.

One element of our growth
strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. Acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of
failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms, or that future
acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings.

Government mandated prices, production control programs, shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impacts of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other
agricultural products used to manufacture our products.

As with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand, and crop quality
can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. Tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. Changes
in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco. Any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices, quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business.

Our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global
talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking.

The tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance. As a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent.

The failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration
by outside parties with the intent to corrupt them could result in business disruption, loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data.

We use information systems to help manage business processes, collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with
employees, suppliers, customers and others. Some of these information systems are managed by third-party service providers. We have backup systems and business continuity plans in place, and we take care to protect our systems and data from
unauthorized access. Nevertheless, failure of our systems to function as intended, or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes, could result in loss of
revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data, cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs to us.

Item 1B.

Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2.

Properties.

As of December 31, 2011, we operated and owned 55 manufacturing facilities, operated one leased manufacturing facility in Mexico, and
maintained contract manufacturing relationships with 21 third-party manufacturers across 23 markets. In addition, we work with 38 third-party operators in Indonesia who manufacture our hand-rolled cigarettes.

PMI Owned Manufacturing Facilities

In 2011, 27 of our facilities each
manufactured over 10 billion cigarettes, of which 7 facilities each produced over 30 billion units. Our largest factories are in Bergen-op-Zoom (the Netherlands), St. Petersburg (Russia), Berlin (Germany), Marikina and Batangas
(Philippines), Krakow (Poland), Izmir (Turkey), Kharkiv (Ukraine), Neuchatel (Switzerland), Merlo (Argentina) and Karawang (Indonesia). Our smallest factories are mostly in Latin America and Asia, where due to tariff constraints we have
established small manufacturing units in individual markets, several of which are make-pack operations. We will continue to optimize our manufacturing base, taking into consideration the evolution of trade blocks.

The plants and properties owned or leased and operated by our
subsidiaries are maintained in good condition and are believed to be suitable and adequate for our present needs.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

Litigation—General

Legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us, and/or our subsidiaries, and/or our indemnitees in various
jurisdictions. Our indemnitees include distributors, licensees, and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend, as well as pay costs and some or all of judgments, if any, that may be entered against
them. Pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement between Altria and PMI, PMI will indemnify Altria and PM USA for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured for PMI by PM
USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI. Various types of claims are raised in these proceedings, including,
among others, product liability, consumer protection, antitrust, employment and tax.

It is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related litigation could encourage the commencement
of additional litigation.

-14-


Damages claimed in some of the tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in
Brazil, Canada, Israel and Nigeria, range into the billions of dollars. The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be
specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. Much of the tobacco-related litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty. However, as discussed below, we have to date been largely successful in
defending tobacco-related litigation.

We and our
subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, while it is
reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, after assessing the information available to it (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases;
(ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable
outcomes in these cases, if any. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.

It is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of
certain pending litigation. Nevertheless, although litigation is subject to uncertainty, we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that we have valid defenses
to the litigation pending against us, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts, if any. All such cases are, and will continue to be, vigorously defended. However, we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in
particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so.

The table below lists the number of tobacco-related cases pending against us and/or our subsidiaries or indemnitees as of February 15, 2012, December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009:

Since 1995, when the first
tobacco-related litigation was filed against a PMI entity, 377 Smoking and Health, Lights, Health Care Cost Recovery, and Public Civil Actions in which we and/or one of our subsidiaries and/or indemnitees were a defendant have been terminated in our
favor. Ten cases have had decisions in favor of plaintiffs. Six of these cases have subsequently reached final resolution in our favor and four remain on appeal. To date, we have paid total judgments including costs of approximately six thousand
Euros. These payments were made in order to appeal three Italian small claims cases, two of which were subsequently reversed on appeal and one of which remains on appeal. To date, no tobacco-related case has been finally resolved in favor of a
plaintiff against us, our subsidiaries or indemnitees.

Brazil/The Smoker Health Defense Association

Class Action

The Civil Court of São Paulo found defendants liable without hearing evidence. The court did not assess moral or actual damages, which were to be assessed in a second phase of the
case. The size of the class was not defined in the ruling.

In April 2004, the court clarified its ruling, awarding “moral damages” of R$1,000 (approximately $530) per smoker per full year of smoking plus interest at the rate of 1% per
month, as of the date of the ruling. The court did not award actual damages, which were to be assessed in the second phase of the case. The size of the class was not estimated. Defendants appealed to the São Paulo Court of Appeals, which
annulled the ruling in November 2008, finding that the trial court had inappropriately ruled without hearing evidence and returned the case to the trial court for further proceedings. In May 2011, the trial court dismissed the claim. Plaintiff has
appealed. In addition, the defendants filed a constitutional appeal to the Federal Supreme Tribunal on the basis that the plaintiff did not have standing to bring the lawsuit. This appeal is still pending.

Pending claims related to tobacco
products generally fall within the following categories:

Smoking and Health Litigation:

These cases primarily allege personal injury and are brought by individual plaintiffs or on behalf of a class
of individual plaintiffs. Plaintiffs’ allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery, including negligence, gross negligence, strict liability, fraud, misrepresentation, design defect, failure to warn, breach
of express and implied warranties, violations of deceptive trade practice laws and consumer protection statutes. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief, including compensatory and other damages, and injunctive and equitable relief.
Defenses raised in these cases include licit activity, failure to state a claim, lack of defect, lack of proximate cause, assumption of the risk, contributory negligence, and statute of limitations.

-17-


As of February 15, 2012, there were a number of smoking and health cases pending against us, our
subsidiaries or indemnitees, as follows:

•

76 cases brought by individual plaintiffs in Argentina (32), Brazil (31), Canada (2), Chile (2), Greece (1), Italy (5), the Philippines (1), Scotland
(1) and Turkey (1), compared with 94 such cases on December 31, 2010, and 119 cases on December 31, 2009; and

•

10 cases brought on behalf of classes of individual plaintiffs in Brazil (2) and Canada (8), compared with 11 such cases on December 31, 2010, and 9
such cases on December 31, 2009.

In
the first class action pending in Brazil,

The Smoker Health Defense Association (ADESF) v. Souza Cruz, S.A. and Philip Morris Marketing, S.A., Nineteenth Lower Civil Court of the Central Courts of the Judiciary District of São Paulo,
Brazil

, filed July 25, 1995, our subsidiary and another member of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, a consumer organization, is seeking damages for smokers and former smokers and injunctive relief. The verdict and post-trial
developments in this case are described in the above table.

In the second class action pending in Brazil

, Public Prosecutor of São Paulo v. Philip Morris Brasil Industria e Comercio Ltda., Civil
Court of the City of São Paulo, Brazil,

filed August 6, 2007, our subsidiary is a defendant. The plaintiff, the Public Prosecutor of the State of São Paulo, is seeking (i) unspecified damages on behalf of all smokers
nationwide, former smokers, and their relatives; (ii) unspecified damages on behalf of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (“ETS”) nationwide, and their relatives; and (iii) reimbursement of the health care costs
allegedly incurred for the treatment of tobacco-related diseases by all Brazilian States and Municipalities, and the Federal District. In an interim ruling issued in December 2007, the trial court limited the scope of this claim to the State of
São Paulo only. In December 2008, the Seventh Civil Court of São Paulo issued a decision declaring that it lacked jurisdiction because the case involved issues similar to the

ADESF

case discussed above and should be transferred
to the Nineteenth Lower Civil Court in São Paulo where the

ADESF

case is pending. The court further stated that these cases should be consolidated for the purposes of judgment. Our subsidiary appealed this decision to the State of
São Paulo Court of Appeals, which subsequently declared the case stayed pending the outcome of the appeal. In April 2010, the São Paulo Court of Appeals reversed the Seventh Civil Court’s decision that consolidated the cases,
finding that they are based on different legal claims and are progressing at different stages of proceedings. This case was returned to the Seventh Civil Court of São Paulo, and our subsidiary filed its closing arguments in December 2010.

In the first class action pending in Canada,

Cecilia
Letourneau v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd., Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. and JTI Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada,

filed in September 1998, our subsidiary and other Canadian manufacturers are defendants. The plaintiff, an
individual smoker, is seeking compensatory and unspecified punitive damages for each member of the class who is deemed addicted to smoking. The class was certified in 2005. Pre-trial proceedings are ongoing. On February 14, 2012, the court
ruled that the federal government will remain as a third-party in the case. Trial is scheduled to begin on March 12, 2012.

Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation:

These cases, brought by governmental and non-governmental plaintiffs, seek reimbursement of health
care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products. Plaintiffs’ allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery including unjust enrichment, negligence, negligent design, strict liability, breach of
express and implied warranties, violation of a voluntary undertaking or special duty, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conspiracy, public nuisance, defective product, failure to warn, sale of cigarettes to minors, and claims under statutes
governing competition and deceptive trade practices. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief including compensatory and other damages, and injunctive and equitable relief. Defenses raised in these cases include lack of proximate
cause, remoteness of injury, failure to state a claim, adequate remedy at law, “unclean hands” (namely, that plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief because they participated in, and benefited from, the sale of cigarettes), and statute
of limitations.

As of February 15, 2012, there were 10
health care cost recovery cases pending against us, our subsidiaries or indemnitees in Canada (4), Nigeria (5) and Spain (1), compared with 10 such cases on December 31, 2010 and 11 such cases on December 31, 2009.

In the first health care cost recovery case pending in Canada,

Her
Majesty the Queen in Right of British Columbia v. Imperial Tobacco Limited, et al., Supreme Court, British Columbia, Vancouver Registry, Canada,

filed January 24, 2001, we, our subsidiaries, our indemnitee (PM USA), and other members of the
industry are defendants. The plaintiff, the government of the province of British Columbia, brought a claim based upon legislation enacted by the province authorizing the government to file a direct action against cigarette manufacturers to recover
the health care costs it has incurred, and will incur, resulting from a “tobacco related wrong.” The Supreme Court of Canada has held that the statute is constitutional. We and certain other non-Canadian defendants challenged the
jurisdiction of the court. The court rejected the jurisdictional challenge, and pre-trial discovery is ongoing. The trial court also has granted plaintiff’s request that the target trial date of September 2011 be postponed indefinitely.
Meanwhile, in December 2009, the British Columbia Court of Appeal ruled that the defendants could pursue a third-party claim against the government of Canada for negligently misrepresenting to defendants the efficacy of the low tar tobacco strain
that the federal government developed and licensed to some of the defendants. In May 2010, the Supreme Court of Canada agreed to hear both the appeal of the Attorney General of Canada and the defendants’ cross-appeal from the British Columbia
Court of Appeal decision. In July 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the third-party claims against the federal government.

In the second health care cost recovery case filed in Canada,

Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Brunswick v. Rothmans Inc., et al., Court of
Queen’s Bench of New Brunswick, Trial Court, New

-20-


Brunswick, Fredericton, Canada,

filed March 13, 2008, we, our subsidiaries, our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria Group, Inc.), and other members of the industry are defendants. The
claim was filed by the government of the province of New Brunswick based on legislation enacted in the province. This legislation is similar to the law introduced in British Columbia that authorizes the government to file a direct action against
cigarette manufacturers to recover the health care costs it has incurred, and will incur, as a result of a “tobacco related wrong.” Pre-trial discovery is ongoing.

In the third health care cost recovery case filed in Canada,

Her
Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario v. Rothmans Inc., et al., Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Toronto, Canada

, filed September 29, 2009, we, our subsidiaries, our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria Group, Inc.), and other members of the
industry are defendants. The claim was filed by the government of the province of Ontario based on legislation enacted in the province. This legislation is similar to the laws introduced in British Columbia and New Brunswick that authorize the
government to file a direct action against cigarette manufacturers to recover the health care costs it has incurred, and will incur, as a result of a “tobacco related wrong.” Preliminary motions are pending.

In the fourth health care cost recovery case filed in Canada,

Attorney General of Newfoundland and Labrador v. Rothmans Inc., et al., Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador, St. Johns, Canada

, filed February 8, 2011, we, our subsidiaries, our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria Group, Inc.), and
other members of the industry are defendants. The claim was filed by the government of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador based on legislation enacted in the province that is similar to the laws introduced in British Columbia, New Brunswick
and Ontario. The legislation authorizes the government to file a direct action against cigarette manufacturers to recover the health care costs it has incurred, and will incur, as a result of a “tobacco related wrong.” Preliminary motions
are pending.

In the first case in Nigeria,

The Attorney
General of Lagos State v. British American Tobacco (Nigeria) Limited, et al., High Court of Lagos State, Lagos, Nigeria,

filed April 30, 2007, our subsidiary and other members of the industry are defendants. Plaintiff seeks reimbursement
for the cost of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the past 20 years, payment of anticipated costs of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the next 20 years, various forms of injunctive relief, plus punitive damages. In February
2008, our subsidiary was served with a Notice of Discontinuance. The claim was formally dismissed in March 2008. However, the plaintiff has since refiled its claim. Our subsidiary is in the process of making challenges to service and the
court’s jurisdiction. Currently, the case is stayed in the trial court pending the appeals of certain co-defendants relating to service objections. We currently have no employees, operations or assets in Nigeria.

In the second case in Nigeria,

The Attorney General of Kano State v.
British American Tobacco (Nigeria) Limited, et al., High Court of Kano State, Kano, Nigeria,

filed May 9, 2007, our subsidiary and other members of the industry are defendants. Plaintiff seeks reimbursement for the cost of treating alleged
smoking-related diseases for the past 20 years, payment of anticipated costs of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the next 20 years, various forms of injunctive relief, plus punitive damages. Our subsidiary is in the process of making
challenges to service and the court’s jurisdiction.

In
the third case in Nigeria,

The Attorney General of Gombe State v. British American Tobacco (Nigeria) Limited, et al., High Court of Gombe State, Gombe, Nigeria,

filed May 18, 2007, our subsidiary and other members of the industry are
defendants

.

Plaintiff seeks reimbursement for the cost of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the past 20 years, payment of anticipated costs of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the next 20 years, various forms of
injunctive relief, plus punitive damages. In July 2008, the court dismissed the case against all defendants based on the plaintiff’s failure to comply with various procedural requirements when filing and serving the complaint. The plaintiff did
not appeal the dismissal. However, in October 2008, the plaintiff refiled its claim. In

-21-


June 2010, the court ordered the plaintiff to amend the claim to properly name Philip Morris International Inc. as a defendant. Philip Morris International Inc. objected to plaintiff’s
attempted service of amended process. In February 2011, the court granted, in part, our service objections, ruling that the plaintiff had not complied with the procedural steps necessary to serve us. As a result of this ruling, Philip Morris
International Inc. is not currently a defendant in the case. Plaintiff may appeal the ruling or follow the procedural steps required to serve Philip Morris International Inc.

In the fourth case in Nigeria,

The Attorney General of Oyo State, et
al., v. British American Tobacco (Nigeria) Limited, et al., High Court of Oyo State, Ibadan, Nigeria,

filed May 25, 2007, our subsidiary and other members of the industry are defendants

.

Plaintiffs seek reimbursement for the cost of
treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the past 20 years, payment of anticipated costs of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the next 20 years, various forms of injunctive relief, plus punitive damages. Our subsidiary challenged
service as improper. In June 2010, the court ruled that plaintiffs did not have leave to serve the writ of summons on the defendants and that they must re-serve the writ. Our subsidiary has not yet been re-served.

In the fifth case in Nigeria,

The Attorney General of Ogun State v.
British American Tobacco (Nigeria) Limited, et al., High Court of Ogun State, Abeokuta, Nigeria

, filed February 26, 2008, our subsidiary and other members of the industry are defendants. Plaintiff seeks reimbursement for the cost of
treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the past 20 years, payment of anticipated costs of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the next 20 years, various forms of injunctive relief, plus punitive damages. In May 2010, the trial court
rejected our subsidiary’s service objections. Our subsidiary has appealed.

In a series of proceedings in Spain,

Junta de Andalucia, et al. v. Philip Morris Spain, et al., Court of First Instance, Madrid, Spain,

the first of which was filed February 21, 2002, our subsidiary and
other members of the industry were defendants. The plaintiffs sought reimbursement for the cost of treating certain of their citizens for various smoking-related illnesses. In May 2004, the first instance court dismissed the initial case, finding
that the State was a necessary party to the claim, and thus, the claim must be filed in the Administrative Court. The plaintiffs appealed. In February 2006, the appellate court affirmed the lower court’s dismissal. The plaintiffs then filed
notice that they intended to pursue their claim in the Administrative Court against the State. Because they were defendants in the original proceeding, our subsidiary and other members of the industry filed notices with the Administrative Court that
they are interested parties in the case. In September 2007, the plaintiffs filed their complaint in the Administrative Court. In November 2007, the Administrative Court dismissed the claim based on a procedural issue. The plaintiffs asked the
Administrative Court to reconsider its decision dismissing the case, and that request was rejected in a ruling rendered in February 2008. Plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court rejected plaintiffs’ appeal in November 2009,
resulting in the final dismissal of the claim. However, plaintiffs have filed a second claim in the Administrative Court against the Ministry of Economy. This second claim seeks the same relief as the original claim, but relies on a different
procedural posture. The Administrative Court has recognized our subsidiary as a party in this proceeding. Our subsidiary and other defendants filed preliminary objections that resulted in a stay of the term to file the answer. In May 2011, the court
rejected the defendants’ preliminary objections, but it has not yet set a deadline for defendants to file their answers.

Lights Cases:

These cases, brought by individual plaintiffs, or on behalf of a class of individual plaintiffs, allege that the use of
the term “lights” constitutes fraudulent and misleading conduct. Plaintiffs’ allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery including misrepresentation, deception, and breach of consumer protection
laws. Plaintiffs seek various forms of relief including restitution, injunctive relief, and compensatory and other damages. Defenses raised include lack of causation, lack of reliance, assumption of the risk, and statute of limitations.

As of February 15, 2012, there were a number of lights cases pending against our subsidiaries or
indemnitees, as follows:

•

2 cases brought on behalf of various classes of individual plaintiffs (some overlapping) in Israel, compared with 2 such cases on December 31, 2010, and 3
such cases on December 31, 2009; and

•

9 cases brought by individuals in the equivalent of small claims courts in Italy, where the maximum damages are approximately one thousand Euros per case,
compared with 10 such cases on December 31, 2010, and 12 such cases on December 31, 2009.

In the first class action pending in Israel,

El-Roy, et al. v. Philip Morris Incorporated, et al., District Court of Tel-Aviv/Jaffa, Israel,

filed January 18, 2004, our subsidiary and our indemnitees (PM USA and our former importer) are defendants. The plaintiffs filed a purported class action claiming that the class members were misled by the descriptor “lights” into
believing that lights cigarettes are safer than full flavor cigarettes. The claim seeks recovery of the purchase price of lights cigarettes and compensation for distress for each class member. Hearings took place in November and December 2008
regarding whether the case meets the legal requirements necessary to allow it to proceed as a class action. The parties’ briefing on class certification was completed in March 2011. A hearing for final oral argument on class certification took
place in November 2011. We are awaiting the court’s decision.

The claims in a second class action pending in Israel,

Navon, et al. v. Philip Morris Products USA, et al., District Court of Tel-Aviv/Jaffa, Israel

, filed December 5, 2004, against our indemnitee (our
distributor) and other members of the industry are similar to those in

El-Roy,

and the case is currently stayed pending a ruling on class certification in

El-Roy

.

Public Civil Actions:

Claims have been filed either by an
individual, or a public or private entity, seeking to protect collective or individual rights, such as the right to health, the right to information or the right to safety. Plaintiffs’ allegations of liability in these cases are based on
various theories of recovery including product defect, concealment, and misrepresentation. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief including injunctive relief such as banning cigarettes, descriptors, smoking in certain places and
advertising, as well as implementing communication campaigns and reimbursement of medical expenses incurred by public or private institutions.

As of February 15, 2012, there were 3 public civil actions pending against our subsidiaries in Argentina (1), Brazil (1), and Venezuela (1),
compared with 7 such cases on December 31, 2010, and 11 such cases on December 31, 2009.

In the public civil action in Argentina,

Asociación Argentina de Derecho de Danos v. Massalin Particulares S.A., et al., Civil Court of Buenos Aires, Argentina,

filed February 26, 2007, our
subsidiary and another member of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, a consumer association, seeks the establishment of a relief fund for reimbursement of medical costs associated with diseases allegedly caused by smoking. Our subsidiary
filed its answer in September 2007. In March 2010, the case file was transferred to the Federal Court on Administrative Matters after the Civil Court granted the plaintiff’s request to add the national government as a co-plaintiff in the case.

In the public civil action in Brazil,

The Brazilian
Association for the Defense of Consumer Health (“SAUDECON”) v. Philip Morris Brasil Industria e Comercio Ltda. and Souza Cruz S.A., Civil Court of City of Porto Alegre, Brazil,

filed November 3, 2008, our subsidiary is a
defendant. The plaintiff, a consumer organization, is asking the court to establish a fund that will be used to provide treatment to smokers who claim to be addicted and who do not otherwise have access to smoking cessation treatment. Plaintiff
requests that each defendant’s liability be determined according to its market share. In May 2009, the trial court dismissed the case on the merits. Plaintiff has appealed.

In the public civil action in Venezuela,

Federation of Consumers and Users Associations
(“FEVACU”), et al. v. National Assembly of Venezuela and the Venezuelan Ministry of Health, Constitutional Chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court

, filed April 29, 2008, we were not named as a defendant, but the plaintiffs
published a notice pursuant to court order, notifying all interested parties to appear in the case. In January 2009, our subsidiary appeared in the case in response to this notice. The plaintiffs purport to represent the right to
health of the citizens of Venezuela and claim that the government failed to protect adequately its citizens’ right to health. The claim asks the court to order the government to enact stricter regulations on the manufacture and sale of tobacco
products. In addition, the plaintiffs ask the court to order companies involved in the tobacco industry to allocate a percentage of their “sales or benefits” to establish a fund to pay for the health care costs of treating
smoking-related diseases. In October 2008, the court ruled that plaintiffs have standing to file the claim and that the claim meets the threshold admissibility requirements.

Other Litigation

Other litigation includes an antitrust suit, a breach of contract
action, various tax and individual employment cases and a tort claim.

Antitrust:

In the antitrust class action in Kansas,

Smith v. Philip Morris Companies Inc., et al., District Court of Seward County, Kansas

, filed February 7, 2000, we and other members of the
industry are defendants. The plaintiff asserts that the defendant cigarette companies engaged in an international conspiracy to fix wholesale prices of cigarettes and sought certification of a class comprised of all persons in Kansas who were
indirect purchasers of cigarettes from the defendants. The plaintiff claims unspecified economic damages resulting from the alleged price-fixing, trebling of those damages under the Kansas price-fixing statute and counsel fees. The trial court
granted plaintiff’s motion for class certification in 2001. Defendants’ motions for summary judgment were argued in January 2012. In the event the summary judgment motions are not granted, the court has set a trial date in July 2012.

Breach of Contract:

In the breach of contract action
in Ontario, Canada,

The Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers’ Marketing Board, et al. v. Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc., Superior Court of Justice, London, Ontario, Canada,

filed November 5, 2009, our subsidiary is a
defendant. Plaintiffs in this putative class action allege that our subsidiary breached contracts with the proposed class members (Ontario tobacco growers and their related associations) concerning the sale and purchase of flue-cured tobacco from
January 1, 1986 to December 31, 1996. Plaintiffs allege that our subsidiary was required by the contracts to disclose to plaintiffs the quantity of tobacco included in cigarettes to be sold for duty free and export purposes (which it
purchased at a lower price per pound than tobacco that was included in cigarettes to be sold in Canada), but failed to disclose that some of the cigarettes it designated as being for export and duty free purposes were ultimately sold in Canada. Our
subsidiary has been served, but there is currently no deadline to respond to the statement of claim. In September 2011, plaintiffs served a notice of motion seeking class certification.

Tax:

In Brazil, there are 114 tax cases involving Philip Morris Brasil S.A. and Philip Morris Brasil Ltda.
relating to the payment of state tax on the sale and transfer of goods and services, federal social contributions, excise, social security and income tax, and other matters. Fifty-eight of these cases are under administrative review
by the relevant fiscal authorities and 56 are under judicial review by the courts.

Employment:

Our subsidiaries, Philip Morris Brasil S.A. and Philip Morris Brasil Ltda., are defendants in various individual employment cases resulting, among other things, from the termination of employment
in connection with the shut-down of one of our factories in Brazil.

Tort:

In the action in Delaware,

Antonio Emilio Hupan et al. v. Alliance One International,
Inc. et al. Superior Court for the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County,

filed February 13, 2012, we, our subsidiaries, other members of the industry, certain companies allegedly involved in the purchase of tobacco leaf in
Argentina, and certain companies allegedly involved in the manufacture of pesticides are defendants. Plaintiffs in this action are eight children born between the years of 1996 and 2008 and their families, all residing in Argentina. The plaintiffs
claim that the children developed birth defects as a result of the exposure of their parents to pesticides while working on farms in Argentina. The plaintiffs allege that we, our subsidiaries, other members of the industry, and certain companies
allegedly involved in the purchase of tobacco leaf in Argentina required the use of pesticides in tobacco growing while failing to warn tobacco growers of the risks. The plaintiffs claim unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. Neither we nor
our subsidiaries have been served with the complaint.

Third-Party Guarantees

At December 31, 2011, PMI’s third-party guarantees were $7 million, of which $2 million expire through December 31, 2012, and the
remainder through 2015. PMI is required to perform under these guarantees in the event that a third party fails to make contractual payments. PMI does not have a liability on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011, as the fair
value of these guarantees is insignificant due to the fact that the probability of future payments under these guarantees is remote.
