DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE



In this report, “PMI,” “we,” “us” and “our” refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries.


PART I

Item 1.

Business.

(a) General Development of Business

General

Philip Morris International Inc. is a Virginia holding company incorporated in 1987. Our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products in markets outside of the United States of America. Our products are sold in more than 180 markets and, in many of these markets, they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands.

Our portfolio of international and local brands is led by

Marlboro

, the world’s best selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately

33%

of our total 2012 shipment volume.

Marlboro

is complemented in the premium-price category by

Merit

,

Parliament

and

Virginia Slims

. Our leading mid-price brands are

L&M

and

Chesterfield

. Other leading international brands include

Bond Street

,

Lark

,

Muratti

,

Next

,

Philip Morris

and

Red & White

.

We also own a number of important local cigarette brands, such as

Sampoerna

,

Dji Sam Soe

and

U Mild

in Indonesia,

Fortune

,

Champion

and

Hope

in the Philippines,

Diana

in Italy,

Optima

and

Apollo-Soyuz

in Russia,

Morven Gold

in Pakistan,

Boston

in Colombia,

Belmont, Canadian Classics

and

Number 7

in Canada,

Best

and

Classic

in Serbia,

f6

in Germany,

Delicados

in Mexico,

Assos

in Greece and

Petra

in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. While there are a number of markets where local brands remain important, international brands are expanding their share in numerous markets. With international brands contributing approximately

70%

of our shipment volume in 2012, we are well-positioned to continue to benefit from this trend.

Separation from Altria Group, Inc.

We were a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”) until the distribution of all of our shares owned by Altria (the “Spin-off”) was made on March 28, 2008 (the “Distribution Date”).

Acquisitions and Other Business Arrangements

During


, we did not acquire any businesses. During


and


, we expanded our business with the following transactions:


:

In June 2011, we completed the acquisition of a cigarette business in Jordan, consisting primarily of cigarette manufacturing assets and inventories, for

$42 million

. In January 2011, we acquired a cigar business, consisting primarily of trademarks in the Australian and New Zealand markets, for

$20 million

.

Effective January 1, 2011, we established a new business structure with Vietnam National Tobacco Corporation (“Vinataba”) in Vietnam, further developing our existing joint venture with Vinataba through the licensing of

Marlboro

and establishing a PMI-controlled branch for the building of our brands.


:

In February 2010, our affiliate, Philip Morris Philippines Manufacturing Inc. (“PMPMI”), and Fortune Tobacco Corporation (“FTC”) combined their respective business activities by transferring selected assets and liabilities of PMPMI and FTC to a new company called PMFTC Inc. (“PMFTC”). PMPMI and FTC hold equal economic interests in PMFTC, while we manage the day-to-day operations of PMFTC and have a majority of its Board of Directors. The establishment of PMFTC permits both parties to benefit from their complementary brand portfolios, as well as cost synergies from the resulting integration of manufacturing, distribution and procurement, and the further development and advancement of tobacco growing in the Philippines.

In June 2010, we announced that our affiliate, Philip Morris Brasil Industria e Comercio Ltda. (“PMB”), would begin directly sourcing tobacco leaf from approximately

17,000

tobacco farmers in Southern Brazil. This initiative has enhanced PMI’s direct involvement in the supply chain and provides approximately

10%

of PMI’s global leaf requirements. The vertically integrated structure was made possible following separate agreements with two leaf suppliers in Brazil, Alliance One Brasil Exportadora de Tabacos Ltda. (“AOB”) and Universal Leaf Tabacos Ltda. (“ULT”).

-


-


These agreements resulted in AOB and ULT assigning approximately

9,000

and

8,000

contracts with tobacco farmers to PMB, respectively. As a result, PMB offered employment to more than 200 employees, most of them agronomy specialists, and acquired related assets in Southern Brazil. The purchase price for the net assets and the contractual relationships was

$83 million

.

Source of Funds — Dividends

We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized. As a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock.

(b) Financial Information About Segments

We divide our markets into four geographic regions, which constitute our segments for financial reporting purposes:

•

The European Union (“EU”) Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland and covers all the EU countries except for Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania, and also comprises Switzerland, Norway and Iceland, which are linked to the EU through trade agreements;

•

The Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa (“EEMA”) Region is also headquartered in Lausanne and includes Eastern Europe, the Balkans (including Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania), Turkey, the Middle East and Africa and our international duty free business;

•

The Asia Region is headquartered in Hong Kong and covers all other Asian markets as well as Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands; and

•

The Latin America & Canada Region is headquartered in New York and covers the South American continent, Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean and Canada.

Net revenues and operating companies income

*

(together with a reconciliation to operating income) attributable to each such segment for each of the last three years are set forth in Note 12.

Segment Reporting

to our consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference to the


Annual Report. See Part II, Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

for a discussion of our operating results by business segment.

The relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows:

______________________________

*

Our management evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based on operating companies income, which we define as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

to our consolidated financial statements and are incorporated herein by reference to the


Annual Report.

We use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products, net of sales and promotion incentives. Our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell.

-


-


Mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium-price brands to mid-price or low-price brands in any given market (product mix). Mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets (geographic mix). We often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to local governments, and, in those circumstances, we include excise taxes in our net revenues and excise taxes on products. Our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs.

Our marketing, administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products. The most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

Our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees manufacture, market and sell tobacco products outside the United States.

Our total cigarette shipments increased

1.3%

in


to

927.0 billion

units. We estimate that international cigarette market shipments were approximately 5.7 trillion units in


, a 0.7% increase over


. We estimate that our reported share of the international cigarette market (which is defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the United States) was approximately 16.3% in


, 16.2% in


and 16.1% in


. Excluding the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), we estimate that our reported share of the international cigarette market was approximately 28.8%, 28.3%, and 27.6% in


,


and


, respectively.

Shipments of our principal cigarette brand,

Marlboro

, increased

0.5%

in


, and represented approximately 9.3% of the international cigarette market, excluding the PRC, in


, 9.2% in


and 9.1% in


.

We have a cigarette market share of at least 15%, and, in a number of instances substantially more than 15%, in 98 markets, including Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey and Ukraine.

References to total international cigarette market, total cigarette market, total market and market shares in this Form 10-K reflect our best estimates based on a number of internal and external sources.

Consumer Focused Marketing & Sales

In 2012, we launched a new strategic framework that combines our marketing and sales expertise with our in-depth knowledge of various sales territories. This framework allows us not only to engage more effectively with our adult consumers but also to enhance the success of our direct and indirect trade partners.  The main benefits are:

•

improved effectiveness of  direct adult consumer engagement activities;

•

more effective communication with our retailers about our brands;

•

increased speed, efficiency and widespread availability of our products; and

•

distribution and sales strategies tailored to the individual characteristics of each market (namely, the needs and capabilities of  retailers, the wholesale infrastructure, our competitive position, operating costs and the regulatory framework).

The four main types of distribution that we use globally, often simultaneously in a given market, are:

•

Direct Sales and Distribution, where we have set up our own distribution directly to retailers;

•

Distribution through single independent distributors who are responsible for distribution in a single market;

•

Exclusive Zonified Distribution, where distributors are assigned an exclusive territory within a market to enable them to obtain a suitable return on their investment; and

•

Distribution through national or regional wholesalers that then supply the retail trade.

In many markets we also directly supply key accounts, including gas stations, retail chains and supermarkets.

Our distribution and sales systems are supported by sales forces that total approximately 18,100 employees worldwide. Our sales forces are well trained and recognized by trade surveys for their professionalism.

-


-


Our products are marketed and promoted through various media and channels, including, where permitted by law, point of sale communications, brand events, access-restricted Web sites, print and direct communication to verified adult smokers. Our direct communication with verified adult smokers utilizes mail, E-mail and other electronic communication tools. Promotional activities include, where permitted by law, competitions, invitations to events, interactive programs, consumer premiums and price promotions. To support advertising and promotional activities in the markets, we have a dedicated consumer engagement group that develops innovative engagement tools for adult consumers based on the latest technologies and adult consumer trends.

Competition

We are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, innovation, packaging, service, marketing, advertising and retail price. Our competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, the PRC, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Industry consolidation and privatizations of state-owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures. Some competitors have different profit and volume objectives, and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates. We compete predominantly with American blend cigarette brands, such as

Marlboro

,

L&M

and

Chesterfield

, which are the most popular across many of our markets. We seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories, although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premium-price category.

Procurement and Raw Materials

We purchase tobacco leaf of various grades and styles throughout the world, the majority through independent tobacco suppliers. We also contract directly with farmers in several countries including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Italy, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, and the United States.

As discussed above, in June 2010, we announced that our affiliate, PMB, began directly sourcing tobacco leaf from tobacco farmers in Southern Brazil. This initiative expanded PMI’s direct involvement in the supply chain and provides approximately 10% of PMI’s global leaf requirements.

Our largest sources of supply are:

•

Brazil, particularly for Virginia tobaccos but also for Burley;

•

The United States for Virginia (flue-cured) and Burley tobaccos, particularly higher quality varieties for use in leading international brands;

•

Indonesia, mostly for domestic use in kretek products;

•

Turkey and Greece, mostly for Oriental; and

•

Argentina and Malawi, mostly for Burley.

We believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements.

In addition to tobacco leaf, we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately 430 suppliers. Our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represent approximately 55% of our total direct materials purchases. The three most significant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging, acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in cigarette manufacturing. In addition, the adequate supply and procurement of cloves are of particular importance to our Indonesian business.

Business Environment

Other Matters

Customers

None of our business segments is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.

Employees

As of

December 31, 2012

, we employed approximately 87,100 people worldwide, including employees under temporary contracts and hourly paid part-time staff. Our businesses are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees. Generally, these laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business. In addition, in accordance with European Union requirements, we have established a European Works Council composed of management and elected members of our workforce. We believe that our relations with our employees and their representative organizations are excellent.

Executive Officers of the Registrant

The disclosure regarding executive officers is set forth under the heading “Executive Officers as of February 22, 2013” in Item 10 of Part III of this Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

Research and Development

One of our strategic priorities is to develop, assess and commercialize a portfolio of innovative products with the potential to reduce the risk of smoking-related diseases in comparison to conventional cigarettes. We refer to these as next generation products, or NGPs. PMI draws upon a team of world-class scientists from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines, whose efforts are guided by the following key objectives:

•

to develop a series of products that provides adult smokers the taste, sensory experience and smoking ritual characteristics that are as close as possible to those currently provided by conventional cigarettes;

•

to substantiate a significant reduction of risk for the individual adult smoker as well as a reduction of harm for  the population as a whole, based on robust scientific evidence derived from well-established assessment processes; and

•

to advocate for the development of regulatory frameworks for the assessment, approval and commercialization of NGPs, including the communication of substantiated reductions in risk to consumers.

We believe the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative systems for aerosol generation is the most promising path to reduce risk and, accordingly, the NGPs we are developing are based on platforms that do not involve combustion.  These platforms are in various stages of development.  One platform is in the early stages of clinical trials and industrial scale-up, another is in its final development phase, and the third requires at least one year for further product development. We are also developing other potential platforms.

Our approach to individual risk assessment is to use cessation as the benchmark because the short-term and long-term effects of smoking cessation are well known and the closer the clinical data derived from adult smokers who switch to an NGP resemble the data from those who quit, the more confident one can be that the product reduces the risk.

We also conduct research to support and reinforce our conventional product business. We seek to be at the forefront of innovation. Significant investments have been made in new product development efforts for conventional products, resulting in a wide range of product enhancements and the launch of innovative new products. Further, with the increase in product regulations, support for the conventional cigarette business has expanded and is expected to become more complex, requiring additional capacity for analysis and testing in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Finally, working through biotechnology partners, we are conducting research and development on technology platforms that can potentially lead to the development of alternative uses of tobacco.

Additional Information

to our consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference to the


Annual Report.

Intellectual Property

Our trademarks are valuable assets and their protection and reputation are essential to us. We own the trademark rights to all of our principal brands, including

Marlboro

, or have the right to use them in all countries where we use them.

In addition, we have more than 3,400 granted patents worldwide and approximately as many pending patent applications. Our patent portfolio, as a whole, is material to our business. However, no one patent, or group of related patents, is material to us. We also have registered industrial designs and proprietary secrets, technology, know-how, processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.

Effective January 1, 2008, PMI entered into an Intellectual Property Agreement with Philip Morris USA Inc. (“PM USA”). The Intellectual Property Agreement governs the ownership of intellectual property between PMI and PM USA. Ownership of the jointly funded intellectual property has been allocated as follows:

•

PMI owns all rights to the jointly-funded intellectual property outside the United States, its territories and possessions; and

•

PM USA owns all rights to the jointly-funded intellectual property in the United States, its territories and possessions.

Ownership of intellectual property related to patent applications and resulting patents based solely on the jointly-funded intellectual property, regardless of when filed or issued, will be exclusive to PM USA in the United States, its territories and possessions and exclusive to PMI everywhere else in the world.

The Intellectual Property Agreement contains provisions concerning intellectual property that is independently developed by us or PM USA following the Distribution Date. For ten years following the Distribution Date, independently developed intellectual property may be subject to rights under certain circumstances that would allow either us or PM USA a priority position to obtain the rights to the new intellectual property from the other party, with the price and other terms to be negotiated.

In the event of a dispute between us and PM USA under the Intellectual Property Agreement, we have agreed with PM USA to submit the dispute first to negotiation between our and PM USA’s senior executives and then to binding arbitration.

Seasonality

Our business segments are not significantly affected by seasonality, although in certain markets cigarette consumption trends rise during the summer months due to longer daylight time and tourism.

Environmental Regulation

We are subject to applicable international, national and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. We have specific programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements and reduce wastage as well as water and energy consumption. We have developed and implemented a consistent environmental and occupational health and safety (“EHS”) management system, which involves policies, standard practices and procedures at all our manufacturing centers. We also conduct regular safety assessments at our offices, warehouses and car fleet organizations. Furthermore, we have engaged an external certification body to validate the effectiveness of our EHS management system at our manufacturing centers around the world, in accordance with internationally recognized standards. Our subsidiaries expect to continue to make investments in order to drive improved performance and maintain compliance with environmental laws and regulations. We assess and report the compliance status of all our legal entities on a regular basis. Based on the management and controls we have in place, environmental expenditures have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position, earnings or competitive position.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements

We may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in filings with the SEC, in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts. You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as "strategy," "expects," "continues," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "will," "estimates," "intends," "projects," "goals," "targets" and other words of similar meaning. You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.

We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. We elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document, particularly in the “Business Environment” section. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations.

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry

Cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. Significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. These tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors.

Tax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of manufactured cigarettes versus other tobacco products, or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our manufactured cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. Because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium-price manufactured cigarette category, tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets. As a result, our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets.

Increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premium-price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories, where we may be under-represented, from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products, or to illicit products such as contraband, counterfeit and illicit whites.

Our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco products.

Governmental actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets, and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase downtrading and the risk of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases. Significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (“FCTC”). The FCTC is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation. The FCTC has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to reduce the palatability and attractiveness of tobacco products to adult smokers. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include:

•

restrictions on or licensing of outlets permitted to sell cigarettes;

•

the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges;

•

restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship;

•

the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements;

•

restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors, and plain packaging;

•

restrictions on packaging and cigarette formats and dimensions;

•

restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines;

•

requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents;

•

disclosure, restrictions, or bans of tobacco product ingredients;

•

increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors;

•

elimination of duty free sales and duty free allowances for travelers; and

•

encouraging litigation against tobacco companies.

Our operating income could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands, in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products, as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements.

Litigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (“ETS”) could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity.

There is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions. Damages claimed in some tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in Brazil, Canada, Israel and Nigeria, range into the billions of

-


-


U.S. dollars. We anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed. The FCTC encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers. It is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. See Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

of this Form 10-K.

We face intense competition, and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, innovation, packaging, service, marketing, advertising and price. We are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products, higher tobacco product taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products. Competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, China, Egypt, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Industry consolidation and privatizations of state-owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures. Some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates.

Because we have operations in numerous countries, our results may be influenced by economic, regulatory and political developments or natural disasters in many countries.

Some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes. In others, nationalization, terrorism, conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment. Economic, political, regulatory or other developments or natural disasters could disrupt our supply chain, manufacturing capabilities or our distribution capabilities. In addition, such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations, which could reduce our volumes, revenues and net earnings. In certain markets, we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes.

In addition, despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct, given the breadth and scope of our international operations, we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and international partners.

We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns.

Our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences, which may be influenced by local economic conditions. To be successful, we must:

•

promote brand equity successfully;

•

anticipate and respond to new consumer trends;

•

develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios;

•

improve productivity; and

•

be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases.

In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may tend to purchase lower-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly. Such downtrading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation.

We lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases.

Large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market. We believe that

Marlboro

is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand, although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity. In addition, our revenues are reduced by contraband and legal cross-border purchases.

From time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters.

Investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes, allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets, allegations of underpayment of customs duties and/or excise taxes, allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors such as “lights” and “ultra lights” and allegations of unlawful advertising. We cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced, and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations.

“Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Operating Results by Business Segment-Business Environment-Governmental Investigations” for a description of governmental investigations to which we are subject.

We may be unsuccessful in our attempts to produce products with the potential to reduce the risk of smoking-related diseases compared to conventional cigarettes.

We continue to seek ways to develop commercially viable new product technologies that may reduce the risk of smoking-related diseases. Our goal is to develop products whose potential for risk reduction can be substantiated and provide adult smokers the taste, sensory experience and smoking ritual characteristics that are as close as possible to those currently provided by conventional cigarettes. We may not succeed in these efforts. If we do not succeed, but others do, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of tobacco products with claims of reduced risk and harm, which could significantly undermine the commercial viability of these products.

Our reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates, and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness.

We conduct our business primarily in local currency and, for purposes of financial reporting, the local currency results are translated into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. During periods of local economic crises, foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the U.S. dollar, reducing our margins. Actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position.

The repatriation of our foreign earnings, changes in the earnings mix, and changes in U.S. tax laws may increase our effective tax rate. Our ability to receive payments from foreign subsidiaries or to repatriate royalties and dividends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls.

Because we are a U.S. holding company, our most significant source of funds is distributions from our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Under current U.S. tax law, in general we do not pay U.S. taxes on our foreign earnings until they are repatriated to the U.S. as distributions from our non-U.S. subsidiaries. These distributions may result in a residual U.S. tax cost. It may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions, which could result in a material increase in our overall effective tax rate. Additionally, the Obama Administration has indicated that it favors changes in U.S. tax law that would fundamentally change how our earnings are taxed in the U.S. If enacted and depending upon its precise terms, such legislation could increase our overall effective tax rate. Certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries' ability to make payments outside the country.

Our ability to grow may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or to improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.

Our profitability may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise prices or maintain an acceptable proportion of our sales of higher margin products and sales in higher margin geographies.

We may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships.

One element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. Acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms, or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings.

Government mandated prices, production control programs, shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impacts of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products.

As with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand, and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. Tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. Changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco. Any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices, quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business.

Our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking.

The tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance. As a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent.

The failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties with the intent to corrupt them could result in business disruption, loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data.

We use information systems to help manage business processes, collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and others. Some of these information systems are managed by third-party service providers. We have backup systems and business continuity plans in place, and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access. Nevertheless, failure of our systems to function as intended, or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes, could result in loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data, cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs to us.

We may be required to replace third party contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources.

In certain instances, we contract with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services.  We may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons, including government regulations; accordingly, our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources.

Properties.

As of

December 31, 2012

, we operated and owned


manufacturing facilities and maintained contract manufacturing relationships with 22 third-party manufacturers across 22 markets. In addition, we work with 38 third-party operators in Indonesia who manufacture our hand-rolled cigarettes.

PMI Owned Manufacturing Facilities

In


, 26 of our facilities each manufactured over 10 billion cigarettes, of which seven facilities each produced over 30 billion units. Our largest factories are in Bergen-op-Zoom (the Netherlands), Marikina and Batangas (Philippines). St. Petersburg and Krasnodar (Russia), Berlin (Germany), Izmir (Turkey), Krakow (Poland), Kharkiv (Ukraine), Merlo (Argentina), Kutna Hora (Czech Republic), Neuchatel (Switzerland), Sukorejo and Karawang (Indonesia) and Klaipeda (Lithuania). Our smallest factories are mostly in Latin America and Asia, where due to tariff and other constraints we have established small manufacturing units in individual markets, several of which are make-pack operations. We will continue to optimize our manufacturing base, taking into consideration the evolution of trade blocks.

The plants and properties owned or leased and operated by our subsidiaries are maintained in good condition and are believed to be suitable and adequate for our present needs.

In 2012, we announced that we are working on all aspects that will lead to the commercialization of NGPs in the 2016 to 2017 period. We are planning to build one or two new manufacturing facilities in Europe to produce NGPs and expect ground-breaking for our first factory to take place in 2013. We anticipate capital expenditures of 500-600 million Euros over a three-year period to achieve an initial capacity of approximately 30 billion NGP units per year.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

Tobacco-Related Litigation

Legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us, and/or our subsidiaries, and/or our indemnitees in various jurisdictions. Our indemnitees include distributors, licensees, and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend, as well as to pay costs and some or all of judgments, if any, that may be entered against them. Pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement between Altria and PMI, PMI will indemnify Altria and PM USA for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI.

It is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation.

Damages claimed in some of the tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in Brazil, Canada, Israel and Nigeria, range into the billions of U.S. dollars. The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. Much of the tobacco-related litigation is in its early stages, and litigation is subject to uncertainty. However, as discussed below, we have to date been largely successful in defending tobacco-related litigation.

We and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, after assessing the information available to it (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.

It is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Nevertheless, although litigation is subject to uncertainty, we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts, if any. All such cases are, and will continue to be, vigorously defended. However, we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so.

To date, we have paid total judgments, including costs, of approximately

six thousand

Euros in tobacco-related cases. These payments were made in order to appeal three Italian small claims cases, all of which were subsequently reversed on appeal. To date,

no

tobacco-related case has been finally resolved in favor of a plaintiff against us, our subsidiaries or indemnitees.

Pending claims related to tobacco products generally fall within the following categories:

Smoking and Health Litigation:

These cases primarily allege personal injury and are brought by individual plaintiffs or on behalf of a class or purported class of individual plaintiffs. Plaintiffs' allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery, including negligence, gross negligence, strict liability, fraud, misrepresentation, design defect, failure to warn, breach of express and implied warranties, violations of deceptive trade practice laws and consumer protection statutes. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief, including compensatory and other damages, and injunctive and equitable relief. Defenses raised in these cases include licit activity, failure to state a claim, lack of defect, lack of proximate cause, assumption of the risk, contributory negligence, and statute of limitations.

As of

February 15, 2013

, there were a number of smoking and health cases pending against us, our subsidiaries or indemnitees, as follows:

•

In the first class action pending in Brazil,

The Smoker Health Defense Association (ADESF) v. Souza Cruz, S.A. and Philip Morris Marketing, S.A., Nineteenth Lower Civil Court of the Central Courts of the Judiciary District of São Paulo, Brazil

, filed July 25, 1995, our subsidiary and another member of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, a consumer organization, is seeking damages for smokers and former smokers and injunctive relief. The verdict and post-trial developments in this case are described in the above table.

In the second class action pending in Brazil

, Public Prosecutor of São Paulo v. Philip Morris Brasil Industria e Comercio Ltda., Civil Court of the City of São Paulo, Brazil,

filed August 6, 2007, our subsidiary is a defendant. The plaintiff, the Public Prosecutor of the State of São Paulo, is seeking (i) unspecified damages on behalf of all smokers nationwide, former smokers, and their relatives; (ii) unspecified damages on behalf of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (“ETS”) nationwide, and their relatives; and (iii) reimbursement of the health care costs allegedly incurred for the treatment of tobacco-related diseases by all Brazilian States and Municipalities, and the Federal District. In an interim ruling issued in December 2007, the trial court limited the scope of this claim to the State of São Paulo only. In December 2008, the Seventh Civil Court of São Paulo issued a decision declaring that it lacked jurisdiction because the case involved issues similar to the

ADESF

case discussed above and should be transferred to the Nineteenth Lower Civil Court in São Paulo where the

ADESF

case is pending. The court further stated that these cases should be consolidated for the purposes of judgment. In April 2010, the São Paulo Court of Appeals reversed the Seventh Civil Court's decision that consolidated the cases, finding that they are based on different legal claims and are progressing at different stages of proceedings. This case was returned to the Seventh Civil Court of São Paulo, and our subsidiary filed its closing arguments in December 2010. In March 2012, the trial court dismissed the case on the merits. This decision has been appealed.

In the first class action pending in Canada,

Cecilia Letourneau v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd., Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. and JTI Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada,

filed in September 1998, our subsidiary and other Canadian manufacturers are defendants. The plaintiff, an individual smoker, is seeking compensatory and unspecified punitive damages for each member of the class who is deemed addicted to smoking. The class was certified in 2005. In February 2011, the trial court ruled that the federal government would remain as a third party in the case. In November 2012, the Court of Appeals dismissed defendants' third-party claims against the federal government. Trial began on March 12, 2012.  At the present pace, trial is expected to last well into 2013 and possibly 2014, with a judgment to follow at an indeterminate point after the conclusion of the trial proceedings.

In the second class action pending in Canada,

The plaintiffs, an anti-smoking organization and an individual smoker, are seeking compensatory and unspecified punitive damages for each member of the class who allegedly suffers from certain smoking-related diseases. The class was certified in 2005. In February 2011, the trial court ruled that the federal government will remain as a third party in the case. In November 2012, the Court of Appeals dismissed defendants' third-party claims against the federal government. Trial began on March 12, 2012.  At the present pace, trial is expected to last well into 2013 and possibly 2014, with a judgment to follow at an indeterminate point after the conclusion of the trial proceedings.

Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation:

These cases, brought by governmental and non-governmental plaintiffs, seek reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products. Plaintiffs' allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery including unjust enrichment, negligence, negligent design, strict liability, breach of express and implied warranties, violation of a voluntary undertaking or special duty, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conspiracy, public nuisance, defective product, failure to warn, sale of cigarettes to minors, and claims under statutes governing competition and deceptive trade practices. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief including compensatory and other damages, and injunctive and equitable relief. Defenses raised in these cases include lack of proximate cause, remoteness of injury, failure to state a claim, adequate remedy at law, “unclean hands” (namely, that plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief because they participated in, and benefited from, the sale of cigarettes), and statute of limitations.

Currently, the case is stayed in the trial court pending the appeals of certain co-defendants relating to service objections.

In the third health care cost recovery case in Nigeria,

The Attorney General of Gombe State v. British American Tobacco (Nigeria) Limited, et al., High Court of Gombe State, Gombe, Nigeria,

filed October 17, 2008, we and other members of the industry are defendants

.

Plaintiff seeks reimbursement for the cost of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the past 20 years, payment of anticipated costs of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the next 20 years, various forms of injunctive relief, plus punitive damages. In February 2011, the court ruled that the plaintiff had not complied with the procedural steps necessary to serve us. As a result of this ruling, Philip Morris International Inc. is not currently a defendant in the case. Plaintiff may appeal the ruling or follow the procedural steps required to serve Philip Morris International Inc.

In the fourth health care cost recovery case in Nigeria,

The Attorney General of Oyo State, et al., v. British American Tobacco (Nigeria) Limited, et al., High Court of Oyo State, Ibadan, Nigeria,

filed May 25, 2007, our subsidiary and other members of the industry are defendants

.

Plaintiffs seek reimbursement for the cost of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the past 20 years, payment of anticipated costs of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the next 20 years, various forms of injunctive relief, plus punitive damages. Our subsidiary challenged service as improper. In June 2010, the court ruled that plaintiffs did not have leave to serve the writ of summons on the defendants and that they must re-serve the writ. Our subsidiary has not yet been re-served.

In the fifth health care cost recovery case in Nigeria,

The Attorney General of Ogun State v. British American Tobacco (Nigeria) Limited, et al., High Court of Ogun State, Abeokuta, Nigeria

, filed February 26, 2008, our subsidiary and other members of the industry are defendants.

In a series of proceedings in Spain,

Junta de Andalucia, et al. v. Philip Morris Spain, et al., Court of First Instance, Madrid, Spain,

the first of which was filed February 21, 2002, our subsidiary and other members of the industry were defendants. The plaintiffs sought reimbursement for the cost of treating certain of their citizens for various alleged smoking-related illnesses. In May 2004, the first instance court dismissed the initial case, finding that the State was a necessary party to the claim, and thus, the claim must be filed in the Administrative Court. In September 2007, the plaintiffs filed their complaint in the Administrative Court, which dismissed the claim based on a procedural issue in November 2007. In November 2009, the Supreme Court rejected plaintiffs' appeal, resulting in the final dismissal of the claim. However, plaintiffs have filed a second claim in the Administrative Court against the Ministry of Economy. This second claim seeks the same relief as the original claim, but relies on a different procedural posture. The Administrative Court has recognized our subsidiary as a party in this proceeding. Our subsidiary and other defendants filed preliminary objections that resulted in a stay of the term to file the answer. In May 2011, the court rejected the defendants' preliminary objections, but it has not yet set a deadline for defendants to file their answers.

Lights Cases:

These cases, brought by individual plaintiffs, or on behalf of a class of individual plaintiffs, allege that the use of the term “lights” constitutes fraudulent and misleading conduct. Plaintiffs' allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery including misrepresentation, deception, and breach of consumer protection laws. Plaintiffs seek various forms of relief including restitution, injunctive relief, and compensatory and other damages. Defenses raised include lack of causation, lack of reliance, assumption of the risk, and statute of limitations.

As of

February 15, 2013

, there were a number of lights cases pending against our subsidiaries or indemnitees, as follows:

•


cases brought on behalf of overlapping classes of individual plaintiffs in Israel, compared with

El-Roy, et al. v. Philip Morris Incorporated, et al., District Court of Tel-Aviv/Jaffa, Israel,

filed January 18, 2004, our subsidiary and our indemnitees (PM USA and our former importer) are defendants. The plaintiffs filed a purported class action claiming that the class members were misled by the descriptor “lights” into believing that lights cigarettes are safer than full flavor cigarettes. The claim seeks recovery of the purchase price of lights cigarettes and compensation for distress for each class member. Hearings took place in November and December 2008 regarding whether the case meets the legal requirements necessary to allow it to proceed as a class action. The parties' briefing on class certification was completed in March 2011. In November 2012, the court denied class certification and dismissed the individual claims. Plaintiffs have appealed and an oral hearing has been scheduled for March 2014.

The claims in the second class action pending in Israel,

Navon, et al. v. Philip Morris Products USA, et al., District Court of Tel-Aviv/Jaffa, Israel

.

Public Civil Actions:

Claims have been filed either by an individual, or a public or private entity, seeking to protect collective or individual rights, such as the right to health, the right to information or the right to safety. Plaintiffs' allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery including product defect, concealment, and misrepresentation. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief including injunctive relief such as banning cigarettes, descriptors, smoking in certain places and advertising, as well as implementing communication campaigns and reimbursement of medical expenses incurred by public or private institutions.

public civil actions pending against our subsidiaries in Argentina (

Asociación Argentina de Derecho de Danos v. Massalin Particulares S.A., et al., Civil Court of Buenos Aires, Argentina,

filed February 26, 2007, our subsidiary and another member of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, a consumer association, seeks the establishment of a relief fund for reimbursement of medical costs associated with diseases allegedly caused by smoking. Our subsidiary filed its answer in September 2007. In March 2010, the case file was transferred to the Federal Court on Administrative Matters after the Civil Court granted the plaintiff's request to add the national government as a co-plaintiff in the case.

In the second public civil action in Argentina,

Conciencia Ciudadana Mejorar Asociación Civil, et al.v. Massalin Particulares S.A., 4th Civil & Commercial Court of Zarate, Argentina

, filed September 20, 2012, our subsidiary is a defendant.  Plaintiffs, a civil association and an individual, seek an order requiring our subsidiary to place information regarding tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide yields on the packages of cigarettes in the

-


-


access to smoking cessation treatment. Plaintiff requests that each defendant's liability be determined according to its market share. In May 2009, the trial court dismissed the case on the merits. Plaintiff has appealed.

In the public civil action in Venezuela,

Federation of Consumers and Users Associations (“FEVACU”), et al. v. National Assembly of Venezuela and the Venezuelan Ministry of Health, Constitutional Chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court

, filed April 29, 2008, we were not named as a defendant, but the plaintiffs published a notice pursuant to court order, notifying all interested parties to appear in the case. In January 2009, our subsidiary appeared in the case in response to this notice. The plaintiffs purport to represent the right to health of the citizens of Venezuela and claim that the government failed to protect adequately its citizens' right to health. The claim asks the court to order the government to enact stricter regulations on the manufacture and sale of tobacco products. In addition, the plaintiffs ask the court to order companies involved in the tobacco industry to allocate a percentage of their “sales or benefits” to establish a fund to pay for the health care costs of treating smoking-related diseases. In October 2008, the court ruled that plaintiffs have standing to file the claim and that the claim meets the threshold admissibility requirements. In December 2012, the court admitted our subsidiary and BAT's subsidiary as interested third parties.

Other Litigation

We are also involved in other litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business.  While the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain, management does not expect that the ultimate outcomes of other litigation, including any reasonably possible losses in excess of current accruals, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
