PART I

Item 1.

Business.

(a) General Development of Business

General

Philip Morris International Inc. is a Virginia holding company incorporated in 1987. Our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are engaged in the
manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products in markets outside of the United States of America. Our products are sold in approximately 160 countries and, in many of these countries, they hold the number one or number two market
share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands.

Our portfolio of international and local brands is led by

Marlboro

, the world’s best selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately
36% of our total 2008 shipment volume.

Marlboro

is complemented in the premium price category by

Merit, Parliament

and

Virginia Slims

. Our leading mid-price brands are

L&M

and

Chesterfield

. Our leading brands
in the profitable low-price segment include

Bond Street

,

Lark

,

Muratti, Next, Philip Morris

and

Red & White

.

We also own a number of important local brands, such as

A Mild

,

Dji Sam Soe

and

A Hijau

in Indonesia,

Diana

in Italy,

Optima

and

Apollo-Soyuz

in Russia,

Morven Gold

in Pakistan,

Boston

in Colombia,

Belmont, Canadian Classics

and

Number 7

in Canada,

Best

and

Classic

in Serbia,

f6

in Germany,

Delicados

in Mexico,

Assos

in Greece and

Petra

in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. While there are a number of markets where local brands remain important, international brands are expanding their share in numerous markets. With international brands
contributing approximately 75% of our shipment volume in 2008, we are well positioned to continue to benefit from this trend.

Separation from Altria Group, Inc.

Prior to March 28, 2008, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”). On January 30, 2008, the Altria Board of Directors
announced Altria’s plans to spin off all of its interest in PMI to Altria’s stockholders in a tax-free transaction pursuant to Section 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The distribution of all of our shares owned by Altria (the
“Spin-off”), was made on March 28, 2008 (the “Distribution Date”), to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 19, 2008 (the “Record Date”). Altria distributed one share of our common stock
for each share of Altria common stock outstanding on the Record Date.

Holders of Altria stock options were treated similarly to public stockholders and, accordingly, had their stock awards split into two instruments. Holders of Altria stock options received the following stock options, which, immediately
after the Spin-off, had an aggregate intrinsic value equal to the intrinsic value of the pre-spin Altria options:

•

a new PMI option (issued by us) to acquire that number of shares of our common stock equal to the number of Altria options held by such person on the Distribution Date; and

•

an adjusted Altria option for the same number of shares of Altria common stock with a reduced exercise price.

As stipulated by the Employee Matters Agreement between PMI and Altria (described
below), the exercise price of each option was set to reflect the relative market values of PMI and Altria shares by allocating the price of Altria common stock before the distribution ($73.83) to PMI shares ($51.44) and Altria shares ($22.39), and
then multiplying each of these allocated values by the Option Conversion

-1-


Ratio. The Option Conversion Ratio is equal to the exercise price of the Altria option, prior to any adjustment for the distribution, divided by $73.83. As a result,
the new PMI option and the adjusted Altria option have an aggregate intrinsic value equal to the intrinsic value of the pre-split Altria option.

Holders of Altria restricted stock or deferred stock awarded prior to January 30, 2008, retained their existing awards and received the same number of shares
of our restricted or deferred stock. The restricted stock and deferred stock will not vest until the completion of the original restriction period (typically, three years from the date of the original grant). Recipients of Altria deferred stock
awarded on January 30, 2008, who were employed by Altria after the Distribution Date, received additional shares of deferred stock of Altria to preserve the intrinsic value of the award. Recipients of Altria deferred stock awarded on
January 30, 2008, who were employed by us after the Distribution Date, received substitute shares of our deferred stock to preserve the intrinsic value of the award.

To the extent that employees of Altria and its remaining subsidiaries received our stock options, Altria reimbursed us in cash for the Black-Scholes
fair value of the stock options received. To the extent that our employees held Altria stock options, we reimbursed Altria in cash for the Black-Scholes fair value of the stock options. To the extent that employees of Altria and its remaining
subsidiaries received PMI deferred stock, Altria paid us the fair value of the PMI deferred stock less the value of projected forfeitures. To the extent that our employees held Altria restricted stock or deferred stock, we reimbursed Altria in cash
for the fair value of the restricted or deferred stock less the value of projected forfeitures and any amounts previously charged to us for the restricted or deferred stock. Based upon the number of Altria stock awards outstanding at the
Distribution Date, the net amount of these reimbursements resulted in a payment of $449 million from Altria to us. This reimbursement from Altria is reflected as an increase to our additional paid-in capital on the December 31, 2008
consolidated balance sheet.

On March 28, 2008, we entered into a
Transition Services Agreement with Altria Corporate Services, Inc. (“ALCS”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Altria, pursuant to which ALCS provided select services to us for certain transition periods not to exceed twenty-four months to
ensure continuity of activity following the Spin-off. The transition services included, among others, consulting services related to risk management, benefit administration and information technology as well as the transfer of transaction processing
(accounts payable and expense reports) for certain Latin American markets.

On March 28, 2008, we entered into an Employee Matters Agreement with Altria. The Employee Matters Agreement governs PMI’s and Altria’s respective obligations with respect to employees, compensation and benefit plans,
treatment of holders of Altria stock options, restricted stock and deferred stock with respect to PMI, and cooperation between the companies in the sharing of employee information and maintenance of confidentiality.

On March 28, 2008, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement with Altria. The Tax
Sharing Agreement generally governs PMI’s and Altria’s respective rights, responsibilities and obligations for pre-distribution periods and for potential taxes on the Spin-off. With respect to any potential taxes resulting from the
Spin-off, responsibility for the tax will be allocated to the party that acted (or failed to act) in a manner which resulted in the tax.

Effective as of January 1, 2008, we entered into an Intellectual Property Agreement with Philip Morris USA Inc. (“PM USA”), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Altria. The Intellectual Property Agreement governs the ownership of intellectual property between PMI and PM USA. Information about the Intellectual Property Agreement is set forth under Other Matters –

Intellectual Property

.

The shares issued as of the Distribution Date equal the number of shares
of Altria common stock outstanding on the Record Date. As a result, on the Distribution Date, we had 2,108,901,789 shares of

-2-


common stock outstanding. The same number of shares is being used to calculate both diluted earnings per share and basic earnings per share for all periods prior to
the Distribution Date as no PMI equity awards were outstanding prior to the Distribution Date.

Other:

Manufacturing Optimization Program:

In 2008, we terminated our contract manufacturing arrangement with PM USA. We completed
the process of shifting all of our PM USA contract manufactured production, which approximated 57 billion cigarettes annually in 2007, to our facilities in Europe during the fourth quarter of 2008. During the first quarter of 2008, we recorded exit
costs of $15 million related to the termination of our manufacturing contract with PM USA. The program generated pre-tax savings of $71 million in 2008 and is expected to provide total pre-tax annual savings of approximately $179 million by 2009.

Asset Impairment and Exit Costs:

Since 2005, we announced plans to streamline various administrative functions and
operations. These plans resulted in the announced closure or partial closure of nine production facilities through December 31, 2008, the largest of which is the closure of a factory in Munich, Germany announced in 2006. As a result of these
announcements and the Manufacturing Optimization Program discussed above, we recorded pre-tax charges of $84 million, $195 million and $126 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The pre-tax charges
primarily related to severance costs. The 2006 pre-tax charges included $57 million of costs related to the Munich, Germany factory closure. In 2007, asset impairment and exit costs also included general corporate pre-tax charges of $13 million
related to fees associated with the Spin-off. Cash payments related to our exit costs were $99 million, $131 million and $44 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Future cash payments for exit costs
incurred to date are expected to be approximately $115 million. As of December 31, 2008, the streamlining of these various functions and operations has resulted in the elimination of approximately 3,600 positions. These actions generated
pre-tax cost savings beginning in 2005, with cumulative estimated annual cost savings of approximately $295 million through the end of 2008, of which $110 million were incremental savings in 2008.

Source of Funds — Dividends

We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries.
Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior claims of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that
claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized. As a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on the debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our
subsidiaries. Our principal wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock.

(b) Financial Information About Segments

We divide our markets into four geographic regions, which constitute our segments for
financial reporting purposes:

•

The European Union (“EU”) Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland and covers all the EU countries except for Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania, and also
comprises Switzerland, Norway and Iceland, which are linked to the EU through trade agreements.

-3-


•

The Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EEMA”) Region is also headquartered in Lausanne and covers the Balkans (including Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania), the
former Soviet Union (excluding Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), Mongolia, Turkey, the Middle East and Africa and our international duty free business.

•

The Asia Region is headquartered in Hong Kong and covers all other Asian countries as well as Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands.

•

The Latin America & Canada Region is headquartered in New York and covers the South American continent, Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean and Canada.

Net revenues and operating companies income* (together
with a reconciliation to operating income) attributable to each such segment for each of the last three years are set forth in Note 11.

Segment Reporting

to our consolidated financial statements (“Note 11”), which is
incorporated herein by reference to the 2008 Annual Report. See Part II, Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

for a discussion of our operating results by business segment.

The relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to
each reportable segment were as follows:

*

Our management reviews operating companies income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Operating companies income for the segments excludes general corporate expenses and
amortization of intangibles. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

to our consolidated financial statements and are incorporated herein by reference
to the 2008 Annual Report.

We use the term net revenues to
refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products, net of sales and promotion incentives. Our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes
in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell. Mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium price brands to mid-price or low-price brands in any given market (product mix). Mix can also refer to the proportion of
volume in more profitable markets versus volume in less profitable markets (geographic mix). We are often required to collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to local governments, and, in those circumstances, we include excise
taxes as a component of net revenues and as part of our cost of sales. Aside from excise taxes, our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs.

Our marketing, administration and research costs include the costs of marketing our
products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products, and costs incurred to develop new products. The most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are selling and marketing expenses, which
relate to the cost of our sales force as well as to the advertising and promotion of our products.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

Our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees manufacture, market and sell tobacco products outside the United States.

Our total cigarette shipments increased 2.5% in 2008 to
869.8 billion units. We estimate that international cigarette market shipments were approximately 5.6 trillion units in 2008, a 2.7% increase over 2007. We estimate that our share of the international cigarette market (which is defined as
worldwide cigarette volume excluding the United States) was approximately 15.6%, 15.6% and 15.4% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Excluding the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), we estimate that our share of the international
cigarette market was approximately 25.8%, 25.2% and 24.6% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Shipments of our principal brand,

Marlboro

, increased 0.2% in 2008, and represented approximately 9.2% of the international cigarette market,
excluding PRC, in 2008, 2007 and 2006.

We have a cigarette market share
of at least 15%, and, in a number of instances substantially more than 15%, in approximately 90 markets, including Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy,
Japan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine.

Acquisitions

Rothmans Inc.:

On July 31, 2008, we announced that we had entered into an agreement with Rothmans Inc. (“Rothmans”), which is located in Canada, to purchase, by way
of a tender offer, all of the outstanding common shares of Rothmans for CAD $30 per share in cash, or approximately CAD $2.0 billion ($1.9 billion based on the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the acquisition). Prior to this agreement,
Rothmans’ sole holding was a 60% interest in Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (“RBH”). The remaining 40% interest in RBH was owned by us. In October 2008, we completed the acquisition of all the Rothmans shares. From January
2008 to September 2008, we recorded equity earnings on our equity interest in RBH. After the completion of the acquisition, Rothmans became a consolidated subsidiary of PMI and, as a result, we recorded all of Rothmans’ earnings during the
fourth quarter of 2008. Rothmans contributed $50 million of incremental operating income and $22 million of incremental net earnings during the fourth quarter of 2008.

Mexico:

In November 2007, we acquired an additional 30% interest in our Mexican tobacco business from Grupo Carso, S.A.B. de C.V. (“Grupo Carso”), which increased
our ownership interest to 80%, for $1.1 billion. After this transaction was completed, Grupo Carso retained a 20% interest in the business. A director of PMI has an affiliation with Grupo Carso. We also entered into an agreement with Grupo Carso
which provides the basis for us to potentially acquire, or for Grupo Carso to potentially sell to us, Grupo Carso’s remaining 20% in the future.

Holdings in the Dominican Republic:

In November 2006, we exchanged our 47.5% interest in E. León Jimenes, C. por. A. (“ELJ”) , which included a 40% indirect interest in ELJ’s
beer subsidiary, for 100% ownership of ELJ’s cigarette subsidiary, Industria de Tabaco León Jimenes, S.A. (“ITLJ”), and $427 million of cash. As a result of this transaction, we now own 100% of the cigarette business and no
longer hold an interest in ELJ’s beer business. The exchange of our interest in ELJ’s beer subsidiary resulted in a pre-tax gain on sale of $488 million.

-5-


Other:

In June 2008, we purchased the fine cut trademark

Interval

and certain other trademarks in the other tobacco products category
(“OTP”) from Imperial Tobacco Group PLC for $407 million.

During the first quarter of 2007, we acquired an additional 58.2% interest in a Pakistan cigarette manufacturer, Lakson Tobacco Company Limited (“Lakson Tobacco”), which increased our total ownership interest in Lakson Tobacco
from 40% to approximately 98%, for $388 million.

In the fourth quarter
of 2006, we purchased from British American Tobacco the

Muratti

and

Ambassador

trademarks in certain markets, as well as the rights to

L&M

and

Chesterfield

in Hong Kong, in exchange for the rights to

Benson & Hedges

in certain African markets and a payment of $115 million.

The effect of these other acquisitions above, in the aggregate, was not material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or operating cash flows in any of the periods presented.

In February 2009, we entered into an agreement with Swedish Match AB
(“SWMA”), to establish an exclusive joint venture to commercialize Swedish style snus and other smoke-free tobacco products worldwide, outside of Scandinavia and the United States. We and SWMA will license exclusively to the joint venture
an agreed list of trademarks and intellectual property. The effect of this agreement is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or operating cash flows.

In February 2009, we purchased the fine cut trademark

Petterøes

worldwide
and other cigarette trademarks sold primarily in Norway and Sweden. The transaction is projected to be modestly accretive to net earnings in 2009. The effect of this acquisition is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial position,
results of operations or operating cash flows.

Distribution and Sales

The distribution and sales strategy for our products is tailored to the
characteristics of each market, including retailer needs and capabilities, the wholesale infrastructure, our competitive position, costs and the regulatory framework. Our goals are speed, efficiency and widespread availability of our products, while
at the same time contributing to the success of our direct and indirect trade partners. The four main types of distribution that we use across the globe are:

•

Direct Sales and Distribution (“DSD”), where we have set up our own distribution directly to retailers.

•

Single independent distributors who are responsible for distribution within a single market.

•

Exclusive Zonified Distribution (“EZD”), where distributors have an exclusive territory within a country to enable them to obtain a suitable return on their
investment.

•

Distribution through wholesalers, where we supply either national or regional wholesalers who then service the retail trade.

In many countries we also service key accounts, including gas stations, retail chains
and supermarkets, directly.

Our distribution and sales systems are
supported by sales forces that in the aggregate total approximately 16,800 worldwide. Our sales forces are well trained, recognized by trade surveys for their professionalism, and have developed a long lasting relationship with the wholesale and
retail

-6-


trade, thus providing us with a superior presence at the point of sale, as evidenced by our leading market share position. In addition, our consumer engagement teams
work together with the sales forces to engage adult smokers in promotional activities and to support new product launches.

Our products are advertised and promoted through various media and channels, including, where permitted by law, point of sale communications, brand events,
access-controlled websites, print and direct communication to verified adult smokers. Our direct communication with verified adult smokers utilize mail, email and text messaging. Promotional activities include, where permitted by law, competitions,
invitation to events, interactive programs, consumer incentive items and price promotions. To support advertising and promotional activities in the markets, we have a dedicated consumer engagement group that develops innovative engagement tools
based on the latest technologies and consumer trends.

Competition

We are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. We
compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, innovation, packaging, service, marketing, advertising and price. Our competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional
and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, government-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in China, Egypt, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam and Algeria. Industry consolidation and privatizations of governmental enterprises have led to an
overall increase in competitive pressures. Some competitors have different profit and volume objectives, and some international competitors are less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates. We compete predominantly with American type
blended cigarettes, such as

Marlboro

and

Chesterfield

, which are the most popular across many of our markets. We seek to compete in all profitable price segments.

Procurement and Raw Materials

Our strategy is to procure tobacco and non-tobacco materials through third parties. We believe that this provides us with greater flexibility and is the most cost
effective approach.

We purchase tobacco leaf of various grades and
styles throughout the world, primarily through independent tobacco dealers. We also contract directly with farmers in several countries including the United States, Argentina, Mexico, Indonesia, Ecuador, Dominican Republic, Poland, Colombia and
Portugal.

Our largest sources of supply are:

•

The United States for Virginia (flue-cured) and Burley tobaccos, particularly higher quality varieties for use in leading international brands.

•

Brazil, particularly for Virginia tobaccos but also for Burley.

•

Indonesia, mostly for domestic use in kretek products.

•

Turkey and Greece, mostly for Oriental.

•

Argentina and Malawi, mostly for Burley.

We believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements.

In addition to tobacco leaf, we purchase a wide variety of other non-tobacco materials
from a total of approximately 370 suppliers. Our top 10 suppliers of non-tobacco materials combined represent more than 52% of our total non-tobacco material purchases. The three most significant non-tobacco

-7-


materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging, acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in cigarette manufacturing. In addition,
the supply of cloves is of particular importance to our Indonesian business.

Business
Environment

Information called for by this Item is hereby
incorporated by reference to the paragraphs captioned “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Operating Results by Business Segment—Business Environment” on pages 28
to 35 of the 2008 Annual Report and made a part hereof.

Other Matters

Customers

None of our business segments are dependent upon a single customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated results of operations.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, we employed approximately 75,600 people worldwide,
including employees under temporary contracts and hourly paid part time staff. Our businesses are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees. Generally, these laws and regulations are specific to the
location of each business. In addition, in accordance with European Union requirements, we have established a European Works Council composed of management and elected members of our workforce. We believe that our relations with our employees and
their representative organizations are excellent.

Executive Officers of the
Registrant

The disclosure regarding executive officers is set forth
under the heading “Executive Officers as of February 15, 2009” in Item 10 of Part III of this Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

Research and Development

Our research efforts are directed toward understanding the biochemical and physiological mechanisms of tobacco-related diseases at the functional molecular level.
We also seek to understand the structure, threshold and interaction of smoke constituents. This research serves as the cornerstone for our applied research efforts to improve our existing products and to develop products that have the potential to
reduce the risk of tobacco-related diseases. Our efforts currently focus on the removal of certain harmful smoke constituents using agronomic practices, smoke generation at lower temperatures, heat generation and transfer, biotechnology and material
science. Our principal goals are to:

•

Build the ability to predict disease risk. The ability to develop and assess potentially reduced risk tobacco products requires state of the art analytical capabilities in
order to understand disease mechanisms and specifically the complex role of tobacco smoke constituents in the development of tobacco related diseases. The research that we are currently undertaking is intended to enable us to develop a model to
predict with a known degree of certainty the risk profiles of potentially reduced risk products. We believe that a critical element to successfully commercialize reduced risk products will be our ability to make scientifically sound and
substantiated statements about the potential quantified reduction in health risk delivered by them.

-8-


•

Develop innovative reduced risk products. We are relentlessly working on a range of initiatives that may result in commercially viable product proposals.

•

Support and reinforce our conventional product business. We seek to be at the forefront of cigarette and packaging innovation. Significant investments have been made in new
product development efforts for conventional products, resulting in a wide range of product enhancements and the launch of innovative new products. Further, with the increase in product regulations, supporting the conventional cigarette business has
expanded and is expected to become more complex, requiring additional capacity for analysis and testing in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

•

Research and develop technology platforms that can potentially lead to the development of alternative uses of tobacco.

The research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007
and 2006 are set forth in Note 13.

Additional Information

to our financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2008 Annual Report.

Intellectual Property

Our trademarks are valuable assets and their protection and their reputation are essential to us. We own the trademark rights to all of our principal brands,
including

Marlboro

, in all countries where we use them. PM USA owns the trademark rights to its brands, including

Marlboro

, within the United States, its territories and possessions.

In addition, we own more than 1,500 patents worldwide, and our patent portfolio, as a
whole, is material to our business; however, no one patent or group of related patents is material to us. We also have proprietary secrets, technology, know-how, processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.

Effective as of January 1, 2008, PMI entered into an Intellectual Property
Agreement with PM USA. The Intellectual Property Agreement governs the ownership of intellectual property between PMI and PM USA. Ownership of the jointly funded intellectual property has been allocated as follows:

•

PMI owns all rights to the jointly funded intellectual property outside the United States, its territories and possessions; and

•

PM USA owns all rights to the jointly funded intellectual property in the United States, its territories and possessions.

Ownership of intellectual property related to patent applications and resulting patents
based solely on the jointly funded intellectual property, regardless of when filed or issued, will be exclusive to PM USA in the United States, its territories and possessions and exclusive to PMI everywhere else in the world.

The Intellectual Property Agreement contains provisions concerning intellectual
property that is independently developed by us or PM USA following the Distribution. For the first two years following the Distribution, if we or PM USA independently develop new intellectual property that satisfies certain conditions and is
incorporated into a new product or included in a patent application, the new intellectual property will be subject to the geographic allocation described above. For ten years following the Distribution, independently developed intellectual property
may be subject to rights under certain circumstances that would allow either us or PM USA a priority position to obtain the rights to the new intellectual property from the other party, with the price and other terms to be negotiated.

-9-


In the event of a dispute between us and PM USA under the Intellectual Property Agreement, we have agreed with PM
USA to submit the dispute first, to negotiation between our and PM USA’s senior executives, and then, to binding arbitration.

Seasonality

Our business segments are not significantly affected by seasonality, although in certain markets cigarette consumption trends rise during the summer months due to longer daylight time and tourism.

Environmental Regulation

We are subject to applicable multi-national, national and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do
business. We have specific programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements and reduce wastage as well as water and energy consumption. We have developed and implemented a consistent environmental
and occupational health and safety (“EHS”) management system, which involves policies, standard practices and procedures at all our manufacturing centers. We also conduct regular safety assessments at our offices, warehouses and car fleet
organizations. Furthermore, we have engaged an external certification body to validate the effectiveness of our EHS management system at all our manufacturing centers around the world, in comparison with internationally recognized standards. Our
subsidiaries expect to continue to make capital and other expenditures in connection with environmental laws and regulations. Although it is not possible to predict precise levels of environmental-related expenditures, compliance with such laws and
regulations, including the payment of any remediation costs and the making of such expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position,
earnings or competitive position.

1A.

Risk Factors.

The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual
Report. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements

We may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including
statements contained in filings with the SEC, in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts. You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as “strategy,” “expects,”
“continues,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “will,” “estimates,” “intends,” “projects,” “goals,” “targets” and other words of similar meaning.
You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.

We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of
future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated,
estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us; any such
statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. We elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document, particularly in the “Business Environment” sections preceding our discussion of operating
results of our business. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. We do not
undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations.

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry

Cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. Significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted
in numerous jurisdictions. These tax increases may affect our profitability disproportionately and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors.

Tax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of manufactured
cigarettes versus other tobacco products, or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our manufactured cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. Because our portfolio is weighted toward the
premium price manufactured cigarette category, tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets. As a result, our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets.

Increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our
sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premium price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories where we may be under-represented,
from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband and counterfeit.

-11-


The European Commission is seeking to alter minimum retail selling price systems.

Several EU Member States have enacted laws establishing a minimum
retail selling price for cigarettes and, in some cases, other tobacco products. The European Commission has commenced proceedings against these Member States, claiming that minimum retail selling price systems infringe EU law. If the European
Commission’s infringement actions are successful, they could adversely impact excise tax levels and/or price gaps in those markets.

Our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of preventing the use of tobacco products.

Governmental actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and
private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets, and we expect that such actions will continue to reduce consumption levels. Significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few
years in most of our markets, driven principally by the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (“FCTC”). The FCTC is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to
establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. In addition, the FCTC has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to
reduce the palatability and appeal of tobacco products to adult smokers. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include:

•

the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges;

•

restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship;

•

the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements;

•

restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors and generic packaging;

•

restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale, and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines;

•

requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents levels;

•

requirements regarding testing, disclosure and use of tobacco product ingredients;

•

increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors;

•

elimination of duty free allowances for travelers; and

•

encouraging litigation against tobacco companies.

Partly because of some or a combination of these measures, unit sales of tobacco products in certain markets, principally Western Europe and Japan, have been in
general decline and we expect this trend to continue. Our operating income could be significantly affected by any significant decrease in demand for our products, any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements and
requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products.

Litigation related
to cigarette smoking and exposure to ETS could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity.

There is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions. Damages claimed in some of the tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in
certain cases in Brazil, Israel, Nigeria and Canada, range into the billions of dollars. We anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed. The FCTC encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers. It is possible that our
consolidated

-12-


results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or
settlement of certain pending litigation. Please see Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

of this Form 10-K for a discussion of tobacco-related litigation.

We face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand
loyalty, service, marketing, advertising and price. We are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions,
erosion of consumer confidence, competitors’ introduction of low-price products or innovative products, higher cigarette taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability
to differentiate tobacco products. Competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, government-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in China, Egypt, Thailand,
Taiwan, Vietnam and Algeria. Industry consolidation and privatizations of governmental enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures. Some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international
competitors are less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates.

Because we
have operations in numerous countries, our results may be influenced by economic, regulatory and political developments in many countries.

Some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes. In others, nationalization, terrorism, conflict and
the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment. Economic, political, regulatory or other developments could disrupt our supply chain or our distribution capabilities. In addition, such developments could lead to loss of
property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations, which could reduce our volumes, revenues and net earnings. In certain markets, we are dependent on governmental
approvals of various actions such as price changes.

In addition, despite
our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct, given the breadth and scope of our international operations, we may not be able to detect all potential improper or
unlawful conduct by our international partners and employees.

We may be unable to
anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns.

Our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences, which may be influenced by local economic conditions. To be successful, we must:

•

promote brand equity successfully;

•

anticipate and respond to new consumer trends;

•

develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios;

•

improve productivity; and

•

be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases.

In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may tend to purchase lower price brands, and the volume of our premium price, high price and mid-price brands and our
profitability could suffer accordingly.

-13-


We lose revenue as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases.

Large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the
international market. We believe that

Marlboro

is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand, although we cannot quantify the amount of revenue we lose as a result of this activity. In addition, our revenues are reduced by
contraband and legal cross-border purchases.

From
time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters.

Investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes, allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets and allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors such as “lights”
and “ultra lights.” We cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced, and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or
future investigations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Operating Results by Business Segment—Business Environment—Governmental Investigations” for a description
of governmental investigations to which we are subject.

We may be unsuccessful in our
attempts to produce cigarettes with the potential to reduce the risk of smoking-related diseases.

We continue to seek ways to develop commercially viable new product technologies that may reduce the risk of smoking. Our goal is to develop products whose
potential for risk reduction can be substantiated and meet adult smokers’ taste expectations. We may not succeed in these efforts. If we do not succeed, but one or more of our competitors do, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. Further, we
cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of tobacco products with claims of reduced risk to consumers, which could significantly undermine the commercial viability of these products.

Our reported results could be adversely affected by currency exchange rates and currency
devaluations could impair our competitiveness.

We conduct our
business primarily in local currency and, for purposes of financial reporting, the local currency results are translated into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. During times of a strengthening U.S.
dollar, our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. During periods of local economic crises, foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the U.S.
dollar, reducing our margins. Actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position.

The repatriation of our foreign earnings and change in the earnings mix may increase our effective tax rate.

Because we are a U.S. holding company, our most significant source of funds will be distributions from our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
These distributions may result in a residual U.S. tax cost. It may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions, which could result in a material increase in our overall tax rate in the
years such distributions take place.

Our ability to grow may be limited by our
inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or to improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.

Our profitability may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise prices or maintain an acceptable proportion
of our sales of higher margin products and sales in higher margin geographies.

-14-


We may be unable to expand our portfolio through successful acquisitions.

One element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market
positions through selective acquisitions. Acquisition opportunities are limited, and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings.
There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings.

Government mandated prices, production control programs, shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns may increase the cost or reduce the quality
of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products.

As with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand, and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns. Tobacco production in
certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. Changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco. Any significant
change in tobacco leaf and clove prices, quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business.

Our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking.

The tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies
that enjoy greater societal acceptance. As a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent.

We could incur significant indemnity obligations if our action or failure to act causes the Distribution to be taxable.

Under the tax sharing agreement between Altria and us, we have agreed to indemnify
Altria and its affiliates if we take, or fail to take, any action where such action, or failure to act, precludes the Spin-off from qualifying as a tax-free transaction. For a discussion of these restrictions, please see “The
Distribution—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Distribution,” which is included in our Registration Statement on Form 10.

Your percentage ownership of our common shares may be diluted by future acquisitions.

One of the purposes of the Spin-off was to provide us with focused common stock that
can be used to fund acquisitions. To the extent we issue new shares of common stock to fund acquisitions, your percentage ownership of our shares will be diluted. There is no assurance that the effect of this dilution will be offset by accretive
earnings from the acquisition.

Item 1B.

Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2.

Properties.

As of December 31, 2008, we operated and owned 58 manufacturing facilities, operated two leased manufacturing facilities, one in Korea and one in Mexico, and
maintained 23 contract manufacturing relationships with third parties. In addition, we work with 37 third-party operators in Indonesia who manufacture our hand-rolled cigarettes.

-15-


PMI Owned Manufacturing Facilities

In 2008, 19 of our facilities
each manufactured over 10 billion cigarettes and an additional 8 facilities each produced over 30 billion units. Our largest factories are in Bergen-op-Zoom (Holland), Izhora-St. Petersburg (Russia), Berlin (Germany), Izmir (Turkey), Krakow
(Poland), Kharkiv (Ukraine), Tanauan (Philippines), Krasnodar (Russia), Albarraque (Portugal), Sukorejo (Indonesia) and Neuchatel (Switzerland). Our smallest factories are mostly in Latin America, where due to tariff constraints we have established
small manufacturing units in individual markets, several of which are make-pack operations. We fully operate newly constructed factories in Greece and Indonesia. We will continue to optimize our manufacturing base, taking into consideration the
evolution of trade blocks. We also own a factory in Munich (Germany), which ceased operating in 2008 and therefore is not included in the above table.

The plants and properties owned or leased and operated by our subsidiaries are maintained in good condition and are believed to be suitable and adequate for present
needs.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

Legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us, and/or our subsidiaries, and/or our indemnitees in various jurisdictions.
Our indemnitees include distributors, licensees, and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend, as well as pay costs and some or all of judgments, if any, that may be entered against them. Altria
Group, Inc. and PM USA are also indemnitees, in certain cases, pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. and PMI. Various types of claims are raised in these proceedings, including, among others, product
liability, consumer protection, antitrust, and tax.

It is possible that
there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation.

Damages claimed in some of the tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in
certain cases in Brazil, Israel, Nigeria and Canada, range into the billions of dollars. The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary
relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. Much of the litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty. However, as discussed below, we have to date been largely successful in
defending tobacco-related litigation.

We and our subsidiaries record
provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an
unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the

-16-


possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, management has
not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.

It is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or
fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Nevertheless, although litigation is subject to uncertainty, we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel
handling the respective cases, that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts, if any. All such cases are, and will continue to be, vigorously defended. However, we and our
subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so.

The table below lists the number of tobacco-related cases pending against us and/or our subsidiaries or indemnitees as of February 15,
2009, December 31, 2007 and 2006:

(1)

The 2,010 cases are all pending in small claims courts in Italy where the maximum damage award claimed is approximately one thousand Euros per case.

Since 1995, when the first tobacco-related litigation was filed against a PMI entity,
approximately 297 Smoking and Health, Lights and Health Care Cost Recovery cases in which we and/or one of our subsidiaries and indemnitees was a defendant have been dismissed. In addition, eight cases have been decided in favor of plaintiffs. Five
of these cases have subsequently reached final resolution in our favor, one has been annulled and returned to the trial court for further proceedings, and two remain on appeal. To date, we have paid total judgments including costs of approximately
six thousand Euros. These payments were made in order to appeal three Italian small claims cases, two of which were subsequently reversed on appeal and one of which remains on appeal. To date, no tobacco-related case has been finally resolved in
favor of a plaintiff against us, our subsidiaries or indemnitees.

The table below lists the verdicts and post-trial developments in the two pending cases (excluding one individual
case on appeal from Italian small claims court) in which verdicts were returned in favor of plaintiffs:

-18-


Pending claims related to tobacco products generally fall within the following categories:

Smoking and Health Litigation

: These cases primarily allege personal
injury and are brought by individual plaintiffs or on behalf of a class of individual plaintiffs. Plaintiffs’ allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery, including negligence, gross negligence, strict
liability, fraud, misrepresentation, design defect, failure to warn, breach of express and implied warranties, violations of deceptive trade practice laws and consumer protection statutes. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief,
including compensatory and other damages, and injunctive and equitable relief. Defenses raised in these cases include licit activity, failure to state a claim, lack of defect, lack of proximate cause, assumption of the risk, contributory negligence,
and statute of limitations.

As of February 15, 2009, there were a
number of smoking and health cases pending against our subsidiaries or indemnitees, as follows:

•

125 cases brought by individual plaintiffs against our subsidiaries (122) or indemnitees (3) in Argentina (43), Australia (2), Brazil (53), Canada (1), Chile (11),
Costa Rica (1), Finland (3), Greece (1), Israel (1), Italy (5), Japan (1), the Philippines (1), Poland (1), and Scotland (1), compared with 136 such cases on December 31, 2007, and 137 cases on December 31, 2006; and

•

5 cases brought on behalf of classes of individual plaintiffs against our subsidiaries in Brazil (2), Bulgaria (1) and Canada (2), compared with 3 such cases on
December 31, 2007, and 2 such cases on December 31, 2006.

In the individual cases in Finland, in which our indemnitees (our former licensees now known as Amer Sports Corporation and Amerintie 1 Oy) and another member of the industry are defendants. Plaintiffs allege personal injuries
as a result of smoking. All three cases were tried together before the

District Court of Helsinki

. Trial began in March 2008, and concluded in May 2008. In October 2008, the District Court issued decisions in favor of defendants in all three
cases. Plaintiffs have filed appeals.

In the first class action pending
in Brazil,

The Smoker Health Defense Association (ADESF) v. Souza Cruz, S.A. and Philip Morris Marketing, S.A., Nineteenth Lower Civil Court of the Central Courts of the Judiciary District of São Paulo, Brazil,

filed July 25,
1995, our subsidiary and another member of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, a consumer organization, is seeking damages for smokers and former smokers, and injunctive relief. In February 2004, the trial court found defendants liable
without hearing evidence. The court did not assess moral or actual damages, which were to be assessed in a second phase of the case. The size of the class was not defined in the ruling. In April 2004, the court clarified its ruling, awarding
“moral damages” of R$1,000 (approximately $450) per smoker per full year of smoking plus interest at the rate of 1% per month, as of the date of the ruling. The court did not award actual damages, which were to be assessed in the
second phase of the case. The size of the class still has not been estimated. Defendants appealed to the São Paulo Court of Appeals, and the case, including the execution of the judgment, was stayed pending appeal. In November 2008, the
São Paulo Court of Appeals annulled the ruling finding that the trial court had inappropriately ruled without hearing evidence and returned the case to the trial court for further proceedings. In addition, the defendants have filed a
constitutional appeal to the Federal Supreme Court on the basis that the consumer association did not have standing to bring the lawsuit. This appeal is still pending.

In the second class action pending in Brazil,

Public Prosecutor of São Paulo v. Philip Morris Brasil Industria e Comercio Ltda, Civil Court
of the City of São Paulo, Brazil,

filed August 6, 2007, our subsidiary is a defendant. The plaintiff, the Public Prosecutor of the State of São Paulo, is seeking (1) unspecified damages on behalf of all smokers
nationwide, former smokers, and their relatives; (2) unspecified damages on behalf of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (“ETS”) nationwide, and their relatives; and (3) reimbursement of the health care costs allegedly
incurred for the treatment of tobacco-related diseases by all 26 States, approximately 5,000 Municipalities, and the

-19-


Federal District. In an interim ruling issued in December 2007, the trial court limited the scope of this claim to the State of São Paulo only. Our subsidiary
was served with the claim in February 2008, and filed its answer to the complaint in March 2008. In December 2008, the trial court issued a decision declaring that it lacked jurisdiction and transferred the case to the Nineteenth Lower Civil Court
in São Paulo where the

ADESF

case is pending.

In the class
action in Bulgaria,

Yochkolovski v. Sofia BT AD, et al., Sofia City Court, Bulgaria,

filed March 12, 2008, our subsidiaries and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff brought a collective claim on behalf of classes
of 1) smokers who were allegedly misled by tar and nicotine yields and 2) minors who were allegedly misled by marketing. Plaintiff seeks damages for economic loss, pain and suffering, medical treatment, and withdrawal from the market of all
cigarettes that allegedly do not comply with tar and nicotine labeling requirements. The court dismissed the youth marketing claims, and plaintiff appealed that decision. The court also has ordered plaintiff to provide additional evidence in support
of the remaining claims. Our subsidiaries have not been served with the complaint.

In the first class action pending in Canada,

Cecilia Letourneau v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd., Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. and JTI Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada,

filed in September 1998, our
subsidiary and two other Canadian manufacturers are defendants. The plaintiff, an individual smoker, is seeking compensatory and unspecified punitive damages for each member of the class who is deemed “addicted” to smoking. The class
was certified in 2005. Defendants’ motion to dismiss on statute-of-limitations grounds was denied in May 2008. Discovery is ongoing; no trial date has been set.

In the second class action pending in Canada,

Conseil Quebecois Sur Le Tabac Et La Santé and Jean-Yves Blais v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd.,
Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. and JTI Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada,

filed in November 1998, our subsidiary and two other Canadian manufacturers are defendants. The plaintiff, an individual smoker, is seeking
compensatory and unspecified punitive damages for each member of the class who suffers from certain smoking-related diseases. The class was certified in 2005. Discovery is ongoing; no trial date has been set.

Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation

: These cases, brought by governmental
and non-governmental plaintiffs, seek reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products. Plaintiffs’ allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery including unjust
enrichment, negligence, negligent design, strict liability, breach of express and implied warranties, violation of a voluntary undertaking or special duty, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conspiracy, public nuisance, defective product, failure
to warn, sale of cigarettes to minors, and claims under statutes governing competition and deceptive trade practices. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief including compensatory and other damages, and injunctive and equitable
relief. Defenses raised in these cases include lack of proximate cause, remoteness of injury, failure to state a claim, adequate remedy at law, “unclean hands” (namely, that plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief because they
participated in, and benefited from, the sale of cigarettes), and statute of limitations.

As of February 15, 2009, there were a total of 10 health care cost recovery cases pending against us, our subsidiaries and indemnitees, compared with 8 such cases on December 31, 2007, and 3 such cases on
December 31, 2006, as follows:

•

3 cases brought against us, our subsidiaries and our indemnitees in Canada (2) and in Israel (1); and

•

7 cases brought in Nigeria (6) and Spain (1) against our subsidiaries.

-20-


In the first health care cost recovery case pending in Canada,

Her Majesty the Queen in Right of British
Columbia v. Imperial Tobacco Limited, et al., Supreme Court, British Columbia, Vancouver Registry, Canada,

filed January 24, 2001, we, our subsidiary, our indemnitee (PM USA), and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff,
the government of the province of British Columbia, brought a claim based upon legislation enacted by the province authorizing the government to file a direct action against cigarette manufacturers to recover the health care costs it has incurred,
and will incur, resulting from a “tobacco related wrong.” The Supreme Court has held that the statute is constitutional. We and certain other non-Canadian defendants challenged the jurisdiction of the court. The court rejected the
jurisdictional challenge and the case is in the early stages of litigation. At the request of the parties, the trial date scheduled for September 2010 has been cancelled. No new trial date has been set.

On March 13, 2008, a second health care cost recovery case was filed in Canada,

Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Brunswick v. Rothmans Inc., et al., Court of Queen’s Bench of New Brunswick, Trial Court, New Brunswick, Fredericton, Canada,

in which we, our subsidiary, our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria Group,
Inc.), and other members of the industry are defendants. The claim was filed by the government of the province of New Brunswick based on legislation enacted in the province. This legislation is very similar to the law introduced in British Columbia
that authorizes the government to file a direct action against cigarette manufacturers to recover the health care costs it has incurred, and will incur, as a result of a “tobacco related wrong.” Our subsidiary, indemnitees, and we have
been served with the complaint. Preliminary motions are pending before the Court.

In the case in Israel,

Kupat Holim Clalit v. Philip Morris USA, et al., Jerusalem District Court, Israel,

filed September 28, 1998, we, our subsidiary, and our indemnitee (PM USA), together with other members of the industry are
defendants. The plaintiff, a private health care provider, brought a claim seeking reimbursement of the cost of treating its members for alleged smoking-related illnesses for the years 1990-1998. Certain defendants filed a motion to dismiss the
case. The motion was rejected, and those defendants filed a motion with the Israel Supreme Court for leave to appeal. The appeal was heard by the Supreme Court in March 2005, and the parties are awaiting the court’s decision.

In the first case in Nigeria,

The Attorney General of Lagos State v. British
American Tobacco (Nigeria) Limited, et al., High Court of Lagos State, Lagos, Nigeria,

filed April 30, 2007, our subsidiary and other members of the industry are defendants. Plaintiff seeks reimbursement for the cost of treating alleged
smoking-related diseases for the past 20 years, payment of anticipated costs of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the next 20 years, various forms of injunctive relief, plus punitive damages. In February 2008, our subsidiary was served
with a Notice of Discontinuance. The claim was formally dismissed in March 2008. However, the plaintiff has since refiled its claim. Our subsidiary has been served with the refiled complaint but is contesting service. We currently conduct no
business in Nigeria.

In the second case in Nigeria,

The Attorney
General of Kano State v. British American Tobacco (Nigeria) Limited, et al., High Court of Kano State, Kano, Nigeria,

filed May 9, 2007, our subsidiary and other members of the industry are defendants. Plaintiff seeks reimbursement for the
cost of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the past 20 years, payment of anticipated costs of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the next 20 years, various forms of injunctive relief, plus punitive damages. The case is in the

In the series of proceedings in Spain,

Junta de Andalucia, et al. v. Philip Morris Spain, et al., Court of First Instance, Madrid, Spain,

the first of which
was filed February 21, 2002, our subsidiary and other members of the industry were defendants. The plaintiffs sought reimbursement for the cost of treating certain of their citizens for various smoking-related illnesses. In May 2004, the first
instance court dismissed the initial case, finding that the State was a necessary party to the claim, and thus, the claim must be filed in the Administrative Court. The plaintiffs appealed. In February 2006, the appellate court affirmed the lower
court’s dismissal. The plaintiffs then filed notice that they intended to pursue their claim in the Administrative Court against the State. Because they were defendants in the original proceeding, our subsidiary and other members of the
industry filed notices with the Administrative Court that they are interested parties in the case. In September 2007, the plaintiffs filed their complaint in the Administrative Court. In November 2007, the Administrative Court dismissed the claim.
The plaintiffs asked the Administrative Court to reconsider its decision dismissing the case, and that request was rejected in a ruling rendered in February 2008. Plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court. In June 2008, our subsidiary filed a brief
of appearance before the Supreme Court giving notice that it is an interested party in the appeal proceedings initiated by the plaintiffs. The Administrative Court has recognized our subsidiary as a party. Plaintiffs have filed a second claim in the
Administrative Court against the Ministry of Economy. This second claim seeks the same relief as the original claim, but relies on a different procedural posture. The Administrative Court has recognized our subsidiary as a party.

Lights Cases

: These cases, brought by individual plaintiffs, or on behalf of a class of individual
plaintiffs, allege that the use of the term “lights” constitutes fraudulent and misleading conduct. Plaintiffs’ allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery including misrepresentation, deception,
and breach of consumer protection laws. Plaintiffs seek various forms of relief including restitution, and compensatory and other damages. Defenses raised include lack of causation, lack of reliance, assumption of the risk, and statute of
limitations.

As of February 15, 2009, there were a number of lights
cases pending against our subsidiaries and indemnitees, as follows:

the case meets the legal requirements necessary to allow it to proceed as a class action. The parties will now file final briefs on class certification.

defendants. The plaintiffs filed a purported class action claiming that the class members were misled by pack colors, terms such as “slims” or “super slims” or “blue,” and text describing tar and nicotine yields.
Plaintiffs allege that these pack features misled consumers to believe that the cigarettes with those descriptors are safer than full flavor cigarettes. Plaintiffs seek recovery of the price of the brands at issue that were purchased from
December 31, 2004 to the date of filing of the claim. They also seek compensation for mental anguish and punitive damages. Our subsidiaries Philip Morris Ltd. and Philip Morris Products S.A., and our indemnitee M.H. Eliashar Distribution Ltd.,

certification of a class comprised of all persons in Kansas who were indirect purchasers of cigarettes from the defendants. The plaintiff claims unspecified economic damages resulting from the alleged price-fixing, trebling of those damages under
the Kansas price-fixing statute and counsel fees. The trial court granted plaintiff’s motion for class certification and refused to permit the defendants to appeal. The case is now in the discovery phase. No trial date has yet been set.

Guarantees

At December 31, 2008, our third-party guarantees, which are primarily related to
excise taxes, were $49 million, of which $44 million have no specific expiration dates. The remainder ($5 million) expires through 2012, with no guarantees expiring during 2009. We are required to perform under these guarantees in the event that a
third party fails to make contractual payments. We do not have a liability on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008, as the fair value of these guarantees is insignificant due to the fact that the probability of future payments
under these guarantees is remote.

Under the terms of the Distribution
Agreement between Altria and us, liabilities concerning tobacco products will be allocated based in substantial part on the manufacturer. We will indemnify Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by us or contract
manufactured for us by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify us for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for us. We do not have a liability recorded on our balance sheet at
December 31, 2008, as the fair value of this indemnification is insignificant since the probability of future payments under this indemnification is remote.
