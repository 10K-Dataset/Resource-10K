DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE



In this report, “PMI,” “we,” “us” and “our” refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and subsidiaries.


PART I

Item 1.

Business.

(a) General Development of Business

General

Philip Morris International Inc. is a Virginia holding company incorporated in 1987. Our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are engaged in
the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products in markets outside of the United States of America. Our products are sold in approximately 160 countries and, in many of these countries, they hold the number one or number two market
share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands.

Our portfolio of international and local brands is led by

Marlboro

, the world’s best selling international cigarette, which accounted for
approximately 35% of our total 2009 shipment volume.

Marlboro

is complemented in the premium price category by

Merit, Parliament

and

Virginia Slims

. Our leading mid-price brands are

L&M

and

Chesterfield

. Other
leading international brands include

Bond Street

,

Lark

,

Muratti, Next, Philip Morris

and

Red & White

.

We also own a number of important local brands, such as

A Mild

,

Dji Sam Soe

and

A Hijau

in Indonesia,

Diana

in Italy,

Optima

and

Apollo-Soyuz

in Russia,

Morven Gold

in Pakistan,

Boston

in Colombia,

Belmont, Canadian Classics

and

Number 7

in Canada,

Best

and

Classic

in Serbia,

f6

in Germany,

Delicados

in Mexico,

Assos

in Greece and

Petra

in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. While there are a number of markets where local brands remain important, international brands are expanding their share in numerous markets. With
international brands contributing approximately 74% of our shipment volume in 2009, we are well positioned to continue to benefit from this trend.

Separation from Altria Group, Inc.

Prior to March 28, 2008, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”). On January 30, 2008, the Altria Board
of Directors announced Altria’s plans to spin off all of its interest in PMI to Altria’s stockholders in a tax-free transaction pursuant to Section 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The distribution of all of our shares owned by
Altria (the “Spin-off”), was made on March 28, 2008 (the “Distribution Date”), to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 19, 2008 (the “Record Date”). Altria distributed one share of our
common stock for each share of Altria common stock outstanding on the Record Date.

Acquisitions and Other Business Arrangements

One element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and/or expand our geographic reach through an active program of selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. We are constantly
evaluating potential acquisition opportunities and strategic projects. From time to time we may engage in confidential negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement. During 2009,
2008 and 2007, we have expanded our business with the following transactions:

2009:

In
September 2009, we acquired Swedish Match South Africa (Proprietary) Limited, for ZAR 1.93 billion (approximately $256 million based on exchange rates prevailing at the time of the acquisition), including acquired cash.

-1-


In July 2009, we entered into an agreement to purchase 100% of the shares of privately-owned Colombian
cigarette manufacturer, Productora Tabacalera de Colombia, Protabaco Ltda., for $452 million. The transaction, which is subject to competition authority approval and final confirmatory due diligence, is expected to close in the first half of 2010.
We project this acquisition to be marginally accretive to our earnings per share immediately.

In February 2009, we purchased the

Petterøes

tobacco business, which includes fine-cut trademarks primarily sold in Norway and Sweden.

In February 2009, we also entered into an agreement with Swedish Match AB (“SWMA”) to establish an exclusive
joint venture to commercialize Swedish style snus and other smoke-free tobacco products worldwide, outside of Scandinavia and the United States. We and SWMA will license exclusively to the joint venture an agreed list of trademarks and intellectual
property. The joint venture started operations on April 1, 2009. The effect of this agreement was not material to our 2009 consolidated financial position, results of operations or operating cash flows.

2008:

In October 2008, we completed the acquisition of Rothmans Inc.
(“Rothmans”), which is located in Canada, for CAD $2.0 billion (approximately $1.9 billion based on exchange rates prevailing at the time of the acquisition). Prior to our acquisition, Rothmans’ sole holding was a 60% interest in
Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (“RBH”). The remaining 40% interest in RBH was owned by us.

In June 2008, we purchased the fine cut trademark

Interval

and certain other trademarks in the other tobacco products category (“OTP”)
from Imperial Tobacco Group PLC for $407 million.

2007:

In November 2007, we acquired an
additional 30% interest in our Mexican tobacco business from Grupo Carso, S.A.B. de C.V. (“Grupo Carso”), which increased our ownership interest to 80%, for $1.1 billion. After this transaction was completed, Grupo Carso retained a 20%
interest in the business. A director of PMI has an affiliation with Grupo Carso. We also entered into an agreement with Grupo Carso which provides the basis for us to potentially acquire, or for Grupo Carso to potentially sell to us, Grupo
Carso’s remaining 20% interest in the future.

During
the first quarter of 2007, we acquired an additional 58.2% interest in a Pakistan cigarette manufacturer, Lakson Tobacco Company Limited (“Lakson Tobacco”), which increased our total ownership interest in Lakson Tobacco from 40% to
approximately 98%, for $388 million.

Other:

On February 25, 2010, our
affiliate, Philip Morris Philippines Manufacturing Inc. (“PMPMI”), and Fortune Tobacco Corporation (“FTC”) signed an agreement to unite their respective business activities by transferring selected assets and liabilities of PMPMI
and FTC to a new company, which will be called PMFTC Inc. (“PMFTC”). PMPMI and FTC will hold equal economic interests in PMFTC, while we will manage the day-to-day operations of PMFTC and have a majority of its Board of Directors.
Consequently, we will account for the contributed assets and liabilities of FTC as a business combination. The preliminary purchase price allocation has not been completed, and therefore we cannot describe assets acquired and liabilities assumed by
each major class. The establishment of PMFTC permits both parties to benefit from their respective, complementary brand portfolios, as well as cost synergies from the resulting integration of manufacturing, distribution and procurement, and the
further development and growth of tobacco growing in the Philippines.

As part of the transaction, FTC also received the right to sell its interest to us, except in certain circumstances, during the period from February 25, 2015 through February 24, 2018, at an agreed-upon value of
$1.17 billion, which will be reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as a redeemable noncontrolling interest. In future periods, if the fair value of 50% of PMFTC were to drop below $1.17 billion, the difference would be treated as a special
dividend to FTC and would be excluded from net earnings attributable to PMI for the calculation of earnings per share.

Source of
Funds — Dividends

We are a legal entity
separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior
claims of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized. As a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from
the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other
distributions with respect to their common stock.

(b) Financial
Information About Segments

We divide our markets
into four geographic regions, which constitute our segments for financial reporting purposes:

•

The European Union (“EU”) Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland and covers all the EU countries except for Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania,
and also comprises Switzerland, Norway and Iceland, which are linked to the EU through trade agreements.

•

The Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EEMA”) Region is also headquartered in Lausanne and covers the Balkans (including Slovenia, Bulgaria and
Romania), the former Soviet Union (excluding Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), Mongolia, Turkey, the Middle East and Africa and our international duty free business.

•

The Asia Region is headquartered in Hong Kong and covers all other Asian countries as well as Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands.

•

The Latin America & Canada Region is headquartered in New York and covers the South American continent, Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean and
Canada.

Net revenues and operating
companies income* (together with a reconciliation to operating income) attributable to each such segment for each of the last three years are set forth in Note 12.

Segment Reporting

to our consolidated financial statements, which is
incorporated herein by reference to the 2009 Annual Report. See Part II, Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

for a discussion of our operating results by business segment.

The relative percentages of operating companies income
attributable to each reportable segment were as follows:

*

Our management evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based on operating companies income, which we define as operating income before general corporate expenses
and amortization of intangibles. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

to our consolidated financial statements and are incorporated herein by
reference to the 2009 Annual Report.

-3-


We use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products, net of
sales and promotion incentives. Our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell. Mix is a
term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium price brands to mid-price or low-price brands in any given market (product mix). Mix can also refer to the proportion of volume in more profitable markets versus volume in less profitable
markets (geographic mix). We often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to local governments, and, in those circumstances, we include excise taxes as a component of net revenues and as part of our cost of sales. Aside from
excise taxes, our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs.

Our marketing, administration and research costs include the costs of marketing our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of
our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products. The most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are selling and marketing expenses, which relate to the cost of our
sales force as well as to the advertising and promotion of our products.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

Our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees manufacture, market and sell tobacco products outside the United States.

Our total cigarette shipments decreased 0.7% in 2009 to 864.0 billion units. We estimate that international cigarette market shipments were
approximately 5.6 trillion units in 2009, a 0.7% increase over 2008. We estimate that our share of the international cigarette market (which is defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the United States) was approximately 15.4%, 15.7% and
15.6% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Excluding the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), we estimate that our share of the international cigarette market was approximately 26.0%, 25.8% and 25.2% in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. Shipments of our principal brand,

Marlboro

, decreased 2.8% in 2009, and represented approximately 9.1% of the international cigarette market, excluding PRC, in 2009 and 2008, and 9.2% in 2007.

We have a cigarette market share of at least 15%, and, in a number of
instances substantially more than 15%, in approximately 90 markets, including Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan,
Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine.

References to total international cigarette market, total cigarette market, total market and market shares in this Form 10-K are our estimates based on
a number of internal and external sources.

Distribution and Sales

The distribution and sales strategy for our products is
tailored to the characteristics of each market, including retailer needs and capabilities, the wholesale infrastructure, our competitive position, costs and the regulatory framework. Our goals are speed, efficiency and widespread availability of our
products, while at the same time contributing to the success of our direct and indirect trade partners. The four main types of distribution that we use across the globe are:

•

Direct Sales and Distribution (“DSD”), where we have set up our own distribution directly to retailers.

•

Single independent distributors who are responsible for distribution within a single market.

-4-


•

Exclusive Zonified Distribution (“EZD”), where distributors have an exclusive territory within a country to enable them to obtain a suitable return on
their investment.

•

Distribution through wholesalers, where we supply either national or regional wholesalers who then service the retail trade.

In many countries we also service key accounts, including gas stations,
retail chains and supermarkets, directly.

Our distribution
and sales systems are supported by sales forces that in the aggregate total approximately 16,800 employees worldwide. Our sales forces are well trained, recognized by trade surveys for their professionalism, and have developed a long lasting
relationship with the wholesale and retail trade, thus providing us with a superior presence at the point of sale, as evidenced by our leading market share position in many markets. In addition, our consumer engagement teams work together with the
sales forces to engage adult smokers in promotional activities and to support new product launches.

Our products are advertised and promoted through various media and channels, including, where permitted by law, point of sale communications, brand
events, access-controlled Web sites, print, new digital technologies and direct communication to verified adult smokers. Our direct communication with verified adult smokers utilizes mail, email and other electronic communication tools. Promotional
activities include, where permitted by law, competitions, invitation to events, interactive programs, consumer incentive items and price promotions. To support advertising and promotional activities in the markets, we have a dedicated consumer
engagement group that develops innovative engagement tools based on the latest technologies and consumer trends.

Competition

We are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand
recognition, brand loyalty, taste, innovation, packaging, service, marketing, advertising and price. Our competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances,
government-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in China, Egypt, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam and Algeria. Industry consolidation and privatizations of governmental enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures. Some
competitors have different profit and volume objectives, and some international competitors are less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates. We compete predominantly with American type blended cigarettes, such as

Marlboro, L&M

and

Chesterfield

, which are the most popular across many of our markets. We seek to compete in all profitable price segments.

Procurement and Raw Materials

We purchase tobacco leaf of various grades and styles throughout the world, the majority through independent tobacco dealers. We also contract directly
with farmers in several countries including the United States, Argentina, Mexico, Indonesia, Ecuador, Dominican Republic, Poland, Colombia, and Portugal.

Our largest sources of supply are:

•

The United States for Virginia (flue-cured) and Burley tobaccos, particularly higher quality varieties for use in leading international brands.

•

Brazil, particularly for Virginia tobaccos but also for Burley.

•

Indonesia, mostly for domestic use in kretek products.

•

Turkey and Greece, mostly for Oriental.

•

Argentina and Malawi, mostly for Burley.

-5-


We believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy our current and
anticipated production requirements.

In addition to tobacco
leaf, we purchase a wide variety of other non-tobacco materials from a total of approximately 340 suppliers. Our top 10 suppliers of non-tobacco materials combined represent more than 54% of our total non-tobacco material purchases. The three most
significant non-tobacco materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging, acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in cigarette manufacturing. In addition, the supply of cloves is of particular importance to our
Indonesian business.

Business Environment

Information called for by this Item is hereby incorporated by reference
to the paragraphs captioned “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Operating Results by Business Segment–Business Environment” on pages 24 to 31 of the 2009 Annual
Report and made a part hereof.

Other Matters

Customers

None of our business segments are dependent upon a single customer or a
few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.

Employees

As of December 31, 2009, we employed approximately 77,300 people worldwide, including employees under temporary contracts and hourly paid part
time staff. Our businesses are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees. Generally, these laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business. In addition, in accordance with European
Union requirements, we have established a European Works Council composed of management and elected members of our workforce. We believe that our relations with our employees and their representative organizations are excellent.

Executive Officers of the Registrant

The disclosure regarding executive officers is set forth under the
heading “Executive Officers as of February 26, 2010” in Item 10 of Part III of this Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

Research and Development

Our research efforts are focused on understanding the mechanisms of tobacco-related diseases, and specifically the complex role of tobacco smoke
constituents in the development of tobacco-related diseases. This research serves as the cornerstone for our efforts to develop products that have the potential to reduce the risk of tobacco-related diseases. Those efforts currently focus on smoke
generation at lower temperatures, heat generation and mass transfer, biotechnology, material science and the removal of certain harmful compounds from the tobacco leaf using agronomic practices. We are undertaking research to enable us to predict
whether and to what extent a product has the potential to reduce the risk of a disease caused by smoking. This will be critical for making substantiated statements about the potential risk reduction of such products when commercializing them.

We also conduct research to support and reinforce our
conventional product business. We seek to be at the forefront of innovation. Significant investments have been made in new product development efforts for conventional products, resulting in a wide range of product enhancements and the launch of

-6-


innovative new products. Further, with the increase in product regulations, support for the conventional cigarette business has expanded and is expected to become more complex, requiring
additional capacity for analysis and testing in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Finally, we are conducting research and development on technology platforms that can potentially lead to the development of alternative uses of
tobacco.

The research and development expense for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is set forth in Note 14.

Additional Information

to our financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2009 Annual Report.

Intellectual Property

Our trademarks are valuable assets and their protection and their
reputation are essential to us. We own the trademark rights to all of our principal brands, including

Marlboro

, in all countries where we use them. Philip Morris USA Inc. (“PM USA”), a U.S. tobacco subsidiary of Altria, owns the
trademark rights to its brands, including

Marlboro

, within the United States, its territories and possessions.

In addition, we own more than 1,900 patents worldwide, and our patent portfolio, as a whole, is material to our business; however, no one patent or
group of related patents is material to us. We also have proprietary secrets, technology, know-how, processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.

Effective as of January 1, 2008, PMI entered into an Intellectual Property Agreement with PM USA. The Intellectual
Property Agreement governs the ownership of intellectual property between PMI and PM USA. Ownership of the jointly funded intellectual property has been allocated as follows:

•

PMI owns all rights to the jointly funded intellectual property outside the United States, its territories and possessions; and

•

PM USA owns all rights to the jointly funded intellectual property in the United States, its territories and possessions.

Ownership of intellectual property related to patent applications and
resulting patents based solely on the jointly funded intellectual property, regardless of when filed or issued, will be exclusive to PM USA in the United States, its territories and possessions and exclusive to PMI everywhere else in the world.

The Intellectual Property Agreement contains provisions
concerning intellectual property that is independently developed by us or PM USA following the Distribution. For the first two years following the Distribution, if we or PM USA independently develop new intellectual property that satisfies certain
conditions and is incorporated into a new product or included in a patent application, the new intellectual property will be subject to the geographic allocation described above. For ten years following the Distribution, independently developed
intellectual property may be subject to rights under certain circumstances that would allow either us or PM USA a priority position to obtain the rights to the new intellectual property from the other party, with the price and other terms to be
negotiated.

In the event of a dispute between us and PM USA
under the Intellectual Property Agreement, we have agreed with PM USA to submit the dispute first, to negotiation between our and PM USA’s senior executives, and then, to binding arbitration.

Seasonality

Our business segments are not significantly affected by seasonality, although in certain markets cigarette consumption
trends rise during the summer months due to longer daylight time and tourism.

-7-


Environmental Regulation

We are subject to applicable international, national and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in
which we do business. We have specific programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements and reduce wastage as well as water and energy consumption. We have developed and implemented a consistent
environmental and occupational health and safety (“EHS”) management system, which involves policies, standard practices and procedures at all our manufacturing centers. We also conduct regular safety assessments at our offices, warehouses
and car fleet organizations. Furthermore, we have engaged an external certification body to validate the effectiveness of our EHS management system at all our manufacturing centers around the world, in accordance with internationally recognized
standards. Our subsidiaries expect to continue to make investments in order to drive improved performance and maintain compliance with environmental laws and regulations. We assess and report the compliance status of all our legal entities on a
regular basis. Based on the management and controls we have in place environmental expenditures have not had, and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position,
earnings or competitive position.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this
Annual Report. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements

We may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements,
including statements contained in filings with the SEC, in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts. You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as “strategy,” “expects,”
“continues,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “will,” “estimates,” “intends,” “projects,” “goals,” “targets” and other words of similar meaning.
You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.

We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions.
Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from
those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made
by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. We elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document, particularly in the “Business Environment” section preceding our discussion
of operating results of our business. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. We
do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations.

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry

Cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. Significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be
proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. These tax increases may affect our profitability disproportionately and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors.

Tax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of
manufactured cigarettes versus other tobacco products, or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our manufactured cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. Because our portfolio is weighted
toward the premium price manufactured cigarette category, tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets. As a result, our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets.

Increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to
have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premium price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories,
where we may be under-represented, from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband and counterfeit.

The European Commission is seeking to alter minimum retail selling price systems.

Several EU Member States have enacted laws establishing a minimum retail
selling price for cigarettes and, in some cases, other tobacco products. The European Commission has commenced proceedings against these Member States in the European Court of Justice, claiming that minimum retail selling price systems infringe EU
law. The Advocate General of the Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion related to the proceedings against Austria, France and Ireland, agreeing with the position of the European Commission. If the European Commission’s infringement
actions are successful, they could adversely impact excise tax levels and/or price gaps in those markets.

Our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of preventing the use of tobacco products.

Governmental actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of
smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets, and we expect that such actions will continue to reduce consumption levels. Significant regulatory developments will take place over
the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (“FCTC”). The FCTC is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective
is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. In addition, the FCTC has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations
to reduce the palatability and appeal of tobacco products to adult smokers. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include:

•

the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges;

•

restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship;

•

the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements;

•

restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors, and plain packaging;

•

restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines;

•

requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents;

•

requirements regarding testing, disclosure and use of tobacco product ingredients;

•

increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors;

•

elimination of duty free allowances for travelers; and

•

encouraging litigation against tobacco companies.

Partly because of some or a combination of these measures, unit sales of tobacco products in certain markets, principally Western Europe and Japan,
have been in general decline and we expect this trend to continue. Our operating income could be significantly affected by any significant decrease in demand for our products, any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory
requirements and requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products.

Litigation related to cigarette smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (“ETS”) could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity.

There is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain
jurisdictions. Damages claimed in some of the tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in Brazil, Israel, Nigeria and

-10-


Canada, range into the billions of dollars. We anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed. The FCTC encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers. It is possible that our
consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Please see Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

of this Form 10-K for a discussion of tobacco-related litigation.

We face intense competition, and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, innovation, packaging, service,
marketing, advertising and price. We are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of
consumer confidence, competitors’ introduction of low-price products or innovative products, higher cigarette taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to
differentiate tobacco products. Competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, government-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in China, Egypt, Thailand,
Taiwan, Vietnam and Algeria. Industry consolidation and privatizations of governmental enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures. Some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international
competitors are less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates.

Because we have operations in numerous countries, our results may be influenced by economic, regulatory and political developments in many countries.

Some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes. In
others, nationalization, terrorism, conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment. Economic, political, regulatory or other developments could disrupt our supply chain or our distribution capabilities. In
addition, such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations, which could reduce our volumes, revenues and net earnings. In
certain markets, we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes.

In addition, despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct,
given the breadth and scope of our international operations, we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our international partners and employees.

We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns.

Our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer
preferences, which may be influenced by local economic conditions. To be successful, we must:

•

promote brand equity successfully;

•

anticipate and respond to new consumer trends;

•

develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios;

•

improve productivity; and

•

be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases.

-11-


In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may tend to purchase lower price brands, and the volume
of our premium price, high-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly.

We lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases.

Large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international
market. We believe that

Marlboro

is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand, although we cannot quantify the amount of revenues we lose as a result of this activity. In addition, our revenues are reduced by contraband and
legal cross-border purchases.

From time
to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters.

Investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes, allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets, allegations of underpayment of custom duties and/or excise taxes, and
allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors such as “lights” and “ultra lights.” We cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced, and it is possible that
our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Operating Results by Business
Segment-Business Environment-Governmental Investigations” for a description of governmental investigations to which we are subject.

We may be unsuccessful in our attempts to produce cigarettes with the potential to reduce the risk of smoking-related diseases.

We continue to seek ways to develop commercially viable new product
technologies that may reduce the risk of smoking. Our goal is to develop products whose potential for risk reduction can be substantiated and meet adult smokers’ taste expectations. We may not succeed in these efforts. If we do not succeed, but
one or more of our competitors do, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. Further, we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of tobacco products with claims of reduced risk to consumers, which could significantly undermine the
commercial viability of these products.

Our reported results could be
adversely affected by currency exchange rates, and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness.

We conduct our business primarily in local currency and, for purposes of financial reporting, the local currency results are translated into U.S.
dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer U.S.
dollars. During periods of local economic crises, foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the U.S. dollar, reducing our margins. Actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position.

The repatriation of our foreign earnings, changes in the earnings mix, and changes in
U.S. tax laws may increase our effective tax rate.

Because we are a U.S. holding company, our most significant source of funds will be distributions from our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Under current U.S. tax law, in general we do not pay U.S. taxes on our foreign earnings until they are
repatriated to the U.S. as distributions from our non-U.S. subsidiaries. These distributions may result in a residual U.S. tax cost. It may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions,
which could result in a

-12-


material increase in our overall effective tax rate. Additionally, the Obama Administration has indicated that it favors changes in U.S. tax law that would fundamentally change how our earnings
are taxed in the U.S. If enacted and depending upon its precise terms, such legislation could increase our overall effective tax rate.

Our ability to grow may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or to improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements
in our brand and geographic mix.

Our profitability may
suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise prices or maintain an acceptable proportion of our sales of higher margin products and sales in higher margin geographies.

We may be unable to expand our portfolio through successful acquisitions and the
development of strategic business relationships.

One
element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. Acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited
and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms
or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings.

Government mandated prices, production control programs, shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other
agricultural products used to manufacture our products.

As with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand, and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns. Tobacco production in certain countries
is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. Changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco. Any significant change in tobacco leaf
and clove prices, quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business.

Our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking.

The tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other
companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance. As a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent.

We could incur significant indemnity obligations if our action or failure to act causes the Spin-off to be taxable.

Under the tax sharing agreement between Altria and us, we have agreed to
indemnify Altria and its affiliates if we take, or fail to take, any action where such action, or failure to act, precludes the Spin-off from qualifying as a tax-free transaction. For a discussion of these restrictions, please see “The
Distribution-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Distribution,” which is included in our Registration Statement on Form 10.

Your percentage ownership of our common shares may be diluted by future acquisitions.

To the extent we issue new shares of common stock to fund acquisitions, your percentage ownership of our shares will be
diluted. There is no assurance that the effect of this dilution will be offset by accretive earnings from the acquisition.

Item 1B.

Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2.

Properties.

As of December 31, 2009, we operated and owned 58 manufacturing facilities, operated two leased manufacturing facilities, one in Korea and one in
Mexico, and maintained 30 contract manufacturing relationships with third parties. In addition, we work with 37 third-party operators in Indonesia who manufacture our hand-rolled cigarettes.

PMI Owned Manufacturing Facilities

In 2009, 24 of our facilities each manufactured over 10 billion cigarettes of which 6 facilities each produced over 30 billion units. Our largest factories are in Bergen-op-Zoom (Holland), Izhora (Russia), Berlin
(Germany), Izmir (Turkey), Krakow (Poland), Kharkiv (Ukraine), Tanauan (Philippines), Neuchatel (Switzerland), Krasnodar (Russia) and Kutna Hora (Czech Republic). Our smallest factories are mostly in Latin America, where due to tariff constraints we
have established small manufacturing units in individual markets, several of which are make-pack operations. We will continue to optimize our manufacturing base, taking into consideration the evolution of trade blocks.

The plants and properties owned or leased and operated by our subsidiaries
are maintained in good condition and are believed to be suitable and adequate for present needs.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

Legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us, and/or our subsidiaries, and/or our indemnitees in various
jurisdictions. Our indemnitees include distributors, licensees, and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend, as well as pay costs and some or all of judgments, if any, that may be entered against
them. Altria Group, Inc. and PM USA are also indemnitees, in certain cases, pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. and PMI. Various types of claims are raised in these proceedings, including, among
others, product liability, consumer protection, antitrust, and tax.

It is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation.

Damages claimed in some of the tobacco-related litigation
are significant and, in certain cases in Brazil, Israel, Nigeria and Canada, range into the billions of dollars. The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims,
demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the

-14-


ultimate outcome. Much of the litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty. However, as discussed below, we have to date been largely successful in defending
tobacco-related litigation.

We and our subsidiaries record
provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an
unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of
loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if
any. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.

It is
possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Nevertheless,
although litigation is subject to uncertainty, we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us, as
well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts, if any. All such cases are, and will continue to be, vigorously defended. However, we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best
interests to do so.

The table below lists the number of
tobacco-related cases pending against us and/or our subsidiaries or indemnitees as of February 15, 2010, December 31, 2008 and 2007:

(1)

Includes two cases due to the acquisition of Rothmans in Canada.

(2)

The 1,964 cases are all pending in small claims courts in Italy where the maximum damage award claimed is approximately one thousand Euros per case. Of these
1,964 cases, 1,952, which were filed by the same plaintiffs’ attorney, have now been stayed pending an investigation by the public prosecutor into the conduct of that plaintiffs’ attorney. In May 2009, the case files in these cases
were permanently confiscated by the court as a result of the investigation. As a consequence of the confiscation of these case files, the small claims courts in which the cases are pending have begun dismissing the cases, and the remainder of the
cases should be dismissed in the coming months.

Since 1995, when the first tobacco-related litigation was filed against a PMI entity, 367

(3)

Smoking and Health, Lights, Health Care Cost Recovery cases and Public Civil Actions in which we and/or one of our subsidiaries and/or indemnitees was a defendant have been terminated in our favor. Nine cases have
had decisions in favor of plaintiffs. Five of these cases have subsequently reached final resolution in our favor, one has been annulled and returned to the trial court for further proceedings, and three remain on appeal. To date, we have paid total
judgments including costs of approximately six thousand

(3)

Includes 156 individual lights cases filed in small claims courts in Italy.

-15-


Euros. These payments were made in order to appeal three Italian small claims cases, two of which were subsequently reversed on appeal and one of which remains on appeal. To date, no
tobacco-related case has been finally resolved in favor of a plaintiff against us, our subsidiaries or indemnitees.

The table below lists the verdicts and post-trial developments in the three pending cases (excluding one individual case on appeal from Italian small
claims court) in which verdicts were returned in favor of plaintiffs:

-16-


Pending claims related to tobacco products generally fall within the following categories:

Smoking and Health Litigation:

These cases primarily allege personal injury and are brought by individual plaintiffs or on behalf of a
class of individual plaintiffs. Plaintiffs’ allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery, including negligence, gross negligence, strict liability, fraud, misrepresentation, design defect, failure to warn,
breach of express and implied warranties, violations of deceptive trade practice laws and consumer protection statutes. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief, including compensatory and other damages, and injunctive and equitable
relief. Defenses raised in these cases include licit activity, failure to state a claim, lack of defect, lack of proximate cause, assumption of the risk, contributory negligence, and statute of limitations.

As of February 15, 2010, there were a number of smoking and health
cases pending against us, our subsidiaries or indemnitees, as follows:

•

119 cases brought by individual plaintiffs against our subsidiaries (117) or indemnitees (2) in Argentina (43), Brazil (50), Canada (1), Chile (9),
Costa Rica (1), Finland (2), Greece (1), Israel

-17-


(1), Italy (7), the Philippines (1), Scotland (1) and Turkey (2), compared with 123 such cases on December 31, 2008, and 136 cases on December 31, 2007; and

•

9 cases brought on behalf of classes of individual plaintiffs against us, our subsidiaries, or indemnitees in Brazil (2), Bulgaria (1) and Canada (6),
compared with 5 such cases on December 31, 2008, and 3 such cases on December 31, 2007.

In the individual cases in Finland, our two indemnitees (our former licensees now known as Amer Sports Corporation and Amerintie 1 Oy) and another
member of the industry are defendants. Plaintiffs allege personal injuries as a result of smoking. All three cases were tried together before the District Court of Helsinki. Trial began in March 2008 and concluded in May 2008. In October 2008, the
District Court issued decisions in favor of defendants in all three cases. Plaintiffs filed appeals. One of the three plaintiffs has since withdrawn her appeal, making the District Court’s decision in favor of the defendants final. The other
two plaintiffs continued to pursue their appeals. The appellate hearing, which was essentially a re-trial of these cases before the Appellate Court, concluded in December 2009. The parties are awaiting the Appellate Court’s decision.

In the first class action pending in Brazil,

The Smoker
Health Defense Association (ADESF) v. Souza Cruz, S.A. and Philip Morris Marketing, S.A., Nineteenth Lower Civil Court of the Central Courts of the Judiciary District of São Paulo, Brazil

, filed July 25, 1995, our subsidiary and
another member of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, a consumer organization, is seeking damages for smokers and former smokers, and injunctive relief. In February 2004, the trial court found defendants liable without hearing evidence. The
court did not assess moral or actual damages, which were to be assessed in a second phase of the case. The size of the class was not defined in the ruling. In April 2004, the court clarified its ruling, awarding “moral damages” of R$1,000
(approximately $540) per smoker per full year of smoking plus interest at the rate of 1% per month, as of the date of the ruling. The court did not award actual damages, which were to be assessed in the second phase of the case. The size of the
class still has not been estimated. Defendants appealed to the São Paulo Court of Appeals, and the case, including the execution of the judgment, was stayed pending appeal. In November 2008, the São Paulo Court of Appeals annulled the
ruling finding that the trial court had inappropriately ruled without hearing evidence and returned the case to the trial court for further proceedings. In addition, the defendants have filed a constitutional appeal to the Federal Supreme Court on
the basis that the consumer association did not have standing to bring the lawsuit. This appeal is still pending.

In the second class action pending in Brazil,

Public Prosecutor of São Paulo v. Philip Morris Brasil Industria e Comercio Ltda, Civil Court
of the City of São Paulo, Brazil,

filed August 6, 2007, our subsidiary is a defendant. The plaintiff, the Public Prosecutor of the State of São Paulo, is seeking (1) unspecified damages on behalf of all smokers
nationwide, former smokers, and their relatives; (2) unspecified damages on behalf of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (“ETS”) nationwide, and their relatives; and (3) reimbursement of the health care costs allegedly
incurred for the treatment of tobacco-related diseases by all 26 States, approximately 5,000 Municipalities, and the Federal District. In an interim ruling issued in December 2007, the trial court limited the scope of this claim to the State of
São Paulo only. Our subsidiary was served with the claim in February 2008, and filed its answer to the complaint in March 2008. In December 2008, the trial court issued a decision declaring that it lacked jurisdiction and transferred the case
to the Nineteenth Lower Civil Court in São Paulo where the

ADESF

case discussed above is pending. Our subsidiary appealed this decision to the State of São Paulo Court of Appeals, which subsequently declared the case stayed
pending the outcome of the appeal.

In the class action in
Bulgaria,

Yochkolovski v. Sofia BT AD, et al., Sofia City Court, Bulgaria,

filed March 12, 2008, our subsidiaries and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff

-18-


brought a collective claim on behalf of classes of smokers who were allegedly misled by tar and nicotine yields printed on packages and on behalf of a class of minors who were allegedly misled by
marketing. Plaintiff seeks damages for economic loss, pain and suffering, medical treatment, and withdrawal from the market of all cigarettes that allegedly do not comply with tar and nicotine labeling requirements. The trial court dismissed the
youth marketing claims. This decision has been affirmed on appeal. The trial court also ordered plaintiff to provide additional evidence in support of the remaining claims. Our subsidiaries have not been served with the complaint.

In the first class action pending in Canada,

Cecilia Letourneau v.
Imperial Tobacco Ltd., Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. and JTI Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada,

filed in September 1998, our subsidiary and two other Canadian manufacturers are defendants. The plaintiff, an individual
smoker, is seeking compensatory and unspecified punitive damages for each member of the class who is deemed addicted to smoking. The class was certified in 2005. Defendants’ motion to dismiss on statute-of-limitations grounds was denied in May
2008. Discovery is ongoing. The court has set September 2010 as the target trial date.

In the second class action pending in Canada,

Conseil Quebecois Sur Le Tabac Et La Santé and Jean-Yves Blais v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd., Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. and JTI Macdonald Corp.,
Quebec Superior Court, Canada,

filed in November 1998, our subsidiary and two other Canadian manufacturers are defendants. The plaintiffs, an anti-smoking organization and an individual smoker, are seeking compensatory and unspecified
punitive damages for each member of the class who suffers from certain smoking-related diseases. The class was certified in 2005. Discovery is ongoing. The court has set September 2010 as the target trial date.

In the third class action pending in Canada,

Kunta v. Canadian Tobacco
Manufacturers’ Council, et al., The Queen’s Bench, Winnipeg, Canada

, filed June 12, 2009, we, our subsidiaries, and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria Group, Inc.), and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff,
an individual smoker, alleges her own addiction to tobacco products and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”), severe asthma, and mild reversible lung disease resulting from the use of tobacco products. She is seeking compensatory
and unspecified punitive damages on behalf of a proposed class comprised of all smokers, their estates, dependents and family members, as well as restitution of profits, and reimbursement of government health care costs allegedly caused by tobacco
products. We, our subsidiaries, and our indemnitees have been served with the complaint.

In the fourth class action pending in Canada,

Adams v. Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers’ Council, et al.

,

The Queen’s Bench, Saskatchewan, Canada

, filed July 10, 2009, we, our
subsidiaries, and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria Group, Inc.), and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, an individual smoker, alleges her own addiction to tobacco products and COPD resulting from the use of tobacco
products. She is seeking compensatory and unspecified punitive damages on behalf of a proposed class comprised of all smokers who have smoked a minimum of 25,000 cigarettes and have suffered, or suffer, from COPD, emphysema, heart disease, or cancer
as well as restitution of profits. We, our subsidiaries, and our indemnitees have been served with the complaint. Preliminary motions are pending.

In the fifth class action pending in Canada,

Semple v. Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers’ Council, et al.

,

The Supreme Court (trial court),
Nova Scotia, Canada

, filed June 18, 2009, we, our subsidiaries, and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria Group, Inc.), and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, an individual smoker, alleges his own addiction to tobacco
products and COPD resulting from the use of tobacco products. He is seeking compensatory and unspecified punitive damages on behalf of a proposed class comprised of all smokers, their estates, dependents and family members, as well as restitution of
profits, and reimbursement of government health care costs allegedly caused by tobacco products. We, our subsidiaries, and our indemnitees have been served with the complaint.

-19-


In the sixth class action pending in Canada,

Dorion v. Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers’
Council, et al., The Queen’s Bench, Alberta, Canada,

filed June 15, 2009, we, our subsidiaries, and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria Group, Inc.), and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, an individual smoker,
alleges her own addiction to tobacco products and chronic bronchitis and severe sinus infections resulting from the use of tobacco products. She is seeking compensatory and unspecified punitive damages on behalf of a proposed class comprised of all
smokers, their estates, dependents and family members, restitution of profits, and reimbursement of government health care costs allegedly caused by tobacco products. To date, we, our subsidiaries, and our indemnitees have not been properly served
with the complaint.

Health Care Cost Recovery
Litigation

: These cases, brought by governmental and non-governmental plaintiffs, seek reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products. Plaintiffs’ allegations of liability in these cases are based
on various theories of recovery including unjust enrichment, negligence, negligent design, strict liability, breach of express and implied warranties, violation of a voluntary undertaking or special duty, fraud, negligent misrepresentation,
conspiracy, public nuisance, defective product, failure to warn, sale of cigarettes to minors, and claims under statutes governing competition and deceptive trade practices. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief including
compensatory and other damages, and injunctive and equitable relief. Defenses raised in these cases include lack of proximate cause, remoteness of injury, failure to state a claim, adequate remedy at law, “unclean hands” (namely, that
plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief because they participated in, and benefited from, the sale of cigarettes), and statute of limitations.

As of February 15, 2010, there were a total of 10 health care cost recovery cases pending against us, our subsidiaries or indemnitees, compared
with 11 such cases on December 31, 2008, and 8 such cases on December 31, 2007, as follows:

•

4 cases brought against us, our subsidiaries and our indemnitees in Canada (3) and in Israel (1); and

•

6 cases brought in Nigeria (5) and Spain (1) against our subsidiaries.

In the first health care cost recovery case pending in Canada,

Her Majesty the Queen in Right of British Columbia v.
Imperial Tobacco Limited, et al., Supreme Court, British Columbia, Vancouver Registry, Canada,

filed January 24, 2001, we, our subsidiaries, our indemnitee (PM USA), and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, the
government of the province of British Columbia, brought a claim based upon legislation enacted by the province authorizing the government to file a direct action against cigarette manufacturers to recover the health care costs it has incurred, and
will incur, resulting from a “tobacco related wrong.” The Supreme Court has held that the statute is constitutional. We and certain other non-Canadian defendants challenged the jurisdiction of the court. The court rejected the
jurisdictional challenge. Pre-trial discovery is ongoing. The court has set September 2011 as the target trial date.

In the second health care cost recovery case filed in Canada,

Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Brunswick v. Rothmans Inc., et al., Court of
Queen’s Bench of New Brunswick, Trial Court, New Brunswick, Fredericton, Canada,

filed March 13, 2008, we, our subsidiaries, our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria Group, Inc.), and other members of the industry are defendants. The claim
was filed by the government of the province of New Brunswick based on legislation enacted in the province. This legislation is similar to the law introduced in British Columbia that authorizes the government to file a direct action against cigarette
manufacturers to recover the health care costs it has incurred, and will incur, as a result of a “tobacco related wrong.” Our subsidiaries, indemnitees, and we have been served with the complaint. Preliminary motions are pending.

-20-


In the third health care cost recovery case filed in Canada,

Her Majesty the Queen in Right of
Ontario v. Rothmans Inc., et al., Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Toronto, Canada

, filed September 29, 2009, we, our subsidiaries, our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria Group, Inc.), and other members of the industry are defendants. The
claim was filed by the government of the province of Ontario based on legislation enacted in the province. This legislation is similar to the laws introduced in British Columbia and New Brunswick that authorize the government to file a direct action
against cigarette manufacturers to recover the health care costs it has incurred, and will incur, as a result of a “tobacco related wrong.” Our subsidiaries, indemnitees, and we have been served with the complaint. Preliminary motions are
pending.

In the case in Israel,

Kupat Holim Clalit v.
Philip Morris USA, et al., Jerusalem District Court, Israel,

filed September 28, 1998, we, our subsidiary, and our indemnitee (PM USA), together with other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, a private health care
provider, brought a claim seeking reimbursement of the cost of treating its members for alleged smoking-related illnesses for the years 1990 to 1998. Certain defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case. The motion was rejected, and those
defendants filed a motion with the Israel Supreme Court for leave to appeal. The appeal was heard by the Supreme Court in March 2005, and the parties are awaiting the court’s decision.

In the first case in Nigeria,

The Attorney General of Lagos State v.
British American Tobacco (Nigeria) Limited, et al., High Court of Lagos State, Lagos, Nigeria,

filed April 30, 2007, our subsidiary and other members of the industry are defendants. Plaintiff seeks reimbursement for the cost of treating
alleged smoking-related diseases for the past 20 years, payment of anticipated costs of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the next 20 years, various forms of injunctive relief, plus punitive damages. In February 2008, our subsidiary was
served with a Notice of Discontinuance. The claim was formally dismissed in March 2008. However, the plaintiff has since refiled its claim. Our subsidiary has been served with the refiled complaint, but is contesting service. We currently conduct no
business in Nigeria.

In the second case in Nigeria,

The
Attorney General of Kano State v. British American Tobacco (Nigeria) Limited, et al., High Court of Kano State, Kano, Nigeria,

filed May 9, 2007, our subsidiary and other members of the industry are defendants. Plaintiff seeks reimbursement
for the cost of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the past 20 years, payment of anticipated costs of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the next 20 years, various forms of injunctive relief, plus punitive damages. The case is
in the early stages of litigation, and the defendants have filed various preliminary motions, upon which the court is yet to rule. Our subsidiary has been served with the complaint, but is contesting service.

In the third case in Nigeria,

The Attorney General of Gombe State v.
British American Tobacco (Nigeria) Limited, et al., High Court of Gombe State, Gombe, Nigeria,

filed May 18, 2007, our subsidiary and other members of the industry are defendants

.

Plaintiff seeks reimbursement for the cost of
treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the past 20 years, payment of anticipated costs of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the next 20 years, various forms of injunctive relief, plus punitive damages. In July 2008, the court
dismissed the case against all defendants based on the plaintiff’s failure to comply with various procedural requirements when filing and serving the claim. The plaintiff did not appeal the dismissal. However, in October 2008, the plaintiff
refiled its claim. In February 2010, the plaintiff attempted service of process on Philip Morris International Inc. We anticipate filing preliminary and service objections.

In the fourth case in Nigeria,

The Attorney General of Oyo State, et al., v. British American Tobacco (Nigeria)
Limited, et al., High Court of Oyo State, Ibadan, Nigeria,

filed May 25, 2007, our subsidiary and other members of the industry are defendants

.

Plaintiffs seek reimbursement for the cost of treating alleged smoking-related diseases
for the past 20 years, payment of anticipated costs of

treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the next 20 years, various forms of injunctive relief, plus punitive damages. The case is in the early stages of litigation, and the defendants have

In the fifth case in Nigeria,

The Attorney General of Ogun State v. British American Tobacco (Nigeria) Limited, et al., High Court of Ogun State,
Abeokuta, Nigeria

, filed February 26, 2008, our subsidiary and other members of the industry are defendants. Plaintiff seeks reimbursement for the cost of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the past 20 years, payment of
anticipated costs of treating alleged smoking-related diseases for the next 20 years, various forms of injunctive relief, plus punitive damages. Our subsidiary was served with notice of the claim in December 2008, but is contesting service.

In the series of proceedings in Spain,

Junta de
Andalucia, et al. v. Philip Morris Spain, et al., Court of First Instance, Madrid, Spain,

the first of which was filed February 21, 2002, our subsidiary and other members of the industry were defendants. The plaintiffs sought reimbursement
for the cost of treating certain of their citizens for various smoking-related illnesses. In May 2004, the first instance court dismissed the initial case, finding that the State was a necessary party to the claim, and thus, the claim must be filed
in the Administrative Court. The plaintiffs appealed. In February 2006, the appellate court affirmed the lower court’s dismissal. The plaintiffs then filed notice that they intended to pursue their claim in the Administrative Court against the
State. Because they were defendants in the original proceeding, our subsidiary and other members of the industry filed notices with the Administrative Court that they are interested parties in the case. In September 2007, the plaintiffs filed their
complaint in the Administrative Court. In November 2007, the Administrative Court dismissed the claim based on a procedural issue. The plaintiffs asked the Administrative Court to reconsider its decision dismissing the case, and that request was
rejected in a ruling rendered in February 2008. Plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court rejected plaintiffs’ appeal in November 2009, resulting in the final dismissal of the claim. However, plaintiffs have filed a second
claim in the Administrative Court against the Ministry of Economy. This second claim seeks the same relief as the original claim, but relies on a different procedural posture. The Administrative Court has recognized our subsidiary as a party in this
proceeding.

Lights Cases

: These cases, brought
by individual plaintiffs, or on behalf of a class of individual plaintiffs, allege that the use of the term “lights” constitutes fraudulent and misleading conduct. Plaintiffs’ allegations of liability in these cases are based on
various theories of recovery including misrepresentation, deception, and breach of consumer protection laws. Plaintiffs seek various forms of relief including restitution, injunctive relief, and compensatory and other damages. Defenses raised
include lack of causation, lack of reliance, assumption of the risk, and statute of limitations.

As of February 15, 2010, there were a number of lights cases pending against our subsidiaries or indemnitees, as follows:

•

3 cases brought on behalf of various classes of individual plaintiffs (some overlapping) in Israel, compared with 3 such cases on December 31, 2008, and 2
such cases on December 31, 2007; and

•

1,964 cases brought by individuals against our subsidiaries in the equivalent of small claims courts in Italy, where the maximum damages claimed are
approximately one thousand Euros per case, compared with 2,010 such cases on December 31, 2008, and 2,026 such cases on December 31, 2007.

In one class action pending in Israel,

El-Roy, et al. v. Philip Morris Incorporated, et al., District Court of
Tel-Aviv/Jaffa, Israel,

filed January 18, 2004, our subsidiary and our indemnitees (PM USA and our former importer Menache H. Eliachar Ltd.) are defendants. The plaintiffs filed a purported class

-22-


action claiming that the class members were misled by the descriptor “lights” into believing that lights cigarettes are safer than full flavor cigarettes. The claim seeks recovery of
the purchase price of lights cigarettes and compensation for distress for each class member. Hearings took place in November and December 2008 regarding whether the case meets the legal requirements necessary to allow it to proceed as a class
action. The parties’ briefing on class certification is scheduled to be completed in June 2010.

The claims in a second class action pending in Israel,

Navon, et al. v. Philip Morris Products USA, et al., District Court of Tel-Aviv/Jaffa,
Israel

El-Roy,

and the case is currently stayed pending a ruling on class
certification in

El-Roy

.

In the third class action
pending in Israel,

Numberg, et al. v. Philip Morris Products S.A., et al., District Court of Tel Aviv/Jaffa, Israel,

filed May 19, 2008, our subsidiaries and our indemnitee (our distributor M.H. Eliashar Distribution Ltd.) and other
members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiffs filed a purported class action claiming that the class members were misled by pack colors, terms such as “slims” or “super slims” or “blue,” and text describing tar
and nicotine yields. Plaintiffs allege that these pack features misled consumers to believe that the cigarettes with those descriptors are safer than full flavor cigarettes. Plaintiffs seek recovery of the price of the brands at issue that were
purchased from December 31, 2004 to the date of filing of the claim. They also seek compensation for mental anguish, punitive damages and injunctive relief. Our subsidiaries and our indemnitee have been served with the claim. Defendants filed
their oppositions to class certification in March 2009.

Public Civil Actions

: Claims have been filed either by an individual, or a public or private entity, seeking to protect collective or individual rights, such as the right to health, the right to information or the right to safety.
Plaintiffs’ allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery including product defect, concealment, and misrepresentation. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief including injunctive relief such
as banning cigarettes, descriptors, smoking in certain places and advertising, as well as implementing communication campaigns and reimbursement of medical expenses incurred by public or private institutions.

As of February 15, 2010, there were 11 public civil actions pending

Plaintiff seeks the suspension of the defendants’ licenses to manufacture cigarettes, the revocation of any import licenses for tobacco-related products, the collection of all tobacco-containing products from the market, and a daily fine
amounting to R$1 million (approximately $540,000) for any violation of the injunction order. Our subsidiary filed its answer in June 2004. In January 2010, the court dismissed the case. Plaintiff may appeal.

In the antitrust class action in Kansas,

Smith v. Philip Morris Companies Inc., et al., District Court of Seward County, Kansas

Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers’ Marketing Board, et al. v. Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc., Superior Court of Justice, London,

tobacco growers and their related associations) concerning the sale and purchase of flue-cured tobacco from January 1, 1986 to December 31, 1996. Plaintiffs allege that our subsidiary was required by the contracts to disclose to plaintiffs
the quantity of tobacco included in cigarettes to be sold for duty free and export purposes (which it purchased at a lower price per pound than tobacco that was included in cigarettes to be sold in Canada), but failed to disclose that some of the
cigarettes it designated as being for export and duty free purposes were ultimately sold in Canada. Our subsidiary has been served, but there is currently no deadline to respond to the statement of claim.

Guarantees

At December 31, 2009, our third-party guarantees were $5 million,
which will expire through 2013, with $2 million guarantees expiring during 2010. We are required to perform under these guarantees in the event that a third party fails to make contractual payments. We do not have a liability on our consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2009, as the fair value of these guarantees is insignificant due to the fact that the probability of future payments under these guarantees is remote.

Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement between Altria and us, liabilities concerning tobacco products will be
allocated based in substantial part on the manufacturer. We will indemnify Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by us or contract manufactured for us by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify us for liabilities
related to tobacco products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for us. We do not have a liability recorded on our balance sheet at December 31, 2009, as the fair value of this indemnification is
insignificant since the probability of future payments under this indemnification is remote.
