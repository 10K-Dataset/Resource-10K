Item 1.

Business.

M&T Bank Corporation (“Registrant” or
    “M&T”) is a New York business corporation which
    is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding
    Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”) and under

Article III-A

of the New York Banking Law (“Banking Law”). The
    principal executive offices of the Registrant are located at One
    M&T Plaza, Buffalo, New York 14203. The Registrant was
    incorporated in November 1969. The Registrant and its direct and
    indirect subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the
    “Company.” As of December 31, 2009 the Company
    had consolidated total assets of $68.9 billion, deposits of
    $47.4 billion and stockholders’ equity of
    $7.8 billion. The Company had 12,802 full-time and
    1,424 part-time employees as of December 31, 2009.

At December 31, 2009, the Registrant had two wholly owned
    bank subsidiaries: M&T Bank and M&T Bank, National
    Association (“M&T Bank, N.A.”). The banks
    collectively offer a wide range of commercial banking, trust and
    investment services to their customers. At December 31,
    2009, M&T Bank represented 99% of consolidated assets of
    the Company. M&T Bank operates branch offices in New York,
    Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Virginia, West
    Virginia and the District of Columbia.

The Company from time to time considers acquiring banks, thrift
    institutions, branch offices of banks or thrift institutions, or
    other businesses within markets currently served by the Company
    or in other locations that would complement the Company’s
    business or its geographic reach. The Company has pursued
    acquisition opportunities in the past, continues to review
    different opportunities, including the possibility of major
    acquisitions, and intends to continue this practice.

Relationship
    With Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c.

On April 1, 2003, M&T completed the acquisition of
    Allfirst Financial Inc. (“Allfirst”), a bank holding
    company headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland from Allied Irish
    Banks, p.l.c. (“AIB”). Under the terms of the
    Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated September 26,
    2002 by and among AIB, Allfirst and M&T (the
    “Reorganization Agreement”), M&T combined with
    Allfirst through the acquisition of all of the issued and
    outstanding Allfirst stock in exchange for
    26,700,000 shares of M&T common stock and $886,107,000
    in cash paid to AIB. In addition, there were several M&T
    corporate governance changes that resulted from the transaction.
    While it maintains a significant ownership in M&T, AIB will
    have representation on the M&T board, the M&T Bank
    board and key M&T board committees and will have certain
    protections of its rights as a substantial M&T shareholder.
    In addition, AIB will have rights that will facilitate its
    ability to maintain its proportionate ownership position in
    M&T. M&T will also have representation on the AIB
    board while AIB remains a significant shareholder. The following
    is a description of the ongoing relationship between M&T
    and AIB. The following description is qualified in its entirety
    by the terms of the Reorganization Agreement. The Reorganization
    Agreement was filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on
    October 3, 2002 as Exhibit 2 to the Current Report on

Form 8-K

of M&T dated September 26, 2002.

Board of
    Directors; Management

At December 31, 2009, AIB held approximately 22.6% of the
    issued and outstanding shares of M&T common stock. In
    defining their relationship after the acquisition, M&T and
    AIB negotiated certain agreements regarding share ownership and
    corporate governance issues such as board representation, with
    the number of AIB’s representatives on the M&T and
    M&T Bank boards of directors being dependent upon the
    amount of M&T common stock held by AIB. M&T has the
    right to one seat on the AIB board of directors until AIB no
    longer holds at least 15% of the outstanding shares of M&T
    common stock. Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, AIB has
    the right to name four members to serve on the Boards of
    Directors of M&T and M&T Bank, each of whom must be
    reasonably acceptable to M&T (collectively, the “AIB
    Designees”). Further, one of the AIB Designees will serve
    on each of the Executive Committee, Nomination, Compensation and
    Governance Committee, and Audit and Risk Committee (or any
    committee or committees performing comparable functions) of the
    M&T board of directors. In order to serve, the AIB
    Designees must meet the requisite independence and expertise
    requirements prescribed under applicable law or stock exchange
    rules. In addition, the Reorganization Agreement provides that
    the board of directors of M&T Bank will include four
    members designated by AIB, each of whom must be reasonably
    acceptable to M&T.



As long as AIB remains a significant shareholder of M&T,
    AIB will have representation on the boards of directors of both
    M&T and M&T Bank as follows:

•

As long as AIB holds at least 15% of the outstanding shares of
    M&T common stock, AIB will be entitled to designate four
    persons on both the M&T and M&T Bank boards of
    directors and representation on the committees of the M&T
    board described above.

•

If AIB holds at least 10%, but less than 15%, of the outstanding
    shares of M&T common stock, AIB will be entitled to
    designate at least two people on both the M&T and M&T
    Bank boards of directors.

•

If AIB’s ownership interest in M&T is at least 5%, but
    less than 10%, of the outstanding shares of M&T common
    stock, AIB will be entitled to designate at least one person on
    both the M&T and M&T Bank boards of directors.

•

As long as AIB holds at least 15% of the outstanding shares of
    M&T common stock, neither M&T’s board of
    directors nor M&T Bank’s board of directors will
    consist of more than twenty-eight directors without the consent
    of the AIB Designees.

•

If AIB’s holdings of M&T common stock fall below 15%,
    but not lower than 12% of the outstanding shares of M&T
    common stock, AIB will continue to have the same rights that it
    would have had if it owned 15% of the outstanding shares of
    M&T common stock, as long as AIB restores its ownership
    percentage to 15% within one year. Additionally, as described in
    more detail below, M&T has agreed to repurchase shares of
    M&T common stock in order to offset dilution to AIB’s
    ownership interests that may otherwise be caused by issuances of
    M&T common stock under M&T employee and director
    benefit or stock purchase plans. Dilution of AIB’s
    ownership position caused by such issuances will not be counted
    in determining whether the “Sunset Date” has occurred
    or whether any of AIB’s other rights under the
    Reorganization Agreement have terminated. The “Sunset
    Date” is the date on which AIB no longer holds at least 15%
    of M&T common stock, calculated as described in this
    paragraph.

The AIB Designees at December 31, 2009 were Michael D.
    Buckley, Colm E. Doherty, Richard G. King and Eugene J. Sheehy.
    Mr. Buckley serves as a member of the Executive Committee
    and the Nomination, Compensation and Governance Committee, and
    Mr. King serves as a member of the Audit and Risk
    Committee. Robert G. Wilmers, Chairman of the Board and Chief
    Executive Officer of M&T, is a member of the AIB board of
    directors.

Amendments
    to M&T’s Bylaws

Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, M&T amended and
    restated its bylaws. The following is a description of the
    amended bylaws:

The amended bylaws provide that until the Sunset Date, the
    M&T board of directors may not take or make any
    recommendation to M&T’s shareholders regarding the
    following actions without the approval of the Executive
    Committee, including the approval of the AIB Designee serving on
    the committee:

•

Any amendment of M&T’s Certificate of Incorporation or
    bylaws that would be inconsistent with the rights described
    herein or that would otherwise have an adverse effect on the
    board representation, committee representation or other rights
    of AIB contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement;

•

Any activity not permissible for a U.S. bank holding
    company;

•

The adoption of any shareholder rights plan or other measures
    having the purpose or effect of preventing or materially
    delaying completion of any transaction involving a change in
    control of M&T; and

•

Any public announcement disclosing M&T’s desire or
    intention to take any of the foregoing actions.

The amended bylaws also provide that until the Sunset Date, the
    M&T board of directors may only take or make any
    recommendation to M&T’s shareholders regarding the
    following actions if the action has been approved by the
    Executive Committee (in the case of the first four items and
    sixth item below) or Nomination, Compensation and Governance
    Committee (in the case of the fifth item below)



and the members of such committee not voting in favor of the
    action do not include the AIB Designee serving on such committee
    and at least one other member of the committee who is not an AIB
    Designee:

•

Any reduction in M&T’s cash dividend policy such that
    the ratio of cash dividends to net income is less than 15%, or
    any extraordinary dividends or distributions to holders of
    M&T common stock;

•

Any acquisition of any assets or businesses, (1) if the
    consideration is in M&T common stock, where the stock
    consideration paid by M&T exceeds 10% of the aggregate
    voting power of M&T common stock and (2) if the
    consideration is cash, M&T stock or other consideration,
    where the fair market value of the consideration paid by
    M&T exceeds 10% of the market capitalization of M&T,
    as determined under the Reorganization Agreement;

•

Any sale of any assets or businesses in which the value of the
    aggregate consideration to be received exceeds 10% of the market
    capitalization of M&T, as determined under the
    Reorganization Agreement;

•

Any liquidation or dissolution of M&T;

•

The appointment or election of the Chairman of the board of
    directors or the Chief Executive Officer of M&T; and

•

Any public announcement disclosing M&T’s desire or
    intention to take any of the foregoing actions prior to
    obtaining the requisite committee approval.

The provisions of the bylaws described above may not be amended
    or repealed without the unanimous approval of the entire
    M&T board of directors or the approval of the holders of
    not less than 80% of the outstanding shares of M&T common
    stock. The provisions of the bylaws described above will
    automatically terminate when AIB holds less than 5% of the
    outstanding shares of M&T common stock.

Investment
    Parameters

The Reorganization Agreement provides that through the second
    anniversary of the Sunset Date, without prior written consent of
    the M&T board of directors, AIB will not, directly or
    indirectly, acquire or offer to acquire (except by way of stock
    dividends, offerings made available to M&T shareholders
    generally, or pursuant to compensation plans) more than 25% of
    the then outstanding shares of M&T common stock. Further,
    during this period, AIB and AIB’s subsidiaries have agreed
    not to participate in any proxy solicitation or to otherwise
    seek to influence any M&T shareholder with respect to the
    voting of any shares of M&T common stock for the approval
    of any shareholder proposals.

The Reorganization Agreement also provides that, during this
    period, AIB will not make any public announcement with respect
    to any proposal or offer by AIB or any AIB subsidiary with
    respect to certain transactions (such as mergers, business
    combinations, tender or exchange offers, the sale or purchase of
    securities or similar transactions) involving M&T or any of
    the M&T subsidiaries. The Reorganization Agreement also
    provides that, during this period, AIB may not subject any
    shares of M&T common stock to any voting trust or voting
    arrangement or agreement and will not execute any written
    consent as a shareholder with respect to the M&T common
    stock.

The Reorganization Agreement also provides that, during this
    period, AIB will not seek to control or influence the
    management, the board of directors or policies of M&T,
    including through communications with shareholders of M&T
    or otherwise, except through non-public communications with the
    directors of M&T, including the AIB Designees.

These restrictions on AIB will no longer apply if a third party
    commences or announces its intention to commence a tender offer
    or an exchange offer and, within a reasonable time, the M&T
    board of directors either does not recommend that shareholders
    not accept the offer or fails to adopt a shareholders rights
    plan, or if M&T or M&T Bank becomes subject to any
    regulatory capital directive or becomes an institution in
    “troubled” condition under applicable banking
    regulations. However, in the event the tender offer or exchange
    offer is not commenced or consummated in accordance with its
    terms, the restrictions on AIB described above will thereafter
    continue to apply.

Anti-Dilution
    Protections

M&T has agreed that until the Sunset Date, in the event
    M&T issues shares of M&T stock (other than certain
    issuances to employees pursuant to option and benefit plans),
    subject to applicable law and



regulatory requirements, AIB will have the right to purchase at
    fair market value up to the number of shares of M&T common
    stock required to increase or maintain its equity interest in
    M&T to 22.5% of the then outstanding M&T common stock.

M&T has also agreed that until the Sunset Date, in
    connection with any issuance of M&T stock pursuant to
    employee option or benefit plans, M&T will as soon as
    reasonably practicable, taking into account applicable law,
    regulatory capital requirements, capital planning and risk
    management, take such necessary actions so that AIB’s
    proportionate ownership of M&T common stock is not reduced
    as a result of such issuances, including by funding such
    issuances through purchases of M&T common stock in the open
    market or by undertaking share repurchase programs.

Sale of
    M&T Common Stock; Right of First Refusal in Certain
    Circumstances

The M&T common stock issued to AIB was not registered under
    the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and
    may only be disposed of by AIB pursuant to an effective
    registration statement or pursuant to an exemption from
    registration under the Securities Act and subject to the
    provisions of the Reorganization Agreement.

M&T and AIB have entered into a registration rights
    agreement that provides that upon AIB’s request, M&T
    will file a registration statement relating to all or a portion
    of AIB’s shares of M&T common stock providing for the
    sale of such shares by AIB from time to time on a continuous
    basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act,
    provided that M&T need only effect one such “shelf
    registration” in any

12-month

period. In addition, the registration rights agreement provides
    that AIB is entitled to demand registration under the Securities
    Act of all or part of its shares of M&T stock, provided
    that M&T is not obligated to effect two such “demand
    registrations” in any

12-month

period. Any demand or shelf registration must cover no less than
    one million shares.

The registration rights agreement further provides that in the
    event M&T proposes to file a registration statement other
    than pursuant to a shelf registration or demand registration or

Forms S-8

or

S-4,

for
    an offering and sale of shares by M&T in an underwritten
    offering or an offering and sale of shares on behalf of one or
    more selling shareholders, M&T must give AIB notice at
    least 15 days prior to the anticipated filing date, and AIB
    may request that all or a portion of its M&T common shares
    be included in the registration statement. M&T will honor
    the request, unless the managing underwriter advises M&T in
    writing that in its opinion the inclusion of all shares
    requested to be included by M&T, the other selling
    shareholders, if any, and AIB would materially and adversely
    affect the offering, in which case M&T may limit the number
    of shares included in the offering to a number that would not
    reasonably be expected to have such an effect. In such event,
    the number of shares to be included in the registration
    statement shall first include the number of shares requested to
    be included by M&T and then the shares requested by other
    selling shareholders, including AIB, on a pro rata basis
    according to the number of shares requested to be included in
    the registration statement by each shareholder.

As long as AIB holds 5% or more of the outstanding shares of
    M&T common stock, AIB will not dispose of any of its shares
    of M&T common stock except, subject to the terms and
    conditions of the Reorganization Agreement and applicable law,
    in a widely dispersed public distribution; a private placement
    in which no one party acquires the right to purchase more than
    2% of the outstanding shares of M&T common stock; an
    assignment to a single party (such as a broker or investment
    banker) for the purpose of conducting a widely dispersed public
    distribution on AIB’s behalf; pursuant to Rule 144
    under the Securities Act; pursuant to a tender or exchange offer
    to M&T’s shareholders not opposed by M&T’s
    board of directors, or open market purchase programs made by
    M&T; with the consent of M&T, which consent will not
    be unreasonably withheld, to a controlled subsidiary of AIB; or
    pursuant to M&T’s right of first refusal as described
    below.

The Reorganization Agreement provides that until AIB no longer
    holds at least 5% of the outstanding shares of M&T common
    stock, if AIB wishes to sell or otherwise transfer any of its
    shares of M&T common stock other than as described in the
    preceding paragraph, AIB must first submit an offer notice to
    M&T identifying the proposed transferee and setting forth
    the proposed terms of the transaction, which shall be limited to
    sales for cash, cash equivalents or marketable securities.
    M&T will have the right, for 20 days following receipt
    of an offer notice from AIB, to purchase all (but not less than
    all) of the shares of M&T common stock that AIB wishes to
    sell, on the proposed terms specified in



the offer notice. If M&T declines or fails to respond to
    the offer notice within 20 days, AIB may sell all or a
    portion of the M&T shares specified in the offer notice to
    the proposed transferee at a purchase price equal to or greater
    than the price specified in the offer notice, at any time during
    the three months following the date of the offer notice, or, if
    prior notification to or approval of the sale by the Federal
    Reserve Board or another regulatory agency is required, AIB
    shall pursue regulatory approval expeditiously and the sale may
    occur on the first date permitted under applicable law.

Certain
    Post-Closing Bank Regulatory Matters

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
    (“Federal Reserve Board”) deems AIB to be
    M&T’s bank holding company for purposes of the BHCA.
    In addition, the New York Banking Superintendent (“Banking
    Superintendent”) deems AIB to be M&T’s bank
    holding company for purposes of

Article III-A

of the Banking Law. Among other things, this means that, should
    M&T propose to make an acquisition or engage in a new type
    of activity that requires the submission of an application or
    notice to the Federal Reserve Board or the Banking
    Superintendent, AIB, as well as M&T, may also be required
    to file an application or notice. The Reorganization Agreement
    generally provides that AIB will make any applications, notices
    or filings that M&T determines to be necessary or
    desirable. The Reorganization Agreement also requires AIB not to
    take any action that would have a material adverse effect on
    M&T and to advise M&T prior to entering into any
    material transaction or activity. These provisions of the
    Reorganization Agreement would no longer apply if AIB ceased to
    be M&T’s bank holding company and also was not
    otherwise considered to control M&T for purposes of the
    BHCA.

Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, if, as a result of any
    administrative enforcement action under Section 8 of the
    Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDI Act”),
    memorandum of understanding, written agreement, supervisory
    letter or any other action or determination of any regulatory
    agency relating to the status of AIB (but not relating to the
    conduct of M&T or any subsidiary of M&T), M&T or
    M&T Bank also becomes subject to such an action,
    memorandum, agreement or letter that relates to M&T or any
    M&T subsidiary, or experiences any fact, event or
    circumstance that affects M&T’s regulatory status or
    compliance, and that in either case would be reasonably likely
    to create a material burden on M&T or to cause any material
    adverse economic or operating consequences to M&T or an
    M&T subsidiary (a “Material Regulatory Event”),
    then M&T will notify AIB thereof in writing as promptly as
    practicable. Should AIB fail to cure the Material Regulatory
    Event within 90 days following the receipt of such notice,
    AIB will, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than
    30 days from the end of the cure period, take any and all
    such actions (with the reasonable cooperation of M&T as
    requested by AIB) as may be necessary or advisable in order that
    it no longer has “control” of M&T for purposes of
    the BHCA, including, if necessary, by selling some or all of its
    shares of M&T common stock (subject to the right of first
    refusal provisions of the Reorganization Agreement) and
    divesting itself as required of its board and committee
    representation and governance rights as set forth in the
    Reorganization Agreement. If, at the end of such

30-day

period, the Material Regulatory Event is continuing and AIB has
    not terminated its control of M&T, then M&T will have
    the right to repurchase, at fair market value, such amount of
    the M&T common stock owned by AIB as would result in AIB
    holding no less than 4.9% of the outstanding shares of M&T
    common stock, pursuant to the procedures detailed in the
    Reorganization Agreement.

As long as AIB is considered to “control” M&T for
    purposes of the BHCA or the federal Change in Bank Control Act,
    if AIB acquires any insured depository institution with total
    assets greater than 25% of the assets of M&T’s largest
    insured depository institution subsidiary, then within two years
    AIB must terminate its affiliation with the insured depository
    institution or take such steps as may be necessary so that none
    of M&T’s bank subsidiaries would be subject to
    “cross guarantee” liability for losses incurred if the
    institution AIB acquired potentially were to fail. This
    liability applies under the FDI Act to insured depository
    institutions that are commonly controlled. The actions AIB would
    take could include disposing of shares of M&T common stock

and/or

surrendering its representation or governance rights. Also, if
    such an insured depository institution that is controlled by AIB
    and of the size described in the first sentence of this
    paragraph that would be considered to be commonly controlled
    with M&T’s insured depository institution subsidiaries
    fails to meet applicable requirements to be “adequately
    capitalized” under applicable U.S. banking laws, then
    AIB will have to take the actions described in the previous



sentence no later than 180 days after the date that the
    institution failed to meet those requirements, unless the
    institution is sooner returned to “adequately
    capitalized” status.

Segment
    Information, Principal Products/Services and Foreign
    Operations

Information about the Registrant’s business segments is
    included in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements filed
    herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data” and is further discussed
    in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.” The Registrant’s reportable segments have
    been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting
    system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain
    strategic business units have been combined for segment
    information reporting purposes where the nature of the products
    and services, the type of customer and the distribution of those
    products and services are similar. The reportable segments are
    Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate,
    Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail
    Banking. The Company’s international activities are
    discussed in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements filed
    herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data.”



The only activities that, as a class, contributed 10% or more of
    the sum of consolidated interest income and other income in any
    of the last three years were interest on loans and investment
    securities and fees for providing deposit account services. The
    amount of income from such sources during those years is set
    forth on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income
    filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Supervision
    and Regulation of the Company

The banking industry is subject to extensive state and federal
    regulation and continues to undergo significant change. The
    following discussion summarizes certain aspects of the banking
    laws and regulations that affect the Company. Proposals to
    change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry
    are frequently raised in Congress, in state legislatures, and
    before the various bank regulatory agencies. The likelihood and
    timing of any changes and the impact such changes might have on
    the Company are impossible to determine with any certainty. A
    change in applicable laws or regulations, or a change in the way
    such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies
    or courts, may have a material impact on the business,
    operations and earnings of the Company. To the extent that the
    following information describes statutory or regulatory
    provisions, it is qualified entirely by reference to the
    particular statutory or regulatory provision.

Financial
    Services Modernization

Under the BHCA, bank holding companies are permitted to offer
    their customers virtually any type of financial service that is
    financial in nature or incidental thereto, including banking,
    securities underwriting, insurance (both underwriting and
    agency), and merchant banking.

In order to engage in these financial activities, a bank holding
    company must qualify and register with the Federal Reserve Board
    as a “financial holding company” by demonstrating that
    each of its bank subsidiaries is “well capitalized,”
    “well managed,” and has at least a
    “satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment
    Act of 1977 (“CRA”). To date, M&T has not elected
    to register as a financial holding company. For as long as AIB
    owns at least 15% of M&T’s outstanding common stock,
    M&T may not become a financial holding company without the
    approval of the Executive Committee of the M&T board of
    directors, which must also include the affirmative approval of
    the AIB Designee on such committee, as described above under the
    caption “Amendments to M&T’s Bylaws.”

The financial activities authorized by the BHCA may also be
    engaged in by a “financial subsidiary” of a national
    or state bank, except for insurance or annuity underwriting,
    insurance company portfolio investments, real estate investment
    and development, and merchant banking, which must be conducted
    in a financial holding company. In order for these financial
    activities to be engaged in by a financial subsidiary of a
    national or state bank, federal law requires each of the parent
    bank (and its sister-bank affiliates) to be well capitalized and
    well managed; the aggregate consolidated assets of all of that
    bank’s financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of
    45% of its consolidated total assets or $50 billion; the
    bank must have at least a satisfactory CRA rating; and, if that
    bank is one of the 100 largest national banks, it must meet
    certain financial rating or other comparable requirements.
    M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. have not elected to engage
    in financial activities through financial subsidiaries. Current
    federal law also establishes a system of functional regulation
    under which the federal banking agencies will regulate the
    banking activities of financial holding companies and
    banks’ financial subsidiaries, the U.S. Securities and
    Exchange Commission will regulate their securities activities,
    and state insurance regulators will regulate their insurance
    activities. Rules developed by the federal financial
    institutions regulators under these laws require disclosure of
    privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow
    consumers to prevent the disclosure of certain personal
    information to nonaffiliated third parties.

Bank
    Holding Company Regulation

As a registered bank holding company, the Registrant and its
    nonbank subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation
    under the BHCA by the Federal Reserve Board and under the
    Banking Law by the Banking Superintendent. The Federal Reserve
    Board requires regular reports from the Registrant and is
    authorized by the BHCA to make regular examinations of the
    Registrant and its subsidiaries.



The Registrant may not acquire direct or indirect ownership or
    control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company,
    including a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal
    Reserve Board, except as specifically authorized under the BHCA.
    The Registrant is also subject to regulation under the Banking
    Law with respect to certain acquisitions of domestic banks.
    Under the BHCA, the Registrant, subject to the approval of the
    Federal Reserve Board, may acquire shares of non-banking
    corporations the activities of which are deemed by the Federal
    Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or
    controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.

The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement powers over bank
    holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries, among
    other things, to interdict activities that represent unsafe or
    unsound practices or constitute violations of law, rule,
    regulation, administrative orders or written agreements with a
    federal bank regulator. These powers may be exercised through
    the issuance of

cease-and-desist

orders, civil money penalties or other actions.

Under the Federal Reserve Board’s statement of policy with
    respect to bank holding company operations, a bank holding
    company is required to serve as a source of financial strength
    to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit all
    available resources to support such institutions in
    circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy.
    Although this “source of strength” policy has been
    challenged in litigation, the Federal Reserve Board continues to
    take the position that it has authority to enforce it. For a
    discussion of circumstances under which a bank holding company
    may be required to guarantee the capital levels or performance
    of its subsidiary banks, see “Capital Adequacy,”
    below. Consistent with this “source of strength”
    policy, the Federal Reserve Board takes the position that a bank
    holding company generally should not maintain a rate of cash
    dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders
    has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the
    prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent
    with the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall
    financial condition. The Federal Reserve also has the authority
    to terminate any activity of a bank holding company that
    constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or
    stability of any subsidiary depository institution or to
    terminate its control of any bank or nonbank subsidiaries.

The BHCA generally permits bank holding companies to acquire
    banks in any state, and preempts all state laws restricting the
    ownership by a bank holding company of banks in more than one
    state. The FDI Act also permits a bank to merge with an

out-of-state

bank and convert any offices into branches of the resulting bank
    if both states have not opted out of interstate branching;
    permits a bank to acquire branches from an

out-of-state

bank if the law of the state where the branches are located
    permits the interstate branch acquisition; and permits banks to
    establish and operate de novo interstate branches whenever the
    host state opts-in to de novo branching. Bank holding companies
    and banks seeking to engage in transactions authorized by these
    laws must be adequately capitalized and managed.

The Banking Law authorizes interstate branching by merger or
    acquisition on a reciprocal basis, and permits the acquisition
    of a single branch without restriction, but does not provide for
    de novo interstate branching.

Bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks are also
    subject to the provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of the
    CRA, the Federal Reserve Board (or other appropriate bank
    regulatory agency) is required, in connection with its
    examination of a bank, to assess such bank’s record in
    meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that bank,
    including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. During these
    examinations, the Federal Reserve Board (or other appropriate
    bank regulatory agency) rates such bank’s compliance with
    the CRA as “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,”
    “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial
    Noncompliance.” The failure of a bank to receive at least a
    “Satisfactory” rating could inhibit such bank or its
    bank holding company from undertaking certain activities,
    including acquisitions of other financial institutions or
    opening or relocating a branch office, as further discussed
    below. M&T Bank has a CRA rating of “Outstanding”
    and M&T Bank, N.A. has a CRA rating of
    “Satisfactory.” Furthermore, such assessment is also
    required of any bank that has applied, among other things, to
    merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the
    liabilities of a federally-regulated financial institution, or
    to open or relocate a branch office. In the case of a bank
    holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or bank
    holding company, the Federal Reserve Board will assess the
    record of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding
    company in considering the application. The Banking



Law contains provisions similar to the CRA which are applicable
    to New York-chartered banks. M&T Bank has a CRA rating of
    “Outstanding” as determined by the New York State
    Banking Department.

Supervision
    and Regulation of Bank Subsidiaries

The Registrant’s bank subsidiaries are subject to
    supervision and regulation, and are examined regularly, by
    various bank regulatory agencies: M&T Bank by the Federal
    Reserve Board and the Banking Superintendent; and M&T Bank,
    N.A. by the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). The
    Registrant and its direct non-banking subsidiaries are
    affiliates, within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, of
    the Registrant’s subsidiary banks and their subsidiaries.
    As a result, the Registrant’s subsidiary banks and their
    subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on loans or extensions
    of credit to, purchases of assets from, investments in, and
    transactions with the Registrant and its direct non-banking
    subsidiaries and on certain other transactions with them or
    involving their securities. Similar restrictions are imposed on
    the Registrant’s subsidiary banks making loans or extending
    credit to, purchasing assets from, investing in, or entering
    into transactions with, their financial subsidiaries.

Under the “cross-guarantee” provisions of the FDI Act,
    insured depository institutions under common control are
    required to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered by the FDIC
    as a result of the default of a commonly controlled insured
    depository institution or for any assistance provided by the
    FDIC to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in
    danger of default. Thus, any insured depository institution
    subsidiary of M&T could incur liability to the FDIC in the
    event of a default of another insured depository institution
    owned or controlled by M&T. The FDIC’s claim under the
    cross-guarantee provisions is superior to claims of stockholders
    of the insured depository institution or its holding company and
    to most claims arising out of obligations or liabilities owed to
    affiliates of the institution, but is subordinate to claims of
    depositors, secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt
    (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured
    depository institution. The FDIC may decline to enforce the
    cross-guarantee provisions if it determines that a waiver is in
    the best interest of the DIF.

Dividends

The Registrant is a legal entity separate and distinct from its
    banking and other subsidiaries. Historically, the majority of
    the Registrant’s revenue has been from dividends paid to
    the Registrant by its subsidiary banks. M&T Bank and
    M&T Bank, N.A. are subject, under one or more of the
    banking laws, to restrictions on the amount of dividend
    declarations. Future dividend payments to the Registrant by its
    subsidiary banks will be dependent on a number of factors,
    including the earnings and financial condition of each such
    bank, and are subject to the limitations referred to in
    note 23 of Notes to Financial Statements filed herewith in
    Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data,” and to other statutory powers of bank
    regulatory agencies.

An insured depository institution is prohibited from making any
    capital distribution to its owner, including any dividend, if,
    after making such distribution, the depository institution fails
    to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital
    measure, including the risk-based capital adequacy and leverage
    standards discussed herein.

As described herein under the heading “The Emergency
    Economic Stabilization Act of 2008,” in connection with the
    issuance of Series A Preferred Stock to the
    U.S. Treasury Department (“U.S. Treasury”),
    M&T is restricted from increasing its common stock dividend.

Supervision
    and Regulation of M&T Bank’s Subsidiaries

M&T Bank has a number of subsidiaries. These subsidiaries
    are subject to the laws and regulations of both the federal
    government and the various states in which they conduct
    business. For example, M&T Securities is regulated by the
    Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry
    Regulatory Authority and state securities regulators.

Capital
    Adequacy

The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC have adopted
    risk-based capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding
    companies and banks under their supervision. Under these
    guidelines, the so-called



“Tier 1 capital” and “Total capital” as
    a percentage of risk-weighted assets and certain off-balance
    sheet instruments must be at least 4% and 8%, respectively.

The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC have also
    imposed a leverage standard to supplement their risk-based
    ratios. This leverage standard focuses on a banking
    institution’s ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total
    assets, adjusted for goodwill and certain other items. Under
    these guidelines, banking institutions that meet certain
    criteria, including excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low
    interest rate exposure and good earnings, and that have received
    the highest regulatory rating must maintain a ratio of
    Tier 1 capital to total adjusted average assets of at least
    3%. Institutions not meeting these criteria, as well as
    institutions with supervisory, financial or operational
    weaknesses, along with those experiencing or anticipating
    significant growth are expected to maintain a Tier 1
    capital to total adjusted average assets ratio equal to at least
    4% to 5%. As reflected in the table in note 23 of Notes to
    Financial Statements filed herewith in Part II,
    Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data,” the risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios of
    the Registrant, M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. as of
    December 31, 2009 exceeded the required capital ratios for
    classification as “well capitalized,” the highest
    classification under the regulatory capital guidelines.

The federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve
    Board and the OCC, maintain risk-based capital standards in
    order to ensure that those standards take adequate account of
    interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk, the risk of
    nontraditional activities and equity investments in nonfinancial
    companies, as well as reflect the actual performance and
    expected risk of loss on certain multifamily housing loans. Bank
    regulators periodically propose amendments to the risk-based
    capital guidelines and related regulatory framework, and
    consider changes to the risk-based capital standards that could
    significantly increase the amount of capital needed to meet the
    requirements for the capital tiers described below. While the
    Company’s management studies such proposals, the timing of
    adoption, ultimate form and effect of any such proposed
    amendments on M&T’s capital requirements and
    operations cannot be predicted.

The federal banking agencies are required to take “prompt
    corrective action” in respect of depository institutions
    and their bank holding companies that do not meet minimum
    capital requirements. The FDI Act establishes five capital
    tiers: “well capitalized,” “adequately
    capitalized,” “undercapitalized,”
    “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically
    undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital
    tier, or that of its bank holding company, depends upon where
    its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital
    measures, including a risk-based capital measure and a leverage
    ratio capital measure, and certain other factors.

Under the implementing regulations adopted by the federal
    banking agencies, a bank holding company or bank is considered
    “well capitalized” if it has (i) a total
    risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, (ii) a
    Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater,
    (iii) a leverage ratio of 5% or greater and (iv) is
    not subject to any order or written directive to meet and
    maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An
    “adequately capitalized” bank holding company or bank
    is defined as one that has (i) a total risk-based capital
    ratio of 8% or greater, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based
    capital ratio of 4% or greater and (iii) a leverage ratio
    of 4% or greater (or 3% or greater in the case of a bank with a
    composite CAMELS rating of 1). A bank holding company or bank is
    considered (A) “undercapitalized” if it has
    (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%,
    (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%
    or (iii) a leverage ratio of less than 4% (or 3% in the
    case of a bank with a composite CAMELS rating of 1);
    (B) “significantly undercapitalized” if the bank
    has (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%,
    or (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than
    3% or (iii) a leverage ratio of less than 3% and
    (C) “critically undercapitalized” if the bank has
    a ratio of tangible equity to total assets equal to or less than
    2%. The Federal Reserve Board may reclassify a “well
    capitalized” bank holding company or bank as
    “adequately capitalized” or subject an
    “adequately capitalized” or
    “undercapitalized” institution to the supervisory
    actions applicable to the next lower capital category if it
    determines that the bank holding company or bank is in an unsafe
    or unsound condition or deems the bank holding company or bank
    to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice and not to have
    corrected the deficiency. M&T, M&T Bank and M&T
    Bank, N.A. met the definition of “well capitalized”
    institutions as of December 31, 2009.

“Undercapitalized” depository institutions, among
    other things, are subject to growth limitations, are prohibited,
    with certain exceptions, from making capital distributions, are
    limited in their ability to



obtain funding from a Federal Reserve Bank and are required to
    submit a capital restoration plan. The federal banking agencies
    may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other
    things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is
    likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s
    capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be
    acceptable, the depository institution’s parent holding
    company must guarantee that the institution will comply with
    such capital restoration plan and provide appropriate assurances
    of performance. If a depository institution fails to submit an
    acceptable plan, including if the holding company refuses or is
    unable to make the guarantee described in the previous sentence,
    it is treated as if it is “significantly
    undercapitalized.” Failure to submit or implement an
    acceptable capital plan also is grounds for the appointment of a
    conservator or a receiver. “Significantly
    undercapitalized” depository institutions may be subject to
    a number of additional requirements and restrictions, including
    orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become
    “adequately capitalized,” requirements to reduce total
    assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent
    banks. Moreover, the parent holding company of a
    “significantly undercapitalized” depository
    institution may be ordered to divest itself of the institution
    or of nonbank subsidiaries of the holding company.
    “Critically undercapitalized” institutions, among
    other things, are prohibited from making any payments of
    principal and interest on subordinated debt, and are subject to
    the appointment of a receiver or conservator.

Each federal banking agency prescribes standards for depository
    institutions and depository institution holding companies
    relating to internal controls, information systems, internal
    audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest
    rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, a maximum ratio of
    classified assets to capital, minimum earnings sufficient to
    absorb losses, a minimum ratio of market value to book value for
    publicly traded shares and other standards as they deem
    appropriate. The Federal Reserve Board and OCC have adopted such
    standards.

Depository institutions that are not “well
    capitalized” or “adequately capitalized” and have
    not received a waiver from the FDIC are prohibited from
    accepting or renewing brokered deposits. As of December 31,
    2009, M&T Bank had approximately $1.5 billion of
    brokered deposits, while M&T Bank, N.A. did not have any
    brokered deposits at that date.

Although M&T has issued shares of common stock in
    connection with acquisitions or at other times, the Company has
    generally maintained capital ratios in excess of minimum
    regulatory guidelines largely through internal capital
    generation (i.e. net income less dividends paid).
    Management’s policy of managing capital through
    reinvestment of earnings, repurchases of shares of common stock
    and dividends is intended to enhance M&T’s earnings
    per share prospects and thereby reward stockholders over time
    with capital gains in the form of increased stock price.

The
    Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008; American Recovery
    and Reinvestment Act of 2009

In the third quarter of 2008, the Federal Reserve, the
    U.S. Treasury and the FDIC initiated measures to stabilize
    the financial markets and to provide liquidity for financial
    institutions. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008
    (“EESA”) was signed into law on October 3, 2008
    and authorized the U.S. Treasury to provide funds to be
    used to restore liquidity and stability to the
    U.S. financial system pursuant to the Troubled Asset Relief
    Program (“TARP”). Under the authority of EESA, the
    U.S. Treasury instituted a voluntary capital purchase
    program under TARP to encourage U.S. financial institutions
    to build capital to increase the flow of financing to
    U.S. businesses and consumers and to support the
    U.S. economy. Under the program, the U.S. Treasury
    purchased senior preferred shares of financial institutions
    which pay cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% per year for five
    years and thereafter at a rate of 9% per year. The terms of the
    senior preferred shares, as amended by the American Recovery and
    Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”), provide that the
    shares may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at par value plus
    accrued and unpaid dividends upon approval of the
    U.S. Treasury and the participating institution’s
    primary banking regulators. The senior preferred shares are
    non-voting and qualify as Tier 1 capital for regulatory
    reporting purposes. In connection with purchasing senior
    preferred shares, the U.S. Treasury also receives warrants
    to purchase the common stock of participating financial
    institutions having a market price of 15% of the amount of
    senior preferred shares on the date of investment with an
    exercise price equal to the market price of the participating
    institution’s common stock at the time of approval,
    calculated on a 20-trading day trailing average. The warrants
    have a term of ten years and are



immediately exercisable, in whole or in part. For a period of
    three years, the consent of the U.S. Treasury is required
    for participating institutions to increase their common stock
    dividend or repurchase their common stock, other than in
    connection with benefit plans consistent with past practice.
    Participation in the capital purchase program also includes
    certain restrictions on executive compensation that were
    modified by ARRA and further defined by the U.S. Treasury
    in its Interim Final Rule on TARP Standards for Compensation and
    Corporate Governance (“TARP Interim Final Rule”). The
    minimum subscription amount available to a participating
    institution is one percent of total risk-weighted assets. In
    general, the maximum subscription amount is three percent of
    risk-weighted assets. On December 23, 2008, M&T issued
    to the U.S. Treasury $600 million of Series A
    Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 1,218,522 shares
    of M&T Common Stock at $73.86 per share. M&T elected
    to participate in the capital purchase program at an amount
    equal to approximately 1% of its risk-weighted assets at the
    time. In connection with its acquisition of Provident on
    May 23, 2009, M&T assumed the preferred stock and
    warrants issued by Provident to the U.S. Treasury on
    November 14, 2008 and issued $152 million of
    Series C Preferred Stock. On a converted basis, the warrant
    issued by Provident to the U.S. Treasury provides for the
    purchase of 407,542 shares of M&T Common Stock at
    $55.76 per share.

ARRA, an economic stimulus package signed into law on
    February 17, 2009, significantly expanded the restrictions
    on executive compensation that were included in Section 111
    of EESA and imposed various corporate governance standards on
    recipients of TARP funds, including under the
    U.S. Treasury’s capital purchase program, until such
    funds are repaid. On June 10, 2009, the U.S. Treasury
    issued the TARP Interim Final Rule to clarify and provide
    additional guidance with respect to the restrictions on
    executive compensation that apply to executives and certain
    other employees of TARP  to M&T, include: (i) a
    prohibition on paying bonuses, retention awards and incentive
    compensation, other than long-term restricted stock or pursuant
    to certain preexisting employment contracts, to its Senior
    Executive Officers (“SEOs”) and next 20 most
    highly-compensated employees; (ii) a prohibition on the
    payment of “golden parachute payments” to its SEOs and
    next five most highly compensated employees; (iii) a
    prohibition on paying incentive compensation for
    “unnecessary and excessive risks” and earnings
    manipulations; (iv) a requirement to clawback any bonus,
    retention award, or incentive compensation paid to a SEO and any
    of the next twenty most highly compensated employees based on
    statements of earnings, revenues, gains, or other criteria later
    found to be materially inaccurate; (v) a requirement to
    establish a policy on luxury or excessive expenditures,
    including entertainment or events, office and facility
    renovations, company owned aircraft and other transportation and
    similar activities or events; (vi) a requirement to provide
    shareholders with a non-binding advisory “say on pay”
    vote on executive compensation; (vii) a prohibition on
    deducting more than $500,000 in annual compensation or
    performance based compensation for the SEOs under Internal
    Revenue Code Section 162(m); (viii) a requirement that
    the compensation committee of the board of directors evaluate
    and review on a semi-annual basis the risks involved in employee
    compensation plans; and (ix) a requirement that the chief
    executive officer and chief financial officer provide written
    certifications of compliance with the foregoing requirements.

Following a systemic risk determination pursuant to the FDI Act,
    the FDIC announced a Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program
    (“TLGP”), which temporarily guarantees the senior debt
    of all FDIC-insured institutions and certain holding companies,
    as well as deposits in noninterest-bearing deposit transaction
    accounts, for those institutions and holding companies who did
    not elect to opt out of the TLGP by December 5, 2008.
    M&T chose to continue its participation in the TLGP and,
    thus, did not opt out. Since October 14, 2008, M&T
    Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. have participated in the
    Transaction Account Guarantee (“TAG”) component of the
    TLGP. Under this program, all noninterest-bearing transaction
    accounts were fully guaranteed by the FDIC for the entire amount
    in the account through December 31, 2009. Coverage under
    the TAG was available for the first 30 days without charge
    and a 10 basis point (hundredth of one percent) surcharge
    was applied to the current assessment rate for M&T Bank and
    M&T Bank, N.A. thereafter on amounts in covered accounts
    exceeding $250,000. Coverage under this program is in addition
    to, and separate from, the coverage available under the
    FDIC’s general deposit insurance rules that currently
    insure up to at least $250,000 per depositor through
    December 31, 2013, after which the standard insurance
    amount will return to $100,000 per depositor for all account
    categories except for certain retirement accounts that will
    remain at $250,000 per depositor.



On August 26, 2009, the FDIC extended the TAG for an
    additional six months for those insured depository institutions
    that elected to continue in the program. M&T Bank and
    M&T Bank, N.A. elected to continue in the TAG through
    June 30, 2010, when the program will end. The surcharge for
    coverage in the program after December 31, 2009 was raised
    to 15 basis points based upon M&T Bank and M&T
    Bank, N.A. being assigned the lowest risk category by the FDIC
    under its risk-based premium system. Pursuant to the terms of
    the TAG, after June 30, 2010 funds held at M&T Bank
    and M&T Bank N.A. in noninterest-bearing transaction
    accounts will no longer be guaranteed in full, but will be
    insured under the FDIC’s general deposit insurance rules.
    As a result of the FDIC’s actions to phase out the Debt
    Guarantee Program under the TLGP, M&T Bank and M&T
    Bank, N.A. ceased their participation in that program on
    October 31, 2009.

FDIC
    Deposit Insurance Assessments

As institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC, M&T Bank
    and M&T Bank, N.A. are subject to FDIC deposit insurance
    assessments. Under the provisions of the FDI Act, the regular
    insurance assessments to be paid by insured institutions are
    specified in schedules issued by the FDIC that specify a target
    reserve ratio designed to maintain that ratio between 1.15% and
    1.50% of estimated insured deposits.

Under the FDI Act, the FDIC imposed deposit insurance
    assessments based on one of four assessment categories depending
    on an institution’s capital classification under the prompt
    corrective action provisions described above and an
    institution’s long-term debt issuer ratings. The adjusted
    assessment rates for insured institutions under the modified
    system range from .05% to .43% of assessable deposits depending
    upon the assessment category into which the insured institution
    is placed. The annual assessment rates for M&T Bank and
    M&T Bank N.A. during 2008 were each between .05% and .06%.

The FDI Act also allows for a one-time assessment credit for
    eligible insured depository institutions (those institutions
    that were in existence on December 31, 1996 and paid a
    deposit insurance assessment prior to that date, or are a
    successor to any such institution). The credit is determined
    based on the assessment base of the institution as of
    December 31, 1996 as compared with the combined aggregate
    assessment base of all eligible institutions as of that date.
    Those institutions having credits could use them to offset up to
    100% of the 2007 DIF assessment, and if not completely used in
    2007, may apply the remaining credits to not more than 90% of
    each of the aggregate 2008, 2009 and 2010 DIF assessments.
    M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. offset 90% of their DIF
    assessments with available one-time assessment credits during
    2008. During 2008, credits utilized to offset amounts assessed
    for M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. totaled
    $18 million and $268 thousand, respectively. Assessments
    for M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A., during 2009 which
    were offset by available credits, were $9 million and $261
    thousand, respectively. All credits available to M&T Bank
    and M&T Bank, N.A. to offset DIF assessments had been
    utilized as of December 31, 2009.

In December 2008, the FDIC approved a final rule on deposit
    assessment rates for the first quarter of 2009. The rule raised
    assessment rates uniformly by 7 basis points (annually) for
    the first quarter of 2009 only. On February, 27, 2009, the FDIC
    adopted a final rule modifying the risk-based assessment system
    and setting initial base assessment rates beginning
    April 1, 2009 and an interim final rule imposing a special
    assessment on each insured depository institution to increase
    the DIF reserve ratio. The final rule revising the FDIC
    risk-based assessment system, which was first proposed in
    October 2008, adjusted the risk-based calculation for an
    institution’s unsecured debt, secured liabilities and
    brokered deposits. The revisions effectively result in a range
    of possible assessments under the risk-based system of 7 to
    77.5 basis points of assessable deposits. The basic
    assessments for Risk Category I, applicable to the least
    risky institutions, including M&T, range from 12 to
    16 basis points, but can be adjusted to from 7 to
    24 basis points under the revised system. The interim final
    rule proposing the emergency assessment contemplated a
    20 basis point assessment on each insured depository
    institution’s insured deposits as of June 30, 2009 and
    collected on September 30, 2009.

On May 22, 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule reducing the
    amount of the proposed emergency assessment and imposed a
    5 basis point special assessment on each insured depository
    institution’s assets minus Tier 1 capital as of
    June 30, 2009. The amount of the special assessment for any
    institution could not exceed 10 basis points times the
    institution’s assessment base for the second quarter of
    2009. The



special assessment was collected on September 30, 2009. The
    Company’s special assessment amounted to $33 million.

On September 29, 2009, the FDIC proposed a rule that was
    subsequently adopted in final form by the FDIC board of
    directors on November 12, 2009 that required insured
    depository institutions to prepay their quarterly risk-based
    assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009, and for all of 2010,
    2011, and 2012, on December 30, 2009, along with each
    institution’s risk-based deposit insurance assessment for
    the third quarter of 2009. For purposes of calculating the
    amount to prepay, the FDIC required that institutions use their
    total base assessment rate in effect on September 30, 2009
    and increase that assessment base quarterly at a 5 percent
    annual growth rate through the end of 2012. On
    September 29, 2009, the FDIC also increased annual
    assessment rates uniformly by 3 basis points beginning in
    2011 such that an institution’s assessment for 2011 and
    2012 would be increased by an annualized 3 basis points.
    The Company’s prepayment for 2010, 2011 and 2012 amounted
    to $249 million.

In addition to the standard deposit insurance assessments, as
    noted above, in the third quarter of 2008, the FDIC announced
    the TLGP which temporarily guarantees the senior debt of all
    FDIC-insured institutions and certain holding companies, as well
    as deposits in noninterest-bearing deposit transaction accounts.
    As a result, the Company recognized additional FDIC insurance
    expense of approximately $500 thousand in the final quarter of
    2008 and $7 million during 2009. The Company expects
    assessments related to the TLGP in the first half of 2010 of
    approximately $6 million - $7 million.

Incremental to insurance fund assessments, the FDIC assesses
    deposits to fund the repayment of debt obligations of the
    Financing Corporation (“FICO”). FICO is a government
    agency-sponsored entity that was formed to borrow the money
    necessary to carry out the closing and ultimate disposition of
    failed thrift institutions by the Resolution
    Trust Corporation. The current annualized rate established
    by the FDIC is 1.06 basis points.

Consumer
    Protection Laws

In connection with their respective lending and leasing
    activities, M&T Bank, certain of its subsidiaries, and
    M&T Bank, N.A. are each subject to a number of federal and
    state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to
    various sectors of the economy. These laws include the Equal
    Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair
    and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Truth in Lending Act,
    the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Real Estate Settlement
    Procedures Act, and various state law counterparts.

In addition, federal law currently contains extensive customer
    privacy protection provisions. Under these provisions, a
    financial institution must provide to its customers, at the
    inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter,
    the institution’s policies and procedures regarding the
    handling of customers’ nonpublic personal financial
    information. These provisions also provide that, except for
    certain limited exceptions, a financial institution may not
    provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties
    unless the institution discloses to the customer that such
    information may be so provided and the customer is given the
    opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. Federal law makes it
    a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain
    or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature
    by fraudulent or deceptive means.

Effective July 1, 2010, a new federal banking rule under
    the Electronic Fund Transfer Act will prohibit financial
    institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts
    on automated teller machines (“ATM”) and one-time
    debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in,
    to the overdraft service for those type of transactions. If a
    consumer does not opt in, any ATM transaction or debit that
    overdraws the consumer’s account will be denied. Overdrafts
    on the payment of checks and regular electronic bill payments
    are not covered by this new rule. Before opting in, the consumer
    must be provided a notice that explains the financial
    institution’s overdraft services, including the fees
    associated with the service, and the consumer’s choices.
    Financial institutions must provide consumers who do not opt in
    with the same account terms, conditions and features (including
    pricing) that they provide to consumers who do opt in.



Sarbanes-Oxley
    Act of 2002

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 implemented a broad range of
    corporate governance, accounting and reporting measures for
    companies that have securities registered under the Exchange
    Act, including publicly-held bank holding companies such as
    M&T. Specifically, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
    various regulations promulgated thereunder, established, among
    other things: (i) requirements for audit committees,
    including independence, expertise, and responsibilities;
    (ii) responsibilities regarding financial statements for
    the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the
    reporting company; (iii) the forfeiture of bonuses or other
    incentive-based compensation and profits from the sale of the
    reporting company’s securities by the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer in the twelve-month period
    following the initial publication of any financial statements
    that later require restatement; (iv) the creation of an
    independent accounting oversight board; (v) standards for
    auditors and regulation of audits, including independence
    provisions that restrict non-audit services that accountants may
    provide to their audit clients; (vi) disclosure and
    reporting obligations for the reporting company and their
    directors and executive officers, including accelerated
    reporting of stock transactions and a prohibition on trading
    during pension blackout periods; (vii) a prohibition on
    personal loans to directors and officers, except certain loans
    made by insured financial institutions on nonpreferential terms
    and in compliance with other bank regulatory requirements; and
    (viii) a range of civil and criminal penalties for fraud
    and other violations of the securities laws.

USA
    Patriot Act

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate
    Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001
    (the “USA Patriot Act”) imposes obligations on
    U.S. financial institutions, including banks and broker
    dealer subsidiaries, to implement policies, procedures and
    controls which are reasonably designed to detect and report
    instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. In
    addition, provisions of the USA Patriot Act require the federal
    financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the
    effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money
    laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank
    holding company acquisitions. The Registrant and its impacted
    subsidiaries have approved policies and procedures that are
    believed to be compliant with the USA Patriot Act.

Regulatory
    Impact of M&T’s Relationship With AIB

As described above under the caption “Relationship With
    Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c.,” AIB owns approximately 22.6%
    of the issued and outstanding shares of M&T common stock
    and has representation on the M&T and M&T Bank boards
    of directors. As a result, AIB has become M&T’s bank
    holding company under the BHCA and the Banking Law and
    AIB’s relationship with M&T is subject to the statutes
    and regulations governing bank holding companies described
    above. Among other things, AIB will have to join M&T in
    applications by M&T for acquisitions and new activities.
    The Reorganization Agreement requires AIB to join in such
    applications at M&T’s request, subject to certain
    limitations. In addition, because AIB is regulated by the
    Central Bank of Ireland (“CBI”), the CBI may assert
    jurisdiction over M&T as a company controlled by AIB.
    Additional discussion of the regulatory implications of the
    Allfirst acquisition for M&T is set forth above under the
    caption “Certain Post-Closing Bank Regulatory Matters.”

Governmental
    Policies

The earnings of the Company are significantly affected by the
    monetary and fiscal policies of governmental authorities,
    including the Federal Reserve Board. Among the instruments of
    monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement
    these objectives are open-market operations in
    U.S. Government securities and federal funds, changes in
    the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in
    reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These
    instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations
    to influence the overall level of bank loans, investments and
    deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans and paid for
    deposits. The Federal Reserve Board frequently uses these
    instruments of monetary policy, especially its open-market
    operations and the discount rate, to influence the level of
    interest rates and to affect the strength of the economy, the
    level of inflation or the price of



the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The monetary policies of
    the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the
    operating results of banking institutions in the past and are
    expected to continue to do so in the future. It is not possible
    to predict the nature of future changes in monetary and fiscal
    policies, or the effect which they may have on the
    Company’s business and earnings.

Competition

The Company competes in offering commercial and personal
    financial services with other banking institutions and with
    firms in a number of other industries, such as thrift
    institutions, credit unions, personal loan companies, sales
    finance companies, leasing companies, securities firms and
    insurance companies. Furthermore, diversified financial services
    companies are able to offer a combination of these services to
    their customers on a nationwide basis. The Company’s
    operations are significantly impacted by state and federal
    regulations applicable to the banking industry. Moreover, the
    provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the Interstate
    Banking Act and the Banking Law have allowed for increased
    competition among diversified financial services providers.

Other
    Legislative Initiatives

Proposals may be introduced in the United States Congress and in
    the New York State Legislature and before various bank
    regulatory authorities which would alter the powers of, and
    restrictions on, different types of banking organizations and
    which would restructure part or all of the existing regulatory
    framework for banks, bank holding companies and other providers
    of financial services. Moreover, other bills may be introduced
    in Congress which would further regulate, deregulate or
    restructure the financial services industry, including proposals
    to substantially reform the regulatory framework. It is not
    possible to predict whether these or any other proposals will be
    enacted into law or, even if enacted, the effect which they may
    have on the Company’s business and earnings.

Interest income data are on a

    from the combined effect of both volume and rate was based on
    the separately determined volume and rate changes.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

M&T and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by
    various risks and uncertainties which are difficult to predict.
    As a financial institution, the Company has significant exposure
    to market risk, including interest-rate risk, liquidity risk and
    credit risk, among others. Adverse experience with these or
    other risks could have a material impact on the Company’s
    financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the
    value of the Company’s financial instruments in general,
    and M&T’s common stock, in particular.



Interest Rate Risk — The Company is exposed to
    interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and
    deposit-taking since assets and liabilities reprice at different
    times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a
    result, net interest income, which represents the largest
    revenue source for the Company, is subject to the effects of
    changing interest rates. The Company closely monitors the
    sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates
    and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as
    interest rates change. The Company makes use of both on- and
    off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to
    interest rate risk. Possible actions to mitigate such risk
    include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan
    and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to,
    modifying or terminating interest rate swap agreements or other
    financial instruments used for interest rate risk management
    purposes.

Liquidity Risk — Liquidity refers to the
    Company’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and
    liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future
    financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit
    withdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporate
    purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of
    financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.
    The Company obtains funding through deposits and various
    short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal
    funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to
    repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, offshore branch
    deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New
    York and others. Should the Company experience a substantial
    deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or
    should the availability of funding become restricted due to
    disruption in the financial markets, the Company’s ability
    to obtain funding from these or other sources could be
    negatively impacted. The Company attempts to quantify such
    credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the
    liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade
    over various grading levels. The Company estimates such impact
    by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines
    of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and
    securitizable assets. To mitigate such risk, the Company
    maintains available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve
    Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York that
    are secured by loans and investment securities. On an ongoing
    basis, management closely monitors the Company’s liquidity
    position for compliance with internal policies and believes that
    available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding
    needs in the normal course of business.

Credit Risk — Factors that influence the
    Company’s credit loss experience include overall economic
    conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and,
    due to the size of the Company’s real estate loan portfolio
    and mortgage-related investment securities portfolio, real
    estate valuations, in particular. Other factors that can
    influence the Company’s credit loss experience, in addition
    to general economic conditions and borrowers’ specific
    abilities to repay loans, include: (i) the impact of
    declining real estate values in the Company’s portfolio of
    loans to residential real estate builders and developers;
    (ii) the repayment performance associated with the
    Company’s portfolio of alternative residential mortgage
    loans and residential and other mortgage loans supporting
    mortgage-related securities; (iii) the concentration of
    commercial real estate loans in the Company’s loan
    portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured
    by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York
    City metropolitan area, in particular; (iv) the amount of
    commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New
    York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in
    central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less
    economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other
    regions of the country; and (v) the size of the
    Company’s portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which
    historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a
    percentage of loans outstanding than many other loan types.
    Considerable concerns exist about the economic recovery in both
    national and international markets; the level and volatility of
    energy prices; a weakened housing market; the troubled state of
    financial and credit markets; Federal Reserve positioning of
    monetary policy; high unemployment, which has caused consumer
    spending to slow; the underlying impact on businesses’
    operations and abilities to repay loans as consumer spending
    slowed; continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New
    York and central Pennsylvania regions; and continued uncertainty
    about possible responses to state government budget deficits.



Numerous factors can affect the Company’s credit loss
    experience. To help manage credit risk, the Company maintains a
    detailed credit policy and utilizes various committees that
    include members of senior management to approve significant
    extensions of credit. The Company also maintains a credit review
    department that regularly reviews the Company’s loan and
    lease portfolios to ensure compliance with established credit
    policy. The Company utilizes an extensive loan grading system
    which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate
    loans. On a quarterly basis, the Company’s loan review
    department reviews all commercial and commercial real estate
    loans greater than $350,000 that are classified as Special
    Mention or worse. Meetings are held with loan officers and their
    managers, workout specialists and Senior Management to discuss
    each of the relationships. Borrower-specific information is
    reviewed, including operating results, future cash flows, recent
    developments and the borrower’s outlook, and other
    pertinent data. The timing and extent of potential losses,
    considering collateral valuation and other factors, and the
    Company’s potential courses of action are reviewed. The
    Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in
    management’s judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent
    in the loan and lease portfolio. In addition, the Company
    regularly reviews its investment securities for declines in
    value below amortized cost that might be characterized as
    “other than temporary.” Any declines in value below
    amortized cost that are deemed to be “other than
    temporary” are charged to earnings.

Economic Risk — The U.S. economy experienced
    recession and weak economic conditions during the last three
    years. Those conditions contributed to risk as follows:

•

The significant downturn in the residential real estate market
    that began in 2007 had continued in 2008 and 2009. The impact of
    that downturn has resulted in declining home prices, higher
    foreclosures and loan charge-offs, and lower market prices on
    investment securities backed by residential real estate. These
    factors have negatively impacted M&T’s results of
    operations and could continue to do so.

•

Lower demand for the Company’s products and services and
    lower revenues and earnings could result from ongoing weak
    economic conditions. Those conditions could also result in
    higher loan charge-offs due to the inability of borrowers to
    repay loans.

•

Lower fee income from the Company’s brokerage and trust
    businesses could result from significant declines in stock
    market prices.

•

Lower earnings could result from other-than-temporary impairment
    charges related to the Company’s investment securities
    portfolio.

•

Higher FDIC assessments could be imposed on the Company due to
    bank failures that have caused the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund
    to fall below minimum required levels.

•

There is no assurance that the Emergency Economic Stabilization
    Act of 2008 or the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
    2009 will improve the condition of the financial markets.

Supervision and Regulation — The Company is subject to
    extensive state and federal laws and regulations governing the
    banking industry, in particular, and public companies, in
    general, including laws related to corporate taxation. Many of
    those laws and regulations are described in Part I,
    Item 1 “Business.” Changes in those or other laws
    and regulations, or the degree of the Company’s compliance
    with those laws and regulations as judged by any of several
    regulators, including tax authorities, that oversee the Company,
    could have a significant effect on the Company’s operations
    and its financial results.

Detailed discussions of the specific risks outlined above and
    other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

in Part I, Item 1 “Business,” and
    Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
    Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading
    “Forward-Looking Statements” is included a description
    of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by
    management that are difficult to predict and that could
    materially affect the Company’s financial condition and
    results of operations, as well as the value of the
    Company’s financial instruments in general, and M&T
    common stock, in particular.

In addition, the market price of M&T common stock may
    fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other
    factors, including changes in securities analysts’
    estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market
    prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in
    market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting
    policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory agencies.

Properties.

Both M&T and M&T Bank maintain their executive offices
    at One M&T Plaza in Buffalo, New York. This twenty-one
    story headquarters building, containing approximately
    279,000 rentable square feet of space, is owned in fee by
    M&T Bank and was completed in 1967. M&T, M&T Bank
    and their subsidiaries occupy approximately 98% of the building
    and the remainder is leased to non-affiliated tenants. At
    December 31, 2009, the cost of this property (including
    improvements subsequent to the initial construction), net of
    accumulated depreciation, was $5.7 million.

In September 1992, M&T Bank acquired an additional facility
    in Buffalo, New York with approximately 365,000 rentable
    square feet of space. Approximately 89% of this facility, known
    as M&T Center, is occupied by M&T Bank and its
    subsidiaries, with the remainder leased to non-affiliated
    tenants. At December 31, 2009, the cost of this building
    (including improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of
    accumulated depreciation, was $11.2 million.

M&T Bank also owns and occupies two separate facilities in
    the Buffalo area which support certain back-office and
    operations functions of the Company. The total square footage of
    these facilities approximates 215,000 square feet and their
    combined cost (including improvements subsequent to
    acquisition), net of accumulated depreciation, was
    $20.6 million at December 31, 2009.

M&T Bank also owns a facility in Syracuse, New York with
    approximately 150,000 rentable square feet of space.
    Approximately 45% of this facility is occupied by M&T Bank.
    At December 31, 2009, the cost of this building (including
    improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of accumulated
    depreciation, was $6.5 million.

M&T Bank also owns facilities in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
    and Millsboro, Delaware with approximately 207,000 and
    322,000 rentable square feet of space, respectively.
    M&T Bank occupies approximately 38% and 85% of these
    respective facilities. At December 31, 2009, the cost of
    these buildings (including improvements subsequent to
    acquisition), net of accumulated depreciation, was
    $12.2 million and $7.3 million, respectively.

No other properties owned by M&T Bank have more than
    100,000 square feet of space. The cost, net of accumulated
    depreciation and amortization, of the Company’s premises
    and equipment is detailed in note 6 of Notes to Financial
    Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8,
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Of the
    794 domestic banking offices of the Registrant’s subsidiary
    banks at December 31, 2009, 302 are owned in fee and 492
    are leased.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings.

M&T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course
    of business to various pending and threatened legal proceedings
    in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. Management,
    after consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that
    the aggregate ultimate liability arising out of litigation
    pending against M&T or its subsidiaries will be material to
    M&T’s consolidated financial position, but at the
    present time is not in a position to determine whether such
    litigation will have a material adverse effect on
    M&T’s consolidated results of operations in any future
    reporting period.

    Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Virginia, West Virginia and the
    District of Columbia, and an office in the Cayman Islands.
    M&T Bank and its subsidiaries offer a broad range of
    financial services to a diverse base of consumers, businesses,
    professional clients, governmental entities and financial
    institutions located in their markets. Lending is largely
    focused on consumers residing in New York State, Pennsylvania,
    Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C., and on small and
    medium size businesses based in those areas, although
    residential and commercial real estate loans are originated
    through lending offices in six other states. Certain lending
    activities are also conducted in other states through various
    subsidiaries. M&T Bank’s subsidiaries include:
    M&T Real Estate Trust, a commercial mortgage lender;
    M&T Realty Capital Corporation, a multifamily commercial
    mortgage lender; M&T Securities, Inc., which provides
    brokerage, investment advisory and insurance services; MTB
    Investment Advisors, Inc., which serves as investment advisor to
    the MTB Group of Funds, a family of proprietary mutual funds,
    and other funds and institutional clients; and M&T
    Insurance Agency, Inc., an insurance agency.

M&T Bank, N.A., with total assets of $908 million at
    December 31, 2009, is a national bank with an office in
    Oakfield, New York. M&T Bank, N.A. offers selected deposit
    and loan products on a nationwide basis, largely through
    telephone, Internet and direct mail marketing techniques.

On August 28, 2009, M&T Bank entered into a purchase
    and assumption agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation (“FDIC”) to assume all of the deposits and
    acquire certain assets of Bradford Bank (“Bradford”),
    Baltimore, Maryland. As part of the transaction, M&T Bank
    entered into a loss-share arrangement with the FDIC whereby
    M&T Bank will be reimbursed by the FDIC for most



losses it incurs on the acquired loan portfolio. The transaction
    has been accounted for using the acquisition method of
    accounting and, accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed were recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition
    date. Assets acquired in the transaction totaled approximately
    $469 million, including $302 million of loans, and
    liabilities assumed aggregated $440 million, including
    $361 million of deposits. In accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), M&T Bank
    recorded an after-tax gain on the transaction of
    $18 million ($29 million before taxes).

On May 23, 2009, M&T acquired all of the outstanding
    common stock of Provident Bankshares Corporation
    (“Provident”), a bank holding company based in
    Baltimore, Maryland, in a stock-for-stock transaction. Provident
    Bank, Provident’s banking subsidiary, was merged into
    M&T Bank on that date. The results of operations acquired
    in the Provident transaction have been included in the
    Company’s financial results since May 23, 2009.
    Provident common shareholders received .171625 shares of
    M&T common stock in exchange for each share of Provident
    common stock, resulting in M&T issuing a total of 5,838,308
    common shares with an acquisition date fair value of
    $273 million. In addition, based on the merger agreement,
    outstanding and unexercised options to purchase Provident common
    stock were converted into options to purchase the common stock
    of M&T. Those options had an estimated fair value of
    approximately $1 million. In total, the purchase price was
    approximately $274 million based on the fair value on the
    acquisition date of M&T common stock exchanged and the
    options to purchase M&T common stock. Holders of
    Provident’s preferred stock were issued shares of new
    Series B and Series C Preferred Stock of M&T
    having substantially identical terms. That preferred stock and
    warrants to purchase common stock associated with the
    Series C Preferred Stock added $162 million to
    M&T’s stockholders’ equity. The Series B
    Preferred Stock has a preference value of $27 million, pays
    non-cumulative dividends at a rate of 10%, and is convertible
    into 433,148 shares of M&T common stock. The
    Series C Preferred Stock has a preference value of
    $152 million, pays cumulative dividends at a rate of 5%
    through November 2013 and 9% thereafter, and is held by the
    U.S. Department of Treasury (“U.S. Treasury”)
    under the Troubled Asset Relief Program — Capital
    Purchase Program.

The Provident transaction has been accounted for using the
    acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets
    acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration exchanged were
    recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Assets
    acquired totaled $6.3 billion, including $4.0 billion
    of loans and leases (including approximately $1.7 billion
    of commercial real estate loans, $1.4 billion of consumer
    loans, $700 million of commercial loans and leases and
    $300 million of residential real estate loans) and
    $1.0 billion of investment securities. Liabilities assumed
    were $5.9 billion, including $5.1 billion of deposits.
    The transaction added $436 million to M&T’s
    stockholders’ equity, including $280 million of common
    equity and $156 million of preferred equity. In connection
    with the acquisition, the Company recorded $332 million of
    goodwill and $63 million of core deposit intangible. The
    core deposit intangible is being amortized over seven years
    using an accelerated method. The acquisition of Provident
    expanded the Company’s presence in the Mid-Atlantic area,
    gave the Company the second largest deposit share in Maryland,
    and tripled the Company’s presence in Virginia.

Application of the acquisition method requires that acquired
    loans be recorded at fair value and prohibits the carry over of
    the acquired entity’s allowance for credit losses.
    Determining the fair value of the acquired loans required
    estimating cash flows expected to be collected on the loans. The
    impact of estimated credit losses on all acquired loans was
    considered in the estimation of future cash flows used in the
    determination of estimated fair value as of the acquisition date.

Net acquisition and integration-related gains and expenses
    (included herein as merger-related expenses) associated with the
    Bradford and Provident acquisition transactions incurred during
    2009 totaled $60 million ($36 million after tax
    effect, or $.31 of diluted earnings per common share). Reflected
    in that amount are a $29 million ($18 million after
    tax effect, or $.15 of diluted earnings per common share) gain
    on the Bradford transaction and $89 million
    ($54 million after tax effect, or $.46 of diluted earnings
    per common share) of expenses associated with the Provident and
    Bradford transactions. The gain reflects the amount of financial
    support and indemnification against loan losses that M&T
    obtained from the FDIC. The expenses were for professional
    services and other temporary help fees associated with the
    conversion of systems

and/or

integration of operations; costs related to branch and office
    consolidations; costs related to termination of existing
    Provident contractual arrangements for various services; initial
    marketing and promotion expenses designed to introduce M&T
    Bank to customers of Bradford



and Provident; severance for former employees of Provident;
    incentive compensation costs; travel costs; and printing,
    supplies and other costs of commencing operations in new markets
    and offices.

The condition of the residential real estate marketplace and the
    U.S. economy since 2007 has had a significant impact on the
    financial services industry as a whole, and specifically on the
    financial results of the Company. Beginning with a pronounced
    downturn in the residential real estate market in early 2007
    that was led by problems in the

sub-prime

mortgage market, the deterioration of residential real estate
    values and higher delinquencies and charge-offs of loans
    continued throughout 2008 and 2009, including loans to builders
    and developers. With the U.S. economy in recession in 2008
    and 2009, financial institutions were facing higher credit
    losses from distressed real estate values and borrower defaults,
    resulting in reduced capital levels. During 2009, the Company
    has experienced higher delinquencies and charge-offs related to
    its commercial loan and commercial real estate loan portfolios
    as well. Additionally, investment securities backed by
    residential and commercial real estate have reflected
    substantial unrealized losses due to a lack of liquidity in the
    financial markets and anticipated credit losses. Many financial
    institutions, including the Company, have taken charges for
    those unrealized losses that were deemed to be other than
    temporary.

In the third quarter of 2008, the Federal Reserve, the
    U.S. Treasury and the FDIC initiated measures to stabilize
    the financial markets and to provide liquidity for financial
    institutions. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008
    (“EESA”) was signed into law on October 3, 2008
    and authorized the U.S. Treasury to provide funds to be
    used to restore liquidity and stability to the
    U.S. financial system pursuant to the Troubled Asset Relief
    Program (“TARP”). Under the authority of EESA, the
    U.S. Treasury instituted a voluntary capital purchase
    program under TARP to encourage U.S. financial institutions
    to build capital to increase the flow of financing to
    U.S. businesses and consumers and to support the
    U.S. economy. Under the program, the U.S. Treasury
    purchased senior preferred shares of financial institutions
    which pay cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% per year for five
    years and thereafter at a rate of 9% per year. The terms of the
    senior preferred shares, as amended by the American Recovery and
    Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”), provide that the
    shares may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at par value plus
    accrued and unpaid dividends upon approval of the
    U.S. Treasury and the participating financial
    institution’s primary banking regulator. The senior
    preferred shares are non-voting and qualify as Tier 1
    capital for regulatory reporting purposes. In connection with
    purchasing senior preferred shares, the U.S. Treasury also
    received warrants to purchase the common stock of participating
    financial institutions having a market price of 15% of the
    amount of senior preferred shares on the date of investment with
    an exercise price equal to the market price of the participating
    institution’s common stock at the time of approval,
    calculated on a 20-trading day trailing average. The warrants
    have a term of ten years and are immediately exercisable, in
    whole or in part. For a period of three years, the consent of
    the U.S. Treasury will be required for participating
    institutions to increase their common stock dividend or
    repurchase their common stock, other than in connection with
    benefit plans consistent with past practice. Participation in
    the capital purchase program also includes certain restrictions
    on executive compensation that were modified by ARRA and further
    defined by the U.S. Treasury in its Interim Final Rule on
    TARP Standards for Compensation and Corporate Governance. The
    minimum subscription amount available to a participating
    institution was one percent of total risk-weighted assets. The
    maximum suggested subscription amount was three percent of
    risk-weighted assets. On December 23, 2008, M&T issued
    to the U.S. Treasury $600 million of Series A
    Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 1,218,522 shares
    of M&T common stock at $73.86 per share. M&T elected
    to participate in the capital purchase program at an amount
    equal to approximately 1% of its risk-weighted assets at the
    time. As already noted, Provident also participated in the
    capital purchase program. Preferred stock resulting from that
    participation was converted into $152 million of M&T
    Series C Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase
    407,542 shares of M&T common stock at $55.76 per
    share. In total, M&T has $752 million of preferred
    stock outstanding related to the capital purchase program.
    Additional information regarding preferred stock of M&T is
    included in note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements.

On November 30, 2007, M&T acquired Partners
    Trust Financial Group, Inc. (“Partners Trust”), a
    bank holding company headquartered in Utica, New York. Partners
    Trust Bank, the primary banking subsidiary of Partners
    Trust, was merged into M&T Bank on that date. Partners
    Trust Bank operated 33



branch offices in upstate New York at the date of acquisition.
    The results of operations acquired in the Partners Trust
    transaction have been included in the Company’s financial
    results since November 30, 2007. After application of the
    election, allocation and proration procedures contained in the
    merger agreement with Partners Trust, M&T paid
    $282 million in cash and issued 3,096,861 shares of
    M&T common stock in exchange for Partners Trust shares
    outstanding at the time of acquisition. In addition, based on
    the merger agreement, M&T paid $9 million in cash to
    holders of outstanding and unexercised stock options granted by
    Partners Trust. The purchase price was approximately
    $559 million based on the cash paid to Partners Trust
    shareholders, the fair value of M&T common stock exchanged,
    and the cash paid to holders of Partners Trust stock options.
    The acquisition of Partners Trust expanded the Company’s
    presence in upstate New York, making M&T Bank the deposit
    market share leader in the Utica-Rome and Binghamton markets,
    while strengthening its lead position in Syracuse.

Assets acquired from Partners Trust on November 30, 2007
    totaled $3.5 billion, including $2.2 billion of loans
    and leases (largely residential real estate and consumer loans),
    liabilities assumed aggregated $3.0 billion, including
    $2.2 billion of deposits (largely savings, money-market and
    time deposits), and $277 million was added to
    stockholders’ equity. In connection with the acquisition,
    the Company recorded approximately $283 million of goodwill
    and $50 million of core deposit intangible. The core
    deposit intangible is being amortized over seven years
    using an accelerated method.

As a condition of the approval of the Partners Trust acquisition
    by regulators, M&T Bank was required to divest three of the
    acquired branch offices in Binghamton, New York. The three
    branches were sold on March 15, 2008, including loans of
    $13 million and deposits of $65 million. No gain or
    loss was recognized on that transaction.

On December 7, 2007, M&T Bank acquired the
    Mid-Atlantic retail banking franchise of First Horizon Bank
    (“First Horizon”), a subsidiary of First Horizon
    National Corporation, in a cash transaction, including
    $214 million of loans, $216 million of deposits and
    $80 million of trust and investment assets under
    management. In connection with the transaction, the Company
    recorded approximately $15 million of core deposit and
    other intangible assets that are being amortized using
    accelerated methods over a weighted-average life of
    seven years.

The Company incurred merger-related expenses associated with the
    Partners Trust and First Horizon transactions related to systems
    conversions and other costs of integrating and conforming
    acquired operations with and into the Company of approximately
    $15 million ($9 million net of applicable income
    taxes, or $.08 of diluted earnings per common share) during 2007
    and $4 million ($2 million net of applicable income
    taxes, or $.02 of diluted earnings per common share) during 2008.

On February 5, 2007, M&T invested $300 million to
    acquire a 20 percent minority interest in Bayview Lending
    Group LLC (“BLG”), a privately-held commercial
    mortgage lender that specialized in originating, securitizing
    and servicing small balance commercial real estate loans.
    M&T recognizes income from BLG using the equity method of
    accounting. M&T’s pro-rata portion of the results of
    operations of BLG were losses of $26 million
    ($16 million after tax effect) in 2009 and $37 million
    ($23 million after tax effect) in 2008, and income of
    $9 million ($5 million after tax effect) in 2007,
    which have been recorded as a component of “other
    income” in the consolidated statement of income. Including
    expenses associated with M&T’s investment in BLG, most
    notably interest expense, that investment reduced the
    Company’s net income in 2009, 2008 and 2007 by
    $24 million (after tax effect) or $.21 per diluted common
    share, $32 million (after tax effect) or $.29 per diluted
    common share, and $4 million (after tax effect) or $.04 per
    diluted common share, respectively.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

The Company’s significant accounting policies conform with
    GAAP and are described in note 1 of Notes to Financial
    Statements. In applying those accounting policies, management of
    the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many
    of the methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized.
    Certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent
    on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility
    in the Company’s reported financial performance should the
    assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes
    in circumstances. Some of the more significant



areas in which management of the Company applies critical
    assumptions and estimates include the following:

•

Allowance for credit losses — The allowance for credit
    losses represents the amount which, in management’s
    judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in
    the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. A
    provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of
    the allowance as deemed necessary by management. In estimating
    losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, assumptions and
    judgment are applied to measure amounts and timing of expected
    future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to
    determine the borrowers’ abilities to repay obligations.
    Historical loss trends are also considered, as are economic
    conditions, industry trends, portfolio trends and
    borrower-specific financial data. Changes in the circumstances
    considered when determining management’s estimates and
    assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and
    assumptions, which may result in adjustment of the allowance. A
    detailed discussion of facts and circumstances considered by
    management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit
    losses is included herein under the heading “Provision for
    Credit Losses.”

•

Valuation methodologies — Management of the Company
    applies various valuation methodologies to assets and
    liabilities which often involve a significant degree of
    judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the
    particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred
    to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as
    trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real
    estate loans held for sale and related commitments. However, for
    those items for which an observable liquid market does not
    exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions
    to value such items. Examples of these items include loans,
    deposits, borrowings, goodwill, core deposit and other
    intangible assets, and other assets and liabilities obtained or
    assumed in business combinations; capitalized servicing assets;
    pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; value
    ascribed to stock-based compensation; estimated residual values
    of property associated with leases; and certain derivative and
    other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of
    various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates,
    rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default
    rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of
    different assumptions could produce significantly different
    results, which could have material positive or negative effects
    on the Company’s results of operations. In addition to
    valuation, the Company must assess whether there are any
    declines in value below the carrying value of assets that should
    be considered other than temporary or otherwise require an
    adjustment in carrying value and recognition of a loss in the
    consolidated statement of income. Examples include investment
    securities, other investments, mortgage servicing rights,
    goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, among
    others. Specific assumptions and estimates utilized by
    management are discussed in detail herein in management’s
    discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
    operations and in notes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 18, 19 and
    20 of Notes to Financial Statements.

•

Commitments, contingencies and off-balance sheet
    arrangements — Information regarding the
    Company’s commitments and contingencies, including
    guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation,
    and their potential effects on the Company’s results of
    operations is included in note 21 of Notes to Financial
    Statements. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to
    examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such
    examinations may result in challenges to the tax return
    treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions.
    Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to
    record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate.
    Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that
    management’s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and
    adjustments required could have a material effect on the
    Company’s results of operations. Information regarding the
    Company’s income taxes is presented in note 13 of
    Notes to Financial Statements. The recognition or de-recognition
    in the Company’s consolidated financial statements of
    assets and liabilities held by so-called variable interest
    entities is subject to the interpretation and application of
    complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that
    require management to estimate and assess the probability of
    financial outcomes in future periods and the degree to which the
    Company can influence those



outcomes. Information relating to the Company’s involvement
    in such entities and the accounting treatment afforded each such
    involvement is included in note 19 of Notes to Financial
    Statements.

Overview

Net income for the Company during 2009 was $380 million or
    $2.89 of diluted earnings per common share, representing
    declines of 32% and 42%, respectively, from $556 million or
    $5.01 of diluted earnings per common share in 2008. Basic
    earnings per common share decreased 42% to $2.90 in 2009 from
    $5.04 in 2008. Net income in 2007 aggregated $654 million,
    while diluted and basic earnings per common share were $5.95 and
    $6.05, respectively. The after-tax impact of net merger-related
    gains and expenses associated with the 2009 and 2007 acquisition
    transactions previously described were $36 million
    ($60 million pre-tax) or $.31 of basic and diluted earnings
    per common share in 2009, $2 million ($4 million
    pre-tax) or $.02 of basic and diluted earnings per common share
    in 2008 and $9 million ($15 million pre-tax) or $.08
    of basic and diluted earnings per common share in 2007. Net
    income expressed as a rate of return on average assets in 2009
    was .56%, compared with .85% in 2008 and 1.12% in 2007. The
    return on average common stockholders’ equity was 5.07% in
    2009, 8.64% in 2008 and 10.47% in 2007.

Several noteworthy items are reflected in the Company’s
    financial results in 2009. The provision for credit losses and
    net loan charge-offs during 2009 were at higher than historical
    levels, due largely to the recessionary state of the
    U.S. economy and its impact on consumers and businesses,
    and the continuation of a distressed residential real estate
    market. The provision for credit losses in 2009 was
    $604 million, up from $412 million in 2008. Net
    charge-offs during 2009 aggregated $514 million, compared
    with $383 million in 2008. As a percentage of average loans
    outstanding, net charge-offs were 1.01% and .78% in 2009 and
    2008, respectively. Charge-offs in all major loan categories
    rose from 2008 to 2009. The most dramatic increase in net
    charge-offs was related to commercial loans, which rose to
    $172 million in 2009 from $94 million in 2008. That
    increase was largely driven by a small number of significant
    commercial loan charge-offs. In addition, charge-offs of
    residential real estate loans rose to $92 million in 2009
    from $63 million in 2008, reflecting the turbulence in the
    residential real estate market place which has resulted in
    deteriorating real estate values and increased delinquencies.
    The Company also continued to incur elevated costs related to
    the workout process for modifying residential mortgage loans of
    creditworthy borrowers and to the foreclosure process for
    borrowers unable to make payments on their loans.

During 2009, $84 million of after-tax

other-than-temporary

impairment charges ($138 million before taxes) were
    recorded on certain

available-for-sale

investment securities, reducing basic and diluted earnings per
    common share by $.73. Specifically, such charges related to
    certain privately issued collateralized mortgage obligations
    (“CMOs”) backed by residential real estate loans and
    collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”). The Company
    also experienced substantially higher costs related to deposit
    assessments by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
    (“FDIC”). Such costs rose to $97 million in 2009
    from $7 million in 2008 and reflected higher assessment
    rates, expirations of available credits and a $33 million
    second quarter 2009 special assessment levied by the FDIC on
    insured financial institutions to rebuild the Deposit Insurance
    Fund. That special assessment reduced net income and diluted
    earnings per common share by $20 million and $.17,
    respectively.

The Company’s financial results for 2008 were also affected
    by several notable factors. Largely the result of the state of
    the U.S. economy and the distressed residential real estate
    marketplace, the Company’s provision for credit losses in
    2008 was $412 million, significantly higher than
    $192 million in 2007. Net charge-offs of loans rose
    dramatically in 2008, to $383 million from
    $114 million in 2007. Net loan charge-offs as a percentage
    of average loans outstanding were .78% and .26% in 2008 and
    2007, respectively. While charge-offs were up in all major
    categories of loans, the most significant contributors to the
    sharp rise were loan charge-offs related to residential real
    estate markets; charge-offs of loans to builders and developers
    of residential real estate jumped from $4 million in 2007
    to $100 million in 2008, and residential real estate loan
    charge-offs grew to $63 million in 2008 from
    $19 million in 2007. Not only did the condition of the
    residential real estate markets negatively impact the
    Company’s financial results in 2008 through a higher
    provision for credit losses, but significantly higher costs were



incurred related to the workout process for modifying
    residential mortgage loans and to the foreclosure process.

During the third quarter of 2008, a $153 million (pre-tax)

other-than-temporary

impairment charge was recorded related to preferred stock
    issuances of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The write-down was
    taken on preferred stock with a basis of $162 million
    following the U.S. Government’s placement of Fannie
    Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship on September 7,
    2008. The Company recognized additional

other-than-temporary

impairment charges during 2008 totaling $29 million
    (pre-tax) related to certain CDOs (obtained from Partners Trust)
    and CMOs. In total,

other-than-temporary

impairment charges on investment securities aggregated
    $182 million ($111 million after tax effect) during
    2008, thereby lowering diluted earnings per common share by
    $1.00.

Also reflected in the Company’s 2008 results was
    $29 million of after-tax income, or $.26 of diluted
    earnings per common share, resulting from M&T Bank’s
    status as a member bank of Visa. During the last quarter of
    2007, Visa completed a reorganization in contemplation of its
    initial public offering (“IPO”) in 2008. As part of
    that reorganization M&T Bank and other member banks of Visa
    received shares of Class B common stock of Visa. M&T
    Bank was allocated 1,967,028 Class B common shares of Visa
    based on its proportionate ownership of Visa. Of those shares,
    760,455 were mandatorily redeemed in March 2008 for an after-tax
    gain of $20 million ($33 million pre-tax), which has
    been recorded as “gain on bank investment securities”
    in the consolidated statement of income, adding $.18 to diluted
    earnings per common share. Those member banks are also obligated
    under various agreements with Visa to share in losses stemming
    from certain litigation involving Visa (“Covered
    Litigation”). As of December 31, 2007, although Visa
    was expected to set aside a portion of the proceeds from its IPO
    in an escrow account to fund any judgments or settlements that
    may arise out of the Covered Litigation, guidance from the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) indicated
    that Visa member banks should record a liability for the fair
    value of the contingent obligation to Visa. The estimation of
    the Company’s proportionate share of any potential losses
    related to the Covered Litigation was extremely difficult and
    involved a great deal of judgment. Nevertheless, in the fourth
    quarter of 2007 the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of
    $23 million ($14 million after tax effect, or $.13 per
    diluted common share) related to the Covered Litigation. In
    accordance with GAAP and consistent with the SEC guidance, the
    Company did not recognize any value for its common stock
    ownership interest in Visa as of the 2007 year-end. During
    the first quarter of 2008, Visa completed its IPO and, as part
    of the transaction, funded an escrow account with
    $3 billion from the proceeds of the IPO to cover potential
    settlements arising out of the Covered Litigation. As a result,
    during the first three months of 2008, the Company reversed
    approximately $15 million of the $23 million accrued
    during the fourth quarter of 2007 for the Covered Litigation,
    adding $9 million to net income ($.08 per diluted common
    share). Subsequently, Visa has announced that it had further
    funded the escrow account to provide for the settlement of
    Covered Litigation. Those subsequent fundings did not result in
    a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial
    position or results of operations as of or for the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008.

The Company resolved certain tax issues during the third quarter
    of 2008 related to its activities in various jurisdictions
    during the years

1999-2007.

As a result, the Company paid $40 million to settle those
    issues, but was able to reduce previously accrued income tax
    expense in 2008 by $40 million, thereby adding $.36 to that
    year’s diluted earnings per common share.

The Company’s financial results for 2007 were also
    adversely impacted by several events. Turmoil in the residential
    real estate market, which began in early 2007, significantly
    affected the Company’s financial results in a number of
    ways. Problems experienced by lenders in the

sub-prime

residential mortgage lending market also had negative
    repercussions on the rest of the residential real estate
    marketplace. Through early 2007, the Company had been an active
    participant in the origination of alternative
    (“Alt-A”) residential real estate loans and the sale
    of such loans in the secondary market. Alt-A loans originated by
    M&T typically included some form of limited documentation
    requirements as compared with more traditional residential real
    estate loans. Unfavorable market conditions during the first
    quarter of 2007, including a lack of liquidity, impacted the
    Company’s willingness to sell Alt-A loans, as an auction of
    such loans initiated by the Company received fewer bids than
    normal and the pricing of those bids was substantially lower
    than expected. As a result, $883 million of Alt-A loans
    previously held for sale (including $808 million of first
    mortgage loans and $75 million of second mortgage loans)
    were transferred in March 2007 to the



Company’s

held-for-investment

loan portfolio. In accordance with GAAP, loans held for sale
    must be recorded at the lower of cost or market value.
    Accordingly, prior to reclassifying the Alt-A mortgage loans to
    the

held-for-investment

portfolio, the carrying value of such loans was reduced by
    $12 million ($7 million after tax effect, or $.07 of
    diluted earnings per common share). Those loans were
    reclassified because management believed at that time that the
    value of the Alt-A residential real estate loans was greater
    than the amount implied by the few bidders who were then active
    in the market. The downturn in the residential real estate
    market, specifically related to declining real estate valuations
    and higher delinquencies, continued throughout the remainder of
    2007 and had a negative effect on the majority of financial
    institutions active in residential real estate lending. As a
    result of retaining those Alt-A residential real estate loans,
    the Company experienced higher loan charge-offs during

2007-2009.

The turbulence in the residential real estate market in 2007
    also negatively affected three CDOs purchased in the first
    quarter of 2007 for approximately $132 million. Although
    these securities were highly rated when purchased, two of the
    three securities were downgraded by the rating agencies in
    late-2007. After a thorough analysis, management concluded that
    the impairment of the market value of these securities was other
    than temporary. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment
    charge of $127 million ($78 million after tax effect,
    or $.71 of diluted earnings per common share) in the fourth
    quarter of 2007.

Finally, as already noted, during the last quarter of 2007, the
    Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $23 million
    ($14 million after tax effect, or $.13 per diluted common
    share) related to the Visa Covered Litigation.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income of $2.08 billion in
    2009 was 6% higher than $1.96 billion in 2008. Contributing
    to the improvement were growth in average earning assets and a
    widening of the Company’s net interest margin, or
    taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage
    of average earning assets. Average earning assets rose 3% to
    $59.6 billion in 2009 from $58.0 billion in 2008,
    largely due to the $5.5 billion of earning assets obtained
    in the Provident and Bradford transactions. Average loans and
    leases totaled $51.0 billion in 2009, up 4% from
    $48.8 billion in 2008. Loans obtained in the 2009
    acquisition transactions were $4.3 billion at the
    respective acquisition dates. Exclusive of acquired loans,
    average loans outstanding during 2009 declined slightly less
    than 1% from 2008. The net interest margin widened 11 basis
    points (hundredths of one percent) to 3.49% in 2009 from 3.38%
    in 2008, largely due to lower interest rates paid on deposits
    and borrowings.

Net interest income expressed on a taxable-equivalent basis in
    2008 rose 5% from $1.87 billion in 2007. The positive
    impact of higher average earning assets was partially offset by
    a decline in net interest margin. Average earning assets
    increased 12% to $58.0 billion in 2008 from
    $52.0 billion in 2007, the result of increased average
    balances of loans and leases and investment securities. Earning
    assets obtained in the fourth quarter 2007 acquisition
    transactions were $3.3 billion. Average loans and leases of
    $48.8 billion in 2008 were $4.7 billion or 11% higher
    than $44.1 billion in 2007, due to growth in commercial
    loans and leases of $1.6 billion, or 13%, commercial real
    estate loans of $2.7 billion, or 17%, and consumer loans
    and leases of $961 million, or 9%, partially offset by a
    $550 million, or 9%, decline in residential real estate
    loans. Reflected in those amounts were loans obtained in the
    2007 acquisition transactions aggregating $2.4 billion at
    the respective acquisition dates, including $259 million of
    commercial loans and leases, $343 million of commercial
    real estate loans, $1.1 billion of residential real estate
    loans and $690 million of consumer loans. Of the
    $1.1 billion of residential real estate loans acquired,
    approximately $950 million were securitized into Fannie Mae
    mortgage-backed securities in December 2007. The acquired loans
    did not have a significant impact on average loans and leases
    for 2007. Average balances of investment securities increased
    23% to $9.0 billion in 2008 from $7.3 billion in 2007.
    The net interest margin declined 22 basis points to 3.38%
    in 2008 from 3.60% in 2007, due to a decrease in the
    contribution ascribed to net interest-free funds that resulted
    largely from the impact of lower interest rates on
    interest-bearing liabilities used to value such funds.

The provision for credit losses rose to $604 million in
    2009 from $412 million in 2008 and $192 million in
    2007. Deteriorating credit conditions that were reflected in
    rising levels of charge-offs and delinquencies, as well as
    rapidly declining residential real estate valuations during 2007
    and continuing in 2008 and 2009 and their impact on the
    Company’s portfolios of residential mortgage loans and
    loans to residential builders and developers, contributed
    significantly to the increases in the



provision. Also contributing to the higher levels of the
    provision, charge-offs and delinquencies in 2008 and 2009 was
    the impact of the condition of the U.S. economy, which was
    in recession. The Company experienced higher levels of
    commercial loan charge-offs during 2009 as the economic
    conditions directly impacted the financial condition of certain
    businesses. Net charge-offs of all loan types were
    $514 million in 2009, up from $383 million in 2008 and
    $114 million in 2007. Net charge-offs as a percentage of
    average loans and leases outstanding rose to 1.01% in 2009 from
    .78% in 2008 and .26% in 2007. The provision in each year
    represents the result of management’s analysis of the
    composition of the loan and lease portfolio and other factors,
    including concern regarding uncertainty about economic
    conditions, both nationally and in many of the markets served by
    the Company, and the impact of such conditions and prospects on
    the abilities of borrowers to repay loans.

Noninterest income in 2009 totaled $1.05 billion, up 12%
    from $939 million in 2008. Gains and losses on bank
    investment securities (including

other-than-temporary

impairment losses) totaled to net losses of $137 million in
    2009 and $148 million in 2008. Those losses were due to

other-than-temporary

impairment charges related to certain of M&T’s
    privately issued CMOs, CDOs and in 2008, preferred stock
    holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, all held in the

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio. The 2008 losses are net of the
    already noted $33 million gain from the sale of shares of
    Visa. Excluding gains and losses from bank investment securities
    and the $29 million gain recorded on the Bradford
    transaction, other income was $1.16 billion in 2009, 6%
    higher than $1.09 billion in 2008. Contributing to that
    improvement were higher mortgage banking revenues and service
    charges on acquisition-related deposit accounts, partially
    offset by declines in trust and brokerage services income.

Noninterest income in 2008 was $6 million higher than
    $933 million in 2007. Reflected in 2007’s total were
    $126 million of losses from bank investment securities.
    Those losses were due predominately to

other-than-temporary

impairment charges related to certain of M&T’s CDOs
    held in the

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio. Excluding the impact of net
    securities losses, noninterest income of $1.09 billion in
    2008 was 3% higher than $1.06 billion in 2007. That rise
    reflected higher mortgage banking revenues and fees for
    providing deposit services that were partially offset by a
    $46 million decline in M&T’s pro-rata portion of
    the operating results of BLG.

Noninterest expense in 2009 totaled $1.98 billion, up 15%
    from $1.73 billion in 2008. Noninterest expense in 2007 was
    $1.63 billion. Included in such amounts are expenses
    considered by M&T to be “nonoperating” in nature,
    consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible
    assets of $64 million, $67 million and
    $66 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and
    merger-related expenses of $89 million in 2009,
    $4 million in 2008 and $15 million in 2007. Exclusive
    of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses
    aggregated $1.83 billion in 2009, $1.66 billion in
    2008 and $1.55 billion in 2007. The most significant
    factors for the higher level of noninterest operating expenses
    in 2009 as compared with 2008 were a $90 million rise in
    FDIC deposit assessments, costs associated with the acquired
    operations of Provident and Bradford, and higher
    foreclosure-related expenses. Partially offsetting those
    increases was a partial reversal of the valuation allowance for
    capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of
    $22 million in 2009, compared with an addition to the
    valuation allowance of $16 million in 2008. Contributing to
    the rise in operating expenses from 2007 to 2008 were higher
    expenses for salaries, occupancy, professional services,
    advertising and promotion, and foreclosed residential real
    estate properties. Partially offsetting those factors was the
    $23 million charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2007
    related to M&T Bank’s obligation as a member bank of
    Visa to share in losses stemming from certain litigation,
    compared with a partial reversal of that charge in the first
    quarter of 2008 of $15 million. Included in operating
    expenses in 2009 were $12 million of tax-deductible
    contributions made to The M&T Charitable Foundation, a
    tax-exempt private charitable foundation. Similar contributions
    of $6 million were made in 2008, whereas no such
    contributions were made in 2007.

The efficiency ratio expresses the relationship of operating
    expenses to revenues. The Company’s efficiency ratio, or
    noninterest operating expenses (as previously defined) divided
    by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and
    noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank
    investment securities and gains on merger transactions), was
    56.5% in 2009, compared with 54.4% in 2008 and 52.8% in 2007.

Supplemental
    Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations

As a result of business combinations and other acquisitions, the
    Company had intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core
    deposit and other intangible assets totaling $3.7 billion
    at December 31, 2009 and $3.4 billion at each of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007. Included in such intangible
    assets was goodwill of $3.5 billion at December 31,
    2009 and $3.2 billion at each of December 31, 2008 and
    2007. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets,
    after tax effect, totaled $39 million, $41 million and
    $40 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

M&T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its
    results on a “net operating” or “tangible”
    basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of
    amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and
    the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other
    intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax
    amounts) and gains and expenses associated with merging acquired
    operations into the Company, since such items are considered by
    management to be “nonoperating” in nature. Although
    “net operating income” as defined by M&T is not a
    GAAP measure, M&T’s management believes that this
    information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition
    activity in reported results.

Net operating income totaled $455 million in 2009, compared
    with $599 million in 2008. Diluted net operating earnings
    per common share in 2009 declined 34% to $3.54 from $5.39 in
    2008. Net operating income and diluted net operating earnings
    per common share were $704 million and $6.40, respectively,
    during 2007.

Net operating income expressed as a rate of return on average
    tangible assets was .71% in 2009, compared with .97% in 2008 and
    1.27% in 2007. Net operating return on average tangible common
    equity was 13.42% in 2009, compared with 19.63% and 22.58% in
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Reconciliations of GAAP amounts with corresponding non-GAAP
    amounts are presented in table 2.

Net
    Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities

Net interest income expressed on a taxable-equivalent basis
    aggregated $2.08 billion in 2009, up 6% from
    $1.96 billion in 2008, the result of growth in average
    earning assets and a widening of the Company’s net interest
    margin. Average earning assets totaled $59.6 billion in
    2009, up 3% from $58.0 billion in 2008. Growth in average
    loan and lease balances outstanding, which rose 4% to
    $51.0 billion in 2009 from $48.8 billion in 2008, was
    partially offset by a decline in average investment securities,
    which decreased 6% to $8.4 billion in 2009 from
    $9.0 billion in 2008. The growth in average loans in 2009
    was predominantly the result of loans obtained in the Provident
    and Bradford transactions. The improvement in the net interest
    margin, which widened 11 basis points to 3.49% in 2009 from
    3.38% in 2008, was largely the result of lower interest rates
    paid on deposits and borrowings.

Average loan and lease balances outstanding increased to
    $51.0 billion in 2009 from $48.8 billion in 2008. That
    growth was predominantly the result of loans acquired in the
    Provident and Bradford transactions of $4.0 billion on
    May 23, 2009 and $302 million on August 28, 2009,
    respectively. In total, the acquired loans consisted of
    approximately $700 million of commercial loans,
    $1.8 billion of commercial real estate loans,
    $400 million of residential real estate loans and
    $1.4 billion of consumer loans. Including the impact of
    acquired loan balances, commercial loans and leases averaged
    $13.9 billion in 2009, up slightly from $13.8 billion
    in 2008; average commercial real estate loans increased 9% to
    $20.1 billion in 2009 from $18.4 billion in 2008;
    average residential real estate loans declined 3% to
    $5.3 billion in 2009 from $5.5 billion in 2008; and
    consumer loans averaged $11.7 billion in 2009, 5% higher
    than $11.2 billion in 2008.

Reflecting growth in average earning assets that was partially
    offset by a narrowing of the net interest margin,
    taxable-equivalent net interest income rose 5% to
    $1.96 billion in 2008 from $1.87 billion in 2007.
    Average earning assets increased $6.0 billion or 12% to
    $58.0 billion in 2008 from $52.0 billion in 2007. That
    growth resulted from a $4.7 billion or 11% increase in
    average outstanding balances of loans and leases and a
    $1.7 billion or 23% rise in average outstanding balances of
    investment securities. The Company’s net interest margin
    declined to 3.38% in 2008 from 3.60% in 2007.

Average loans and leases increased to $48.8 billion in 2008
    from $44.1 billion in 2007. Most of the Company’s
    major loan categories experienced growth during 2008. Average
    commercial loans and leases increased 13% to $13.8 billion
    in 2008 from $12.2 billion in 2007. Commercial real estate
    loans averaged $18.4 billion in 2008, up 17% from
    $15.7 billion in 2007. The Company’s consumer loan
    portfolio averaged $11.2 billion in 2008, 9% higher than
    $10.2 billion in 2007. Average residential real estate
    loans declined 9% to $5.5 billion in 2008 from
    $6.0 billion in 2007, due largely to a $533 million
    decrease in average loans held for sale to $591 million in
    2008 from $1.1 billion in 2007.

Table 4 summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in 2009

Commercial loans and leases, excluding loans secured by real
    estate, aggregated $13.5 billion at December 31, 2009,
    representing 26% of total loans and leases. Table 5 presents
    information on commercial loans and leases as of
    December 31, 2009 relating to geographic area, size,
    borrower industry and whether the loans are secured by
    collateral or unsecured. Of the $13.5 billion of commercial
    loans and leases outstanding at the end of 2009, approximately
    $11.1 billion, or 82%, were secured, while 48%, 23% and 19%
    were granted to businesses in New York State, Pennsylvania and
    the Mid-Atlantic area (which includes Maryland, Delaware,
    Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia),
    respectively. The Company provides financing for leases to
    commercial customers, primarily for equipment. Commercial leases
    included in total commercial loans and leases at
    December 31, 2009 aggregated $1.6 billion, of which
    42% were secured by collateral located in New York State, 16%
    were secured by collateral in the Mid-Atlantic area and another
    10% were secured by collateral in Pennsylvania.

International loans included in commercial loans and leases
    totaled $55 million and $91 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company
    participates in the insurance and guarantee programs of the
    Export-Import Bank of the United States. These programs provide
    U.S. government repayment coverage of 90% to 100% on loans
    supporting foreign borrowers’ purchases of U.S. goods
    and services and coverage of 90% on loans to U.S. exporters
    of goods and services to foreign buyers. The loans generally
    range up to $10 million. The outstanding balances of loans
    under these programs at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were
    $43 million and $76 million, respectively.

Loans secured by real estate, including outstanding balances of
    home equity loans and lines of credit which the Company
    classifies as consumer loans, represented approximately 62% of
    the loan and lease portfolio during 2009, compared with 60% in
    2008 and 61% in 2007. At December 31, 2009, the Company
    held approximately $20.9 billion of commercial real estate
    loans, $5.5 billion of consumer real estate loans secured
    by

one-to-four

family residential properties (including $530 million of
    loans held for sale) and $6.8 billion of outstanding
    balances of home equity loans and lines of credit, compared with
    $18.8 billion, $4.9 billion and $5.7 billion,
    respectively, at December 31, 2008. Loans obtained in the
    2009 Provident and Bradford acquisition transactions included
    $1.8 billion of commercial real estate loans,
    $400 million of consumer real estate loans secured by

one-to-four

family residential mortgages and $1.1 billion of
    outstanding home equity loans and lines of credit. Included in
    total loans and leases were amounts due from builders and
    developers of residential real estate aggregating
    $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively, of which $1.6 billion and
    $1.8 billion, respectively, were classified as commercial
    real estate loans.

A significant portion of commercial real estate loans originated
    by the Company are secured by properties in the New York City
    metropolitan area, including areas in neighboring states
    generally considered to be within commuting distance of New York
    City, and other areas of New York State where the Company
    operates. Commercial real estate loans are also originated
    through the Company’s offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland,
    Virginia, Washington, D.C., Oregon, West Virginia and other
    states. Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company
    include fixed-rate instruments with monthly payments and a
    balloon payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity,
    in many cases five years after origination. For borrowers in
    good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the
    customer for an additional five years at the then current market
    rate of interest. The Company also originates fixed-rate
    commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater than
    five years, generally having original maturity terms of
    approximately seven to ten years, and adjustable-rate commercial
    real estate loans. Excluding construction and development loans
    made to investors, adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans
    represented approximately 46% of the commercial real estate loan
    portfolio as of December 31, 2009. Table 6 presents
    commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of
    collateral and size of the loans outstanding at
    December 31, 2009. New York City metropolitan area
    commercial real estate loans totaled $7.1 billion at the
    2009 year-end. The $6.0 billion of investor-owned
    commercial real estate loans in the New York City metropolitan
    area were largely secured by multifamily residential properties,
    retail space, and office space. The Company’s experience
    has been that office, retail and service-related properties tend
    to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through
    economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do
    multifamily residential properties. Approximately 49% of the
    aggregate dollar amount of New York City-area loans were for
    loans with outstanding balances of $10 million or less,
    while loans of more than $50 million made up approximately
    15% of the total.

Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located in
    other parts of New York State, Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic
    area tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and
    include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the
    mortgaged property in their trade or business (owner-occupied).
    Approximately 82% of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial
    real estate loans in New York State secured by properties
    located outside of the metropolitan New York City area were for
    loans with outstanding balances of $10 million or less. Of
    the outstanding balances of commercial real



estate loans in Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area,
    approximately 74% and 67%, respectively, were for loans with
    outstanding balances of $10 million or less.

Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located
    outside of Pennsylvania, the Mid-Atlantic area, New York State
    and areas of states neighboring New York considered to be part
    of the New York City metropolitan area, comprised 7% of total
    commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2009.

Commercial real estate construction and development loans made
    to investors presented in table 6 totaled $4.4 billion at
    December 31, 2009, or 8% of total loans and leases.
    Approximately 78% of those construction loans had adjustable
    interest rates. Included in such loans at December 31, 2009
    were $1.6 billion of loans to developers of residential
    real estate properties. Information about the credit performance
    of the Company’s loans to builders and developers of
    residential real estate properties is included herein under the
    heading “Provision For Credit Losses.” The remainder
    of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio was
    comprised of loans made for various purposes, including the
    construction of office buildings, multifamily residential
    housing, retail space and other commercial development.

M&T Realty Capital Corporation, a commercial real estate
    lending subsidiary of M&T Bank, participates in the Fannie
    Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (“DUS”)
    program, pursuant to which commercial real estate loans are
    originated in accordance with terms and conditions specified by
    Fannie Mae and sold. Under this program, loans are sold with
    partial credit recourse to M&T Realty Capital Corporation.
    The amount of recourse is generally limited to one-third of any
    credit loss incurred by the purchaser on an individual loan,
    although in some cases the recourse amount is less than
    one-third of the outstanding principal balance. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately $1.3 billion
    and $1.2 billion, respectively, of commercial real estate
    loan balances serviced for others had been sold with recourse.
    There have been no material losses incurred as a result of those
    recourse arrangements. Commercial real estate loans held for
    sale at December 31, 2009 and 2008 aggregated
    $123 million and $156 million, respectively. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, commercial real estate loans
    serviced for other investors by the Company were
    $7.1 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively. Those
    serviced loans are not included in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet.

Real estate loans secured by

one-to-four

family residential properties were $5.5 billion at
    December 31, 2009, including approximately 36% secured by
    properties located in New York State, 12% secured by properties
    located in Pennsylvania and 21% secured by properties located in
    the Mid-Atlantic area. At December 31, 2009,
    $530 million of residential real estate loans were held for
    sale, compared with $352 million at December 31, 2008.
    The Company’s portfolio of Alt-A loans held for investment
    at December 31, 2009 totaled $789 million, compared
    with $974 million at December 31, 2008. Loans to
    individuals to finance the construction of

one-to-four

family residential properties totaled $76 million at
    December 31, 2009, or approximately .1% of total loans and
    leases, compared with $233 million or .5% at
    December 31, 2008. Information about the credit performance
    of the Company’s Alt-A mortgage loans and other residential
    mortgage loans is included herein under the heading
    “Provision For Credit Losses.”

Consumer loans comprised approximately 23% of the average loan
    portfolio during each of 2009 and 2008. The two largest
    components of the consumer loan portfolio are outstanding
    balances of home equity lines of credit and automobile loans.
    Average balances of home equity lines of credit outstanding
    represented approximately 11% and 9% of average loans
    outstanding in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Automobile loans
    represented approximately 6% and 7% of the Company’s
    average loan portfolio during 2009 and 2008, respectively. No
    other consumer loan product represented more than 4% of average
    loans outstanding in 2009. Approximately 44% of home equity
    lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2009 were
    secured by properties in New York State, and 19% and 35% were
    secured by properties in Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area,
    respectively. Average outstanding balances on home equity lines
    of credit were approximately $5.4 billion and
    $4.5 billion in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At
    December 31, 2009, 34% and 24% of the automobile loan
    portfolio were to customers residing in New York State and
    Pennsylvania, respectively. Although automobile loans have
    generally been originated through dealers, all applications
    submitted through dealers are subject to the Company’s
    normal underwriting and loan approval procedures. Outstanding
    automobile loan balances declined to $2.9 billion at
    December 31, 2009 from $3.3 billion at
    December 31, 2008.



Table 7 presents the composition of the Company’s loan and
    lease portfolio at the end of 2009, including outstanding
    balances to businesses and consumers in New York State,
    Pennsylvania, the Mid-Atlantic area and other states.
    Approximately 47% of total loans and leases at December 31,
    2009 were to New York State customers, while 18% and 23% were to
    Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area customers, respectively.

Balances of investment securities averaged $8.4 billion in
    2009, compared with $9.0 billion and $7.3 billion in
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The decline in average investment
    securities balances during 2009 as compared with 2008 largely
    reflects paydowns of mortgage-backed securities, partially
    offset by the investment securities obtained in the Provident
    transaction and the impact of a first quarter 2009 residential
    real estate loan securitization. The Company securitized
    approximately $141 million of residential real estate loans
    in a guaranteed mortgage securitization with Fannie Mae. The
    increase of $1.7 billion or 23% from 2007 to 2008 was
    largely due to the impact of residential real estate loan
    securitizations in June and July of 2008 and in December 2007
    and to the full-year impact of third quarter 2007 purchases of
    approximately $800 million of collateralized mortgage
    obligations and other mortgage-backed securities. During June
    and July 2008, the Company securitized approximately
    $875 million of residential real estate loans in guaranteed
    mortgage securitizations with Fannie Mae. During December 2007,
    approximately $950 million of residential real estate loans
    obtained in the Partners Trust acquisition were securitized in a
    guaranteed mortgage securitization with Fannie Mae. The Company
    recognized no gain or loss on those securitization transactions
    as it retained all of the resulting securities, which are held
    in the

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio.



The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of
    residential mortgage-backed securities and CMOs, debt securities
    issued by municipalities, debt and preferred equity securities
    issued by government-sponsored agencies and certain financial
    institutions, and shorter-term U.S. Treasury and federal
    agency notes. When purchasing investment securities, the Company
    considers its overall interest-rate risk profile as well as the
    adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed,
    including prepayments. In managing the investment securities
    portfolio, the Company occasionally sells investment securities
    as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads, actual or
    anticipated prepayments, credit risk associated with a
    particular security, or as a result of restructuring its
    investment securities portfolio following completion of a
    business combination.

During the third quarter of 2008, the Company purchased a
    $142 million AAA-rated private placement mortgage-backed
    security that had been securitized by Bayview Financial
    Holdings, L.P. (together with its affiliates, “Bayview
    Financial”). Bayview Financial is a privately-held company
    and is the majority investor of BLG. Upon purchase, the security
    was placed in the Company’s

held-to-maturity

portfolio, as management determined that it had the intent and
    ability to hold the security to maturity. Management
    subsequently reconsidered whether certain other similar
    mortgage-backed securities previously purchased from Bayview
    Financial and held in the Company’s

available-for-sale

portfolio should more appropriately be in the

held-to-maturity

portfolio. Concluding that it had the intent and ability to hold
    those securities to maturity as well, the Company transferred
    CMOs having a fair value of $298 million and a cost basis
    of $385 million from its

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio to the

held-to-maturity

portfolio during the third quarter of 2008.

The Company regularly reviews its investment securities for
    declines in value below amortized cost that might be
    characterized as “other than temporary.” As previously
    discussed,

other-than-temporary

impairment charges of $138 million (pre-tax) were
    recognized during 2009 related to certain privately issued CMOs
    and CDOs held in the Company’s

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio. Specifically, $130 million
    of such impairment charges related to privately issued CMOs and
    CDOs backed by residential real estate loans and $8 million
    related to CDOs backed by trust preferred securities of
    financial institutions. During the third quarter of 2008 the
    Company recognized an

other-than-temporary

impairment charge of $153 million related to its holdings
    of preferred stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Additional

other-than-temporary

impairment charges of $29 million were recognized in 2008
    on CMOs backed by option adjustable rate residential mortgage
    loans (“ARMs”) and CDOs backed by trust preferred
    securities of financial institutions. Poor economic conditions,
    high unemployment and depressed real estate values are
    significant factors contributing to the recognition of the

other-than-temporary

impairment charges. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
    Company concluded that the remaining declines associated with
    the rest of the investment securities portfolio were temporary
    in nature. That conclusion was based on management’s
    assessment of future cash flows associated with individual
    investment securities as of each respective date. A further
    discussion of fair values of investment securities is included
    herein under the heading “Capital.” Additional
    information about the investment securities portfolio is
    included in notes 3 and 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Other earning assets include deposits at banks, trading account
    assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities.
    Those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged
    $189 million in 2009, $198 million in 2008 and
    $503 million in 2007. Reflected in those balances were
    purchases of investment securities under agreements to resell,
    which averaged $41 million, $96 million and
    $417 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    higher level of resell agreements in 2007 as compared with 2008
    and 2009 was due, in part, to the need to collateralize deposits
    of municipalities. The amounts of investment securities and
    other earning assets held by the Company are influenced by such
    factors as demand for loans, which generally yield more than
    investment securities and other earning assets, ongoing
    repayments, the levels of deposits, and management of balance
    sheet size and resulting capital ratios.

The most significant source of funding for the Company is core
    deposits, which are comprised of noninterest-bearing deposits,
    nonbrokered interest-bearing transaction accounts, nonbrokered
    savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under
    $100,000. The Company’s branch network is its principal
    source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest
    rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities.
    Certificates of deposit under $100,000 generated on a nationwide
    basis by M&T



Bank, N.A. are also included in core deposits. Core deposits
    averaged $39.1 billion in 2009, up from $31.7 billion
    in 2008 and $28.6 billion in 2007. The acquisition
    transactions in 2009 added $3.8 billion of core deposits on
    the respective acquisition dates, while the late-2007
    acquisition transactions added $2.0 billion of core
    deposits on the respective acquisition dates. Average core
    deposits of M&T Bank, N.A. were $337 million in 2009,
    $274 million in 2008 and $208 million in 2007.
    Excluding deposits obtained in the acquisition transactions, the
    growth in core deposits from 2008 to 2009 was due, in part, to
    the impact on the attractiveness of alternative investments to
    the Company’s customers resulting from lower interest rates
    and the recessionary environment in the U.S. The continuing
    low interest rate environment has resulted in a shift in
    customer savings trends, as average time deposits have continued
    to decline, while average noninterest-bearing deposits and
    savings deposits have increased. Funding provided by core
    deposits represented 66% of average earning assets in 2009, up
    significantly from 55% in each of 2008 and 2007. Core deposits
    totaled $43.1 billion at December 31, 2009, compared
    with $34.3 billion at December 31, 2008. Table 8
    summarizes average core deposits in 2009 and percentage changes
    in the components of such deposits over the past two years.

Domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more, deposits originated
    through the Company’s offshore branch office, and brokered
    deposits provide additional funding sources for the Company.
    Domestic time deposits over $100,000, excluding brokered
    certificates of deposit, averaged $2.6 billion in each of
    2009 and 2008, and $2.7 billion in 2007. Offshore branch
    deposits, primarily comprised of accounts with balances of
    $100,000 or more, averaged $1.7 billion in 2009,
    $4.0 billion in 2008 and $4.2 billion in 2007. Average
    brokered time deposits totaled $822 million in 2009,
    compared with $1.4 billion in 2008 and $2.1 billion in
    2007, and at December 31, 2009 and 2008 totaled
    $868 million and $487 million, respectively. Reflected
    in average brokered time deposits in 2009 were deposits obtained
    in the acquisition of Provident, which added approximately
    $601 million to the average 2009 total. In connection with
    the Company’s management of interest rate risk, interest
    rate swap agreements have been entered into under which the
    Company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable
    rate and that have notional amounts and terms substantially
    similar to the amounts and terms of $25 million of brokered
    time deposits. The Company also had brokered NOW and brokered
    money-market deposit accounts, which in the aggregate averaged
    $757 million, $218 million and $87 million in
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The significant increase in
    such average brokered deposit balances in 2009 as compared with
    2008 and 2007 was the result of demand for such deposits,
    largely resulting from the uncertain economic markets and the
    desire of brokerage firms to earn reasonable yields while
    ensuring that customer deposits were fully insured. Offshore
    branch deposits and brokered deposits have been used by the
    Company as alternatives to short-term borrowings. Additional
    amounts of offshore branch deposits or brokered deposits may be
    added in the future depending on market conditions, including
    demand by customers and other investors for those deposits, and
    the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time.

The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers,
    various Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”), the Federal
    Reserve and others as sources of funding. Short-term borrowings
    averaged



$2.9 billion in 2009, $6.1 billion in 2008 and
    $5.4 billion in 2007. Included in short-term borrowings
    were unsecured federal funds borrowings, which generally mature
    on the next business day, that averaged $1.8 billion,
    $4.5 billion and $4.6 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Overnight federal funds borrowings represented the
    largest component of average short-term borrowings and were
    obtained from a wide variety of banks and other financial
    institutions. Overnight federal funds borrowings totaled
    $2.1 billion at December 31, 2009 and
    $809 million at December 31, 2008. Average short-term
    borrowings during 2009, 2008 and 2007 included
    $688 million, $682 million and $160 million,
    respectively, of borrowings from the FHLB of New York and the
    FHLB of Atlanta. Also included in average short-term borrowings
    in 2009 and 2008 were secured borrowings with the Federal
    Reserve through their Term Auction Facility (“TAF”).
    Borrowings under the TAF averaged $268 million and
    $238 million during 2009 and 2008, respectively. There were
    no outstanding borrowings under the TAF at December 31,
    2009, while at December 31, 2008 $1.0 billion were
    outstanding. Also included in average short-term borrowings in
    2007 and 2008 was a $500 million revolving asset-backed
    structured borrowing secured by automobile loans that was paid
    off during late-2008. All of the available amount of that
    structured borrowing was in use at the 2007 year-end. The
    average balance of this borrowing was $463 million in 2008
    and $437 million in 2007.

Long-term borrowings averaged $11.1 billion in 2009,
    $11.6 billion in 2008 and $8.4 billion in 2007.
    Included in average long-term borrowings were amounts borrowed
    from the FHLBs of $6.1 billion in 2009, $6.7 billion
    in 2008 and $4.3 billion in 2007, and subordinated capital
    notes of $1.9 billion in each of 2009 and 2008, and
    $1.6 billion in 2007. The Company has utilized interest
    rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of
    certain components of long-term debt. Those swap agreements are
    used to hedge approximately $1.0 billion of fixed rate
    subordinated notes. Further information on interest rate swap
    agreements is provided in note 18 of Notes to Financial
    Statements. Junior subordinated debentures associated with trust
    preferred securities that were included in average long-term
    borrowings were $1.1 billion in each of 2009 and 2008, and
    $716 million in 2007. Additional information regarding
    junior subordinated debentures, as well as information regarding
    contractual maturities of long-term borrowings, is provided in
    note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. Also included in
    long-term borrowings were agreements to repurchase securities,
    which averaged $1.6 billion during 2009, 2008 and 2007. The
    agreements, which were entered into due to favorable rates
    available, have various repurchase dates through 2017, however,
    the contractual maturities of the underlying securities extend
    beyond such repurchase dates.

Changes in the composition of the Company’s earning assets
    and interest-bearing liabilities as described herein, as well as
    changes in interest rates and spreads, can impact net interest
    income. Net interest spread, or the difference between the yield
    on earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing
    liabilities, was 3.21% in 2009, compared with 3.01% in 2008. The
    yield on the Company’s earning assets during 2009 was
    4.61%, down 108 basis points from 5.69% in 2008, while the
    rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities declined
    128 basis points to 1.40% in 2009 from 2.68% in 2008. The
    yield on earning assets of 5.69% during 2008 was 117 basis
    points lower than 6.86% in 2007, while the rate paid on
    interest-bearing liabilities also decreased 117 basis
    points to 2.68% from 3.85% in 2007. The lower interest rates in
    2009 as compared with 2008 and in 2008 as compared with 2007
    reflect the impact of the recessionary economy and the Federal
    Reserve’s monetary policies on both short-term and
    long-term interest rates. In addition, the Federal Open Market
    Committee noted in January 2010 that low rates of resource
    utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation
    expectations were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of
    the federal funds rate for an extended period of time. During
    2008, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark overnight
    federal funds target rate seven times representing decreases of
    400 basis points for the year, such that, at
    December 31, 2008 and 2009, the Federal Reserve’s
    target rate for overnight federal funds was expressed as a range
    from 0% to .25%. Additionally, in the last four months of 2007,
    the Federal Reserve lowered its federal funds target rate three
    times totaling 100 basis points.

Net interest-free funds consist largely of noninterest-bearing
    demand deposits and stockholders’ equity, partially offset
    by bank owned life insurance and non-earning assets, including
    goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets. Net
    interest-free funds averaged $11.7 billion in 2009,
    compared with $8.1 billion in 2008 and $7.9 billion in
    2007. The significant increase in average net interest-free
    funds in



2009 was largely the result of higher average balances of
    noninterest-bearing deposits, which rose to $11.1 billion
    in 2009 from $7.7 billion in 2008. In connection with the
    Provident and Bradford transactions, the Company added
    noninterest-bearing deposits totaling $946 million at the
    respective acquisition dates. Goodwill and core deposit and
    other intangible assets averaged $3.6 billion in 2009,
    $3.4 billion in 2008, and $3.2 billion in 2007. The
    cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged
    $1.4 billion in 2009, $1.2 billion in 2008 and
    $1.1 billion in 2007. Increases in the cash surrender value
    of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest
    income, but rather are recorded in “other revenues from
    operations.” The contribution of net interest-free funds to
    net interest margin was .28% in 2009, .37% in 2008 and .59% in
    2007. The decline in the contribution to net interest margin
    ascribed to net interest free funds in 2009 as compared with
    2008 and in 2008 as compared with 2007 resulted largely from the
    impact of significantly lower interest rates on interest-bearing
    liabilities used to value such contribution.

Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the
    contribution of interest-free funds as described herein, the
    Company’s net interest margin was 3.49% in 2009, compared
    with 3.38% in 2008 and 3.60% in 2007. Future changes in market
    interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition
    of the Company’s portfolios of earning assets and
    interest-bearing liabilities that result in reductions in
    spreads, could adversely impact the Company’s net interest
    income and net interest margin.

Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in
    interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income
    under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate
    risk, the Company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to
    modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its
    portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
    Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are
    generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or the
    rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The notional amount
    of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate
    risk management purposes was approximately $1.1 billion at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, all of which were designated as
    fair value hedges of certain fixed rate time deposits and
    long-term borrowings. Under the terms of those swap agreements,
    the Company received payments based on the outstanding notional
    amount of the agreements at fixed rates and made payments at
    variable rates. There were no interest rate swap agreements
    designated as cash flow hedges at those respective dates.

In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the
    interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of
    the hedged item are recorded in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in
    current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair
    value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items
    represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in “other
    revenues from operations” in the Company’s
    consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, unlike
    in a fair value hedge, the effective portion of the
    derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a
    component of other comprehensive income and subsequently
    reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction
    affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is
    reported in “other revenues from operations”
    immediately. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in
    2009, 2008 and 2007 were not material to the Company’s
    results of operations. The estimated aggregate fair value of
    interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges
    represented gains of approximately $54 million at
    December 31, 2009 and $146 million at
    December 31, 2008. The fair values of such swap agreements
    were substantially offset by changes in the fair values of the
    hedged items. The changes in the fair values of the interest
    rate swap agreements and the hedged items primarily result from
    the effects of changing interest rates and spreads. The
    Company’s credit exposure as of December 31, 2009 with
    respect to the estimated fair value of interest rate swap
    agreements used for managing interest rate risk has been
    substantially mitigated through master netting arrangements with
    trading account interest rate contracts with the same
    counterparty as well as counterparty postings of
    $35 million of collateral with the Company. Additional
    information about swap agreements and the items being hedged is
    included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. The
    average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements

Provision
    for Credit Losses

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in
    management’s judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent
    in the loan and lease portfolio. A provision for credit losses
    is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed
    necessary by management. The provision for credit losses was
    $604 million in 2009, up from $412 million in 2008 and
    $192 million in 2007. Net loan charge-offs increased to
    $514 million in 2009 from $383 million and
    $114 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net loan
    charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were
    1.01% in 2009, compared with .78% in 2008 and .26% in 2007. The
    significantly higher levels of the provision for credit losses
    in 2008 and 2009 as compared with 2007 reflect a pronounced
    downturn in the U.S. economy, which entered recession in
    late-2007, and significant deterioration in the residential real
    estate market that began in early-2007 and continued throughout
    2008 and 2009. Declining real estate valuations and higher
    levels of delinquencies and charge-offs throughout 2007, 2008
    and 2009 significantly affected the quality of the
    Company’s residential real estate loan portfolio.
    Specifically, the Company’s Alt-A residential real estate
    loan portfolio and its residential real estate builder and
    developer loan portfolio experienced the majority of the credit
    problems related to the turmoil in the residential real estate
    marketplace. As a result of higher unemployment levels and the
    recessionary economy, the Company also experienced increased
    levels of consumer and commercial loan charge-offs in 2009 and
    2008 as compared with 2007. A summary of the Company’s loan
    charge-offs, provision and allowance for credit losses is
    presented in table 10.

As already noted, loans acquired in connection with the
    Provident and Bradford transactions were recorded at fair value
    with no carry over of any previously recorded allowance for
    credit losses. Determining the fair value of the acquired loans
    required estimating cash flows expected to be collected on the
    loans and discounting those cash flows at current interest
    rates. The excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the
    estimated fair value is recognized as interest income over the
    remaining lives of the loans. The difference between
    contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash
    flows expected to be collected at acquisition reflects estimated
    credit losses and other contractually required payments that the
    Company does not expect to collect. Subsequent decreases to the
    expected cash flows will require the Company to evaluate the
    need for an additional allowance for credit losses and could
    lead to charge-offs of acquired loan balances. Subsequent
    increases in expected cash flows will result in additional
    interest income to be recognized over the then-remaining lives
    of the loans.

Nonaccrual loans aggregated $1.33 billion or 2.56% of
    outstanding loans and leases at December 31, 2009, compared
    with $755 million or 1.54% at December 31, 2008 and
    $431 million or .90% at December 31, 2007. Major
    factors contributing to the rise in nonaccrual loans from
    December 31, 2008



to the 2009 year-end were a $209 million increase in
    commercial loans and leases and a $319 million increase in
    commercial real estate loans, including a $113 million rise
    in loans to builders and developers of residential real estate.
    Contributing to the increase in nonaccrual loans from the
    2007 year-end to December 31, 2008 were a
    $124 million increase in loans to residential builders and
    developers and a $75 million increase in residential real
    estate loans. The continuing turbulence in the residential real
    estate marketplace has resulted in deteriorating real estate
    values and increased delinquencies, both for loans to consumers
    and loans to builders and developers of residential real estate.
    The recessionary state of the U.S. economy has resulted in
    generally higher levels of nonaccrual loans.

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were
    $208 million or .40% of total loans and leases at
    December 31, 2009, compared with $159 million or .32%
    at December 31, 2008 and $77 million or .16% at
    December 31, 2007. Those loans included loans guaranteed by
    government-related entities of $193 million,
    $114 million and $73 million at December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Such guaranteed loans
    included

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company that
    were repurchased to reduce associated servicing costs, including
    a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that
    had not been received from individual mortgagors. Despite the
    loans being purchased by the Company, the insurance or guarantee
    by the applicable government-related entity remains in force.
    The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans are
    fully guaranteed by government-related entities and totaled
    $176 million at December 31, 2009, $108 million
    at December 31, 2008 and $67 million at
    December 31, 2007. Loans past due 90 days or more and
    accruing interest that were guaranteed by government-related
    entities also included foreign commercial and industrial loans
    supported by the Export-Import Bank of the United States that
    totaled $13 million at December 31, 2009 and
    $5 million at each of December 31, 2008 and 2007. A
    summary of nonperforming assets and certain past due,
    renegotiated and impaired loan data and credit quality ratios is

Accruing loans that were
    impaired at acquisition date and recorded at fair
    value.



Loans obtained in the 2009 acquisition transactions that were
    impaired at the date of acquisition were recorded at estimated
    fair value and are generally delinquent in payments, but, in
    accordance with GAAP the Company continues to accrue interest
    income on such loans based on the estimated expected cash flows
    associated with the loans. The carrying amount of such loans was
    $88 million at December 31, 2009, or approximately .2%
    of total loans.

In an effort to assist borrowers, the Company has modified the
    terms of select loans secured by residential real estate. The
    modified loans were largely from the Company’s portfolio of
    Alt-A loans and aggregated $292 million at
    December 31, 2009, of which $108 million were
    classified as nonaccrual. The remaining modified loans have
    demonstrated payment capability consistent with the modified
    terms and, accordingly, were classified as renegotiated loans
    and were accruing interest at the 2009 year-end. Loan
    modifications included such actions as the extension of loan
    maturity dates (generally from thirty to forty years) and the
    lowering of interest rates and monthly payments. The objective
    of the modifications was to increase loan repayments by
    customers and thereby reduce net charge-offs. In accordance with
    GAAP, the modified loans are included in impaired loans for
    purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses.
    Modified residential real estate loans totaled $162 million
    at December 31, 2008, of which $93 million were in
    nonaccrual status.

Net charge-offs of commercial loans and leases totaled
    $172 million in 2009, $94 million in 2008 and
    $24 million in 2007. Contributing to the rise in such
    charge-offs in 2009 were a $45 million partial charge-off
    of an unsecured loan to a single customer in the commercial real
    estate sector and a $42 million partial charge-off of a
    relationship with an operator of retirement communities. The
    rise in net charge-offs of commercial loans and leases from 2007
    to 2008 was largely due to charge-offs of loans to a consumer
    debt collections company, loans to two customers in the
    publishing business, and three loans to automobile dealers.
    Nonaccrual commercial loans and leases were $322 million at
    December 31, 2009, $114 million at December 31,
    2008 and $79 million at December 31, 2007. The rise in
    2009 reflects the impact of general economic conditions on
    borrowers’ abilities to repay loans. Specifically
    contributing to the increase were a relationship to a single
    borrower that operates retirement communities
    ($41 million), a $37 million loan to a consumer
    finance and credit insurance company, a loan to a single
    borrower in the commercial real estate sector ($36 million)
    and a $22 million loan to a business in the health care
    sector. The increase from the 2007 year-end to
    December 31, 2008 reflects the net addition of
    relationships with automobile dealers totaling $12 million.

Net charge-offs of commercial real estate loans during 2009,
    2008 and 2007 were $121 million, $112 million and
    $6 million, respectively. Reflected in 2009’s
    charge-offs were $92 million of loans to residential real
    estate builders and developers, compared with $100 million
    in 2008 and $4 million in 2007. Commercial real estate
    loans classified as nonaccrual totaled $638 million at
    December 31, 2009, compared with $319 million at
    December 31, 2008 and $118 million at
    December 31, 2007. Contributing to the rise in such loans
    from December 31, 2008 to the 2009 year-end were an
    increase of $113 million in loans to residential
    homebuilders and developers and a loan collateralized by real
    estate in New York City ($104 million). The rise in such
    loans during 2008 was largely the result of an increase of
    $124 million in loans to residential homebuilders and
    developers, reflecting the impact of the deterioration of the
    residential real estate market, including declining real estate
    values. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, loans to residential
    homebuilders and developers classified as nonaccrual aggregated
    $322 million and $209 million, respectively.
    Information about the location of nonaccrual and charged-off
    loans to residential real estate builders and developers as of
    and for the year ended December 31, 2009 is presented in

Includes approximately
    $.1 billion of loans either not secured by real estate or
    permanent loans to investors of apartments/multifamily
    properties.

Residential real estate loans charged off, net of recoveries,
    were $92 million in 2009, $63 million in 2008 and
    $19 million in 2007. Nonaccrual residential real estate
    loans at the end of 2009 totaled $281 million, compared
    with $256 million and $181 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Declining real
    estate values and higher levels of delinquencies have
    contributed to the higher levels of residential real estate
    loans classified as nonaccrual at the 2008 and
    2009 year-ends as compared with December 31, 2007 and
    to the level of charge-offs, largely in the Company’s Alt-A
    portfolio. Net charge-offs of Alt-A loans were $52 million
    in 2009, $44 million in 2008 and $12 million in 2007.
    Nonaccrual Alt-A loans aggregated $112 million at the
    2009 year-end, compared with $125 million and
    $90 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Residential real estate loans past due
    90 days or more and accruing interest totaled
    $178 million, $108 million and $66 million at
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. A
    substantial portion of such amounts related to guaranteed loans
    repurchased from government-related entities. Information about
    the location of nonaccrual and charged-off residential real
    estate loans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009
    is presented in table 13.

Net charge-offs of consumer loans during 2009 were
    $129 million, representing 1.10% of average consumer loans
    and leases outstanding, compared with $114 million or 1.03%
    in 2008 and $65 million or .63% in 2007. Automobile loans
    represented the most significant category of consumer loan
    charge-offs during the past three years. Net charge-offs of
    automobile loans were $56 million during 2009,
    $51 million during 2008 and $28 million during 2007.
    Consumer loan charge-offs also include recreational vehicle
    loans of $25 million, $21 million and $11 million
    during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and home equity loans
    and lines of credit secured by

one-to-four

family residential properties of $39 million during 2009,
    $31 million during 2008 and $16 million during 2007.
    Nonaccrual consumer loans were $91 million at
    December 31, 2009, representing .75% of outstanding
    consumer loans, compared with $66 million or .60% at
    December 31, 2008, and $53 million or .47% at
    December 31, 2007. At the 2009, 2008 and
    2007 year-ends, consumer loans and leases delinquent

30-90 days

totaled $141 million, $118 million and
    $155 million, respectively, or 1.17%, 1.07% and 1.38% of
    outstanding consumer loans. Consumer loans past due 90 days
    or more and accruing interest totaled $4 million at
    December 31, 2009 and $1 million at each of
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. Information

Management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for
    credit losses by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and
    lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing
    economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial
    condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in
    which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the
    value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of
    any guarantees or indemnifications. Management evaluated the
    impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic
    conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment
    obligations when quantifying the Company’s exposure to
    credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the Company’s
    allowance for such losses as of each reporting date. Factors
    also considered by management when performing its assessment, in
    addition to general economic conditions and the other factors
    described above, included, but were not limited to: (i) the
    impact of declining residential real estate values in the
    Company’s portfolio of loans to residential real estate
    builders and developers; (ii) the repayment performance
    associated with the Company’s portfolio of Alt-A and other
    residential mortgage loans; (iii) the concentration of
    commercial real estate loans in the Company’s loan
    portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured
    by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York
    City metropolitan area, in particular; (iv) the amount of
    commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New
    York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in
    central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less
    economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other
    regions of the country; and (v) the size of the
    Company’s portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which
    historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a
    percentage of loans outstanding than other loan types and for
    which repayment performance can be significantly affected by
    unemployment levels. The level of the allowance is adjusted
    based on the results of management’s analysis.

Management cautiously and conservatively evaluated the allowance
    for credit losses as of December 31, 2009 in light of
    (i) lower residential real estate values and higher levels
    of delinquencies of residential real estate loans; (ii) the
    recession-like weak economic conditions in many of the markets
    served by the Company; (iii) continuing weakness in
    industrial employment in upstate New York and central
    Pennsylvania; (iv) the significant subjectivity involved in
    commercial real estate valuations for properties located in
    areas with stagnant or low growth economies; and (v) the
    amount of loan growth experienced by the Company. Considerable
    concerns exist about the economic recovery in both national and
    international markets; the level and volatility of energy
    prices; a weakened housing market; the troubled state of
    financial and credit markets; Federal Reserve positioning of
    monetary policy; high levels of unemployment, which has caused
    consumer spending to slow; the underlying impact on
    businesses’ operations and abilities to repay loans as
    consumer spending slowed; continued stagnant population growth
    in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions; and
    continued uncertainty about possible responses to state
    government budget deficits. Although the U.S. economy
    experienced recession and weak economic conditions during much
    of the last three years, as compared with other areas of the
    country, the impact of those conditions was not as pronounced on
    borrowers in the traditionally slower growth or stagnant regions
    of upstate New York and central Pennsylvania. Approximately
    one-half of the Company’s loans are to customers in upstate
    New York and Pennsylvania. Home prices in upstate New York and
    central Pennsylvania were largely unchanged in 2009, in contrast
    to steep declines in values in other regions of the country.
    Therefore, despite the conditions, as previously described, the
    most severe credit issues experienced by the Company have been
    centered around residential real estate, including loans to
    builders and developers of residential real estate, in areas
    other than New York State and Pennsylvania. In response,
    throughout 2008 and 2009 the Company has conducted detailed
    reviews of all loans to residential real estate builders and
    developers that exceeded $2.5 million. Those credit reviews
    often resulted in adjustments to loan grades and, if
    appropriate, commencement of intensified collection efforts,
    including foreclosure. During 2009, the Company has also
    experienced increases in nonaccrual commercial loans, largely
    the result of a small number of large relationships, and in
    nonaccrual commercial real estate loans, largely due to builders
    and developers of residential real estate and one large loan in
    New York City. The Company utilizes an extensive loan grading
    system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real
    estate loans. On a quarterly basis, the Company’s loan
    review department reviews all commercial and commercial real
    estate loans greater than $350,000 that are classified as
    Special Mention or worse. Meetings are held with loan officers
    and their managers, workout specialists and Senior Management to
    discuss each of the relationships. Borrower-specific information
    is



reviewed, including operating results, future cash flows, recent
    developments and the borrower’s outlook, and other
    pertinent data. The timing and extent of potential losses,
    considering collateral valuation, and the Company’s
    potential courses of action are reviewed. To the extent that
    these loans are collateral-dependent, they are evaluated based
    on the fair value of the loan’s collateral as estimated at
    or near the financial statement date. As the quality of a loan
    deteriorates to the point of classifying the loan as Special
    Mention, the process of obtaining updated collateral valuation
    information is usually initiated, unless it is not considered
    warranted given factors such as the relative size of the loan,
    the characteristics of the collateral or the age of the last
    valuation. In those latter cases, when current appraisals may
    not yet be available, prior appraisals are utilized with
    adjustments, as deemed necessary, for estimates of subsequent
    declines in value as determined by line of business

and/or

loan
    workout personnel in the respective geographic regions. Those
    adjustments are reviewed and assessed for reasonableness by the
    Company’s loan review department. Accordingly, for real
    estate collateral securing larger commercial and commercial real
    estate loans, estimated collateral values are based on current
    appraisals and estimates of value. For non-real estate loans,
    collateral is assigned a discounted estimated liquidation value
    and, depending on the nature of the collateral, is verified
    through field exams or other procedures. In assessing
    collateral, real estate and non-real estate values are reduced
    by an estimate of selling costs. With regard to residential real
    estate loans, with special emphasis on the portfolio of Alt-A
    mortgage loans, the Company expanded its collections and loan
    work-out staff and further refined its loss identification and
    estimation techniques by reference to loan performance and house
    price depreciation data in specific areas of the country where
    collateral that was securing the Company’s residential real
    estate loans was located. For residential real estate loans,
    including home equity loans and lines of credit, the excess of
    the loan balance over the net realizable value of the property
    collateralizing the loan is charged-off when the loan becomes
    150 days delinquent. That charge-off is based on recent
    indications of value from external parties.

Factors that influence the Company’s credit loss experience
    include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and
    consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real
    estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the
    Company’s real estate loan portfolios. Reflecting the
    factors and conditions as described herein, through
    December 31, 2009 the more significant increases in
    nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs of real estate-related
    loans have been in the Company’s portfolios of residential
    real estate loans, including second lien Alt-A mortgage loans
    and loans to builders and developers of residential real estate.
    Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective, as
    they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be
    significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by
    changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest
    rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of
    businesses and other occupants of the real property. Similarly,
    residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing
    trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest
    rates, and general economic conditions affecting consumers.

In ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses,
    the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled
    credits identified through both normal and detailed or
    intensified credit review processes and also estimates losses
    inherent in other loans and leases. In quantifying incurred
    losses, the Company considers the factors and uses the
    techniques described herein. For purposes of determining the
    level of the allowance for credit losses, the Company segments
    its loan and lease portfolio by loan type. The amount of
    specific loss components in the Company’s loan and lease
    portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of
    commercial and commercial real estate loans greater than
    $350,000 which are in nonaccrual status. Measurement of the
    specific loss components is typically based on expected future
    cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact
    the borrower’s ability to pay. Impaired loans are evaluated
    for specific loss components. Except for consumer loans and
    leases and residential real estate loans that are considered
    smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated
    collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired when,
    based on current information and events, it is probable that the
    Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the
    contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is
    delinquent 90 days or more and has been placed in
    nonaccrual status. Nevertheless, modified loans, including
    smaller balance homogenous loans, that are considered to be
    troubled debt restructurings are evaluated for impairment giving
    consideration to the impact of the modified loan terms on the
    present value of the loan’s expected cash flows. Loans



less than 90 days delinquent are deemed to have a minimal
    delay in payment and are generally not considered to be impaired.

The inherent base level loss components of the Company’s
    allowance for credit losses are generally determined by applying
    loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and
    management’s classification of such loans under the
    Company’s loan grading system. The Company utilizes an
    extensive loan grading system which is applied to all commercial
    and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers are
    responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans
    based on standards outlined in the Company’s Credit Policy.
    Internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the
    Company’s loan review department to ensure consistency and
    strict adherence to the prescribed standards. Loan balances
    utilized in the inherent base level loss component computations
    exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are
    maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss component factors that
    reflect the Company’s loss estimate for each group of loans
    and leases. Factors considered in assigning loan grades and loss
    component factors include borrower-specific information related
    to expected future cash flows and operating results, collateral
    values, financial condition, payment status, and other
    information; levels of and trends in portfolio charge-offs and
    recoveries; levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and
    impaired loans; changes in the risk profile of specific
    portfolios; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of
    changes in credit concentrations; and observed trends and
    practices in the banking industry. In assessing the overall
    adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, management also
    gives consideration to such factors as customer, industry and
    geographic concentrations as well as national and local economic
    conditions including: (i) the comparatively poorer economic
    conditions and unfavorable business climate in many market
    regions served by the Company, specifically upstate New York and
    central Pennsylvania, that result in such regions generally
    experiencing significantly poorer economic growth and vitality
    as compared with much of the rest of the country;
    (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding loan type,
    collateral type and geographic location, in particular the large
    concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by
    properties in the New York City metropolitan area and other
    areas of New York State; and (iii) additional risk
    associated with the Company’s portfolio of consumer loans,
    in particular automobile loans and leases, which generally have
    higher rates of loss than other types of collateralized loans.

In evaluating collateral, the Company relies extensively on
    internally and externally prepared valuations. In 2008 and 2009,
    valuations of residential real estate, which are usually based
    on sales of comparable properties, declined significantly in
    many regions across the United States. Commercial real estate
    valuations also refer to sales of comparable properties but
    oftentimes are based on calculations that utilize many
    assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective.
    Specifically, commercial real estate values can be significantly
    affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in
    business climate, economic conditions and interest rates, and,
    in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other
    occupants of the real property. Additionally, management is
    aware that there is oftentimes a delay in the recognition of
    credit quality changes in loans and, as a result, in changes to
    assigned loan grades due to time delays in the manifestation and
    reporting of underlying events that impact credit quality.
    Accordingly, loss estimates derived from the inherent base level
    loss component computation are adjusted for current national and
    local economic conditions and trends. Economic indicators in the
    most significant market regions served by the Company were weak
    during 2009, indicative of a recessionary economy. For example,
    during 2009 private sector employment declined in most market
    areas served by the Company. Nevertheless, such declines were
    generally less than the national average decline of 4.4%.
    Private sector employment in 2009 declined 2.2% in upstate New
    York, 3.6% in areas of Pennsylvania served by the Company, 2.8%
    in Maryland and 1.6% in Greater Washington D.C. Employment
    growth in areas of Pennsylvania served by the Company was flat
    in 2008, while growth in the Maryland and Greater Washington
    D.C. regions exceeded the national average. Additionally,
    although the 2.7% decline in private sector employment in New
    York City also trailed the national average in 2009, significant
    layoffs in the financial services sector in both 2008 and 2009
    are expected to weigh heavily on New York City economic growth
    in 2010. At the end of 2009 there remain significant concerns
    about the pace of national economic recovery from the recession,
    high unemployment, real estate valuations, high levels of
    consumer indebtedness, weak automobile sales and volatile energy
    prices. Those factors are expected to have a significant impact
    on the national economy in 2010.



The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss
    components together comprise the total base level or
    “allocated” allowance for credit losses. Such
    allocated portion of the allowance represents management’s
    assessment of losses existing in specific larger balance loans
    that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other
    loans that are not individually analyzed. In addition, the
    Company has always provided an inherent unallocated portion of
    the allowance that is intended to recognize probable losses that
    are not otherwise identifiable. The inherent unallocated
    allowance includes management’s subjective determination of
    amounts necessary for such things as: (i) the possible use
    of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of
    the allowance; (ii) the effect of expansion into new
    markets, including market areas entered through acquisitions,
    for which the Company does not have the same degree of
    familiarity and experience regarding portfolio performance in
    changing market conditions; (iii) the introduction of new
    loan and lease product types; and (iv) other additional
    risks associated with the Company’s loan portfolio which
    may not be specifically allocable.

A comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for
    each of the past five year-ends is presented in table 14.
    Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on
    information available to management at the time of each year-end
    assessment and using the methodology described herein.
    Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category
    as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in
    management’s estimate of specific loss components and
    inherent base level loss components, including the impact of the
    increased delinquencies and nonaccrual loans. As described in
    note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements, loans considered
    impaired were $1.3 billion at December 31, 2009 and
    $617 million at December 31, 2008. The allocated
    portion of the allowance for credit losses related to impaired
    loans totaled $244 million at December 31, 2009 and
    $124 million at December 31, 2008. The unallocated
    portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to .13% and
    .15% of gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. The declines in the unallocated portion of
    the allowance since 2005 reflect management’s continued
    refinement of its loss estimation techniques, which has
    increased the precision of its calculation of the allocated
    portion of the allowance for credit losses. However, given the
    inherent imprecision in the many estimates used in the
    determination of the allocated portion of the allowance,
    management deliberately remained cautious and conservative in
    establishing the overall allowance for credit losses. Given the
    Company’s high concentration of real estate loans and
    considering the other factors already discussed herein,
    management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of
    the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and reasonable.
    Furthermore, the Company’s allowance is general in nature
    and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease
    category.

Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at
    December 31, 2009 was adequate to absorb credit losses
    inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for
    credit losses was $878 million or 1.69% of total loans and
    leases at December 31, 2009, compared with
    $788 million or



1.61% at December 31, 2008 and $759 million or 1.58%
    at December 31, 2007. The ratio of the allowance to total
    loans and leases at December 31, 2009 reflects the impact
    of $3.9 billion of loans obtained in the acquisition of
    Provident and in the Bradford transaction that have been
    recorded at estimated fair value based on estimated future cash
    flows expected to be received on those loans. Those cash flows
    reflect the impact of expected defaults on customer repayment
    performance. As a result, and as required by GAAP, there was no
    carry over of the allowance for credit losses recorded by
    Provident and Bradford. The allowance for credit losses at
    December 31, 2009 as a percentage of the Company’s
    legacy loans (that is, total loans excluding loans acquired
    during 2009 in the Provident and Bradford transactions) was
    1.83%. The level of the allowance reflects management’s
    evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology
    and considering the factors as described herein and the
    Company’s loan charge-off policies. Should the various
    credit factors considered by management in establishing the
    allowance for credit losses change and should management’s
    assessment of losses inherent in the loan portfolios also
    change, the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans
    could increase or decrease in future periods. The ratio of the
    allowance to nonaccrual loans at the end of 2009, 2008 and 2007
    was 66%, 104% and 176%, respectively. Given the Company’s
    position as a secured lender and its practice of charging off
    loan balances when collection is deemed doubtful, that ratio and
    changes in that ratio are generally not an indicative measure of
    the adequacy of the Company’s allowance for credit losses,
    nor does management rely upon that ratio in assessing the
    adequacy of the allowance. The level of the allowance reflects
    management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as
    of each respective date.

In establishing the allowance for credit losses, management
    follows the methodology described herein, including taking a
    conservative view of borrowers’ abilities to repay loans.
    The establishment of the allowance is extremely subjective and
    requires management to make many judgments about borrower,
    industry, regional and national economic health and performance.
    In order to present examples of the possible impact on the
    allowance from certain changes in credit quality factors, the
    Company assumed the following scenarios for possible
    deterioration of credit quality:

•

For consumer loans and leases considered smaller balance
    homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 20 basis
    point increase in loss factors;

•

For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and
    lines of credit, also considered smaller balance homogenous
    loans and evaluated collectively, a 15% increase in estimated
    inherent losses; and

•

For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, which are
    not similar in nature, a migration of loans to lower-ranked risk
    grades resulting in a 20% increase in the balance of classified
    credits in each risk grade.

For possible improvement in credit quality factors, the
    scenarios assumed were:

•

For consumer loans and leases, a 10 basis point decrease in
    loss factors;

•

For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and
    lines of credit, a 5% decrease in estimated inherent
    losses; and

•

For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, a
    migration of loans to higher-ranked risk grades resulting in a
    5% decrease in the balance of classified credits in each risk
    grade.

The scenario analyses resulted in an additional $95 million
    that could be identifiable under the assumptions for credit
    deterioration, whereas under the assumptions for credit
    improvement a $30 million reduction could occur. These
    examples are only a few of numerous reasonably possible
    scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of
    the allowance for credit losses based on changes in assumptions
    and other factors.

Investor-owned commercial real estate loans secured by retail
    properties in the New York City metropolitan area represented 4%
    of loans outstanding at December 31, 2009. The Company had
    no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry
    that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2009.
    Outstanding loans to foreign borrowers were $55 million at
    December 31, 2009, or .11% of total loans and leases.

Real estate and other foreclosed assets totaled to
    $95 million at December 31, 2009, compared with
    $100 million at December 31, 2008 and $40 million
    at December 31, 2007. The increase from December 31,
    2007 to the two most recent year-ends resulted from higher
    residential real estate loan



defaults and additions from residential real estate development
    projects. At December 31, 2009, the Company’s holding
    of residential real estate-related properties comprised 84% of
    foreclosed assets.

Other income aggregated $1.05 billion in 2009, compared
    with $939 million in 2008. Gains and losses from bank
    investment securities (including

other-than-temporary

impairment losses) totaled to net losses of $137 million in
    2009 and $148 million in 2008. During 2009,

other-than-temporary

impairment charges of $138 million were recognized related
    to certain of the Company’s privately issued CMOs and CDOs
    and in 2008, similar losses of $182 million were recognized
    related to certain of the Company’s privately issued CMOs,
    CDOs and preferred stock holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
    all held in the

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio. Excluding gains and losses from
    bank investment securities, noninterest income was
    $1.19 billion in 2009, 9% higher than $1.09 billion in
    2008. Contributing to that improvement was the $29 million
    gain recognized on the Bradford acquisition transaction and
    higher mortgage banking revenues, service charges on deposit
    accounts obtained in the 2009 acquisition transactions and a
    smaller loss related to M&T’s equity in the operations
    of BLG. Partially offsetting those factors were declines in
    trust and brokerage services income.

Other income in 2008 was 1% higher than the $933 million
    earned in 2007. As discussed above, reflected in other income in
    2008 were losses from bank investment securities of
    $148 million, compared with losses of $126 million in
    2007 (including $127 million of

other-than-temporary

impairment losses). Excluding the impact of securities gains or
    losses, other income of $1.09 billion in 2008 was 3% higher
    than $1.06 billion in 2007. That rise reflects higher
    mortgage banking revenues and fees for providing deposit
    account, trust, brokerage and credit-related services that were
    partially offset by a $46 million decline in
    M&T’s pro-rata share of the operating results of BLG
    and lower trading account and foreign exchange gains.

Mortgage banking revenues were $208 million in 2009,
    $156 million in 2008 and $112 million in 2007.
    Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both residential and
    commercial mortgage banking activities. The Company’s
    involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities includes
    the origination, sales and servicing of loans under the
    multi-family loan programs of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the
    U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Residential mortgage banking revenues, consisting of realized
    gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan
    servicing rights, unrealized gains and losses on residential
    mortgage loans held for sale and related commitments,
    residential mortgage loan servicing fees, and other residential
    mortgage loan-related fees and income, were $166 million in
    2009, $117 million in 2008 and $86 million in 2007.
    The substantially higher revenues in 2009 as compared with the
    previous two years were attributable to significantly higher
    origination activity, due largely to refinancing of loans by
    consumers in response to relatively low interest rates, and
    wider margins associated with that activity. Reflected in the
    2007 total was the previously described $12 million of

Alt-A-related

losses in that year’s first quarter and the impact of lower
    gains on residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights
    due to slimmer margins realized by the Company resulting from
    changes in market conditions during that year.

Residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other
    investors totaled approximately $6.2 billion in 2009,
    compared with $4.4 billion in 2008 and $5.6 billion in
    2007. Residential mortgage loans sold to investors totaled
    $5.9 billion in 2009, $4.4 billion in 2008 and
    $5.3 billion in 2007. Realized gains from sales of
    residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights and
    recognized net unrealized gains or losses attributable to
    residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to
    originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans totaled
    $79 million in 2009, compared with $31 million in 2008
    and $3 million in 2007. Reflected in the 2008 gains were
    approximately $7 million of revenues related to the
    January 1, 2008 adoption of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
    (“SAB”) No. 109 for written loan commitments
    issued or modified after January 1, 2008. In November 2007,
    the SEC issued SAB No. 109, which reversed previous
    conclusions expressed by the SEC staff regarding written loan
    commitments that are accounted for at fair value through
    earnings. Specifically, the SEC staff now believes that the
    expected net future cash flows related to the associated
    servicing of the loan should be included in the fair value
    measurement of the derivative loan commitment. In accordance
    with SAB No. 105, “Application of Accounting
    Principles to Loan Commitments,” the Company had not
    included such amounts in the value



of loan commitments accounted for as derivatives in 2007. As
    previously described, reflected in 2007 were $12 million of
    losses related to Alt-A residential mortgage loans that were
    recognized during the first quarter of 2007.

Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others
    were $82 million in 2009, compared with $81 million in
    2008 and $73 million in 2007. Included in such servicing
    revenues were amounts related to purchased servicing rights
    associated with small balance commercial mortgage loans totaling
    $29 million in each of 2009 and 2008, compared with
    $21 million in 2007. Residential mortgage loans serviced
    for others aggregated $21.4 billion at December 31,
    2009, $21.3 billion a year earlier and $19.4 billion
    at December 31, 2007, including the small balance
    commercial mortgage loans noted above of approximately
    $5.5 billion, $5.9 billion and $4.9 billion at
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Capitalized
    residential mortgage loan servicing assets, net of a valuation
    allowance for possible impairment, totaled $141 million at
    December 31, 2009, compared with $143 million and
    $170 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The valuation allowance for possible impairment of
    capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets totaled $50
    thousand, $22 million and $6 million at the 2009, 2008
    and 2007 year-ends, respectively. Included in capitalized
    residential mortgage servicing assets were purchased servicing
    rights associated with the small balance commercial mortgage
    loans noted above of $40 million, $58 million and
    $57 million at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Servicing rights for the small balance commercial
    mortgage loans were purchased from BLG or its affiliates. In
    addition, at December 31, 2009 capitalized servicing rights
    included $17 million of servicing rights for
    $4.1 billion of residential real estate loans that were
    purchased from affiliates of BLG. Additional information about
    the Company’s relationship with BLG and its affiliates is
    provided in note 25 of Notes to Financial Statements.
    Additional information about the Company’s capitalized
    residential mortgage loan servicing assets, including
    information about the calculation of estimated fair value, is
    presented in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Commitments to sell residential mortgage loans and commitments
    to originate residential mortgage loans for sale at
    pre-determined rates were $936 million and
    $631 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009,
    $898 million and $871 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2008 and $772 million and
    $492 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007. Net
    unrealized gains on residential mortgage loans held for sale,
    commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate loans
    for sale were $15 million and $6 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, compared with net
    unrealized losses of $7 million at December 31, 2007.
    Changes in such net unrealized gains and losses are recorded in
    mortgage banking revenues and resulted in net increases in
    revenue of $9 million and $13 million in 2009 and
    2008, respectively, and a net decrease in revenue of
    $23 million in 2007 (including $12 million to record
    the Alt-A mortgage loans transferred from held for sale to held
    for investment at the lower of cost or market value in 2007).

Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $42 million in
    2009, $39 million in 2008 and $26 million in 2007.
    Revenues from loan origination and sales activities were
    $27 million in each of 2009 and 2008, and $13 million
    in 2007. Improved margins in 2009 were offset by a decline in
    loan origination volume as compared with 2008. The increased
    revenues in 2008 as compared with 2007 reflect higher loan
    origination volumes. Commercial mortgage loans originated for
    sale to other investors totaled approximately $1.1 billion
    in each of 2009 and 2007, compared with $1.4 billion in
    2008. Loan servicing revenues totaled $15 million in 2009,
    $12 million in 2008 and $13 million in 2007.
    Capitalized commercial mortgage loan servicing assets aggregated
    $33 million at December 31, 2009, $26 million at
    December 31, 2008 and $20 million at December 31,
    2007. Commercial mortgage loans serviced for other investors
    totaled $7.1 billion, $6.4 billion and
    $5.3 billion at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, and included $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion
    and $1.0 billion, respectively, of loan balances for which
    investors had recourse to the Company if such balances are
    ultimately uncollectible. Commitments to sell commercial
    mortgage loans and commitments to originate commercial mortgage
    loans for sale were $303 million and $180 million,
    respectively, at December 31, 2009, $408 million and
    $252 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008 and
    $176 million and $97 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2007. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale
    totaled $123 million, $156 million and
    $79 million at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.



Service charges on deposit accounts rose 9% to $469 million
    in 2009 from $431 million in 2008. That improvement
    resulted predominantly from the impact of the acquisition of
    Provident. Deposit account service charges in 2007 were
    $409 million. The higher level of service charges on
    deposit accounts in 2008 as compared with 2007 was largely due
    to increases in service charges on commercial accounts and
    consumer debit card fees due to higher transaction volumes.
    Certain fees charged by financial institutions for deposit
    services have come under scrutiny by lawmakers and regulators.
    The Federal Reserve and other bank regulators have adopted
    regulations requiring expanded disclosure of overdraft and other
    fees assessed to consumers and have issued guidance that will
    allow consumers to elect to not be subject to fees for certain
    deposit account transactions beginning in 2010. The Company
    intends to comply with these regulations but, at the present
    time, cannot predict the extent to which customers will elect to
    not avail themselves of the respective deposit account services.

Trust income includes fees for trust and custody services
    provided to personal, corporate and institutional customers, and
    investment management and advisory fees that are often based on
    a percentage of the market value of assets under management.
    Trust income declined 18% to $129 million in 2009 from
    $156 million in 2008. Contributing to that decline were
    lower fees for providing services that are based on market
    values of assets under administration, the impact of lower
    balances in proprietary mutual funds and the impact of fee
    waivers by the Company in order to continue to pay customers a
    yield on their investments in proprietary money-market mutual
    funds. Those waived fees were approximately $10 million in
    2009. Trust income totaled $153 million in 2007. Total
    trust assets, which include assets under management and assets
    under administration, aggregated $111.6 billion at
    December 31, 2009, compared with $111.0 billion at
    December 31, 2008. Trust assets under management were
    $13.8 billion and $12.8 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company’s proprietary
    mutual funds, the MTB Group of Funds, had assets of
    $7.9 billion and $11.5 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale
    of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees,
    aggregated $58 million in 2009, $64 million in 2008
    and $60 million in 2007. The decrease in revenues in 2009
    as compared with the previous year was largely attributable to
    lower fees for providing services that are tied to the
    performance of bond and equity markets. The improvement from
    2007 to 2008 was due largely to increased revenues earned from
    the sale of annuities. Trading account and foreign exchange
    activity resulted in gains of $23 million in 2009,
    $18 million in 2008 and $30 million in 2007. The
    higher revenues in 2009 as compared with 2008 were due to
    increases in market values of trading assets held in connection
    with deferred compensation plans, while the decline in revenues
    from 2007 to 2008 resulted from decreases in the market values
    of such trading assets. The Company enters into interest rate
    and foreign exchange contracts with customers who need such
    services and concomitantly enters into offsetting trading
    positions with third parties to minimize the risks involved with
    these types of transactions. Information about the notional
    amount of interest rate, foreign exchange and other contracts
    entered into by the Company for trading account purposes is
    included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements and
    herein under the heading “Liquidity, Market Risk, and
    Interest Rate Sensitivity.” Trading account revenues
    related to interest rate and foreign exchange contracts totaled
    $10 million in 2009, compared with $21 million in each
    of 2008 and 2007. That decline related predominantly to lower
    new volumes of interest rate swap agreement transactions
    executed on behalf of commercial customers. Trading account
    assets held in connection with deferred compensation plans were
    $36 million and $33 million at December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively. Trading account revenues resulting from
    net increases in the market values of such assets were
    $4 million in each of 2009 and 2007, compared with losses
    of $12 million in 2008. A largely offsetting impact on
    expenses resulting from corresponding increases or decreases in
    liabilities related to deferred compensation is included in
    “other costs of operations.”

Including

other-than-temporary

impairment losses, the Company recognized net losses on
    investment securities of $137 million during 2009, compared
    with $148 million and $126 million in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Other-than-temporary

impairment charges of $138 million, $182 million and
    $127 million were recorded in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. During 2009, the Company recognized impairment
    charges on certain privately issued CMOs backed by residential
    real estate loans and CDOs backed by trust preferred securities
    issued by financial institutions and other entities. The
    impairment



charges recognized in 2008 included write-downs of
    $153 million related to preferred stock issuances of Fannie
    Mae and Freddie Mac and $29 million related to CMOs and
    CDOs in the investment securities portfolio and were partially
    offset by a gain of $33 million related to the mandatory
    redemption of common shares of Visa during the first quarter of
    that year. The losses in 2007 reflect the previously described
    $127 million charge for the

other-than-temporary

impairment in value of CDOs backed by residential
    mortgage-backed securities. Each reporting period the Company
    reviews its impaired investment securities for

other-than-temporary

impairment. For equity securities, such as the Company’s
    investment in the preferred stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
    the Company considers various factors to determine if the
    decline in value is other than temporary, including the duration
    and extent of the decline in value, the factors contributing to
    the decline in fair value, including the financial condition of
    the issuer as well as the conditions of the industry in which it
    operates, and the prospects for a recovery in fair value of the
    equity security. For debt securities, the Company analyzes the
    creditworthiness of the issuer or reviews the credit performance
    of the underlying collateral supporting the bond. For debt
    securities backed by pools of loans, such as privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities, the Company estimates the cash flows
    of the underlying loan collateral using forward-looking
    assumptions of default rates, loss severities and prepayment
    speeds. Estimated collateral cash flows are then utilized to
    estimate bond-specific cash flows to determine the ultimate
    collectibility of the bond. If the present value of the cash
    flows indicates that the Company should not expect to recover
    the entire amortized cost basis of a bond or if the Company
    intends to sell the bond or it more likely than not will be
    required to sell the bond before recovery of its amortized cost
    basis, an

other-than-temporary

impairment loss is recognized. If an

other-than-temporary

impairment loss is deemed to have occurred, the investment
    security’s cost basis is adjusted, as appropriate for the
    circumstances.

M&T’s pro-rata share of the operating losses of BLG in
    2009 and 2008 was $26 million and $37 million,
    respectively, compared with a gain of $9 million in 2007.
    The operating losses of BLG in 2009 and 2008 resulted from the
    disruptions in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market
    and reflected losses from loan securitization and sales
    activities, lower values ascribed to loans held for sale, higher
    provisions for losses associated with loans held by BLG, and
    costs associated with severance and certain lease terminations
    incurred by BLG as it downsized its operations. Despite the
    credit and liquidity disruptions that began in 2007, BLG had
    been successfully securitizing and selling significant volumes
    of small-balance commercial real estate loans until the first
    quarter of 2008. In response to the illiquidity in the
    marketplace since that time, BLG reduced its originations
    activities, scaled back its workforce and made use of its
    contingent liquidity sources. In addition to BLG’s mortgage
    originations and sales capabilities, BLG is also entitled to
    cash flows from mortgage assets that it owns or that are owned
    by its affiliates and from asset management and other services
    provided by its affiliates. Accordingly, the Company believes
    that BLG is capable of realizing positive cash flows that could
    be available for distribution to its owners, including M&T,
    despite a lack of positive GAAP-earnings. Nevertheless, if BLG
    is not able to realize sufficient cash flows for the benefit of
    M&T, the Company may be required to recognize an

other-than-temporary

impairment charge in a future period for some portion of the
    $246 million book value of its investment in BLG.
    Information about the Company’s relationship with BLG and
    its affiliates is included in note 25 of Notes to Financial
    Statements.

Other revenues from operations totaled $325 million in
    2009, compared with $300 million in 2008 and
    $286 million in 2007. The improvement from 2008 to 2009
    reflects the $29 million gain recognized on the Bradford
    transaction in 2009 offset, in part, by modest decreases in
    other miscellaneous fees and revenues. The primary contributor
    to the 5% improvement from 2007 to 2008 was a $16 million
    increase in letter of credit and other credit-related fees.

Included in other revenues from operations were the following
    significant components. Letter of credit and other
    credit-related fees totaled $100 million, $97 million
    and $81 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    rise in such fees from 2007 to 2008 was due predominately to
    higher income from providing loan syndication and letter of
    credit services. Tax-exempt income earned from bank owned life
    insurance aggregated $49 million in each of 2009 and 2008,
    and $47 million in 2007. Such income includes increases in
    cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits
    received. Revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees
    were $40 million in each of 2009 and 2008, and
    $35 million in 2007. Insurance-related sales commissions
    and other revenues totaled $42 million in 2009,
    $31 million in



2008 and $33 million in 2007. Automated teller machine
    usage fees aggregated $19 million in 2009, $17 million
    in 2008 and $15 million in 2007.

Other
    Expense

Other expense aggregated $1.98 billion in 2009, compared
    with $1.73 billion in 2008 and $1.63 billion in 2007.
    Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be
    “nonoperating” in nature consisting of amortization of
    core deposit and other intangible assets of $64 million,
    $67 million and $66 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, and merger-related expenses of $89 million in
    2009, $4 million in 2008 and $15 million in 2007.
    Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating
    expenses were $1.83 billion in 2009, up 10% from
    $1.66 billion in 2008. The most significant factors for the
    rise in operating expenses from 2008 to 2009 were costs
    associated with the acquired operations of Provident and
    Bradford, a $90 million increase in FDIC assessments
    (including approximately $9 million relating to deposits
    from Provident and Bradford) and higher foreclosure-related
    expenses. The impact of those increases was mitigated by a
    reversal of the valuation allowance for capitalized residential
    mortgage servicing rights of $22 million in 2009, as
    compared with an addition to that valuation allowance of
    $16 million in 2008. Noninterest operating expenses were
    $1.55 billion in 2007. The higher level of operating
    expenses in 2008 as compared with 2007 was due largely to
    increased expenses for salaries, occupancy, professional
    services, advertising and promotion, and foreclosed residential
    real estate properties. Also contributing to the rise in
    operating expenses was an addition to the valuation allowance
    for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of
    $16 million in 2008, as compared with a partial reversal of
    the allowance of $4 million in 2007. Partially offsetting
    those factors was a $23 million charge taken in the fourth
    quarter of 2007 related to M&T Bank’s obligation as a
    member bank of Visa to share in losses stemming from certain
    litigation against Visa, compared with a partial reversal of
    that charge in 2008’s initial quarter of $15 million.

Salaries and employee benefits expense totaled
    $1.00 billion in 2009, up 5% from $957 million in
    2008. The higher expense levels in 2009 as compared with 2008
    reflect the impact of the 2009 acquisition transactions and
    included $10 million of merger-related expenses in 2009.
    Those expenses consisted predominantly of severance expense for
    Provident employees. Also contributing to the increased expenses
    in 2009 were higher costs for providing medical and pension
    benefits. Salaries and employee benefits expense was
    $908 million in 2007. The most significant contributors to
    the increase from 2007 to 2008 were the impact of annual merit
    increases, higher incentive compensation and the fourth quarter
    2007 acquisition transactions. Stock-based compensation totaled
    $54 million in 2009, $50 million in 2008 and
    $51 million in 2007. The number of full-time equivalent
    employees was 13,639 at December 31, 2009, compared with
    12,978 and 13,246 at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

The Company provides pension and other postretirement benefits
    (including a retirement savings plan) for its employees.
    Expenses related to such benefits totaled $60 million in
    2009, $52 million in 2008 and $54 million in 2007. The
    Company sponsors both defined benefit and defined contribution
    pension plans. Pension benefit expense for those plans was
    $32 million in 2009, $23 million in 2008 and
    $27 million in 2007. Included in those amounts are
    $11 million in 2009, $10 million in 2008 and
    $8 million in 2007 for a defined contribution pension plan
    that the Company began on January 1, 2006. The
    determination of pension expense and the recognition of net
    pension assets and liabilities for defined benefit pension plans
    requires management to make various assumptions that can
    significantly impact the actuarial calculations related thereto.
    Those assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return
    on plan assets, the rate of increase in future compensation
    levels and the discount rate. Changes in any of those
    assumptions will impact the Company’s pension expense. The
    expected long-term rate of return assumption is determined by
    taking into consideration asset allocations, historical returns
    on the types of assets held and current economic factors.
    Returns on invested assets are periodically compared with target
    market indices for each asset type to aid management in
    evaluating such returns. The discount rate used by the Company
    to determine the present value of the Company’s future
    benefit obligations reflects specific market yields for a
    hypothetical portfolio of highly rated corporate bonds that
    would produce cash flows similar to the Company’s benefit
    plan obligations and the level of market interest rates in
    general as of the year-end. Other factors used to estimate the
    projected benefit obligations include actuarial assumptions for
    mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate and disability



rate. Those other factors do not tend to change significantly
    over time. The Company reviews its pension plan assumptions
    annually to ensure that such assumptions are reasonable and
    adjusts those assumptions, as necessary, to reflect changes in
    future expectations. The Company utilizes actuaries and others
    to aid in that assessment.

The Company’s 2009 pension expense for its defined benefit
    plans was determined using the following assumptions: a
    long-term rate of return on assets of 6.5%; a rate of future
    compensation increase of 4.6%; and a discount rate of 6.0%. To
    demonstrate the sensitivity of pension expense to changes in the
    Company’s pension plan assumptions, 25 basis point
    increases in: the rate of return on plan assets would have
    resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $2 million;
    the rate of increase in compensation would have resulted in an
    increase in pension expense of $.3 million; and the
    discount rate would have resulted in a decrease in pension
    expense of $2 million. Decreases of 25 basis points in
    those assumptions would have resulted in similar changes in
    amount, but in the opposite direction from the changes presented
    in the preceding sentence. The accounting guidance for defined
    benefit pension plans reflects the long-term nature of benefit
    obligations and the investment horizon of plan assets, and has
    the effect of reducing expense volatility related to short-term
    changes in interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains
    and losses include the impact of plan amendments, in addition to
    various gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions
    and investment returns which are different from that which is
    assumed. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had
    cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of approximately
    $239 million that could result in an increase in the
    Company’s future pension expense depending on several
    factors, including whether such losses at each measurement date
    exceed ten percent of the greater of the projected benefit
    obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. In
    accordance with GAAP, net unrecognized gains or losses that
    exceed that threshold are required to be amortized over the
    expected service period of active employees, and are included as
    a component of net pension cost. Amortization of these net
    unrealized losses had the effect of increasing the
    Company’s pension expense by approximately $10 million
    in 2009, $4 million in 2008 and $6 million in 2007.

GAAP requires an employer to recognize in its balance sheet as
    an asset or liability the overfunded or underfunded status of a
    defined benefit postretirement plan, measured as the difference
    between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit
    obligation. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the
    projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement
    benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit
    obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.
    Gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise
    during the period, but are not included as components of net
    periodic benefit cost, are to be recognized as a component of
    other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2009, the
    combined benefit obligations of the Company’s defined
    benefit postretirement plans exceeded the fair value of the
    assets of such plans by approximately $147 million. Of that
    amount, $27 million was related to qualified defined
    benefit plans that are periodically funded by the Company and
    $120 million related to non-qualified pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans that are generally not funded until
    benefits are paid. The Company was required to have a net
    pension and postretirement benefit liability for those plans
    that was at least equal to $147 million at
    December 31, 2009. Accordingly, as of December 31,
    2009 the Company recorded an additional postretirement benefit
    liability of $193 million. After applicable tax effect,
    that liability reduced accumulated other comprehensive income
    (and thereby stockholders’ equity) by $117 million.
    The result of this, however, was a

year-over-year

decrease of $94 million to the required minimum
    postretirement benefit liability from the $286 million
    recorded at December 31, 2008. After applicable tax effect,
    the $94 million decrease in the minimum required liability
    increased accumulated other comprehensive income in 2009 by
    $57 million from the prior year-end amount of $174 million.
    The $94 million decrease to the liability was the result of
    gains that occurred during 2009 resulting from actual experience
    differing from actuarial assumptions and from changes in those
    assumptions. The main factor contributing to those gains was the
    improved performance of the qualified defined benefit plan
    assets, reflecting the overall improvement in global financial
    markets. In determining the benefit obligation for defined
    benefit postretirement plans the Company used a discount rate of
    5.75% at December 31, 2009 and 6% at December 31,
    2008. A 25 basis point decrease in the assumed discount
    rate as of December 31, 2009 to 5.50% would have resulted
    in increases in the combined benefit obligations of all defined
    benefit postretirement plans (including pension and other plans)
    of $31 million. Under that scenario, the minimum
    postretirement liability adjustment at



December 31, 2009 would have been $224 million, rather
    than the $193 million that was actually recorded, and the
    corresponding after tax-effect charge to accumulated other
    comprehensive income at December 31, 2009 would have been
    $135 million, rather than the $117 million that was
    actually recorded. A 25 basis point increase in the assumed
    discount rate to 6.00% would have decreased the combined benefit
    obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans by
    $29 million. Under this latter scenario, the aggregate
    minimum liability adjustment at December 31, 2009 would
    have been $164 million rather than the $193 million
    actually recorded and the corresponding after tax-effect charge
    to accumulated other comprehensive income would have been
    $99 million rather than $117 million. During the
    second quarter of 2009, the Company elected to contribute
    900,000 shares of common stock of M&T having a fair
    value of $44 million to its qualified defined benefit
    pension plan. During 2008, the Company made cash contributions
    to its qualified defined benefit pension plan totaling
    $140 million. Information about the Company’s pension
    plans, including significant assumptions utilized in completing
    actuarial calculations for the plans, is included in
    note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company also provides a retirement savings plan
    (“RSP”) that is a defined contribution plan in which
    eligible employees of the Company may defer up to 50% of
    qualified compensation via contributions to the plan. The
    Company makes an employer matching contribution in an amount
    equal to 75% of an employee’s contribution, up to 4.5% of
    the employee’s qualified compensation. RSP expense totaled
    $24 million in 2009, $23 million in 2008 and
    $22 million in 2007.

Expenses associated with the defined benefit and defined
    contribution pension plans and the RSP totaled $56 million
    in 2009, $47 million in 2008 and $49 million in 2007.
    Expense associated with providing medical and other
    postretirement benefits was $4 million in 2009 and
    $5 million in each of 2008 and 2007.

Excluding the nonoperating expense items already noted,
    nonpersonnel operating expenses totaled $835 million in
    2009, up 19% from $700 million in 2008. Higher FDIC deposit
    assessments were a significant contributor to that rise. In
    total, FDIC assessments in 2009 were $97 million, including
    a $33 million special assessment in the second quarter,
    compared with $7 million in 2008. Also contributing to the
    higher level of operating expenses in 2009 were costs associated
    with the acquired operations of Provident and Bradford and
    expenses related to the foreclosure process for residential real
    estate properties. Finally, a $15 million reversal in the
    first quarter of 2008 of an accrual established in the fourth
    quarter of 2007 for estimated losses stemming from certain
    litigation involving Visa also contributed to the

year-over-year

variance. Partially offsetting those factors was the impact of
    partial reversals of the valuation allowance for impairment of
    residential mortgage servicing rights in 2009 of
    $22 million, compared with additions to the valuation
    allowance of $16 million in 2008. Nonpersonnel operating
    expenses were $639 million in 2007. Contributing to the
    rise from 2007 to 2008 were increases in costs for occupancy,
    professional services, advertising and promotion, contributions
    to The M&T Charitable Foundation, and higher expenses
    related to foreclosed residential real estate properties. Also
    contributing to the higher level of operating expenses was an
    addition to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential
    mortgage servicing rights of $16 million in 2008, as
    compared with a partial reversal of the allowance of
    $4 million in 2007. Partially offsetting those factors was
    the $23 million charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2007
    related to M&T Bank’s obligation as a member bank of
    Visa to share in losses stemming from certain litigation against
    Visa, compared with a partial reversal of that charge in
    2008’s initial quarter of $15 million.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $139 million in 2009,
    compared with $184 million in 2008 and $309 million in
    2007. The effective tax rates were 26.8%, 24.9% and 32.1% in
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The recent year’s
    provision for income taxes was reduced as a result of a
    $10 million reversal of taxes accrued in earlier periods
    for previously uncertain tax positions in various jurisdictions.
    Income taxes in 2008 reflect the resolution in that year of
    previously uncertain tax positions related to the Company’s
    activities in various jurisdictions during the years

1999-2007

that allowed the Company to reduce its accrual for income taxes
    in the third quarter of 2008 by $40 million. Exclusive of
    the impact of the $10 million and the $40 million
    credits to income taxes in 2009 and 2008, respectively, the
    effective tax rates in 2009 and 2008 were 28.8% and 30.3%,
    respectively. The effective tax rate is affected by the



level of income earned that is exempt from tax, the level of
    income allocated to the various state and local jurisdictions
    where the Company operates, because tax rates differ among those
    jurisdictions, and the impact of any large but infrequently
    occurring items. For example, although the higher merger-related
    expenses incurred during 2009 are predominantly deductible for
    purposes of computing income tax expense, those charges had an
    impact on the effective tax rate because they lowered pre-tax
    income relative to the amounts of tax-exempt income and other
    permanent differences that impact the effective tax rate.
    Excluding the impact of the:

(i) other-than-temporary

impairment charges from pre-tax income and income tax expense in
    2009, 2008 and 2007; (ii) net merger-related expenses of
    $60 million in 2009, $4 million in 2008 and
    $15 million in 2007; and (iii) the $10 million
    and $40 million credits to income tax expense in 2009 and
    2008, respectively, the Company’s effective tax rates for
    2009, 2008 and 2007 would have been 31.6%, 32.1% and 33.0%,
    respectively.

The Company’s effective tax rate in future periods will be
    affected by the results of operations allocated to the various
    tax jurisdictions within which the Company operates, any change
    in income tax laws or regulations within those jurisdictions,
    and interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from
    the Company’s interpretations by any of various tax
    authorities that may examine tax returns filed by M&T or
    any of its subsidiaries. Information about amounts accrued for
    uncertain tax positions and a reconciliation of income tax
    expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal
    income tax rate to pre-tax income is provided in note 13 of
    Notes to Financial Statements.

International
    Activities

The Company’s net investment in international assets
    totaled $62 million at December 31, 2009 and
    $99 million at December 31, 2008. Such assets included
    $55 million and $91 million, respectively, of loans to
    foreign borrowers. Offshore deposits totaled $1.1 billion
    at December 31, 2009 and $4.0 billion at
    December 31, 2008. The Company uses such deposits to
    facilitate customer demand and as an alternative to short-term
    borrowings when the costs of such deposits seem reasonable.

Liquidity,
    Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity

As a financial intermediary, the Company is exposed to various
    risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to
    the Company’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow
    and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future
    obligations, including demands for loans and deposit
    withdrawals, funding operating costs, and other corporate
    purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of
    financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.

Core deposits have historically been the most significant
    funding source for the Company and are generated from a large
    base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. That
    customer base has, over the past several years, become more
    geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion
    of the Company’s businesses. Nevertheless, the Company
    faces competition in offering products and services from a large
    array of financial market participants, including banks,
    thrifts, mutual funds, securities dealers and others. Core
    deposits financed 72% of the Company’s earning assets at
    December 31, 2009, compared with 60% and 54% at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The substantial
    increase in the amount of earning assets financed by core
    deposits at the 2009 year-end as compared with a year
    earlier was the result of an $8.7 billion, or 25%, rise in
    core deposits, largely due to higher noninterest-bearing
    deposits.

The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits
    with various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings,
    including federal funds purchased and securities sold under
    agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit,
    offshore branch deposits and borrowings from the FHLBs and
    others. At December 31, 2009, M&T Bank had short-term
    and long-term credit facilities with the FHLBs aggregating
    $6.5 billion. Outstanding borrowings under these credit
    facilities totaled $5.4 billion and $8.0 billion at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Such borrowings
    are secured by loans and investment securities. M&T Bank
    and M&T Bank, N.A. had available lines of credit with the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York that totaled approximately
    $7.0 billion at December 31, 2009. The amounts of
    those lines are dependent upon the balances of loans and
    securities pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings
    outstanding under these lines of credit at December 31,
    2009. At December 31, 2008, secured



short-term borrowings from the Federal Reserve totaled
    $1.0 billion. Those borrowings were bid for by the Company
    through the Federal Reserve’s TAF program and had
    maturities of 84 days.

As a source of funding and to enhance regulatory capital ratios,
    during January 2008, M&T Capital Trust IV issued
    $350 million of Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities
    bearing a fixed rate of interest of 8.50% and maturing in 2068.
    The related junior subordinated debentures are included in
    long-term borrowings. Such securities qualify for inclusion in
    the Company’s Tier 1 Capital as defined by federal
    regulators. The Company has issued subordinated capital notes
    from time to time to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory
    capital ratios. Such notes qualify for inclusion in the
    Company’s total capital as defined by federal regulators.
    Information about the Company’s borrowings is included in
    note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company has informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of
    funding available through various arrangements for unsecured
    short-term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other
    financial institutions. Short-term federal funds borrowings were
    $2.1 billion and $809 million at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. In general, those borrowings were
    unsecured and matured on the next business day. As already
    noted, offshore branch deposits and brokered certificates of
    deposit have been used by the Company as an alternative to
    short-term borrowings. Offshore branch deposits also generally
    mature on the next business day and totaled $1.1 billion
    and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Outstanding brokered time deposits at
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 were
    $868 million and $487 million, respectively. Such
    deposits at December 31, 2009 included $813 million of
    brokered time deposits obtained in the acquisition of Provident.
    At December 31, 2009, the weighted-average remaining term
    to maturity of brokered time deposits was 21 months.
    Certain of these brokered deposits have provisions that allow
    for early redemption. The Company also had brokered NOW and
    brokered money-market deposit accounts which aggregated
    $618 million and $537 million at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

The Company’s ability to obtain funding from these or other
    sources could be negatively affected should the Company
    experience a substantial deterioration in its financial
    condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of
    short-term funding become restricted due to a disruption in the
    financial markets. The Company attempts to quantify such
    credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the
    liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade
    over various grading levels. Such impact is estimated by
    attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of
    credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and
    securitizable assets. Information about the credit ratings of
    M&T and M&T Bank is presented in table 15. Additional
    information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the
    Company’s short-term and long-term borrowings is provided
    in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to
    deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include
    maturities of investment securities and other earning assets,
    repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash
    generated from operations, such as fees collected for services.

Certain customers of the Company obtain financing through the
    issuance of variable rate demand bonds (“VRDBs”). The
    VRDBs are generally enhanced by direct-pay letters of credit
    provided by M&T Bank. M&T Bank oftentimes acts as
    remarketing agent for the VRDBs and, at its discretion, may from

time-to-time

own some of the VRDBs while such instruments are remarketed.
    When this occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading assets in
    the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Nevertheless,
    M&T Bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the
    VRDBs. The value of VRDBs in the Company’s trading account
    totaled $19 million and $29 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At each of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the VRDBs outstanding backed by
    M&T Bank letters of credit totaled $1.9 billion.
    M&T Bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those
    bonds.

The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal
    course of business which require future cash payments. The
    contractual amounts and timing of those payments as of
    December 31, 2009 are summarized in table 17. Off-balance
    sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity, including
    commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit,
    commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and
    indemnification contracts, and commitments to sell real estate
    loans. Because many of these commitments or contracts expire
    without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts
    are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further
    discussion of these commitments is provided in note 21 of
    Notes to Financial Statements. Table 17 summarizes the
    Company’s other commitments as of December 31, 2009
    and the timing of the expiration of such commitments.

M&T’s primary source of funds to pay for operating
    expenses, shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases
    has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking
    subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory
    limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T
    are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary
    in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of
    the test, approximately $1.2 billion at December 31,
    2009 was available for payment of dividends to M&T from
    banking subsidiaries. These historic sources of cash flow have
    been augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred
    securities and senior notes payable. Information regarding trust
    preferred securities, the related junior subordinated debentures
    and senior notes is included in note 9 of Notes to
    Financial Statements. M&T also maintains a $30 million
    line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank, of which
    there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2009.
    A similar $30 million line of credit was entirely available
    for borrowing at December 31, 2008.

Management closely monitors the Company’s liquidity
    position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal
    policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are
    adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the normal course
    of business. Management does not anticipate engaging in any
    activities, either currently or in the long-term, for which
    adequate funding would not be available and would therefore
    result in a significant strain on liquidity at either M&T
    or its subsidiary banks.

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the
    market prices

and/or

interest rates of the Company’s financial instruments. The
    primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate
    risk. Interest rate risk arises from the Company’s core
    banking activities of lending and deposit-taking, because assets
    and liabilities reprice at different times and by different
    amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest
    income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of
    changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk
    by calculating the variability of net interest income in future
    periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected
    balances for earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and
    derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Management’s
    philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the
    variability of net interest income. The balances of financial
    instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth
    from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments
    of loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of
    investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a
    “value of equity” model to supplement the modeling
    technique described above. Those supplemental analyses are based
    on discounted cash flows associated with on- and off-balance
    sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to
    reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a
    long-term interest rate risk metric. The Company has entered
    into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to
    interest rate risk. At December 31, 2009, the aggregate
    notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into
    for interest rate risk management purposes was
    $1.1 billion. Information about interest rate swap
    agreements entered into for interest rate risk management
    purposes is included herein under the heading “Net Interest
    Income/Lending and Funding Activities” and in note 18
    of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company’s Risk Management Committee, which includes
    members of senior management, monitors the sensitivity of the
    Company’s net interest income to changes in interest rates
    with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest
    income under different interest rate scenarios. In modeling
    changing interest rates, the Company considers different yield
    curve shapes that consider both parallel (that is, simultaneous
    changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve) and
    non-parallel (that is, allowing interest rates at points on the
    yield curve to vary by different amounts) shifts in the yield
    curve. In utilizing the model, market implied forward interest
    rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to
    determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest
    income simulation. That calculated base net interest income is
    then compared to the income calculated under the varying
    interest rate scenarios. The model considers the impact of
    ongoing lending and deposit-gathering activities, as well as
    interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing
    of financial instruments, including the effect of changing
    interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When
    deemed prudent, management has taken actions to mitigate
    exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on-or
    off-balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in
    the future. Possible actions include, but are



not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit
    products, modifying the composition of earning assets and
    interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or
    terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other
    financial instruments used for interest rate risk management
    purposes.

Table 20 displays as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 the
    estimated impact on net interest income from non-trading
    financial instruments in the base scenario described above
    resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across
    repricing categories during the first modeling year.

The Company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact
    that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income.
    The more significant of those assumptions included the rate of
    prepayments of mortgage-related assets, cash flows from
    derivative and other financial instruments held for non-trading
    purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit
    maturities. In the scenarios presented, the Company also assumed
    gradual changes in rates during a twelve-month period of 100 and
    200 basis points, as compared with the assumed base
    scenario. In the event that a 100 or 200 basis point rate
    change cannot be achieved, the applicable rate changes are
    limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates cannot be
    less than zero. The assumptions used in interest rate
    sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and, as a result,
    the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in
    interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ
    significantly from those presented due to the timing, magnitude
    and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market
    conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between
    maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as
    those previously described, which management may take to counter
    such changes. In light of the uncertainties and assumptions
    associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table
    are not considered significant to the Company’s past or
    projected net interest income.

Table 21 presents cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities)
    repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time
    frames, as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap
    agreements entered into for interest rate risk management
    purposes. Management believes that this measure does not
    appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in
    interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of
    earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities equally nor, as
    assumed in the table, on the contractual maturity or repricing
    date. Furthermore, this static presentation of interest rate
    risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit
    gathering activities, projected changes in balance sheet
    composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management
    activities the Company is likely to implement.

Changes in fair value of the Company’s financial
    instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for
    similar instruments in the financial markets. That impact is
    most notable on the values assigned to the Company’s
    investment securities. Information about the fair valuation of
    such securities is presented herein under the heading
    “Capital” and in notes 3 and 20 of Notes to
    Financial Statements.

The Company engages in trading activities to meet the financial
    needs of customers, to fund the Company’s obligations under
    certain deferred compensation plans and, to a limited extent, to
    profit from perceived market opportunities. Financial
    instruments utilized in trading activities consist predominantly
    of interest rate contracts, such as swap agreements, and forward
    and futures contracts related to foreign currencies, but have
    also included forward and futures contracts related to
    mortgage-backed securities and investments in U.S. Treasury
    and other government securities, mortgage-backed securities and
    mutual funds and, as previously described, a limited number of
    VRDBs. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and
    interest rate risk associated with trading activities by
    entering into offsetting trading positions. The amounts of gross
    and net trading positions, as well as the type of trading
    activities conducted by the Company, are subject to a
    well-defined series of potential loss exposure limits
    established by management and approved by M&T’s Board
    of Directors. However, as with any non-government guaranteed
    financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk
    associated with counterparties to the Company’s trading
    activities.

The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for
    trading purposes aggregated $13.9 billion at
    December 31, 2009 and $14.6 billion at
    December 31, 2008. The notional amounts of foreign currency
    and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading
    purposes totaled $608 million and $713 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Although the
    notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in
    the consolidated balance sheet, the fair values of all financial
    instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the
    consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of trading account
    assets and liabilities were $387 million and
    $302 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009 and
    $618 million and $521 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2008. Included in trading account assets at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $36 million and
    $33 million, respectively, of assets related to deferred
    compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of such assets are
    recorded as



“trading account and foreign exchange gains” in the
    consolidated statement of income. Included in “other
    liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheet at each of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $38 million of
    liabilities related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in
    the balances of such liabilities due to the valuation of
    allocated investment options to which the liabilities are
    indexed are recorded in “other costs of operations” in
    the consolidated statement of income.

Given the Company’s policies, limits and positions,
    management believes that the potential loss exposure to the
    Company resulting from market risk associated with trading
    activities was not material, however, as previously noted, the
    Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties
    to transactions associated with the Company’s trading
    activities. Additional information about the Company’s use
    of derivative financial instruments in its trading activities is
    included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Capital

Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2009 was
    $7.8 billion and represented 11.26% of total assets,
    compared with $6.8 billion or 10.31% at December 31,
    2008 and $6.5 billion or 10.00% at December 31, 2007.
    Included in stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2009
    and December 31, 2008 was $600 million of Fixed Rate
    Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, and
    warrants to purchase M&T common stock issued on
    December 23, 2008 as part of the U.S. Treasury Capital
    Purchase Program. Provident also participated in that program in
    November 2008. As a result, Provident’s $151.5 million
    of preferred stock related thereto was converted to M&T
    Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C,
    with warrants to purchase M&T common stock. The holder of
    the Series A and Series C preferred stock is entitled
    to cumulative cash dividends of 5% per annum for five years
    after the date of initial issuance and 9% per annum thereafter,
    payable quarterly in arrears. That preferred stock is redeemable
    at the option of M&T, subject to regulatory approval.
    M&T also obtained another series of preferred stock as part
    of the Provident acquisition that was converted to
    $26.5 million of M&T Series B Mandatory
    Convertible Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, liquidation
    preference of $1,000 per share. The 26,500 shares of the
    Series B Preferred Stock will automatically convert into
    433,148 shares of M&T common stock on April 1,
    2011. The Series B Preferred Stock pays dividends at a rate
    of 10% per annum on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per
    share, payable quarterly in arrears. The estimated fair values
    ascribed to the preferred stock and warrants to purchase common
    stock of M&T associated with the acquisition of Provident
    were $156 million and $6 million, respectively, on the
    May 23, 2009 acquisition date. Additional information
    related to M&T’s preferred stock and the related
    warrants to purchase common stock is included in note 10 of
    Notes to Financial Statements.

Common stockholders’ equity was $7.0 billion, or
    $59.31 per share, at December 31, 2009, compared with
    $6.2 billion, or $56.29 per share, at December 31,
    2008 and $6.5 billion, or $58.99 per share, at
    December 31, 2007. Tangible equity per common share, which
    excludes goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets
    and applicable deferred tax balances, was $28.27 at
    December 31, 2009, compared with $25.94 and $27.98 at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    Company’s ratio of tangible common equity to tangible
    assets was 5.13% at December 31, 2009, compared with 4.59%
    and 5.01% at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007,
    respectively. Reconciliations of total common stockholders’
    equity and tangible common equity as of December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007 are presented in table 2. During 2009, 2008 and
    2007, the ratio of average total stockholders’ equity to
    average total assets was 10.79%, 9.88% and 10.67%, respectively.
    The ratio of average common stockholders’ equity to average
    total assets was 9.81%, 9.86% and 10.67% in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Stockholders’ equity reflects accumulated other
    comprehensive income or loss, which includes the net after-tax
    impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities
    classified as available for sale, gains or losses associated
    with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow
    hedges, and adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined
    benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Net unrealized
    losses on

available-for-sale

investment securities, net of applicable tax effect, were
    $220 million, or $1.86 per common share, at
    December 31, 2009, compared with losses of
    $557 million, or $5.04 per common share, at
    December 31, 2008, and $59 million, or $.54 per common
    share, at December 31, 2007. Such unrealized losses
    represent the difference, net of applicable income tax effect,
    between the



estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities
    classified as available for sale, including the remaining
    unamortized unrealized losses on investment securities that have
    been transferred to

held-to-maturity

classification. The increase in net unrealized losses from
    December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 resulted
    primarily from pre-tax net unrealized losses of
    $786 million on $3.2 billion of privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2008. As of
    December 31, 2009, pre-tax net unrealized losses on the
    Company’s remaining $2.5 billion of privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities classified as available for sale had
    decreased to $381 million.

Reflected in net unrealized losses at December 31, 2009
    were pre tax-effect unrealized losses of $483 million on

available-for-sale

investment securities with an amortized cost of
    $3.0 billion and pre-tax effect unrealized gains of
    $190 million on securities with an amortized cost of
    $4.0 billion. The pre-tax effect unrealized losses reflect
    $383 million of losses considered Level 3 valuations
    on privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities
    having an amortized cost of $2.0 billion and an estimated
    fair value of $1.6 billion and $58 million of losses
    generally considered Level 2 valuations on trust preferred
    securities issued by financial institutions having an amortized
    cost of $196 million and an estimated fair value of
    $138 million.

The Company’s privately issued residential mortgage-backed
    securities classified as available for sale are generally
    collateralized by prime and Alt-A residential mortgage loans as
    depicted in table 22. Information in the table is as of
    December 31, 2009. As with any accounting estimate or other
    data, changes in fair values and investment ratings may occur at
    any time.

All information is as of
    December 31, 2009.

Due to the severe disruption in the credit markets during the
    second half of 2008 and continuing in 2009, trading activity for
    privately issued mortgage-backed securities was dramatically
    reduced. In estimating values for such securities, the Company
    was significantly restricted in the level of market observable
    assumptions used in the valuation of its privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Because of the inactivity
    and the lack of observable valuation inputs, the Company
    transferred $2.2 billion of its privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities portfolio from Level 2 to
    Level 3 valuations in the third quarter of 2008. The
    remaining portion of its portfolio of privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities had already been classified as
    Level 3. To assist in the determination of fair value for
    its privately issued mortgage-backed securities, the Company
    engaged two independent pricing sources at December 31,
    2009 and 2008. In determining fair value of those securities at
    December 31, 2008, in general, the Company averaged the
    results obtained from the independent sources. In April 2009,
    new accounting guidance was provided for estimating fair value
    when the volume and level of trading activity for an asset



or liability have significantly decreased. In consideration of
    the new guidance, the Company performed internal modeling to
    estimate the cash flows and fair value of 148 of its privately
    issued residential mortgage-backed securities with an amortized
    cost basis of $1.9 billion at December 31, 2009. The
    Company’s internal modeling techniques included discounting
    estimated bond-specific cash flows using assumptions about cash
    flows associated with loans underlying each of the bonds. In
    estimating those cash flows, the Company used conservative
    assumptions as to future delinquency, default and loss rates in
    order to mitigate exposure that might be attributable to the
    risk that actual future credit losses could exceed assumed
    credit losses. Differences between internal model valuations and
    external pricing indications were generally considered to be
    reflective of the lack of liquidity in the market for privately
    issued mortgage-backed securities. To determine the most
    representative fair value for each of the 148 bonds under
    current market conditions, the Company computed values based on
    judgmentally applied weightings of the internal model valuations
    and the indications obtained from the average of the two
    independent pricing sources. Weightings applied to internal
    model valuations were generally dependent on bond structure and
    collateral type, with prices for bonds in non-senior tranches
    generally receiving lower weightings on the internal model
    results and greater weightings of the valuation data provided by
    the independent pricing sources. As a result, certain valuations
    of privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities were
    determined by reference to independent pricing sources without
    adjustment. The average weight placed on internal model
    valuations was 37%, compared with a 63% weighting on valuations
    provided by the independent sources. Generally, the range of
    weights placed on internal valuations was between 0% and 40%.
    The impact of relying on the guidance provided by the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and using an
    internal valuation modeling technique was to increase
    accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2009
    by $72 million ($118 million pre-tax). Further
    information concerning the Company’s valuations of
    privately issued mortgage-backed securities can be found in
    note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.

During 2009 the Company recognized $138 million (pre-tax)
    of

other-than-temporary

impairment losses related to privately issued residential
    mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost basis (before
    impairment charge) of $486 million and securities backed
    largely by trust preferred securities issued by financial
    institutions with an amortized cost basis (before impairment
    charge) of $8 million. Those

other-than-temporary

impairment losses were determined in accordance with GAAP and,
    therefore, reflect the estimated credit losses on the impaired
    securities. In assessing impairment losses, the Company
    performed internal modeling to estimate bond-specific cash
    flows, which considered the placement of the bond in the overall
    securitization structure and the remaining levels of
    subordination. For privately issued residential mortgage-backed
    securities, the model utilized assumptions about the underlying
    performance of the mortgage loan collateral considering recent
    collateral performance and future assumptions regarding default
    and loss severity. At December 31, 2009, projected model
    default percentages on the underlying mortgage loan collateral
    ranged from 2% to 42% and loss severities ranged from 10% to
    71%. For bonds in which the Company has recognized an
    other-than-temporary impairment charge, the weighted-average
    percentage of defaulted collateral was 24% and the
    weighted-average loss severity was 49%. For bonds without
    other-than-temporary impairment losses, the weighted-average
    default percentage and loss severity were 12% and 38%,
    respectively. Underlying mortgage loan collateral cash flows,
    after considering the impact of estimated credit losses, were
    distributed by the model to the various securities within the
    securitization structure to determine the timing and extent of
    losses at the bond-level, if any. The

other-than-temporary

impairment losses recognized in the consolidated statement of
    income were net of $126 million of unrealized losses for
    the same securities resulting from other factors that have been
    reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. Despite
    rising levels of delinquencies and losses in the underlying
    residential mortgage loan collateral, given credit enhancements
    resulting from the structures of individual bonds, the Company
    has concluded that as of December 31, 2009 its remaining
    privately issued mortgage-backed securities were not

other-than-temporarily

impaired. Nevertheless, given recent market conditions, it is
    possible that adverse changes in repayment performance and fair
    value could occur in 2010 and later years that could impact the
    Company’s conclusions. Management has modeled cash flows
    from privately issued mortgage-backed securities under various
    scenarios and has concluded that even if home price depreciation
    and current delinquency trends persist for an extended period of
    time, the Company’s principal losses on its privately



issued mortgage-backed securities would be substantially less
    than their current fair valuation losses. During 2008 the
    Company recognized $182 million (pre-tax) of

other-than-temporary

losses, $18 million of which related to privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost basis (before
    impairment charge) of $20 million and $11 million
    related to securities backed by trust preferred securities
    issued by financial institutions with an amortized cost basis
    (before impairment charge) of $12 million. As previously
    noted, the remaining $153 million of

other-than-temporary

impairment in 2008 related to the Company’s holdings of
    preferred stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Given the Company’s relationship with Bayview Financial and
    related entities, during the third quarter of 2008, the Company
    reconsidered its intention to hold certain CMOs securitized by
    Bayview Financial with a cost basis of $385 million and a
    fair value of $298 million and transferred such securities
    from its

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio to its

held-to-maturity

investment securities portfolio. As a result, at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had in its

held-to-maturity

portfolio CMOs securitized by Bayview Financial with an
    amortized cost basis of $352 million and $412 million,
    respectively, (including the effect of $68 million and
    $82 million, respectively, of unamortized fair value
    adjustment (pre-tax) residing in accumulated other comprehensive
    income from the time of transfer) and a fair value of
    $201 million and $319 million, respectively. At
    December 31, 2009, the amortized cost and fair value of
    CMOs securitized by Bayview Financial in the Company’s

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio were $33 million and
    $25 million, respectively, and at December 31, 2008
    were $40 million and $32 million, respectively. Given
    the credit enhancements within each of the individual bond
    structures, the Company has determined that, despite rising
    levels of delinquencies and losses in the underlying residential
    and commercial mortgage loan collateral, it expects to fully
    collect its contractual principal and interest payments on the
    private CMOs securitized by Bayview Financial and therefore
    believes such securities were not

other-than-temporarily

impaired at December 31, 2009.

At December 31, 2009, the Company also had net pre-tax
    unrealized losses of $29 million on $384 million of
    trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions,
    securities backed by trust preferred securities issued by
    financial institutions and other entities, and other debt
    securities (including $12 million of net unrealized gains
    on $115 million of securities using a Level 3
    valuation and $41 million of net unrealized losses on
    $268 million of securities classified as Level 2
    valuations). Pre-tax unrealized losses of $90 million
    existed on $241 million of such securities at
    December 31, 2008. After evaluating the expected repayment
    performance of financial institutions where trust preferred
    securities were held directly by the Company or were within the
    CDOs backed by trust preferred securities obtained in the
    Provident and Partners Trust acquisitions, the Company, during
    2009 and 2008, recognized pre-tax

other-than-temporary

impairment losses of $8 million and $11 million,
    respectively, on securities obtained in the Partners Trust
    acquisition.

Following the U.S. Government’s placement of Fannie
    Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship on September 7,
    2008, the Company recognized an

other-than-temporary

impairment charge of $153 million (pre-tax) on its
    preferred stock holdings of those government-sponsored entities.
    At December 31, 2009, the Company’s investment in
    Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock had a remaining cost
    basis of $9 million and a fair value of $6 million.
    The Company recognized a $127 million (pre-tax)

other-than-temporary

impairment charge in 2007 resulting from the decline in fair
    value of certain CDOs  backed by

sub-prime

mortgage securities held in the

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio based on its evaluation at the
    time that it was probable that the Company would not receive all
    payments owed to it under the terms and structure of the
    securities.

As of December 31, 2009, based on a review of each of the
    remaining securities in the investment securities portfolio, the
    Company concluded that it expected to recover its amortized cost
    basis for such securities. Accordingly, the Company concluded
    that the declines in the values of those securities were
    temporary and that additional

other-than-temporary

impairment charges were not appropriate at December 31,
    2009. As of that date, the Company did not intend to sell nor is
    it anticipated that it would be required to sell any of its
    impaired securities, that is, where fair value is less than the
    cost basis of the security. The Company intends to closely
    monitor the performance of the privately issued mortgage-backed
    securities and other securities to assess if changes in their
    underlying credit performance or other events cause the cost
    basis of those securities to become

other-than-temporarily

impaired. However, because the unrealized losses on

available-for-sale

investment securities have generally already



been reflected in the financial statement values for investment
    securities and stockholders’ equity, any recognition of an

other-than-temporary

decline in value of those investment securities would not have a
    material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    condition. Any

other-than-temporary

impairment charge related to

held-to-maturity

securities would result in reductions in the financial statement
    values for investment securities and stockholders equity.
    Additional information concerning fair value measurements and
    the Company’s approach to the classification of such
    measurements is included in note 20 of the Notes to
    Financial Statements.

Reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income at
    December 31, 2009 was a net gain of $1 million, or
    $.01 per common share, and at December 31, 2008 and 2007
    were net losses of $6 million or $.05 per common share and
    $10 million or $.09 per common share, respectively,
    representing unrealized gains or losses related to the
    termination of interest rate swap agreements that had been
    designated as cash flow hedges.

Adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit
    pension and other postretirement plans, net of applicable tax
    effect, reduced accumulated other comprehensive income by
    $117 million, or $.99 per common share, at
    December 31, 2009, $174 million, or $1.58 per common
    share, at December 31, 2008, and $46 million, or $.42
    per common share, at December 31, 2007. The decrease in
    such adjustment at December 31, 2009 as compared with
    December 31, 2008 was predominantly the result of actual
    investment performance of assets held by the Company’s
    qualified pension plans being significantly better than assumed
    for actuarial purposes. Conversely, the increase in such
    adjustment at the 2008 year-end as compared with
    December 31, 2007 was predominantly the result of actual
    investment performance of pension plan assets being
    significantly worse than that assumed for actuarial purposes.
    Information about the funded status of the Company’s
    pension and other postretirement benefit plans is included in
    note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Cash dividends declared on M&T’s common stock totaled
    $327 million in 2009, compared with $309 million and
    $282 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. M&T
    increased the quarterly dividend on its common stock in the
    third quarter of 2007 from $.60 to $.70 per share. Dividends per
    common share totaled $2.80 in each of 2009 and 2008, and $2.60
    in 2007. During 2009, cash dividends of $27 million, or
    $44.72 per share, were declared and paid to the
    U.S. Treasury on M&T’s Series A Preferred
    Stock issued on December 23, 2008. Cash dividends of
    $1 million and $4 million ($50.00 per share and $25.00
    per share) were declared and paid during 2009 on M&T’s
    Series B and Series C Preferred Stock, respectively.
    Those series of preferred stock were created in connection with
    the Provident transaction.

M&T repurchased 4,514,800 shares of its common stock
    in 2007 at a cost of $509 million. There were no common
    stock repurchases by M&T in 2009 or 2008. In February 2007,
    M&T announced that it had been authorized by its Board of
    Directors to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common
    stock. M&T had repurchased a total of 2,818,500 shares
    of common stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of
    $108.30 per share.

Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to
    maintain “Tier 1 capital” and “total
    capital” ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of
    risk-adjusted total assets. In addition to the risk-based
    measures, Federal bank regulators have also implemented a
    minimum “leverage” ratio guideline of 3% of the
    quarterly average of total assets. As of December 31, 2009,
    Tier 1 capital included $1.1 billion of the trust
    preferred securities described in note 9 of Notes to
    Financial Statements. Total capital further included
    $1.6 billion of subordinated notes. The capital ratios of
    the Company and its banking subsidiaries as of December 31,
    2009 and 2008 are presented in note 23 of Notes to
    Financial Statements.

Fourth
    Quarter Results

Net income aggregated $137 million during the fourth
    quarter of 2009, up 34% from $102 million in the
    year-earlier quarter. Diluted and basic earnings per common
    share were $1.04 and $1.05, respectively, in the final quarter
    of 2009, 13% and 14% higher than $.92 of diluted and basic
    earnings per common share in the fourth quarter of 2008. The
    annualized rates of return on average assets and average common
    stockholders’ equity for the fourth quarter of 2009 were
    .79% and 7.09%, respectively, compared with .63% and 6.41%,
    respectively, in the year-earlier period.

Net operating income totaled $151 million in the fourth
    quarter of 2009, compared with $112 million in the
    year-earlier quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common
    share were $1.16 in



the recent quarter, compared with $1.00 in the final quarter of
    2008. The annualized net operating returns on average tangible
    assets and average tangible common equity in the last quarter of
    2009 were .92% and 16.73%, respectively, compared with .72% and
    15.01%, respectively, in the corresponding 2008 quarter. Core
    deposit and other intangible asset amortization, after tax
    effect, totaled $10 million in each of the fourth quarters
    of 2009 and 2008 ($.09 and $.08 per diluted common share,
    respectively). The after-tax impact of merger-related expenses
    associated with the Provident and Bradford acquisition
    transactions was $4 million ($6 million pre-tax) or
    $.03 of diluted earnings per common share in the fourth quarter
    of 2009. There were no merger-related expenses during the final
    quarter of 2008. Reconciliations of GAAP results with non-GAAP
    results for the quarterly periods of 2009 and 2008 are provided
    in table 24.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose 15% to
    $565 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 from
    $491 million in the year-earlier quarter. That improvement
    reflects a 34 basis point widening of the Company’s
    net interest margin and higher average earning assets, which
    increased $2.5 billion, or 4%, to $60.5 billion from
    $57.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. The yield on
    earning assets was 4.58% in the fourth quarter of 2009, down
    77 basis points from 5.35% in the year-earlier quarter. The
    rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 1.13% in the final
    quarter of 2009, 119 basis points lower than 2.32% in the
    fourth quarter of 2008. The resulting net interest spread was
    3.45% in the recent quarter, up 42 basis points from 3.03%
    in the corresponding quarter of 2008. That improvement was
    largely due to lower interest rates paid on deposits and
    borrowings. The contribution of net interest-free funds to the
    Company’s net interest margin was .26% in the final 2009
    quarter, down from .34% in the year-earlier quarter. That
    decline reflects the impact of lower interest rates on
    interest-bearing liabilities used to value such contribution. As
    a result, the Company’s net interest margin widened to
    3.71% in the recent quarter from 3.37% in the fourth quarter of
    2008. The major contributor to the growth experienced in average
    earning assets in the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared with
    the year-earlier quarter was an increase in average loans and
    leases, which rose 7% to $52.1 billion from
    $48.8 billion. Included in average loans and leases in the
    recent quarter were loans obtained in the acquisition of
    Provident, which added approximately $3.8 billion to the
    average loan and lease total. In addition, loans obtained in the
    Bradford transaction added approximately $268 million to
    average loans and leases in the final quarter of 2009. Average
    commercial loan and lease balances were $13.5 billion in
    the recent quarter, compared with $14.2 billion in the
    fourth quarter of 2008. Commercial real estate loans averaged
    $21.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009, up
    $2.3 billion from $18.7 billion in the year-earlier
    quarter. Average residential mortgage loans outstanding
    increased $553 million to $5.5 billion in the recent
    quarter from $4.9 billion in the final 2008 quarter.
    Consumer loans averaged $12.1 billion in the fourth quarter
    of 2009, up $1.1 billion from $11.0 billion in the
    year-earlier quarter.

The provision for credit losses was $145 million in the
    three-month period ended December 31, 2009, compared with
    $151 million in the year-earlier period. Net charge-offs of
    loans were $135 million in the fourth quarter of 2009,
    representing an annualized 1.03% of average loans and leases
    outstanding, compared with $144 million or 1.17% during the
    final quarter of 2008. Net charge-offs included: residential
    real estate loans of $21 million in the recent quarter,
    compared with $19 million a year earlier; loans to builders
    and developers of residential properties of $40 million,
    compared with $26 million a year earlier; other commercial
    real estate loans of $11 million, compared with
    $3 million in 2008’s final quarter; commercial loans
    of $31 million, compared with $61 million in 2008; and
    consumer loans of $32 million, compared with
    $35 million in the prior year fourth quarter.

Other income totaled $266 million in the recent quarter, up
    10% from $241 million in the year-earlier quarter.

Other-than-temporary

impairment charges aggregated $34 million during the fourth
    quarter of 2009, compared with $24 million in the
    year-earlier quarter. Excluding those charges, other income was
    $300 million, up 13% from $265 million in the
    year-earlier quarter. The most significant contributors to that
    improvement were increases in mortgage banking revenues and
    service charges on acquisition-related deposit accounts.

Other expense in the fourth quarter of 2009 totaled
    $478 million, compared with $447 million in the
    year-earlier quarter. Included in such amounts are expenses
    considered to be “nonoperating” in nature consisting
    of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of
    $17 million and $16 million in the final quarters of
    2009 and 2008, respectively, and merger-related expenses of
    $6 million



in the fourth quarter of 2009. Exclusive of these nonoperating
    expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $455 million
    in the recently completed quarter, up 6% from $431 million
    in the final quarter of 2008. As compared with the fourth
    quarter of 2008, the recent quarter’s rise in operating
    expenses was due, in large part, to the operations obtained in
    the 2009 acquisition transactions and higher FDIC deposit
    assessments, partially offset by the impact of changes in the
    valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage
    servicing rights. A partial reversal of the valuation allowance
    reduced expense by $4 million in the final quarter of 2009,
    compared with an addition to the valuation allowance in the
    year-earlier quarter which increased expense by
    $19 million. The Company’s efficiency ratio during the
    fourth quarter of 2009 and 2008 was 52.7% and 57.0%,
    respectively. Table 24 includes a reconciliation of other
    expense to noninterest operating expense for each of the
    quarters of 2009 and 2008.

Segment
    Information

In accordance with GAAP, the Company’s reportable segments
    have been determined based upon its internal profitability
    reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit.
    Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment
    information reporting purposes where the nature of the products
    and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of
    those products and services are similar. The reportable segments
    are Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real
    Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking,
    and Retail Banking.

The financial information of the Company’s segments was
    compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in
    note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management
    accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment
    financial information are highly subjective and, unlike
    financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance
    similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the
    financial information of the reported segments are not
    necessarily comparable with similar information reported by
    other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management
    structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result
    in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial
    information about the Company’s segments is presented in
    note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Business Banking segment provides a wide range of services
    to small businesses and professionals through the Company’s
    branch network, business banking centers and other delivery
    channels such as telephone banking, Internet banking and
    automated teller machines within markets served by the Company.
    Services and products offered by this segment include various
    business loans and leases, including loans guaranteed by the
    Small Business Administration, business credit cards, deposit
    products, and financial services such as cash management,
    payroll and direct deposit, merchant credit card and letters of
    credit. The Business Banking segment recorded net income of
    $124 million in 2009, 3% higher than the $120 million
    earned in 2008. The rise in net income in 2009 as compared with
    2008 was due to higher net interest income of $33 million,
    largely attributable to higher average deposit and loan balances
    of $869 million and $416 million, respectively,
    partially offset by a $20 million increase in total
    noninterest expenses, reflecting higher FDIC deposit assessments
    of $10 million, and an $8 million increase in the
    provision for credit losses, the result of higher net
    charge-offs of loans. Approximately three-fourths of the higher
    net interest income was due to the Provident transaction. This
    segment’s net income totaled $133 million in 2007. The
    10% decline in net income in 2008 as compared with 2007 was
    mainly due to a $15 million increase in the provision for
    credit losses, the result of higher net loan charge-offs, and
    higher noninterest expenses of $12 million, reflecting
    increased personnel costs. Those unfavorable factors were
    partially offset by a $5 million rise in service charges on
    deposit accounts.

The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit
    products and banking services for middle-market and large
    commercial customers, mainly within the markets served by the
    Company. Services provided by this segment include commercial
    lending and leasing, letters of credit, deposit products, and
    cash management services. The Commercial Banking segment
    contributed net income of $239 million in 2009, up 12% from
    $213 million in 2008. The higher net income in 2009 as
    compared with 2008 reflects a $98 million increase in net
    interest income, primarily due to a $3.0 billion increase
    in average deposit balances. Approximately 15 percent of
    the increase in net interest income was due to the Provident
    acquisition. Partially offsetting that increase were a
    $31 million increase in the provision for credit losses,
    predominately due to higher net charge-offs of loans, and a
    $15 million rise in FDIC deposit assessments. Net income
    earned in 2007 by the Commercial Banking segment was
    $217 million.



Contributing to the slight decline in net income in 2008 as
    compared with 2007 was a $65 million increase in the
    provision for credit losses, due to higher net charge-offs of
    loans, and higher noninterest expenses of $22 million,
    largely the result of increased personnel costs. Those factors
    were offset by a $51 million rise in net interest income,
    primarily the result of a $2.0 billion increase in average
    loan balances outstanding, and a $28 million increase in
    noninterest income resulting from higher fees of
    $14 million for providing credit-related services, a
    $9 million increase in fees earned for providing deposit
    account services, and a $3 million increase in income from
    providing credit card and merchant-related services.

The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit
    services to its customers. Real estate securing loans in this
    segment is generally located in the New York City metropolitan
    area, upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of
    Columbia, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and the
    northwestern portion of the United States. Commercial real
    estate loans may be secured by apartment/multifamily buildings;
    office, retail and industrial space; or other types of
    collateral. Activities of this segment also include the
    origination, sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans
    through the Fannie Mae DUS program and other programs. The
    Commercial Real Estate segment’s net income declined 5% to
    $155 million in 2009 from $164 million in 2008.
    Contributing to that decline were a $69 million increase in
    the provision for credit losses, primarily due to higher net
    charge-offs of loans, and higher noninterest expenses of
    $15 million, including increased deposit assessments of
    $4 million. Partially offsetting those increased costs was
    higher net interest income of $59 million. The increase in
    net interest income was largely attributable to higher average
    loan and deposit balances of $1.4 billion and
    $489 million, respectively, and an 18 basis point
    widening of the net interest margin on loans. Approximately
    one-half of the increase in net interest income was due to the
    Provident acquisition. Net income for the Commercial Real Estate
    segment aggregated $148 million in 2007. As compared with
    2007, the improvement in 2008 was due to a $31 million
    increase in net interest income, largely the result of higher
    average loan and deposit balances of $1.8 billion and
    $189 million, respectively, and a $13 million increase
    in commercial mortgage banking revenues. Those positive factors
    were partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit
    losses of $11 million, mainly due to higher net charge-offs
    of loans, and a rise in personnel costs of $10 million, due
    largely to higher incentive compensation.

The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and
    trading securities, residential mortgage loans and other assets;
    short-term and long-term borrowed funds; brokered certificates
    of deposit and interest rate swap agreements related thereto;
    and offshore branch deposits. This segment also provides foreign
    exchange services to customers. Included in the assets of the
    Discretionary Portfolio segment are the investment securities
    for which the Company has recognized

other-than-temporary

impairment charges in each of the last three years and the
    portfolio of Alt-A mortgage loans. The Discretionary Portfolio
    segment incurred net losses of $28 million,
    $48 million and $7 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Included in those results were

other-than-temporary

impairment charges of $138 million in 2009,
    $182 million in 2008 and $127 million in 2007. The
    impairment charges recorded in 2009 were related to private CMOs
    and CDOs backed by residential mortgages ($130 million) and
    CDOs backed by trust preferred securities ($8 million). The
    2008 impairment charges were related to the Company’s
    holdings of preferred stock issuances of Fannie Mae and Freddie
    Mac ($153 million), private CMOs ($18 million) and
    CDOs backed by trust preferred securities ($11 million).
    The impairment charges recorded in 2007 related entirely to CDOs
    backed by

sub-prime

residential mortgage securities. All of the impairment charges
    relate to bonds or preferred stock held in the Company’s

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio. Factors contributing to the
    lower net loss in 2009 as compared with 2008 were a
    $44 million decline in

other-than-temporary

impairment charges, the impact of a partial reversal of the
    valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage
    servicing rights of $6 million in 2009, compared with an
    addition to the valuation allowance of $6 million in 2008,
    and lower foreclosure-related costs of $10 million. Those
    factors were partially offset by a $14 million increase in
    the provision for credit losses, driven by higher net
    charge-offs, and a $7 million decline in net interest
    income, reflecting lower average balances of investment
    securities and loans of $529 million and $290 million,
    respectively. The Discretionary Portfolio segment’s higher
    net loss in 2008 as compared with 2007 was due, in part, to the
    following unfavorable factors: higher

other-than-temporary

impairment charges of $55 million; an increase in the
    provision for credit losses of $41 million, resulting
    largely from higher net



charge-offs of Alt-A loans; higher foreclosure-related costs of
    $13 million; a $6 million increase in the valuation
    allowance for capitalized mortgage servicing rights; and a rise
    in costs incurred for professional services of $4 million.
    Partially offsetting those unfavorable factors were a
    $55 million increase in net interest income, largely
    resulting from a 21 basis point widening of the net
    interest margin on investment securities and a 23% increase in
    the average balances of investment securities, reflecting
    purchases of residential mortgage-backed securities during the
    first quarter of 2008 and the full-year impact of third quarter
    2007 purchases of approximately $800 million of CMOs and
    other

mortgage-backed

securities.

The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services
    residential mortgage loans and sells substantially all of those
    loans in the secondary market to investors or to the
    Discretionary Portfolio segment. This segment also originated
    loans to developers of residential real estate properties,
    although that activity has been significantly curtailed. In
    addition to the geographic regions served by or contiguous with
    the Company’s branch network, the Company maintains
    mortgage loan origination offices in several states throughout
    the western United States. The Company also periodically
    purchases the rights to service mortgage loans. Residential
    mortgage loans held for sale are included in this segment. This
    segment incurred net losses of $13 million and
    $48 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, reflecting
    significant losses on loans to builders and developers of
    residential real estate. The lower net loss in 2009 resulted
    from the following factors: a $55 million rise in
    noninterest revenues from residential mortgage loan origination
    activities due to increased volume and wider margins; the impact
    of a partial reversal of the capitalized mortgage servicing
    rights valuation allowance of $16 million in 2009, compared
    with a $10 million addition to such allowance in 2008; and
    a $13 million increase in net interest income, partly due
    to a 68 basis point widening of the net interest margin on
    loans. Those factors were offset, in part, by a $43 million
    increase in total noninterest expenses (excluding the
    capitalized mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance
    reversal), reflecting higher foreclosure-related costs of
    $23 million. Compared with the net loss of $48 million
    in 2008, the Residential Mortgage Banking segment recorded net
    income of $13 million in 2007. The main factor that
    contributed to the net loss in 2008 was the continued
    deterioration of the residential real estate market, including
    the valuation of residential real estate, which resulted in a
    $100 million increase to the provision for credit losses
    that was predominately attributable to a significant rise in net
    charge-offs of loans to builders and developers of residential
    real estate. Also contributing to the unfavorable performance of
    this segment in 2008 was a $15 million decrease in net
    interest income, mainly due to lower average loan balances
    outstanding of $369 million and a 17 basis point
    narrowing of the net interest margin associated with such loans,
    and a $14 million increase in the valuation allowance for
    capitalized mortgage servicing rights. Partially offsetting
    those factors was a $25 million increase in noninterest
    revenues from residential mortgage banking activities,
    reflecting the impact of $12 million of losses recorded in
    2007 related to Alt-A mortgage loans and higher servicing
    revenues of $8 million in 2008.

The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of services to
    consumers through several delivery channels which include branch
    offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and
    Internet banking. The Company has branch offices in New York
    State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the District of
    Columbia, West Virginia, Delaware and New Jersey. The Retail
    Banking segment also offers certain deposit products on a
    nationwide basis through the delivery channels of M&T Bank,
    N.A. Credit services offered by this segment include consumer
    installment loans, automobile loans (originated both directly
    and indirectly through dealers), and home equity loans and lines
    of credit. The segment also offers to its customers deposit
    products, including demand, savings and time accounts;
    investment products, including mutual funds and annuities; and
    other services. The Retail Banking segment contributed net
    income of $237 million in 2009, down 5% from the
    $250 million recorded in 2008. The following factors
    contributed to that decline: a $42 million increase in FDIC
    deposit assessments; a rise in the provision for credit losses
    of $32 million, resulting from higher net charge-offs of
    consumer loans; and increases in personnel and net occupancy
    costs of $17 million and $16 million, respectively,
    related to the operations added with the Provident acquisition.
    Those unfavorable factors were partially offset by a
    $48 million increase in net interest income and a
    $34 million rise in fees earned for providing deposit
    account services to Provident customers. The higher net interest
    income was due to a $2.4 billion increase in average
    deposit balances (approximately 60 percent of the increase
    in those balances was due to the impact of the Provident
    transaction) and a 26 basis point widening of the net
    interest margin on



loans, offset, in part, by a 26 basis point narrowing of
    the deposit net interest margin. Net income for this segment in
    2008 was 21% lower than the $316 million earned in 2007.
    That decline resulted from increases in: the provision for
    credit losses of $38 million, mainly due to higher net
    charge-offs of loans; personnel costs of $22 million,
    reflecting merit increases and the impact of the late-2007
    acquisitions; net occupancy expenses of $12 million,
    largely the result of the 2007 acquisitions; and higher
    advertising and promotion costs of $6 million. Another
    contributing factor in the decline in net income was lower net
    interest income of $19 million, largely attributable to the
    narrowing of the net interest margins on deposits and loans of
    34 basis points and 14 basis points, respectively,
    partially offset by the impact of higher average deposit and
    loan balances of $1.5 billion and $979 million,
    respectively.

The “All Other” category reflects other activities of
    the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported
    segments. Reflected in this category are the amortization of
    core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from the
    acquisitions of financial institutions, M&T’s equity
    in the earnings (loss) of BLG, merger-related gains and expenses
    resulting from acquisitions and the net impact of the
    Company’s allocation methodologies for internal transfers
    for funding charges and credits associated with the earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Company’s
    reportable segments and the provision for credit losses. The
    various components of the “All Other” category
    resulted in net losses of $335 million, $95 million
    and $167 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Contributing to the higher net loss in 2009 as compared with
    2008 were the following unfavorable factors: the impact from the
    Company’s allocation methodologies for internal transfers
    for funding charges and credits associated with the earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Company’s
    reportable segments and the provision for credit losses;
    $89 million of merger-related expenses associated with the
    Provident and Bradford acquisitions recorded in 2009, compared
    with $4 million of merger-related expenses in 2008 related
    to acquisition transactions completed in the fourth quarter of
    2007; Visa-related transactions that were recorded in the first
    quarter of 2008, including a $33 million gain realized from
    the mandatory partial redemption of Visa stock owned by M&T
    Bank and $15 million related to the reversal of Visa
    litigation-related accruals initially recorded in 2007’s
    fourth quarter; increased personnel costs associated with the
    business and support units included in the “All Other”
    category of $35 million, including higher costs for
    medical, pension and post-retirement benefits; the impact of a
    $10 million reduction of income tax expense resulting from
    the reversal of taxes previously accrued for uncertain tax
    positions in various jurisdictions, compared with a
    $40 million reduction of income tax expense recorded in
    2008’s third quarter relating to M&T’s resolution
    of certain tax issues from its activities in various
    jurisdictions during the years

1999-2007;

lower trust income of $28 million; a $16 million
    increase in FDIC deposit assessments; and a $6 million
    increase in charitable contributions made to the M&T
    Charitable Foundation. Partially offsetting those factors was
    the previously noted $29 million merger-related gain
    associated with the Bradford transaction in 2009 and a
    $13 million (pre-tax) improvement from M&T’s
    share of the operating results of BLG (inclusive of interest
    expense to fund that investment). The lower net loss recorded in
    2008 as compared with 2007 resulted from several factors,
    including the previously mentioned $40 million reduction of
    income tax expense in 2008; the $33 million gain realized
    in the first quarter of 2008 from the mandatory partial
    redemption of Visa stock; the impact from the $23 million
    accrual recorded in the final quarter of 2007 related to Visa
    litigation and the subsequent $15 million partial reversal
    of such accrual in the first quarter of 2008; lower
    merger-related costs resulting from the 2007 acquisition
    transactions of $11 million; and the favorable impact from
    the Company’s allocation methodologies for internal funds
    transfer pricing and the provision for credit losses. Those
    favorable factors were partially offset by a $32 million
    after-tax reduction in 2008 of the contribution from
    M&T’s investment in BLG, inclusive of interest expense
    to fund that investment, compared with a similar reduction in
    2007 of $4 million; higher personnel and professional
    services costs of $15 million and $11 million,
    respectively, related to the business and support units included
    in the “All Other” category; and contributions to The
    M&T Charitable Foundation that totaled $6 million.

Recent
    Accounting Developments

In January 2010, the FASB amended fair value measurement and
    disclosure guidance to require disclosure of significant
    transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value
    measurements and the reasons for the transfers and to require
    separate presentation of information about purchases, sales,
    issuances, and



settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair
    value measurements. The amended guidance also clarifies existing
    requirements that (i) fair value measurement disclosures
    should be disaggregated for each class of asset and liability
    and (ii) disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs
    for both recurring and nonrecurring Level 2 and
    Level 3 fair value measurements should be provided. The
    guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning
    after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about
    purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward
    of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, which are
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2010 and for interim periods within those years. The adoption of
    this guidance will not impact the Company’s financial
    position or results of operations.

In June 2009, the FASB amended accounting guidance relating to
    the consolidation of variable interest entities to eliminate the
    quantitative approach previously required for determining the
    primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. The amended
    guidance instead requires a reporting entity to qualitatively
    assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a
    variable interest entity based on whether the reporting entity
    has the power to direct the activities that most significantly
    impact the variable interest entity’s economic performance
    and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive
    benefits of the variable interest entity that could potentially
    be significant to the variable interest entity. The amended
    guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether the reporting
    entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity.
    The amended guidance is effective as of the beginning of the
    first annual reporting period that begins after
    November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first
    annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting
    periods thereafter. Earlier adoption is prohibited.

In June 2009, the FASB also issued amended accounting guidance
    relating to accounting for transfers of financial assets to
    eliminate the exceptions for qualifying special purpose entities
    from the consolidation guidance and the exception that permitted
    sale accounting for certain mortgage securitizations when a
    transferor has not surrendered control over the transferred
    assets. The amended guidance is effective as of the beginning of
    the first annual reporting period that begins after
    November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first
    annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting
    periods thereafter. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The
    recognition and measurement provisions of the amended guidance
    should be applied to transfers that occur on or after the
    effective date. Additionally, on and after the effective date,
    the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity will no
    longer be relevant for accounting purposes. Therefore, formerly
    qualifying special-purpose entities will be evaluated for
    consolidation on and after the effective date in accordance with
    applicable consolidation guidance, including the new accounting
    guidance relating to the consolidation of variable interest
    entities discussed in the previous paragraph.

Effective January 1, 2010, the Company includes in its
    consolidated financial statements

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans that were included in two
    separate non-recourse securitization transactions using
    qualified special trusts. The effect of that consolidation was
    to increase loans receivable by $424 million, decrease the
    amortized cost of

available-for-sale

investment securities by $360 million (fair value of
    $355 million), and increase borrowings by $65 million.
    Information concerning these securitization transactions is
    included in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued a revision of the business
    combinations accounting standard. The revised guidance retains
    the fundamental requirements of the previous accounting standard
    that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all
    business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for
    each business combination. The revised accounting guidance
    defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one
    or more businesses in the business combination and establishes
    the acquisition date as the date the acquirer achieves control.
    The revised accounting guidance retains the provisions in the
    previous accounting standard for identifying and recognizing
    intangible assets separately from goodwill. With limited
    exceptions, the revised guidance requires an acquirer to
    recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date,
    measured at their fair value as of that date. That replaces the
    previous accounting standard’s cost-allocation process,
    which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the
    individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
    their estimated fair values. As a result, certain
    acquisition-related costs previously included in the cost of an
    acquisition are now required to be expensed as



incurred. In addition, certain restructuring costs previously
    recognized as if they were an assumed liability from an
    acquisition are also required to be expensed. The revised
    accounting guidance also requires the acquirer in a business
    combination achieved in stages (sometimes referred to as a step
    acquisition) to recognize the identifiable assets and
    liabilities, as well as the noncontrolling interest in the
    acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair values. The revised
    accounting guidance requires an acquirer to recognize goodwill
    as of the acquisition date measured as a residual, which in most
    types of business combinations will result in measuring goodwill
    as the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair
    value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the
    acquisition date over the fair value of the identifiable net
    assets acquired. The revised accounting guidance also eliminates
    the recognition of a separate valuation allowance, such as an
    allowance for credit losses, as of the acquisition date for
    assets acquired in a business combination that are measured at
    their acquisition-date fair values because the effects of
    uncertainty about future cash flows should be included in the
    fair value measurement of those assets. The revised accounting
    guidance must be applied prospectively to business combinations
    for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of
    the first annual reporting period beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The
    adoption of the revised accounting guidance significantly
    impacts the accounting for acquisitions consummated in 2009 and
    beyond, including the Company’s acquisition of Provident in
    a

stock-for-stock

transaction, which was completed on May 23, 2009, and the
    FDIC-assisted Bradford transaction, which was completed on
    August 28, 2009. Information concerning the Provident and
    Bradford transactions is included in note 2 of Notes to
    Financial Statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued amended accounting rules relating
    to the accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in
    a business combination that arise from contingencies to amend
    and clarify the business combination accounting standard to
    address application issues with respect to initial recognition
    and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and
    disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies
    in a business combination. This guidance applies to all assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that
    arise from contingencies, except for assets or liabilities
    arising from contingencies that are subject to specific
    provisions in the business combinations accounting rules. The
    accounting guidance requires an acquirer to recognize at fair
    value, at the acquisition date, an asset acquired or a liability
    assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency
    if the acquisition-date fair value of that asset or liability
    can be determined during the measurement period. If the
    acquisition-date fair value of an asset acquired or a liability
    assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency
    cannot be determined during the measurement period, an asset or
    liability shall be recognized if it is probable that an asset
    existed or that a liability had been incurred at the acquisition
    date and the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably
    estimated. An acquirer shall develop a rational basis for
    subsequently measuring and accounting for assets and liabilities
    arising from contingencies depending on their nature. This
    accounting guidance is effective for assets or liabilities
    arising from contingencies in business combinations for which
    the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2008. The Company applied the guidance in accounting for the
    aforementioned Provident and Bradford transactions completed
    during the 2009 second and third quarters, respectively.
    Information concerning the Provident and Bradford acquisitions
    is included in note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Forward-Looking
    Statements

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations and other sections of this Annual
    Report contain forward-looking statements that are based on
    current expectations, estimates and projections about the
    Company’s business, management’s beliefs and
    assumptions made by management. These statements are not
    guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks,
    uncertainties and assumptions (“Future Factors”) which
    are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results
    may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in
    such forward-looking statements.

Future Factors include changes in interest rates, spreads on
    earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and interest
    rate sensitivity; prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit
    losses and market values on loans, collateral securing loans and
    other assets; sources of liquidity; common shares



outstanding; common stock price volatility; fair value of and
    number of stock-based compensation awards to be issued in future
    periods; legislation affecting the financial services industry
    as a whole, and M&T and its subsidiaries individually or
    collectively, including tax legislation; regulatory supervision
    and oversight, including monetary policy and required capital
    levels; changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be
    required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies; increasing
    price and product/service competition by competitors, including
    new entrants; rapid technological developments and changes; the
    ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and
    services on a timely, cost-effective basis; the mix of
    products/services; containing costs and expenses; governmental
    and public policy changes; protection and validity of
    intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers;
    technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large,
    multi-year contracts; the outcome of pending and future
    litigation and governmental proceedings, including tax-related
    examinations and other matters; continued availability of
    financing; financial resources in the amounts, at the times and
    on the terms required to support M&T and its
    subsidiaries’ future businesses; and material differences
    in the actual financial results of merger, acquisition and
    investment activities compared with M&T’s initial
    expectations, including the full realization of anticipated cost
    savings and revenue enhancements.

These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect
    the outcome of the forward-looking statements. In addition, such
    statements could be affected by general industry and market
    conditions and growth rates, general economic and political
    conditions, either nationally or in the states in which M&T
    and its subsidiaries do business, including interest rate and
    currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes and trends in the
    securities markets, and other Future Factors.

Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting at M&T
    Bank Corporation and subsidiaries (“the Company”).
    Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009 based on criteria described in
    “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, management
    concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009.

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, that was engaged to express an opinion
    as to the fairness of presentation of such financial statements.
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was also engaged to assess the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting. The report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
    follows this report.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and
    Stockholders of

M&T Bank Corporation

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of M&T Bank Corporation and its
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) at December 31, 2009
    and 2008, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
    opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for these financial statements, for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting, included in the accompanying Report on Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
    express opinions on these financial statements and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

    Financial Statements

1.

Significant
    accounting policies

M&T Bank Corporation (“M&T”) is a bank
    holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York. Through
    subsidiaries, M&T provides individuals, corporations and
    other businesses, and institutions with commercial and retail
    banking services, including loans and deposits, trust, mortgage
    banking, asset management, insurance and other financial
    services. Banking activities are largely focused on consumers
    residing in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and
    the District of Columbia and on small and medium-size businesses
    based in those areas. Banking services are also provided in
    Delaware, West Virginia and New Jersey, while certain
    subsidiaries also conduct activities in other states.

The accounting and reporting policies of M&T and
    subsidiaries (“the Company”) conform to generally
    accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and to general
    practices within the banking industry. The preparation of
    financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates. Subsequent events have been evaluated for their
    potential impact in the financial statements through
    February 19, 2010, which is the date the financial
    statements were issued. The more significant accounting policies
    are as follows:

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include M&T and all
    of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
    transactions of consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated
    in consolidation. The financial statements of M&T included
    in note 26 report investments in subsidiaries under the
    equity method. Information about some limited purpose entities
    that are affiliates of the Company but are not included in the
    consolidated financial statements appears in note 19.

Consolidated
    Statement of Cash Flows

For purposes of this statement, cash and due from banks and
    federal funds sold are considered cash and cash equivalents.

Securities
    purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under
    agreements to repurchase

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities
    sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as
    collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at
    amounts equal to the cash or other consideration exchanged. It
    is generally the Company’s policy to take possession of
    collateral pledged to secure agreements to resell.

Trading
    account

Financial instruments used for trading purposes are stated at
    fair value. Realized gains and losses and unrealized changes in
    fair value of financial instruments utilized in trading
    activities are included in “trading account and foreign
    exchange gains” in the consolidated statement of income.

Investment
    securities

Investments in debt securities are classified as held to
    maturity and stated at amortized cost when management has the
    positive intent and ability to hold such securities to maturity.
    Investments in other debt securities and equity securities
    having readily determinable fair values are classified as
    available for sale and stated at estimated fair value.
    Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts for
    investment securities available for sale and held to maturity
    are included in interest income. Except for investment
    securities for which the Company has entered into a related fair
    value hedge, unrealized gains or losses on investment securities
    available for sale are reflected in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable income taxes.

Other securities are stated at cost and include stock of the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank
    (“FHLB”) of New York.

The cost basis of individual securities is written down through
    a charge to earnings when declines in value below amortized cost
    are considered to be other than temporary. In cases where fair
    value is less



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

than amortized cost and the Company intends to sell a debt
    security, it is more likely than not to be required to sell a
    debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or
    the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost
    basis of a debt security, an

other-than-temporary

impairment is considered to have occurred. If the Company
    intends to sell the debt security or more likely than not will
    be required to sell the security before recovery of its
    amortized cost basis, the

other-than-temporary

impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire
    difference between the debt security’s amortized cost basis
    and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If the Company
    does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of
    the security, the Company does not intend to sell the security
    and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be
    required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized
    cost basis, the

other-than-temporary

impairment is separated into (a) the amount representing
    the credit loss and (b) the amount related to all other
    factors. The amount of the

other-than-temporary

impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings
    while the amount related to other factors is recognized in other
    comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Subsequently, the
    Company accounts for the

other-than-temporarily

impaired debt security as if the security had been purchased on
    the measurement date of the

other-than-temporary

impairment at an amortized cost basis equal to the previous
    amortized cost basis less the other-than-temporary impairment
    recognized in earnings. The cost basis of individual equity
    securities is written down to estimated fair value through a
    charge to earnings when declines in value below cost are
    considered to be other than temporary. Realized gains and losses
    on the sales of investment securities are determined using the
    specific identification method.

Loans
    and leases

Interest income on loans is accrued on a level yield method.
    Loans are placed on nonaccrual status and previously accrued
    interest thereon is charged against income when principal or
    interest is delinquent 90 days, unless management
    determines that the loan status clearly warrants other
    treatment. Loan balances are charged off when it becomes evident
    that such balances are not fully collectible. For loans secured
    by residential real estate, the excess of the loan balances over
    the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the
    loan is charged-off when the loan becomes 150 days
    delinquent. Loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs
    are deferred and recognized as an interest yield adjustment over
    the life of the loan. Net deferred fees have been included in
    unearned discount as a reduction of loans outstanding.
    Commitments to sell real estate loans are utilized by the
    Company to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of real
    estate loans held for sale. The carrying value of hedged real
    estate loans held for sale recorded in the consolidated balance
    sheet includes changes in estimated fair market value during the
    hedge period, typically from the date of close through the sale
    date. Valuation adjustments made on these loans and commitments
    are included in “mortgage banking revenues.”

Except for consumer and residential mortgage loans that are
    considered smaller balance homogenous loans and are evaluated
    collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired for
    purposes of applying GAAP when, based on current information and
    events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to
    collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the
    loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days. Impaired
    loans are classified as either nonaccrual or as loans
    renegotiated at below market rates. Loans less than 90 days
    delinquent are deemed to have an insignificant delay in payment
    and are generally not considered impaired. Impairment of a loan
    is measured based on the present value of expected future cash
    flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the
    loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of
    collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Interest
    received on impaired loans placed on nonaccrual status is
    applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan or, if
    principal is considered fully collectible, recognized as
    interest income.

Due to changes in GAAP for loans acquired in a business
    combination subsequent to December 31, 2008, the excess of
    cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value
    is recognized as interest income over the remaining lives of the
    loans. Because those loans are recorded at fair value, no carry
    over of an acquired entity’s previously established
    allowance for credit losses may be recorded. Subsequent
    decreases in the expected cash flows require the Company to
    evaluate the need for additions to the Company’s allowance
    for credit losses. Subsequent improvements in expected cash
    flows result in the recognition of additional interest income
    over the then remaining lives of the loans.



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

Residual value estimates for commercial leases are generally
    determined through internal or external reviews of the leased
    property. The Company reviews commercial lease residual values
    at least annually and recognizes residual value impairments
    deemed to be other than temporary.

Allowance
    for credit losses

The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in
    management’s judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit
    losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the
    balance sheet date. The adequacy of the allowance is determined
    by management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio
    based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated
    with each loan category, the current financial condition of
    specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers
    operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any
    collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any
    guarantees or indemnifications.

Assets
    taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans

Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans are primarily
    comprised of commercial and residential real property and are
    included in “other assets” in the consolidated balance
    sheet. Upon acquisition of assets taken in satisfaction of a
    defaulted loan, the excess of the remaining loan balance over
    the asset’s estimated fair value less costs to sell is
    charged off against the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent
    declines in value of the assets are recognized as “other
    expense” in the consolidated statement of income.

Premises
    and equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation expense is computed principally using
    the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets.

Capitalized
    servicing rights

Capitalized servicing assets are included in “other
    assets” in the consolidated balance sheet. Separately
    recognized servicing assets are initially measured at fair
    value. The Company uses the amortization method to subsequently
    measure servicing assets. Under that method, capitalized
    servicing assets are charged to expense in proportion to and
    over the period of estimated net servicing income.

To estimate the fair value of servicing rights, the Company
    considers market prices for similar assets and the present value
    of expected future cash flows associated with the servicing
    rights calculated using assumptions that market participants
    would use in estimating future servicing income and expense.
    Such assumptions include estimates of the cost of servicing
    loans, loan default rates, an appropriate discount rate, and
    prepayment speeds. For purposes of evaluating and measuring
    impairment of capitalized servicing rights, the Company
    stratifies such assets based on the predominant risk
    characteristics of the underlying financial instruments that are
    expected to have the most impact on projected prepayments, cost
    of servicing and other factors affecting future cash flows
    associated with the servicing rights. Such factors may include
    financial asset or loan type, note rate and term. The amount of
    impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value
    of the capitalized servicing rights for a stratum exceeds
    estimated fair value. Impairment is recognized through a
    valuation allowance.

Sales
    and securitizations of financial assets

Transfers of financial assets for which the Company has
    surrendered control of the financial assets are accounted for as
    sales to the extent that consideration other than beneficial
    interests in the transferred assets is received in exchange.
    Interests in a sale or securitization of financial assets that
    continue to be held by the Company, other than servicing rights
    which are initially measured at fair value, are measured at the
    date of transfer by allocating the previous carrying amount
    between the assets transferred and the retained interests based
    on their relative estimated fair values. The fair values of
    retained debt securities are generally determined through
    reference to independent pricing information. The fair values of
    retained servicing rights and any other retained interests are
    determined based on the present value of expected future cash
    flows associated with those interests and by reference to market
    prices for similar assets.

Goodwill
    and core deposit and other intangible assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity
    over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
    Similar to goodwill, other intangible assets, which include core
    deposit intangibles, also lack physical substance but, as
    required by GAAP, portions of the cost of an acquired entity
    have been assigned to such assets. The Company accounts for
    goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with GAAP,
    which, in general, requires that goodwill not be amortized, but
    rather that it be tested for impairment at least annually at the
    reporting unit level, which is either at the same level or one
    level below an operating segment. Other acquired intangible
    assets with finite lives, such as core deposit intangibles, are
    required to be amortized over their estimated lives. Core
    deposit and other intangible assets are generally amortized
    using accelerated methods over estimated useful lives of five to
    ten years. The Company periodically assesses whether events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of
    core deposit and other intangible assets may be impaired.

Derivative
    financial instruments

The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments at
    fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be
    specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to
    changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or
    an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the
    exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction or
    (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net
    investment in a foreign operation, an unrecognized firm
    commitment, an available for sale security, or a foreign
    currency denominated forecasted transaction.

The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of
    the management of interest rate risk to modify the repricing
    characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities. For such agreements,
    amounts receivable or payable are recognized as accrued under
    the terms of the agreement and the net differential is recorded
    as an adjustment to interest income or expense of the related
    asset or liability. Interest rate swap agreements may be
    designated as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. In a
    fair value hedge, the fair values of the interest rate swap
    agreements and changes in the fair values of the hedged items
    are recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet
    with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current
    earnings. The difference between changes in the fair values of
    interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents
    hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in “other revenues
    from operations” in the consolidated statement of income.
    In a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the
    derivative’s unrealized gain or loss is initially recorded
    as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently
    reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction
    affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gain
    or loss is reported in “other revenues from
    operations” immediately.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to
    hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of real estate
    loans held for sale. Commitments to originate real estate loans
    to be held for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans
    are generally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at
    estimated fair market value. Effective January 1, 2008, the
    Company adopted the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin
    (“SAB”) No. 109 for written loan commitments
    issued or modified after that date. SAB No. 109
    reversed previous conclusions expressed by the SEC staff
    regarding written loan commitments that are accounted for at
    fair value through earnings. Specifically, the SEC staff now
    believes that the expected net future cash flows related to the
    associated servicing of the loan should be included in the fair
    value measurement of the derivative loan commitment. In
    accordance with SAB No. 105, “Application of
    Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments,” the Company had
    not included such amount in the value of commitments to
    originate real estate loans for sale in 2007.

Derivative instruments not related to mortgage banking
    activities, including financial futures commitments and interest
    rate swap agreements, that do not satisfy the hedge accounting
    requirements are recorded at fair value and are generally
    classified as trading account assets or liabilities with
    resultant changes in fair value being recognized in
    “trading account and foreign exchange gains” in the
    consolidated statement of income.



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

Stock-based
    compensation

Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the vesting
    period of the stock-based grant based on the estimated grant
    date value of the stock-based compensation that is expected to
    vest, except that the recognition of compensation costs is
    accelerated for stock-based awards granted to
    retirement-eligible employees and employees who will become
    retirement-eligible prior to full vesting of the award because
    the Company’s incentive compensation plan allows for
    vesting at the time an employee retires. Information on the
    determination of the estimated value of stock-based awards used
    to calculate stock-based compensation expense is included in
    note 11.

Income
    taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
    future tax effects attributable to differences between the
    financial statement value of existing assets and liabilities and
    their respective tax bases and carryforwards. Deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and
    laws.

The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions using the two-step
    process required by GAAP. The first step requires a
    determination of whether it is more likely than not that a tax
    position will be sustained upon examination, including
    resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based
    on the technical merits of the position. Under the second step,
    a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition
    threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is
    greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon
    ultimate settlement. Information related to uncertain tax
    positions is provided in note 13.

Earnings
    per common share

Basic earnings per common share exclude dilution and are
    computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by
    the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
    (exclusive of shares represented by the unvested portion of
    restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants) and common
    shares issuable under deferred compensation arrangements during
    the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflect shares
    represented by the unvested portion of restricted stock and
    restricted stock unit grants and the potential dilution that
    could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common
    stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted
    in the issuance of common stock that then shared in earnings.
    Proceeds assumed to have been received on such exercise or
    conversion are assumed to be used to purchase shares of M&T
    common stock at the average market price during the period, as
    required by the “treasury stock method” of accounting.

GAAP requires that for financial statements issued for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods
    within those years, unvested share-based payment awards that
    contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend
    equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) shall be considered
    participating securities and shall be included in the
    computation of earnings per common share pursuant to the
    two-class method. In 2009, the Company issued stock-based
    compensation awards in the form of restricted stock and
    restricted stock units that contain such rights and,
    accordingly, beginning in 2009 the Company’s earnings per
    common share are calculated using the two-class method. The
    effects of the application of the two-class method to previously
    reported earnings per common share amounts were immaterial.

Treasury
    stock

Repurchases of shares of M&T common stock are recorded at
    cost as a reduction of stockholders’ equity. Reissuances of
    shares of treasury stock are recorded at average cost.

Acquisitions

On August 28, 2009, M&T Bank, M&T’s
    principal banking subsidiary, entered into a purchase and
    assumption agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation (“FDIC”) to assume all of the deposits and
    acquire certain assets of Bradford Bank (“Bradford”),
    Baltimore, Maryland. As part of the transaction, M&T Bank
    entered into a loss-share arrangement with the FDIC whereby
    M&T Bank will be reimbursed by the FDIC for most losses it
    incurs on the acquired loan portfolio. The transaction has been
    accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and,
    accordingly, assets acquired and



M&T

liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair value on the
    acquisition date. Assets acquired totaled approximately
    $469 million, including $302 million of loans, and
    liabilities assumed aggregated $440 million, including
    $361 million of deposits. In accordance with GAAP, M&T
    Bank recorded an after-tax gain on the transaction of
    $18 million ($29 million before taxes). There was no
    goodwill or other intangible assets recorded in connection with
    this transaction. The Bradford acquisition transaction did not
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position or results of operations.

On May 23, 2009, M&T acquired all of the outstanding
    common stock of Provident Bankshares Corporation
    (“Provident”), a bank holding company based in
    Baltimore, Maryland, in a

stock-for-stock

transaction. Provident Bank, Provident’s banking
    subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank on that date. The
    results of operations acquired in the Provident transaction have
    been included in the Company’s financial results since
    May 23, 2009. Provident common shareholders received
    .171625 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for
    each share of Provident common stock, resulting in M&T
    issuing a total of 5,838,308 common shares with an acquisition
    date fair value of $273 million. In addition, based on the
    merger agreement, outstanding and unexercised options to
    purchase Provident common stock were converted into options to
    purchase the common stock of M&T. Those options had an
    estimated fair value of $1 million. In total, the purchase
    price was approximately $274 million based on the fair
    value on the acquisition date of M&T common stock exchanged
    and the options to purchase M&T common stock. Holders of
    Provident’s preferred stock were issued shares of new
    Series B and Series C Preferred Stock of M&T
    having substantially identical terms. That preferred stock and
    warrants to purchase common stock associated with the
    Series C Preferred Stock added $162 million to
    M&T’s stockholders’ equity.

The Provident transaction has been accounted for using the
    acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets
    acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration exchanged were
    recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Assets
    acquired totaled $6.3 billion, including $4.0 billion
    of loans and leases (including approximately $1.7 billion
    of commercial real estate loans, $1.4 billion of consumer
    loans, $700 million of commercial loans and leases and
    $300 million of residential real estate loans) and
    $1.0 billion of investment securities. Liabilities assumed
    were $5.9 billion, including $5.1 billion of deposits.
    The transaction added $436 million to M&T’s
    stockholders’ equity, including $280 million of common
    equity and $156 million of preferred equity. In connection
    with the acquisition, the Company recorded $332 million of
    goodwill and $63 million of core deposit intangible. The
    core deposit intangible is being amortized over seven years
    using an accelerated method. The acquisition of Provident
    expanded the Company’s presence in the Mid-Atlantic area,
    gave the Company the second largest deposit share in Maryland,
    and tripled the Company’s presence in Virginia.

In many cases, determining the fair value of the acquired assets
    and assumed liabilities required the Company to estimate cash
    flows expected to result from those assets and liabilities and
    to discount those cash flows at appropriate rates of interest.
    The most significant of those determinations related to the fair
    valuation of acquired loans. For such loans, the excess of cash
    flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is
    recognized as interest income over the remaining lives of the
    loans. The difference between contractually required payments at
    acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at
    acquisition reflects the impact of estimated credit losses and
    other factors, such as prepayments. In accordance with GAAP,
    there was no carry over of Provident’s previously
    established allowance for credit losses. Subsequent decreases in
    the expected cash flows will require the Company to evaluate the
    need for additions to the Company’s allowance for credit
    losses. Subsequent improvements in expected cash flows will
    result in the recognition of additional interest income over the
    then remaining lives of the loans.

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

In connection with the acquisition of Provident, goodwill of
    $332 million was calculated after recording all other
    acquired assets and liabilities at estimated fair value. In
    management’s opinion, that goodwill represents the inherent
    long-term value expected from the business opportunities and
    synergies created from combining Provident with the Company.
    None of the goodwill recognized is deductible for income tax
    purposes. Changes in goodwill in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheet from December 31, 2008 to December 31,
    2009 were attributable to the acquisition of Provident. As
    described in note 22, the Company does not allocate
    goodwill to its reportable segments when compiling the assets
    associated with those segments. The Company does, however,
    allocate goodwill to segments for purposes of periodically
    testing goodwill for impairment. That allocation of goodwill to
    the Company’s segments is provided in note 8.

The following table discloses the impact of Provident (excluding
    the impact of merger-related expenses noted below) since the
    acquisition on May 23, 2009 through the end of 2009. The
    table also presents certain pro forma information for 2009 as if
    Provident had been acquired on January 1, 2009 and for 2008
    as if Provident had been acquired on January 1, 2008. These
    results combine the historical results of Provident into the
    Company’s consolidated statement of income and, while
    certain adjustments were made for the estimated impact of
    certain fair valuation adjustments and other acquisition-related
    activity, they are not indicative of what would have occurred
    had the acquisition taken place on the indicated dates. In
    particular, no adjustments have been made to eliminate the
    amount of Provident’s provision for credit losses of
    $42 million in 2009 and $38 million in 2008 or the
    impact of other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized by
    Provident of $87 million in 2009 and $121 million in
    2008 that would not have been necessary had the acquired loans
    and investment securities been recorded at fair value as of the
    beginning of each year. Furthermore, expenses related to systems
    conversions and other costs of integration are included in the
    2009 periods in which such costs were incurred.

Additionally, the Company expects to achieve further operating
    cost savings and other business synergies as a result of the
    acquisition which are not reflected in the pro forma amounts
    that follow.

On November 30, 2007, M&T completed the acquisition of
    Partners Trust Financial Group, Inc. (“Partners
    Trust”), a bank holding company headquartered in Utica, New
    York. Partners Trust operated 33 branch offices in upstate New
    York at the date of acquisition. The results of operations
    acquired in the Partners Trust transaction have been included in
    the Company’s financial results since November 30,
    2007. After application of the election, allocation and
    proration procedures contained in the merger agreement with
    Partners Trust, M&T paid $282 million in cash and
    issued 3,096,861 shares of M&T common stock in
    exchange for Partners Trust shares and stock options outstanding
    at the time of acquisition. The purchase price was approximately
    $559 million based on the cash paid to Partners Trust
    shareholders, the fair value of M&T common stock exchanged,
    and the cash paid to holders of Partners Trust stock options.
    The acquisition of Partners Trust expanded the Company’s
    presence in upstate New York, making the Company the deposit
    market share leader in the Utica-Rome and Binghamton markets,
    while strengthening its lead position in Syracuse.

Assets acquired from Partners Trust on November 30, 2007
    totaled $3.5 billion, including $2.2 billion of loans
    and leases (largely residential real estate and consumer loans),
    liabilities assumed aggregated $3.0 billion, including
    $2.2 billion of deposits (largely savings, money-market and
    time deposits), and $277 million was added to
    stockholders’ equity. In connection with the acquisition,
    the Company recorded approximately $283 million of goodwill
    and $50 million of core deposit intangible. The core
    deposit intangible is being amortized over seven years using an
    accelerated method.

As a condition of the approval of the Partners Trust acquisition
    by regulators, M&T Bank was required to divest three branch
    offices in Binghamton, New York. The three branches were sold on

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

March 15, 2008, including loans of $13 million and
    deposits of $65 million. No gain or loss was recognized on
    that transaction.

Pro forma information for the year ended December 31, 2007
    as if Partners Trust had been acquired on January 1, 2007
    is not presented since such pro forma results were not
    materially different from the Company’s actual results.

On December 7, 2007, M&T Bank acquired 13 branch
    offices in the Mid-Atlantic area from First Horizon Bank in a
    cash transaction. The offices had approximately
    $214 million of loans, $216 million of deposits and
    $80 million of trust and investment assets under management
    on the transaction date.

The Company incurred merger-related expenses related to systems
    conversions and other costs of integrating and conforming
    acquired operations with and into the Company of approximately
    $89 million ($54 million net of applicable income
    taxes) during 2009, $4 million ($2 million net of
    applicable income taxes) during 2008 and $15 million
    ($9 million net of applicable income taxes) during 2007.
    Those expenses consisted largely of professional services and
    other temporary help fees associated with the conversion of
    systems

and/or

integration of operations; costs related to branch and office
    consolidations; costs related to termination of existing
    contractual arrangements for various services; initial marketing
    and promotion expenses designed to introduce M&T Bank to
    its new customers; severance (for former Provident employees)
    and incentive compensation costs; travel costs; and printing,
    postage, supplies and other costs of commencing operations in
    new markets and offices. As of December 31, 2009, the
    remaining unpaid portion of merger-related expenses was
    $20 million.

Gross realized gains on investment securities were $1,629,000 in
    2009, $34,730,000 in 2008 and $1,585,000 in 2007. Gross realized
    losses on investment securities were $464,000 in 2009, $259,000
    in 2008 and $381,000 in 2007. Effective January 1, 2009,
    the Company adopted new GAAP related to the recognition and
    presentation of other-than-temporary impairments of investment
    securities. In accordance with GAAP, the Company recognized
    $138 million of pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment
    losses in 2009 related primarily to $230 million of
    privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities. The
    impairment charges were recognized in light of deterioration of
    housing values in the residential real estate market and a rise
    in delinquencies and charge-offs of underlying mortgage loans
    collateralizing those securities. Approximately $8 million
    of the impairment charges recognized in 2009 related to
    collateralized debt obligations backed by trust preferred
    securities issued by financial institutions. The
    other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized were net of
    $126 million of unrealized losses classified in accumulated
    other comprehensive income for the same securities for the
    year-ended December 31, 2009. The other-than-temporary
    impairment losses represent management’s estimate of credit
    losses inherent in the securities considering projected cash
    flows using assumptions of delinquency rates, loss severities,
    and other estimates of future collateral performance. The effect
    of the adoption of the new accounting requirements on debt
    securities previously reported as other-than-temporarily
    impaired was not material and, therefore, the Company did not
    record a transition adjustment as of January 1, 2009.
    During 2008, the Company recognized $182 million of
    other-than-temporary impairment losses, mainly attributable to a
    $153 million impairment charge recognized on its preferred
    stock holdings of The Federal National Mortgage Association
    (“Fannie Mae”) and The Federal Home Loan Mortgage
    Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) with a cost basis of
    $162 million following the placement of those
    government-sponsored entities into conservatorship on
    September 7, 2008. Other-than-temporary charges of
    $18 million and $11 million were also recognized
    during 2008 on $20 million of privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities and $12 million of securities
    backed by trust preferred securities issued by financial
    institutions, respectively. During 2007, the Company recognized
    a $127 million other-than-temporary impairment charge
    related to collateralized debt obligations that were supported
    by sub-prime mortgage-backed securities that had an amortized
    cost basis of $132 million. Changes in credit losses

The Company owned 879 individual investment securities with
    aggregate gross unrealized losses of $635,612,000 at
    December 31, 2009. Approximately $542 million of the
    unrealized losses pertain to privately issued mortgage-backed
    securities with a cost basis of $2.4 billion. The Company
    also had $69 million of unrealized losses on trust
    preferred securities issued by financial institutions,
    securities backed by trust preferred securities issued by
    financial institutions and other entities, and other debt
    securities having a cost basis of $230 million. Based on a
    review of each of the remaining securities in the investment
    securities portfolio at December 31, 2009, with the
    exception of the aforementioned securities for which
    other-than-temporary impairment losses were recognized, the
    Company concluded that it expected to recover the amortized cost
    basis of its investment. As of December 31, 2009, the
    Company does not intend to sell nor is it anticipated that it
    would be required to sell any of its impaired investment
    securities. At December 31, 2009, the Company has not
    identified events or changes in circumstances which may have a
    significant adverse effect on the fair value of the
    $509 million of cost method investment securities.

At December 31, 2009, investment securities with a carrying
    value of $4,823,703,000, including $4,064,840,000 of investment
    securities available for sale, were pledged to secure demand
    notes issued to the U.S. Treasury, borrowings from various
    FHLBs, repurchase agreements, governmental deposits and interest
    rate swap agreements.

Investment securities pledged by the Company to secure
    obligations whereby the secured party is permitted by contract
    or custom to sell or repledge such collateral totaled

One-to-four family residential mortgage loans held for sale were

    $352 million at December 31, 2008. Commercial mortgage
    loans held for sale were $123 million at December 31,
    2009 and $156 million at December 31, 2008.

As of December 31, 2009, approximately $16 million of
    one-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced for
    others had been sold with credit recourse. As of
    December 31, 2009, approximately $1.3 billion of
    commercial mortgage loan balances serviced for others had been
    sold with recourse in conjunction with the Company’s
    participation in the Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and
    Servicing (“DUS”) program. At December 31, 2009
    the Company estimated that the recourse obligations described
    above were not material to the Company’s consolidated
    financial position. There have been no material losses incurred
    as a result of those credit recourse arrangements.

Nonaccrual loans totaled $1,331,702,000 at December 31,
    2009 and $755,397,000 at December 31, 2008. Renegotiated
    loans (loans which had been renegotiated at below-market
    interest rates or for which other concessions were granted, but
    are accruing interest) were $212,548,000 and $91,575,000 at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009 and
    2008, to assist borrowers the Company modified the terms of
    select residential real estate loans consisting largely of loans
    in the Company’s portfolio of Alt-A loans. At
    December 31, 2009, outstanding balances of those modified
    loans totaled approximately $292 million. Of that total,
    $108 million were included in nonaccrual loans at
    December 31, 2009. The remaining $184 million of such
    modified loans have demonstrated payment capability consistent
    with the modified terms and accordingly, were classified as
    renegotiated loans and were accruing interest at the
    2009 year-end. If nonaccrual and renegotiated loans had
    been accruing interest at their originally contracted terms,
    interest income on such loans would have amounted to $99,618,000
    in 2009 and $61,666,000 in 2008. The actual amounts included in
    interest income during 2009 and 2008 on such loans were
    $43,920,000 and $36,747,000, respectively.

The recorded investment in loans considered impaired for
    purposes of applying GAAP was $1,311,616,000 and $616,743,000 at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The recorded
    investment in loans considered impaired for which there was a
    related valuation allowance for impairment included in the
    allowance for credit losses and the amount of such impairment
    allowance were $1,077,626,000 and $244,137,000, respectively, at
    December 31, 2009 and $501,873,000 and $123,674,000,
    respectively, at December 31, 2008. The recorded investment
    in loans considered impaired for which there was no related
    valuation allowance for impairment was $233,990,000 and
    $114,870,000 at December 31, 2009

and 2008, respectively. The average recorded investment in
    impaired loans during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $986,164,000,
    $371,298,000 and $195,597,000, respectively. Interest income
    recognized on impaired loans totaled $10,224,000, $7,222,000 and
    $7,368,000 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively.

Borrowings by directors and certain officers of M&T and its
    banking subsidiaries, and by associates of such persons,
    exclusive of loans aggregating less than $120,000 amounted to
    $106,845,000 and $154,128,000 at December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. During 2009, new borrowings by such persons
    amounted to $13,038,000 (including any borrowings of new
    directors or officers that were outstanding at the time of their
    election) and repayments and other reductions (including
    reductions resulting from retirements) were $60,321,000.

At December 31, 2009, approximately $4.3 billion of
    commercial mortgage loans and $2.4 billion of one-to-four
    family residential mortgage loans were pledged to secure
    outstanding borrowings from the FHLB of New York.

The Company’s loan and lease portfolio includes commercial
    lease financing receivables consisting of direct financing and
    leveraged leases for machinery and equipment, railroad
    equipment, commercial trucks and trailers, and aircraft. A

Residential mortgage loans serviced for others were
    $15.9 billion, $15.4 billion and $14.5 billion at
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Small-balance commercial mortgage loans serviced for others were
    $5.5 billion, $5.9 billion and $4.9 billion at
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Commercial
    mortgage loans serviced for others were $7.1 billion,
    $6.4 billion and $5.3 billion at December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

During 2009 and 2007, $21,950,000 and $4,050,000, respectively,
    of the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage
    loan servicing assets was reversed because of increases in the
    market value of certain strata of servicing assets relative to
    the amortized cost basis of the servicing assets in such strata.
    During 2008, a provision for impairment of $16,000,000 was added
    to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage
    loan servicing assets because the carrying value of certain
    strata of capitalized servicing assets exceeded estimated fair
    value. The estimated fair value of capitalized residential
    mortgage loan servicing assets was approximately
    $158 million at December 31, 2009 and
    $103 million at December 31, 2008. The fair value of
    capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets was
    estimated using weighted-average discount rates of 13.3% and
    13.0% at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and
    contemporaneous prepayment assumptions that vary by loan type.
    At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the discount rate
    represented a weighted-average option-adjusted spread
    (“OAS”) of 775 basis points (hundredths of one
    percent) and 832 basis points, respectively, over market
    implied



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

forward London Interbank Offered Rates. The estimated fair value
    of capitalized small-balance commercial mortgage loan servicing
    assets was approximately $64 million at December 31,
    2009 and $74 million at December 31, 2008. The fair
    value of capitalized small-balance commercial loan servicing
    assets was estimated using weighted-average discount rates of
    20.3% and 20.2% at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, and contemporaneous prepayment assumptions that
    vary by loan type. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
    discount rate represented a weighted-average OAS of
    1,779 basis points and 1,774 basis points,
    respectively, over market implied forward London Interbank
    Offered Rates. The estimated fair value of capitalized
    residential and small-balance commercial mortgage loan servicing
    rights may vary significantly in subsequent periods due to
    changing interest rates and the effect thereof on prepayment
    speeds. The estimated fair value of capitalized commercial
    mortgage loan servicing assets was approximately
    $39 million and $31 million at December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively. An 18% discount rate was used to
    estimate the fair value of capitalized commercial mortgage loan
    servicing rights at December 31, 2009 and 2008 with no
    prepayment assumptions because, in general, the servicing
    agreements allow the Company to share in customer loan
    prepayment fees and thereby recover the remaining carrying value
    of the capitalized servicing rights associated with such loan.
    The Company’s ability to realize the carrying value of
    capitalized commercial mortgage servicing rights is more
    dependent on the borrowers’ abilities to repay the
    underlying loans than on prepayments or changes in interest
    rates.

The key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of
    capitalized servicing rights at December 31, 2009 and the
    sensitivity of such value to changes in those assumptions are
    summarized in the table that follows. Those calculated
    sensitivities are hypothetical and actual changes in the fair
    value of capitalized servicing rights may differ significantly
    from the amounts presented herein. The effect of a variation in
    a particular assumption on the fair value of the servicing
    rights is calculated without changing any other assumption. In
    reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another
    which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities. The changes
    in assumptions are presumed to be instantaneous.

Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets was

    amortization periods of five to ten years. The weighted-average
    original amortization period was approximately eight years. The
    remaining weighted-average amortization period as of
    December 31, 2009 was approximately six years. Amortization
    expense for core deposit and other intangible assets was
    $64,255,000, $66,646,000 and $66,486,000 for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Estimated

Also in accordance with GAAP, the Company completed annual
    goodwill impairment tests as of October 1, 2009, 2008 and
    2007. For purposes of testing for impairment, the Company
    assigned all recorded goodwill to the reporting units originally
    intended to benefit from past business combinations, which has
    historically been the Company’s core relationship business
    reporting units. Goodwill was generally assigned based on the
    implied fair value of the acquired goodwill applicable to the
    benefited reporting units at the time of each respective
    acquisition. The implied fair value of the goodwill was
    determined as the difference between the estimated incremental
    overall fair value of the reporting unit and the estimated fair
    value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit as of
    each respective acquisition date. To test for goodwill
    impairment at each evaluation date, the Company compared the
    estimated fair value of each of its reporting units to their
    respective carrying amounts and certain other assets and
    liabilities assigned to the reporting unit, including goodwill
    and core deposit and other intangible assets. The methodologies
    used to estimate fair values of reporting units as of the
    acquisition dates and as of the evaluation dates were similar.
    For the Company’s core customer relationship business
    reporting units, fair value was estimated as the present value
    of the expected future cash flows of the reporting unit. Based
    on the results of the goodwill impairment tests, the Company
    concluded that the amount of recorded goodwill was not impaired
    at the respective testing dates.

The subordinated notes of M&T Bank are unsecured and are
    subordinate to the claims of depositors and other creditors of
    M&T Bank. The subordinated notes of M&T Bank due 2013
    had a fixed rate of interest of 3.85% through March 2008 and
    bear a floating rate of interest thereafter until maturity in
    April 2013, at a rate equal to the three-month London Interbank
    Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.50%. The subordinated
    notes of M&T were unsecured and subordinate to the general
    creditors of M&T.

Long-term variable rate advances from the FHLB had contractual
    interest rates that ranged from 0% to 3.53% at December 31,
    2009 and from 1.04% to 4.65% at December 31, 2008. The
    weighted-average contractual interest rates were 0.35% at
    December 31, 2009 and 2.62% at December 31, 2008.
    Long-term fixed-rate advances from the FHLB had contractual
    interest rates ranging from 3.24% to 7.32%. The weighted-average
    contractual interest rates payable were 4.89% at
    December 31, 2009 and



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

5.13% at December 31, 2008. Advances from the FHLB mature
    at various dates through 2035 and are secured by residential
    real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and investment
    securities.

Long-term agreements to repurchase securities had contractual
    interest rates that ranged from 3.91% to 5.14%. The
    weighted-average contractual interest rates were 4.21% at each
    of December 31, 2009 and 2008. The agreements outstanding
    at December 31, 2009 reflect various repurchase dates
    through 2017, however, the contractual maturities of the
    underlying investment securities extend beyond such repurchase
    dates.

The fixed and floating rate junior subordinated deferrable
    interest debentures (“Junior Subordinated Debentures”)
    are held by various trusts and were issued in connection with
    the issuance by those trusts of preferred capital securities
    (“Capital Securities”) and common securities
    (“Common Securities”). The proceeds from the issuances
    of the Capital Securities and the Common Securities were used by
    the trusts to purchase the Junior Subordinated Debentures. The
    Common Securities of each of those trusts are wholly owned by
    M&T and are the only class of each trust’s securities
    possessing general voting powers. The Capital Securities
    represent preferred undivided interests in the assets of the
    corresponding trust. Under the Federal Reserve Board’s
    current risk-based capital guidelines, the Capital Securities
    are includable in M&T’s Tier 1 capital. The
    variable rate Junior Subordinated Debentures pay interest
    quarterly at rates that are indexed to the three-month LIBOR.
    Those rates ranged from 1.13% to 3.63% at December 31, 2009
    and from 4.04% to 8.17% at December 31, 2008. The
    weighted-average variable rates payable on those Junior
    Subordinated Debentures were 1.70% and 5.05% at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Holders of the Capital Securities receive preferential
    cumulative cash distributions unless M&T exercises its
    right to extend the payment of interest on the Junior
    Subordinated Debentures as allowed by the terms of each such
    debenture, in which case payment of distributions on the
    respective Capital Securities will be deferred for comparable
    periods. During an extended interest period, M&T may not
    pay dividends or distributions on, or repurchase, redeem or
    acquire any shares of its capital stock. In the event of an
    extended interest period exceeding twenty quarterly periods for
    $350 million of Junior Subordinated Debentures due
    January 31, 2068, M&T must fund the payment of accrued
    and unpaid interest through an alternative payment mechanism,
    which requires M&T to issue common stock, non-cumulative
    perpetual preferred stock or warrants to purchase common stock
    until M&T has raised an amount of eligible proceeds at
    least equal to the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid
    deferred interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures due
    January 31, 2068. In general, the agreements governing the
    Capital Securities, in the aggregate, provide a full,
    irrevocable and unconditional guarantee by M&T of the
    payment of distributions on, the redemption of, and any
    liquidation distribution with respect to the Capital Securities.
    The obligations under such guarantee and the Capital Securities
    are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all senior
    indebtedness of M&T.

The Capital Securities will remain outstanding until the Junior
    Subordinated Debentures are repaid at maturity, are redeemed
    prior to maturity or are distributed in liquidation to the
    Trusts. The Capital Securities are mandatorily redeemable in
    whole, but not in part, upon repayment at the stated maturity
    dates (ranging from 2027 to 2068) of the Junior
    Subordinated Debentures or the earlier redemption of the Junior
    Subordinated Debentures in whole upon the occurrence of one or
    more events set forth in the indentures relating to the Capital
    Securities, and in whole or in part at any time after an
    optional redemption prior to contractual maturity
    contemporaneously with the optional redemption of the related
    Junior Subordinated Debentures in whole or in part, subject to
    possible regulatory approval. In connection with the issuance of
    8.50% Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities associated with
    $350 million of Junior Subordinated Debentures maturing in
    2068, M&T entered into a replacement capital covenant that
    provides that neither M&T nor any of its subsidiaries will
    repay, redeem or purchase any of the Junior Subordinated
    Debentures due January 31, 2068 or the 8.50% Enhanced
    Trust Preferred Securities prior to January 31, 2048,
    with certain limited exceptions, except to the extent that,
    during the 180 days prior to the date of that repayment,
    redemption or purchase, M&T and its subsidiaries have
    received proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities that
    (i) have equity-like characteristics that are the same as,
    or more equity-like than, the applicable characteristics of the
    8.50% Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities or the Junior
    Subordinated Debentures due January 31, 2068, as

Shares were issued as part of
    the Troubled Asset Relief Program — Capital Purchase
    Program of the U.S. Department of Treasury (“U.S.
    Treasury”). Cash proceeds were allocated between the
    preferred stock and a ten-year warrant to purchase M&T
    common stock (Series A — 1,218,522 common
    shares at $73.86 per share, Series C —
    407,542 common shares at $55.76 per share). Dividends, if
    declared, will accrue and be paid quarterly at a rate of 5% per
    year for the first five years following the original 2008
    issuance dates and thereafter at a rate of 9% per year. The
    agreement with the U.S. Treasury contains limitations on certain
    actions of M&T, including the payment of quarterly cash
    dividends on M&T’s common stock in excess of $.70 per
    share, the repurchase of its common stock during the first three
    years of the agreement, and the amount and nature of
    compensation arrangements for certain of the Company’s
    officers.

Shares were assumed in the
    Provident acquisition and a new Series B Preferred Stock
    was designated. In the aggregate, the shares of Series B
    Preferred Stock will automatically convert into
    433,148 shares of M&T common stock on April 1,
    2011, but shareholders may elect to convert their preferred
    shares at any time prior to that date. Dividends, if declared,
    are payable quarterly in arrears at a rate of 10% per
    year.

Stock-based
    compensation plans

Stock-based compensation expense was $54 million in 2009,
    $50 million in 2008 and $51 million in 2007. The
    Company recognized $17 million, $11 million and
    $12 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, of income
    tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

The Company’s equity incentive compensation plan allows for
    the issuance of various forms of stock-based compensation,
    including stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
    units and performance-based awards. Through December 31,
    2009, only stock-based compensation awards, including stock
    options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, that vest
    with the passage of time as service is provided have been
    issued. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, there
    were 6,134,264 and 3,108,342 shares available for future
    grant under the Company’s equity incentive compensation
    plan.

Stock
    option awards

Stock options issued generally vest over four years and are
    exercisable over terms not exceeding ten years and one day. The
    Company used an option pricing model to estimate the grant date
    present value of stock options granted. The weighted-average
    estimated grant date value per option was $5.74 in 2009, $15.85
    in 2008 and $28.59 in 2007. The values were calculated using the
    following weighted-average assumptions: an option term of
    6.5 years (representing the estimated period between grant
    date and exercise date based on historical data); a risk-free
    interest rate of 2.76% in 2009, 3.21% in 2008 and 4.79% in 2007
    (representing the yield on a U.S. Treasury security with a
    remaining term equal to the expected option term); expected
    volatility of 29% in 2009, and 21% in each of 2008 and 2007
    (based on historical volatility of M&T’s common stock
    price); and estimated dividend yields of 7.20% in 2009, 3.07% in
    2008 and 1.98% in 2007 (representing the approximate annualized
    cash dividend rate paid with respect to a share of common stock
    at or near the grant date). Based on historical data and
    projected employee turnover rates, the Company reduced the
    estimated value of stock options for purposes of recognizing
    stock-based compensation expense by 7% to reflect the
    probability of forfeiture prior to vesting. Aggregate fair value
    of options expected to vest that were granted in 2009, 2008 and
    2007 were $340,000, $46 million and $48 million,
    respectively.

For 2009, 2008 and 2007, M&T received $15 million,
    $25 million and $66 million, respectively, in cash and
    realized tax benefits from the exercise of stock options of
    $3 million, $4 million and $17 million,
    respectively. The intrinsic value of stock options exercised
    during those periods was $6 million, $13 million and
    $55 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009,
    there was $15 million of total unrecognized compensation
    cost related to non-vested stock options. That cost is expected
    to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
    1.2 years. The total grant date fair value of stock options
    vested during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $37 million,
    $36 million and $39 million, respectively. Upon the
    exercise of stock options, the Company generally issues shares
    from treasury stock to the extent available, but may also issue
    new shares.

Restricted
    stock awards

Restricted stock awards are comprised of restricted stock and
    restricted stock units. Restricted stock awards vest over four
    years. Unrecognized compensation expense associated with
    restricted stock was $17 million as of December 31,
    2009 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
    period of 1.7 years. The Company generally will issue
    restricted shares from treasury stock to the extent available,
    but may also issue new shares. During 2009 and 2008, the number
    of shares of restricted stock issued was 709,415 and 37,747,
    respectively, with a weighted-average grant date fair value of
    $27,932,000 and $3,446,000, respectively. Unrecognized
    compensation expense associated with restricted stock units was
    $6 million as of December 31, 2009 and is expected to
    be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years.
    During 2009, the number of restricted stock units issued was

Stock
    purchase plan

The stock purchase plan provides eligible employees of the
    Company with the right to purchase shares of M&T common
    stock through accumulated payroll deductions. Shares of M&T
    common stock will be issued at the end of an option period,
    typically one year or six months. In connection with the
    employee stock purchase plan, 1,000,000 shares of M&T
    common stock were authorized for issuance, of which
    398,481 shares have been issued. There were
    3,149 shares issued in 2009, 2,377 shares were issued
    in 2008 and no shares were issued in 2007. For 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, M&T received $100,000 and $173,000 in cash
    for shares purchased through the employee stock purchase plan.

The Company used an option pricing model to estimate the grant
    date present value of purchase rights under the stock purchase
    plan. The estimated weighted-average grant date value per right
    was $16.39 in 2009, $12.79 in 2008 and $15.04 in 2007. Such
    values were calculated using the following weighted-average
    assumptions: a term of six months to one year (representing the
    period between grant date and exercise date); a risk-free
    interest rate of 0.45% in 2009, 2.05% in 2008 and 4.39% in 2007
    (representing the yield on a U.S. Treasury security with a
    like term); expected volatility of 69% in 2009, 34% in 2008 and
    20% in 2007 (based on historical volatility of M&T’s
    common stock price); and an estimated dividend yield of 4.77% in
    2009, 3.84% in 2008 and 2.63% in 2007 (representing the
    approximate annualized cash dividend rate paid with respect to a
    share of common stock at or near the grant date).

Deferred
    bonus plan

The Company provides a deferred bonus plan pursuant to which
    eligible employees may elect to defer all or a portion of their
    current annual incentive compensation awards and allocate such
    awards to several investment options, including M&T common
    stock. Participants could elect the timing of distributions from
    the plan. Such distributions are payable in cash with the
    exception of balances allocated to M&T common stock which
    are distributable in the form of M&T common stock. Shares
    of M&T common stock distributable pursuant to the terms of
    the deferred bonus plan were 54,386 and 54,782 at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The obligation to
    issue shares is included in “common stock issuable” in
    the consolidated balance sheet. Through December 31, 2009,
    111,885 shares have been issued in connection with the
    deferred bonus plan.

Directors’
    stock plan

The Company maintains a compensation plan for non-employee
    members of the Company’s boards of directors and directors
    advisory councils that allows such members to receive all or a
    portion of their compensation in shares of M&T common
    stock. Through December 31, 2009, 134,176 shares had
    been issued in connection with the directors’ stock plan.

Through an acquisition, the Company assumed an obligation to
    issue shares of M&T common stock related to a deferred
    directors compensation plan. Shares of common stock issuable
    under such plan were 20,784 and 23,665 at December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively. The obligation to issue shares is
    included in “common stock issuable” in the
    consolidated balance sheet.

Management
    stock ownership program

Through an acquisition, M&T obtained loans that are secured
    by M&T common stock purchased by former executives of the
    acquired entity. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the loan
    amounts owed M&T were less than the fair value of the
    financed stock purchased and totaled approximately
    $4 million. Such loans are classified as a reduction of
    “additional paid-in capital” in the consolidated
    balance sheet. The amounts are due to M&T no later than
    October 5, 2010.

The Company has an unfunded supplemental pension plan for
    certain key executives. The projected benefit obligation and
    accumulated benefit obligation included in the preceding data
    related to such plan were $63,705,000 and $63,640,000,
    respectively, as of December 31, 2009 and $48,096,000 and
    $47,977,000, respectively, as of December 31, 2008.
    Included in the amounts for 2009 was approximately
    $15 million assumed in the Provident acquisition.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit
    pension plans was $843,279,000 and $740,825,000 at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2009, the accumulated benefit obligation for
    those defined benefit pension plans in which the ABO exceeded
    plan assets totaled $797,101,000 (including $63,640,000 related
    to the unfunded supplemental pension plan). As of



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

December 31, 2008, all defined benefit pension plans had
    accumulated benefit obligations (including $47,977,000 related
    to the unfunded supplemental pension plan) in excess of plan
    assets.

GAAP requires an employer to recognize in its balance sheet as
    an asset or liability the overfunded or underfunded status of a
    defined benefit postretirement plan, measured as the difference
    between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit
    obligation. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the
    projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement
    benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit
    obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.
    Gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise
    during the period, but are not included as components of net
    periodic benefit expense, are recognized as a component of other
    comprehensive income. As indicated in the preceding table, as of
    December 31, 2009 the Company recorded a minimum liability
    adjustment of $192,668,000 ($196,088,000 related to pension
    plans and $(3,420,000) related to other postretirement benefits)
    with a corresponding reduction of stockholders’ equity, net
    of applicable deferred taxes, of $117,046,000. Of the
    $196,088,000 related to pension plans, $9,907,000 was related to
    unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans. In aggregate, the
    benefit plans incurred gains during 2009 that resulted from
    actual experience differing from the plan assumptions utilized
    and from changes in actuarial assumptions. The main factor
    contributing to those gains was a positive return on assets in
    the qualified defined benefit pension plans of approximately
    $159 million as compared with an expected gain of
    approximately $47 million. As a result, the Company
    decreased its minimum liability adjustment from that which was
    recorded at December 31, 2008 by $93,823,000 with a
    corresponding increase to stockholders’ equity that, net of
    applicable deferred taxes, was $57,284,000. The table below
    reflects the changes in plan assets and benefit obligations
    recognized in other comprehensive income related to the
    Company’s postretirement benefit plans.

The Company also provides a qualified defined contribution
    pension plan to eligible employees who were not participants in
    the defined benefit pension plan as of December 31, 2005
    and to other employees who have elected to participate in the
    defined contribution plan. The Company makes contributions to
    the defined contribution plan each year in an amount that is
    based on an individual participant’s total compensation
    (generally defined as total wages, incentive compensation,
    commissions and bonuses) and years of service. Participants do

On December 1, 2007, pension and other benefit obligations
    were assumed as a result of the acquisition of Partners Trust.
    Initial liabilities and net costs were determined using a 6.00%
    discount rate and other assumptions as noted above. Partners
    Trust had previously frozen all pension benefit accruals and
    participation in its plan. On May 23, 2009, pension and
    other obligations were assumed as a result of the acquisition of
    Provident. Initial liabilities and net costs were determined
    using a 7.00% discount rate and 4.50% expected return on assets.
    All future benefit accruals related to the former Provident
    qualified pension plan were frozen.

The expected long-term rate of return assumption as of each
    measurement date was developed through analysis of historical
    market returns, current market conditions, anticipated future
    asset allocations, the funds’ past experience, and
    expectations on potential future market returns. The expected
    rate of return assumption represents a long-term average view of
    the performance of the plan assets, a return that may or may not
    be achieved during any one calendar year.

For measurement of other postretirement benefits, a 7.5% annual
    rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care
    benefits was assumed for 2010. The rate was assumed to decrease
    gradually to 6% over 3 years and gradually to 5% over
    30 years. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a
    significant effect on the amounts reported for health care
    plans. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost
    trend rates would have had the following effects:

Plan
    Assets

The Company’s policy is to invest the pension plan assets
    in a prudent manner for the purpose of providing benefit
    payments to participants and mitigating reasonable expenses of
    administration. The Company’s investment strategy is
    designed to provide a total return that, over the long-term,
    places a strong emphasis on the preservation of capital. The
    strategy attempts to maximize investment returns on assets at a
    level of risk deemed appropriate by the Company while complying
    with applicable regulations and laws. The investment strategy
    utilizes asset allocation as a principal determinant for
    establishing an



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

appropriate risk profile. The target allocations for plan assets
    are generally 55 to 70 percent equity securities, 25 to
    40 percent debt securities, and 3 to 10 percent

money-market

funds or other short-term investments. Equity securities include
    investments in large-cap and mid-cap companies located in the
    United States, equity mutual funds with international
    investments, and, to a lesser extent, direct investments in
    foreign-based companies. Debt securities include corporate bonds
    of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed
    securities guaranteed by government agencies, U.S. Treasury
    securities, and mutual funds that invest in debt securities.
    Returns on invested assets are periodically compared with target
    market indices for each asset type to aid management in
    evaluating such returns. Furthermore, management regularly
    reviews the investment policy and may, if deemed appropriate,
    make changes to the target allocations noted above.

The fair values of the Company’s pension plan assets at
    December 31, 2009, by asset category, are as follows:

Pension plan assets included common stock of M&T with a
    fair value of $82,136,000 (10.7% of total plan assets) at
    December 31, 2009 and $18,826,000 (3% of total plan assets)
    at December 31, 2008. No other investment in securities of
    a

non-U.S. Government

or government agency issuer exceeded ten percent of plan assets
    at December 31, 2009. Pension plan assets also included
    American Depositary Shares of AIB (“AIB ADSs”) with a
    fair value of $495,000 and $661,000 at December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively (see note 24).

The Company makes contributions to its funded qualified defined
    benefit pension plans as required by government regulation or as
    deemed appropriate by management after considering factors such
    as the fair value of plan assets, expected returns on such
    assets, and the present value of benefit obligations of the
    plans. Subject to the impact of actual events and circumstances
    that may occur in 2010, the Company may make contributions to
    the qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2010, but the
    amount of any such contribution has not yet been determined. No
    minimum contribution is required in 2010 under government
    regulations for the qualified defined benefit pension plans. The
    Company’s contributions to the qualified defined benefit
    pension plans totaled $44 million in the form of common
    stock of M&T in 2009 and $140 million in cash in 2008.
    The Company regularly funds the payment of benefit obligations
    for the supplemental defined benefit pension and postretirement
    benefit plans because such plans do not hold assets for
    investment. Payments made by the Company for supplemental
    pension benefits were $4,239,000 and $3,634,000 in 2009 and
    2008, respectively. Payments made by the Company for
    postretirement benefits were $5,164,000 and $7,450,000 in 2009
    and 2008, respectively. Payments for supplemental pension and
    other postretirement benefits for 2010 are not expected to
    differ from those made in 2009 by an amount that will be
    material to the Company’s consolidated financial position.

Estimated benefits expected to be paid in future years related
    to the Company’s defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement benefits plans are as follows:

The Company has a retirement savings plan (“RSP”) that
    is a defined contribution plan in which eligible employees of
    the Company may defer up to 50% of qualified compensation via
    contributions to the plan. The Company makes an employer
    matching contribution in an amount equal to 75% of an
    employee’s contribution, up to 4.5% of the employee’s
    qualified compensation. Employees’ accounts, including
    employee contributions, employer matching contributions and
    accumulated earnings thereon, are at all times fully vested and
    nonforfeitable. Employee benefits expense resulting from the
    Company’s contributions to the RSP totaled $23,719,000,
    $23,311,000 and $21,749,000 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Total current income taxes for 2009 reflect a $10 million
    reversal of taxes accrued in earlier periods for previously
    uncertain tax positions in various jurisdictions because the
    applicable income tax returns are no longer subject to further
    examination by taxing authorities. Total current income taxes
    for 2008 reflect the resolution of previously uncertain tax
    positions related to the Company’s activities in various
    jurisdictions during the years

1999-2007

that allowed the Company to reduce previously accrued income
    taxes by $40 million.

The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return
    reflecting taxable income earned by all subsidiaries. In prior
    years, applicable federal tax law allowed certain financial
    institutions the option of deducting as bad debt expense for tax
    purposes amounts in excess of actual losses. In accordance with
    GAAP, such financial institutions were not required to provide
    deferred income taxes on such excess. Recapture of the excess
    tax bad debt reserve established under the previously allowed
    method will result in taxable income if M&T Bank fails to
    maintain bank status as defined in the Internal Revenue Code or
    charges are made to the reserve for other than bad debt losses.
    At December 31, 2009, M&T Bank’s tax bad debt
    reserve for which no federal income taxes have been provided was
    $79,121,000. No actions are planned that would cause this
    reserve to become wholly or partially taxable.

Income taxes attributable to gains or losses on bank investment
    securities were benefits of $53,824,000, $57,859,000 and
    $49,308,000 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. No alternative
    minimum tax expense was recognized in 2009, 2008 or 2007.

The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and
    penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in
    income taxes in the consolidated statement of income. The
    balance of accrued interest at December 31, 2009 is
    included in the table above. The Company’s federal, state
    and local income tax returns are routinely subject to
    examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such
    examinations may result in challenges to the tax return
    treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions.
    Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to
    record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate.
    Should determinations rendered by tax authorities ultimately
    indicate that management’s assumptions were inappropriate,
    the result and adjustments required could have a material effect
    on the Company’s results of operations. Under statute, the
    Company’s federal income tax returns for the years

2006-2008

could be adjusted by the Internal Revenue Service
    (“IRS”), although examinations for those tax years
    have been concluded. The Company is appealing the sole issue
    raised by the IRS in its examination of 2007 and would
    anticipate that any settlement or resolution within the next
    twelve months would not materially impact the effective tax
    rate. The Company also files income tax returns in over forty
    state and local jurisdictions. Substantially all material state
    and local matters have been concluded for years through 2001.
    Some tax returns for years after 2001 are presently under
    examination. It is not reasonably possible to estimate when any
    of those examinations will be completed or if others will be
    commenced.

GAAP requires that for financial statements issued for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods
    within those years, unvested share-based payment awards that
    contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend
    equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating
    securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings
    per common share pursuant to the two-class method. In 2009, the
    Company issued stock-based compensation awards in the form of
    restricted stock and restricted stock units, which, in
    accordance with GAAP, are considered participating securities.
    Beginning in 2009, the Company’s earnings per common share
    are calculated using the two-class method. The effects of the
    application of the two-class method to previously reported
    earnings per common share amounts were immaterial.

Stock-based compensation awards, warrants to purchase common
    stock of M&T and preferred stock convertible into shares of
    M&T common stock representing approximately 15,040,000,
    10,082,000 and 3,667,000 common shares during 2009, 2008 and

    diluted earnings per common share because the effect on those
    years would be antidilutive.

    in foreign currency trading, providing credit to support the
    international activities of domestic companies and holding
    certain loans to foreign borrowers. Net assets identified with
    international activities amounted to $61,849,000 and $98,767,000
    at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Such assets
    included $55,336,000 and $91,472,000, respectively, of loans to
    foreign borrowers. Deposits at M&T Bank’s offshore
    branch office were $1,050,438,000 and $4,047,986,000 at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company uses
    such deposits to facilitate customer demand and as an
    alternative to short-term borrowings when the costs of such
    deposits seem reasonable.

Derivative
    financial instruments

As part of managing interest rate risk, the Company enters into
    interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing
    characteristics of certain portions of the Company’s
    portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
    The Company designates interest rate swap agreements utilized in
    the management of interest rate risk as either fair value hedges
    or cash flow hedges. Interest rate swap agreements are generally
    entered into with counterparties that meet established credit
    standards and most contain master netting and collateral
    provisions protecting the at-risk party. Based on adherence to
    the



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

Company’s credit standards and the presence of the netting
    and collateral provisions, the Company believes that the credit
    risk inherent in these contracts is not significant as of
    December 31, 2009.

The net effect of interest rate swap agreements was to increase
    net interest income by $38 million and $16 million in
    2009 and 2008, respectively, and to decrease net interest income
    in 2007 by $3 million. The average notional amounts of
    interest rate swap agreements impacting net interest income that
    were entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was
    $1.08 billion in 2009, $1.27 billion in 2008 and
    $1.41 billion in 2007.

Under the terms of these

In response to changes in its interest rate risk profile, during
    2008 the Company terminated interest rate swap agreements with a
    notional amount of $1.5 billion that had originally been
    entered into as cash flow hedges of variable rate long-term
    borrowings. The Company recognized a $37 million loss as a
    result of the termination. Amounts pertaining to these interest
    rate swap agreements that were reclassified from accumulated
    other comprehensive income to increase interest expense were
    $11 million and $26 million for 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

In addition, the Company also has commitments to sell and
    commitments to originate residential and commercial real estate
    loans, which are considered derivatives. The Company designates
    certain of the commitments to sell real estate loans as fair
    value hedges of real estate loans held for sale. The Company
    also utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to offset
    the exposure to changes in the fair value of certain commitments
    to originate real estate loans for sale. As a result of these
    activities, net unrealized pre-tax gains related to hedged loans
    held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and
    commitments to sell loans were approximately $20 million
    and $9 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Changes in unrealized gains and losses are
    included in mortgage banking revenues and, in general, are
    realized in subsequent periods as the related loans are sold and
    commitments satisfied.

The aggregate fair value of derivative financial instruments in
    a net liability position at December 31, 2009 for which the
    Company was required to post collateral was $225 million.
    The fair value of collateral posted for such instruments was
    $221 million.

The Company’s credit exposure with respect to the estimated
    fair value as of December 31, 2009 of interest rate swap
    agreements used for managing interest rate risk has been
    substantially mitigated through master netting arrangements with
    trading account interest rate contracts with the same
    counterparties as well as counterparty postings of
    $35 million of collateral with the Company.

Variable
    interest entities and asset securitizations

Variable
    interest entities

Variable interest entities in which the Company holds a
    significant variable interest are described below.

M&T has a variable interest in a trust that holds AIB ADSs
    for the purpose of satisfying options to purchase such shares
    for certain employees. The trust purchased the AIB ADSs with the
    proceeds of a loan from an entity subsequently acquired by
    M&T. Proceeds from option exercises and any dividends and
    other earnings on the trust assets are used to repay the loan
    plus interest. Option holders have no preferential right with

    statements. As a result,

included in investment securities available for sale were
    591,813 AIB ADSs with a carrying value of approximately
    $2 million at December 31, 2009 and $3 million at
    December 31, 2008. Outstanding options granted to employees
    who have continued service with M&T totaled 189,450 and
    304,210 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. All
    outstanding options were fully vested and exercisable at both
    December 31, 2009 and 2008. The options expire at various
    dates through June 2012. The AIB ADSs are included in available
    for sale investment securities and have a fair value of
    $2 million and an amortized cost of $13 million at
    December 31, 2009.

As described in note 9, M&T has issued junior
    subordinated debentures payable to various trusts that have
    issued Capital Securities. M&T owns the common securities
    of those trust entities. The Company is not considered to be the
    primary beneficiary of those entities and, accordingly, the
    trusts are not included in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
    Company included the Junior Subordinated Debentures as
    “long-term borrowings” in its consolidated balance
    sheet. The Company has recognized $34 million in other
    assets for its “investment” in the common securities
    of the trusts that will be concomitantly repaid to M&T by
    the respective trust from the proceeds of M&T’s
    repayment of the junior subordinated debentures associated with
    preferred capital securities described in note 9.

The Company has invested as a limited partner in various real
    estate partnerships that collectively had total assets of
    approximately $1.0 billion and $593 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Those
    partnerships generally construct or acquire properties for which
    the investing partners are eligible to receive certain federal
    income tax credits in accordance with government guidelines.
    Such investments may also provide tax deductible losses to the
    partners. The partnership investments also assist the Company in
    achieving its community reinvestment initiatives. As a limited
    partner, there is no recourse to the Company by creditors of the
    partnerships. However, the tax credits that result from the
    Company’s investments in such partnerships are generally
    subject to recapture should a partnership fail to comply with
    the respective government regulations. The Company’s
    maximum exposure to loss of its investments in such partnerships
    was $246 million, including $89 million of unfunded
    commitments, at December 31, 2009 and $188 million,
    including $64 million of unfunded commitments, at
    December 31, 2008. Management currently estimates that no
    material losses are probable as a result of the Company’s
    involvement with such entities. In accordance with the
    accounting provisions for variable interest entities, the
    partnership entities are not included in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Securitizations

In 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company securitized approximately
    $141 million, $875 million and $948 million,
    respectively, of

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans in guaranteed mortgage
    securitizations with Fannie Mae. The Company recognized no gain
    or loss on the transactions as it retained all of the resulting
    securities. Such securities were classified as investment
    securities available for sale. The Company expects no material
    credit-related losses on the retained securities as a result of
    the guarantees by Fannie Mae.

In 2002 and 2003, the Company transferred approximately
    $1.9 billion of

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans to qualified special purpose
    trusts in non-recourse securitization transactions. In exchange
    for the loans, the Company received cash, no more than 88% of
    the resulting securities, and the servicing rights to the loans.
    All of the retained securities were classified as investment
    securities available for sale. The qualified special purpose
    trusts are not included in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements, however, coincident with the
    Company’s adoption of newly required consolidation rules
    such trusts will be included in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements beginning January 1, 2010. Because the
    transactions were non-recourse, the Company’s maximum
    exposure to loss as a result of its association with the trusts
    is limited to realizing the carrying value of the retained
    securities and servicing rights. The combined outstanding
    principal amount of mortgage-backed securities issued by the
    qualified special purpose trusts was $433 million at
    December 31, 2009 and $540 million at
    December 31, 2008. The principal amount of such securities
    held by the Company was $369 million and $460 million
    at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, loans of the trusts that were
    30 or more days delinquent totaled $17 million and
    $15 million, respectively. Credit losses, net of
    recoveries, for the trusts in 2009 and 2008 were insignificant.
    There were no significant repurchases of

delinquent or foreclosed loans from the trusts by the Company in
    2009 or 2008. The Company has not provided financial or other
    support to the trusts during 2009 or 2008 that was not
    contractually required. Certain cash flows between the Company
    and the trusts were as follows:

A summary of the fair values of retained subordinated interests
    resulting from the Company’s residential mortgage loan
    securitization activities follows. Although the estimated fair
    values of the retained subordinated interests were obtained from
    independent pricing sources, the Company has modeled the
    sensitivity of such fair values to changes in certain
    assumptions as summarized in the table below. These calculated
    sensitivities are hypothetical and actual changes in the fair
    value may differ significantly from the amounts presented
    herein. The effect of a variation in a particular assumption on
    the fair values is calculated without changing any other
    assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in
    changes in another which may magnify or counteract the
    sensitivities. The changes in assumptions are presumed to be
    instantaneous. The hypothetical effect of adverse changes on the
    Company’s retained capitalized servicing assets at
    December 31, 2009 is included in note 7.

Fair
    value measurements

GAAP permits an entity to choose to measure eligible financial
    instruments and other items at fair value. The Company has not
    made any fair value elections as of December 31, 2009.

Pursuant to GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would
    be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
    an orderly transaction between market participants at the
    measurement date. A three-level hierarchy exists in GAAP for
    fair value measurements based upon the inputs to the valuation
    of an asset or liability.

•

Level 1 — Valuation is based on quoted prices in
    active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

•

Level 2 — Valuation is determined from quoted
    prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,
    quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets
    that are not active or by model-based techniques in which all
    significant inputs are observable in the market.

•

Level 3 — Valuation is derived from model-based
    and other techniques in which at least one significant input is
    unobservable and which may be based on the Company’s own
    estimates about the assumptions that market participants would
    use to value the asset or liability.

When available, the Company attempts to use quoted market prices
    in active markets to determine fair value and classifies such
    items as Level 1 or Level 2. If quoted market prices
    in active markets are not



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

available, fair value is often determined using model-based
    techniques incorporating various assumptions including interest
    rates, prepayment speeds and credit losses. Assets and
    liabilities valued using model-based techniques are classified
    as either Level 2 or Level 3, depending on the lowest
    level classification of an input that is considered significant
    to the overall valuation. The following is a description of the
    valuation methodologies used for the Company’s assets and
    liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis at estimated
    fair value.

Trading
    account assets and liabilities

Trading account assets and liabilities consist primarily of
    interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts
    with customers who require such services with offsetting trading
    positions with third parties to minimize the Company’s risk
    with respect to such transactions. The Company generally
    determines the fair value of its derivative trading account
    assets and liabilities using externally developed pricing models
    based on market observable inputs and therefore classifies such
    valuations as Level 2. Prices for certain foreign exchange
    contracts are more observable and therefore have been classified
    as Level 1. Mutual funds held in connection with deferred
    compensation arrangements have also been classified as
    Level 1 valuations. Valuations of investments in municipal
    and other bonds can generally be obtained through reference to
    quoted prices in less active markets for the same or similar
    securities or through model-based techniques in which all
    significant inputs are observable and, therefore, such
    valuations have been classified as Level 2.

Investment
    securities available for sale

The majority of the Company’s

available-for-sale

investment securities have been valued by reference to prices
    for similar securities or through model-based techniques in
    which all significant inputs are observable and, therefore, such
    valuations have been classified as Level 2. Certain
    investments in mutual funds and equity securities are actively
    traded and therefore have been classified as Level 1
    valuations.

Due to the severe disruption in the credit markets during the
    second half of 2008 and continuing into 2009, trading activity
    in privately issued mortgage-backed securities was very limited.
    The markets for such securities were generally characterized by
    a sharp reduction of non-agency mortgage-backed securities
    issuances, a significant reduction in trading volumes and
    extremely wide bid-ask spreads, all driven by the lack of market
    participants. Although estimated prices were generally obtained
    for such securities, the Company was significantly restricted in
    the level of market observable assumptions used in the valuation
    of its privately issued mortgage-backed securities portfolio.
    Specifically, market assumptions regarding credit adjusted cash
    flows and liquidity influences on discount rates were difficult
    to observe at the individual bond level. Because of the
    inactivity in the markets and the lack of observable valuation
    inputs, the Company has classified the valuation of its
    privately issued mortgage-backed securities as Level 3.

In April 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued new accounting rules that provided
    guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of
    trading activity for an asset or liability have significantly
    decreased. The Company has concluded that there has been a
    significant decline in the volume and level of activity in the
    market for privately issued mortgage-backed securities.
    Therefore, the Company supplemented its determination of fair
    value for many of its privately issued mortgage-backed
    securities by obtaining pricing indications from two independent
    sources at December 31, 2009. However, the Company could
    not readily ascertain that the basis of such valuations could be
    ascribed to orderly and observable trades in the market for
    privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities. As a
    result, the Company also performed internal modeling to estimate
    the cash flows and fair value of 148 of its privately issued
    residential mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost
    basis of $1.9 billion at December 31, 2009. The
    Company’s internal modeling techniques included discounting
    estimated bond-specific cash flows using assumptions about cash
    flows associated with loans underlying each of the bonds,
    including estimates about the timing and amount of credit losses
    and prepayments. In estimating those cash flows, the Company
    used conservative assumptions as to future delinquency, defaults
    and loss rates, including assumptions for further home price
    depreciation. Differences between internal model valuations and
    external pricing indications were generally considered to be
    reflective of the lack of liquidity in the market for privately
    issued mortgage-backed securities given



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

the conservative nature of the cash flow modeling performed in
    the Company’s assessment of value. To determine the point
    within the range of potential values that was most
    representative of fair value under current market conditions for
    each of the 148 bonds, the Company computed values based on
    judgmentally applied weightings of the internal model valuations
    and the indications obtained from the average of the two
    independent pricing sources. Weightings applied to internal
    model valuations generally ranged from zero to 40% depending on
    bond structure and collateral type, with prices for bonds in
    non-senior tranches generally receiving lower weightings on the
    internal model results and senior bonds receiving a higher model
    weighting. Weighted-average reliance on internal model pricing
    for the bonds modeled was 37% with a 63% average weighting
    placed on the values provided by the independent sources. The
    Company concluded its estimate of fair value for the
    $1.9 billion of privately issued residential
    mortgage-backed securities to approximate $1.6 billion,
    which implies a weighted-average market yield based on
    reasonably likely cash flows of 10.25%. Other valuations of
    privately issued mortgage-backed securities, including those
    resulting from two non-recourse securitization transactions
    executed by the Company in 2002 and 2003, were determined by
    reference to independent pricing sources without adjustment.

Included in CDOs are securities backed by trust preferred
    securities issued by financial institutions and other entities.
    Given the severe disruption in the credit markets and lack of
    observable trade information, the Company could not obtain
    pricing indications for many of these securities from its two
    primary independent pricing sources. The Company, therefore,
    performed internal modeling to estimate the cash flows and fair
    value of its portfolio of securities backed by trust preferred
    securities at December 31, 2009. The modeling techniques
    included discounting estimated cash flows using bond-specific
    assumptions about defaults, deferrals and prepayments of the
    trust preferred securities underlying each bond. The estimation
    of cash flows included conservative assumptions as to the future
    collateral defaults and the related loss severities. The
    resulting cash flows were then discounted by reference to market
    yields observed in the single-name trust preferred securities
    market. At December 31, 2009, the total amortized cost and
    fair value of securities backed by trust preferred securities
    issued by financial institutions and other entities was
    $103 million and $115 million, respectively. Privately
    issued mortgage-backed securities and securities backed by trust
    preferred securities issued by financial institutions and other
    entities constituted substantially all of the available for sale
    investment securities classified as Level 3 valuations as
    of December 31, 2009.

Real
    estate loans held for sale

The Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to
    hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of real estate loans
    held for sale. The carrying value of hedged real estate loans
    held for sale includes changes in estimated fair value during
    the hedge period. Typically, the Company attempts to hedge real
    estate loans held for sale from the date of close through the
    sale date. The fair value of hedged real estate loans held for
    sale is generally calculated by reference to quoted prices in
    secondary markets for commitments to sell real estate loans with
    similar characteristics and, as such, have been classified as a
    Level 2 valuation.

Commitments
    to originate real estate loans for sale and commitments to sell
    real estate loans

The Company enters into various commitments to originate real
    estate loans for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans.
    Such commitments are considered to be derivative financial
    instruments and, therefore, are carried at estimated fair value
    on the consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair values of
    such commitments were generally calculated by reference to
    quoted prices in secondary markets for commitments to sell real
    estate loans to certain government-sponsored entities and other
    parties. The fair valuations of commitments to sell real estate
    loans generally result in a Level 2 classification. The
    estimated fair value of commitments to originate real estate
    loans for sale are adjusted to reflect the Company’s
    anticipated commitment expirations. Estimated commitment
    expirations are considered a significant unobservable input,
    which results in a Level 3 classification. The Company
    includes the expected net future cash flows related to the
    associated servicing of the loan in the fair value measurement
    of a derivative loan commitment. The estimated value ascribed to
    the expected net future



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

servicing cash flows is also considered a significant
    unobservable input contributing to the Level 3
    classification of commitments to originate real estate loans for
    sale.

Interest
    rate swap agreements used for interest rate risk
    management

The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of
    the management of interest rate risk to modify the repricing
    characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Company generally
    determines the fair value of its interest rate swap agreements
    using externally developed pricing models based on market
    observable inputs and therefore classifies such valuations as
    Level 2. The Company has considered counterparty credit
    risk in the valuation of its interest rate swap assets and has
    considered its own credit risk in the valuation of its interest
    rate swap liabilities.

The Company is required, on a nonrecurring basis, to adjust the
    carrying value of certain assets or provide valuation allowances
    related to certain assets using fair value measurements in
    accordance with GAAP.

Loans

Loans are generally not recorded at fair value on a recurring
    basis. Periodically, the Company records nonrecurring
    adjustments to the carrying value of loans based on fair value
    measurements for partial charge-offs of the uncollectible
    portions of those loans. Nonrecurring adjustments also include
    certain impairment amounts for collateral-dependent loans when
    establishing the allowance for credit losses. Such amounts are
    generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral
    supporting the loan and, as a result, the carrying value of the
    loan less the calculated valuation amount does not necessarily
    represent the fair value of the loan. Real estate collateral is
    typically valued using appraisals or other indications of value
    based on recent comparable sales of similar properties or
    assumptions generally observable in the marketplace and the
    related nonrecurring fair value measurement adjustments have
    generally been classified as Level 2, unless significant
    adjustments have been made to the valuation that are not readily
    observable by market participants. Estimates of fair value used
    for other collateral supporting commercial loans generally are
    based on assumptions not observable in the marketplace and
    therefore such valuations have been classified as Level 3.
    Loans subject to nonrecurring fair value measurement were
    $901 million at December 31, 2009 ($547 million
    and $354 million of which were classified as Level 2
    and Level 3, respectively) and $420 million at
    December 31, 2008 ($238 million and $182 million
    of which were classified as Level 2 and Level 3,
    respectively). Changes in fair value recognized for partial
    charge-offs of loans and loan impairment reserves on loans held
    by the Company at December 31, 2009 were decreases of
    $343 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and
    on loans

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

held by the Company at December 31, 2008 were decreases of
    $166 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Capitalized
    servicing rights

Capitalized servicing rights are initially measured at fair
    value in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The
    Company utilizes the amortization method to subsequently measure
    its capitalized servicing assets. In accordance with GAAP, the
    Company must record impairment charges, on a nonrecurring basis,
    when the carrying value of certain strata exceed their estimated
    fair value. The determination of fair value of capitalized
    servicing rights is described in note 1 and is considered a
    Level 3 valuation. At December 31, 2009, no stratum of
    capitalized servicing rights had a carrying value equal to its
    fair value. Changes in the fair value-based valuation allowance
    for capitalized servicing rights recognized for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 reflected increases in fair value of
    $22 million. At December 31, 2008, $50 million of
    capitalized servicing rights had a carrying value equal to their
    fair value. Changes in fair value of capitalized servicing
    rights recognized for the year ended December 31, 2008 were
    a decrease of $16 million.

Assets
    taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans

Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans are primarily
    comprised of commercial and residential real property and are
    generally measured at the lower of cost or fair value less costs
    to sell. The fair value of the real property is generally
    determined using appraisals or other indications of value based
    on recent comparable sales of similar properties or assumptions
    generally observable in the marketplace, and the related
    nonrecurring fair value measurement adjustments have generally
    been classified as Level 2. Assets taken in foreclosure of
    defaulted loans subject to nonrecurring fair value measurement
    were $43 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in fair
    value for those foreclosed assets held by the Company at
    December 31, 2009 were $24 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Disclosures
    of fair value of financial instruments

With the exception of marketable securities, certain off-balance
    sheet financial instruments and

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans originated for sale, the
    Company’s financial instruments are not readily marketable
    and market prices do not exist. The Company, in attempting to
    comply with the provisions of GAAP that require disclosures of
    fair value of financial instruments, has not attempted to market
    its financial instruments to potential buyers, if any exist.
    Since negotiated prices in illiquid markets depend greatly upon
    the then present motivations of the buyer and seller, it is
    reasonable to assume that actual sales prices could vary widely
    from any estimate of fair value made without the benefit of
    negotiations. Additionally, changes in market interest rates can
    dramatically impact the value of financial instruments in a
    short period of time. Additional information about the
    assumptions and calculations utilized follows.

The following assumptions, methods and calculations were used in
    determining the estimated fair value of financial instruments
    not measured at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet.

Cash
    and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits at banks,
    short-term borrowings, accrued interest receivable and accrued
    interest payable

Due to the nature of cash and cash equivalents and the near
    maturity of interest-bearing deposits at banks, short-term
    borrowings, accrued interest receivable and accrued interest
    payable, the Company estimated that the carrying amount of such
    instruments approximated estimated fair value.

Agreements
    to resell securities

The amounts assigned to agreements to resell securities were
    based on discounted calculations of projected cash flows.



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

Investment
    securities

Estimated fair values of investments in readily marketable
    securities were generally based on quoted market prices.
    Investment securities that were not readily marketable were
    assigned amounts based on estimates provided by outside parties
    or modeling techniques that relied upon discounted calculations
    of projected cash flows or, in the case of other investment
    securities, which include capital stock of the Federal Reserve
    Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, at
    an amount equal to the carrying amount.

Loans
    and leases

In general, discount rates used to calculate values for loan
    products were based on the Company’s pricing at the
    respective year end and included appropriate adjustments for
    expected credit losses. A higher discount rate was assumed with
    respect to estimated cash flows associated with nonaccrual
    loans. Projected loan cash flows were adjusted for estimated
    credit losses. However, such estimates made by the Company may
    not be indicative of assumptions and adjustments that a
    purchaser of the Company’s loans and leases would seek.

Deposits

Pursuant to GAAP, the estimated fair value ascribed to
    noninterest-bearing deposits, savings deposits and NOW accounts
    must be established at carrying value because of the
    customers’ ability to withdraw funds immediately. Time
    deposit accounts are required to be revalued based upon
    prevailing market interest rates for similar maturity
    instruments. As a result, amounts assigned to time deposits were
    based on discounted cash flow calculations using prevailing
    market interest rates based on the Company’s pricing at the
    respective year end for deposits with comparable remaining terms
    to maturity.

The Company believes that deposit accounts have a value greater
    than that prescribed by GAAP. The Company feels, however, that
    the value associated with these deposits is greatly influenced
    by characteristics of the buyer, such as the ability to reduce
    the costs of servicing the deposits and deposit attrition which
    often occurs following an acquisition.

Long-term
    borrowings

The amounts assigned to long-term borrowings were based on
    quoted market prices, when available, or were based on
    discounted cash flow calculations using prevailing market
    interest rates for borrowings of similar terms and credit risk.

Commitments
    to originate real estate loans for sale and commitments to sell
    real estate loans

The Company enters into various commitments to originate real
    estate loans for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans.
    Such commitments are considered to be derivative financial
    instruments and, therefore, are carried at estimated fair value
    on the consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair values of
    such commitments were generally calculated by reference to
    quoted market prices for commitments to sell real estate loans
    to certain government-sponsored entities and other parties.

Interest
    rate swap agreements used for interest rate risk
    management

The estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements used
    for interest rate risk management represents the amount the
    Company would have expected to receive or pay to terminate such
    agreements.

Other
    commitments and contingencies

As described in note 21, in the normal course of business,
    various commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding,
    such as loan commitments, credit guarantees and letters of
    credit. The Company’s pricing of such financial instruments
    is based largely on credit quality and relationship, probability
    of funding and other requirements. Loan commitments often have
    fixed expiration dates and contain termination and other clauses
    which provide for relief from funding in the event of
    significant deterioration in the credit quality of the customer.
    The rates and terms of the Company’s loan commitments,
    credit guarantees and letters of credit are competitive with
    other financial institutions



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

operating in markets served by the Company. The Company believes
    that the carrying amounts, which are included in other
    liabilities, are reasonable estimates of the fair value of these
    financial instruments.

The Company does not believe that the estimated information
    presented herein is representative of the earnings power or
    value of the Company. The preceding analysis, which is
    inherently limited in depicting fair value, also does not
    consider any value associated with existing customer
    relationships nor the ability of the Company to create value
    through loan origination, deposit gathering or fee generating
    activities.

Many of the estimates presented herein are based upon the use of
    highly subjective information and assumptions and, accordingly,
    the results may not be precise. Management believes that fair
    value estimates may not be comparable between financial
    institutions due to the wide range of permitted valuation
    techniques and numerous estimates which must be made.
    Furthermore, because the disclosed fair value amounts were
    estimated as of the balance sheet date, the amounts actually
    realized or paid upon maturity or settlement of the various
    financial instruments could be significantly different.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to
    customers, generally having fixed expiration dates or other
    termination clauses that may require payment of a fee. Standby
    and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments
    issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third
    party. Standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon
    the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of
    the underlying contract with the third party, whereas commercial
    letters of credit are issued to facilitate commerce and
    typically result in the commitment being funded when the
    underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and
    third party. The credit risk associated with commitments to
    extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit is
    essentially the same as that involved with extending loans to
    customers and is subject to normal credit policies. Collateral
    may be obtained based on management’s assessment of the
    customer’s creditworthiness.

Financial guarantees and indemnification contracts are
    oftentimes similar to standby letters of credit and include
    mandatory purchase agreements issued to ensure that customer
    obligations are fulfilled, recourse obligations associated with
    sold loans, and other guarantees of customer performance or
    compliance with designated rules and regulations. Included in
    financial guarantees and indemnification contracts are loan
    principal amounts sold with recourse in conjunction with the
    Company’s involvement in the Fannie Mae DUS program. The
    Company’s maximum credit risk for recourse associated with
    loans sold under this program totaled approximately
    $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

Since many loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and
    guarantees and indemnification contracts expire without being
    funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not
    necessarily indicative of future cash flows.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to
    hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of real estate loans
    held for sale. Such commitments are considered derivatives and
    along with commitments to originate real estate loans to be held
    for sale are generally recorded in the consolidated balance
    sheet at estimated fair market value.

The Company occupies certain banking offices and uses certain
    equipment under noncancellable operating lease agreements

    lease payments under noncancellable operating leases are

The Company has an agreement with the Baltimore Ravens of the
    National Football League whereby the Company obtained the naming
    rights to a football stadium in Baltimore, Maryland. Under the
    agreement, the Company is obligated to pay $5 million per
    year through 2013 and $6 million per year from 2014 through
    2017.

The Company reinsures credit life and accident and health
    insurance purchased by consumer loan customers. The Company also
    enters into reinsurance contracts with third party insurance
    companies who insure against the risk of a mortgage
    borrower’s payment default in connection with certain
    mortgage loans originated by the Company. When providing
    reinsurance coverage, the Company receives a premium in exchange
    for accepting a portion of the insurer’s risk of loss. The
    outstanding loan principal balances reinsured by the Company
    were approximately $97 million at December 31, 2009.
    Assets of subsidiaries providing reinsurance that are available
    to satisfy claims totaled approximately $72 million at
    December 31, 2009. The amounts noted above are not
    necessarily indicative of losses which may ultimately be
    incurred. Such losses are expected to be substantially less
    because most loans are repaid by borrowers in accordance with
    the original loan terms. Management believes that any
    reinsurance losses that may be payable by the Company will not
    be material to the Company’s consolidated financial
    position.

M&T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course
    of business to various pending and threatened legal proceedings
    in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. Management,
    after consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that
    the aggregate ultimate liability arising out of litigation
    pending against M&T or its subsidiaries will be material to
    the Company’s consolidated financial position, but at the
    present time is not in a position to determine whether such
    litigation will have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s consolidated results of operations in any future
    reporting period.

22.

Segment
    information

Reportable segments have been determined based upon the
    Company’s internal profitability reporting system, which is
    organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business
    units have been combined for segment information reporting
    purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type
    of customer and the distribution of those products and services
    are similar. The reportable segments are Business Banking,
    Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary
    Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking.



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

The financial information of the Company’s segments has
    been compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in
    note 1 with certain exceptions. The more significant of
    these exceptions are described herein. The Company allocates
    interest income or interest expense using a methodology that
    charges users of funds (assets) interest expense and credits
    providers of funds (liabilities) with income based on the
    maturity, prepayment

and/or

repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities. The net
    effect of this allocation is recorded in the “All
    Other” category. A provision for credit losses is allocated
    to segments in an amount based largely on actual net charge-offs
    incurred by the segment during the period plus or minus an
    amount necessary to adjust the segment’s allowance for
    credit losses due to changes in loan balances. In contrast, the
    level of the consolidated provision for credit losses is
    determined using the methodologies described in note 1 to
    assess the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.
    Indirect fixed and variable expenses incurred by certain
    centralized support areas are allocated to segments based on
    actual usage (for example, volume measurements) and other
    criteria. Certain types of administrative expenses and bankwide
    expense accruals (including amortization of core deposit and
    other intangible assets associated with acquisitions of
    financial institutions) are generally not allocated to segments.
    Income taxes are allocated to segments based on the
    Company’s marginal statutory tax rate adjusted for any
    tax-exempt income or non-deductible expenses. Equity is
    allocated to the segments based on regulatory capital
    requirements and in proportion to an assessment of the inherent
    risks associated with the business of the segment (including
    interest, credit and operating risk).

The management accounting policies and processes utilized in
    compiling segment financial information are highly subjective
    and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative
    guidance similar to generally accepted accounting principles. As
    a result, reported segment results are not necessarily
    comparable with similar information reported by other financial
    institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or
    allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in
    reported segment financial data. Information about the
    Company’s segments is presented in the accompanying table.
    Income statement amounts are in thousands of dollars. Balance
    sheet amounts are in millions of dollars.

(a)

Net interest income is the
    difference between actual taxable-equivalent interest earned on
    assets and interest paid on liabilities by a segment and a
    funding charge (credit) based on the Company’s internal
    funds transfer pricing methodology. Segments are charged a cost
    to fund any assets (e.g. loans) and are paid a funding credit
    for any funds provided (e.g. deposits). The taxable-equivalent
    adjustment aggregated $21,829,000 in 2009, $21,861,000 in 2008
    and $20,833,000 in 2007 and is eliminated in “All
    Other” net interest income and income tax expense
    (benefit).

The Business Banking segment provides deposit, lending, cash
    management and other financial services to small businesses and
    professionals through the Company’s banking office network
    and several other delivery channels, including business banking
    centers, telephone banking, Internet banking and automated
    teller machines. The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide
    range of credit products and banking services to middle-market
    and large commercial customers, mainly within the markets the
    Company serves. Among the services provided by this segment are
    commercial lending and leasing, letters of credit, deposit
    products and cash management services. The Commercial Real
    Estate segment provides credit services which are secured by
    various types of multifamily residential and commercial real
    estate and deposit services to its customers. Activities of this
    segment include the origination, sales and servicing of
    commercial real estate loans. The Discretionary Portfolio
    segment includes securities, residential mortgage loans and
    other assets; short-term and long-term borrowed funds; brokered
    certificates of deposit and interest rate swap agreements
    related thereto; and offshore branch deposits. This segment also
    provides foreign exchange services to customers. The Residential
    Mortgage Banking segment originates and services residential
    mortgage loans for consumers and sells substantially all of
    those loans in the secondary market to investors or to the
    Discretionary Portfolio segment. The segment periodically
    purchases servicing rights to loans that have been originated by
    other entities. This segment also originated loans to developers
    of residential real estate properties. Residential mortgage
    loans held for sale are included in the Residential Mortgage
    Banking segment. The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of
    services to consumers through several delivery channels that
    include banking offices, automated teller machines, telephone
    banking and Internet banking. The “All Other” category
    includes other operating activities of the Company that are not
    directly attributable to the reported segments; the difference
    between the provision for credit losses and the calculated
    provision allocated to the reportable segments; goodwill and
    core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from
    acquisitions of financial institutions; merger-related expenses
    resulting from acquisitions; the net impact of the
    Company’s internal funds transfer pricing methodology;
    eliminations of transactions between reportable segments;
    certain nonrecurring transactions; the residual effects of
    unallocated support systems and general and administrative
    expenses; and the impact of interest rate risk management
    strategies. The amount of

    totals was included in the “All Other” category as

Regulatory
    matters

Payment of dividends by M&T’s banking subsidiaries is
    restricted by various legal and regulatory limitations.
    Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T are limited by
    the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current
    year and the preceding two years. For purposes of this test, at
    December 31, 2009, approximately $1.2 billion was
    available for payment of dividends to M&T from banking
    subsidiaries.

Banking regulations prohibit extensions of credit by the
    subsidiary banks to M&T unless appropriately secured by
    assets. Securities of affiliates are not eligible as collateral
    for this purpose.

The bank subsidiaries are required to maintain
    noninterest-earning reserves against certain deposit
    liabilities. During the maintenance periods that included
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, cash and due from banks
    included a daily average of $162,952,000 and $183,088,000,
    respectively, for such purpose.

Federal regulators have adopted capital adequacy guidelines for
    bank holding companies and banks. Failure to meet minimum
    capital requirements can result in certain mandatory, and
    possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that,
    if undertaken, could have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial statements. Under the capital adequacy
    guidelines, the so-called “Tier 1 capital” and
    “Total capital” as a percentage of risk-weighted
    assets and certain off-balance sheet financial instruments must
    be at least 4% and 8%, respectively. In addition to these
    risk-based measures, regulators also require banking
    institutions that meet certain qualitative criteria to maintain
    a minimum “leverage” ratio of “Tier 1
    capital” to average total assets, adjusted for goodwill and
    certain other items, of at least 3% to be considered adequately
    capitalized. As of December 31, 2009, M&T and each of
    its banking subsidiaries exceeded all applicable capital
    adequacy requirements. To be considered “well
    capitalized,” under the regulatory framework for prompt
    corrective action, a banking institution must maintain
    Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and
    leverage ratios of at least 6%, 10% and 5%, respectively.

Relationship
    of M&T and AIB

AIB received 26,700,000 shares of M&T common stock on
    April 1, 2003 as a result of M&T’s acquisition of
    a subsidiary of AIB on that date. Those shares of common stock
    owned by AIB represented 22.6% of the issued and outstanding
    shares of M&T common stock on December 31, 2009. While
    AIB maintains a significant ownership in M&T, the Agreement
    and Plan of Reorganization between M&T and AIB
    (“Reorganization Agreement”) includes several
    provisions related to the corporate governance of M&T that
    provide AIB with representation on the M&T and M&T
    Bank boards of directors and key board committees and certain
    protections of its rights as a substantial M&T shareholder.
    In addition, AIB has rights that will facilitate its ability to
    maintain its proportionate ownership position in M&T.

With respect to AIB’s right to have representation on the
    M&T and M&T Bank boards of directors and key board
    committees, for as long as AIB holds at least 15% of
    M&T’s outstanding common stock, AIB is entitled to
    designate four individuals, reasonably acceptable to M&T,
    on both the M&T and M&T Bank boards of directors. In
    addition, one of the AIB designees to the M&T board of
    directors will serve



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

on each of the Executive; Nomination, Compensation and
    Governance; and Audit and Risk committees. Also, as long as AIB
    holds at least 15% of M&T’s outstanding common stock,
    neither the M&T nor the M&T Bank board of directors
    may consist of more than 28 directors without the consent
    of the M&T directors designated by AIB. AIB will continue
    to enjoy these rights if its holdings of M&T common stock
    drop below 15%, but not below 12%, so long as AIB restores its
    ownership percentage to 15% within one year. In the event that
    AIB holds at least 10%, but less than 15%, of M&T’s
    outstanding common stock, AIB will be entitled to designate at
    least two individuals on both the M&T and M&T Bank
    boards of directors and, in the event that AIB holds at least
    5%, but less than 10%, of M&T’s outstanding common
    stock, AIB will be entitled to designate one individual on both
    the M&T and M&T Bank boards of directors. M&T
    also has the right to appoint one representative to the AIB
    board while AIB remains a significant shareholder.

There are several other corporate governance provisions that
    serve to protect AIB’s rights as a substantial M&T
    shareholder and are embodied in M&T’s certificate of
    incorporation and bylaws. These protections include an effective
    consent right in connection with certain actions by M&T,
    such as amending M&T’s certificate of incorporation or
    bylaws in a manner inconsistent with AIB’s rights, engaging
    in activities not permissible for a bank holding company or
    adopting any shareholder rights plan or other measures intended
    to prevent or delay any transaction involving a change in
    control of M&T. AIB has the right to limit, with the
    agreement of at least one non-AIB designee on the M&T board
    of directors, other actions by M&T, such as reducing
    M&T’s cash dividend policy such that the ratio of cash
    dividends to net income is less than 15%, acquisitions and
    dispositions of significant amounts of assets, and the
    appointment or election of the chairman of the board of
    directors or the chief executive officer of M&T. The
    protective provisions described above will cease to be
    applicable when AIB no longer owns at least 15% of
    M&T’s outstanding common stock, calculated as
    described in the Reorganization Agreement.

25.

Relationship
    with Bayview Lending Group LLC and Bayview Financial Holdings,
    L.P.

In 2007, M&T invested $300 million to acquire a 20%
    minority interest in Bayview Lending Group LLC
    (“BLG”), a privately-held commercial mortgage lender.
    M&T recognizes income from BLG using the equity method of
    accounting. The carrying value of that investment was
    $246 million at December 31, 2009.

Bayview Financial Holdings, L.P. (together with its affiliates,
    “Bayview Financial”), a privately-held specialty
    mortgage finance company, is BLG’s majority investor. In
    addition to their common investment in BLG, the Company and
    Bayview Financial conduct other business activities with each
    other. The Company has purchased loan servicing rights for
    small-balance commercial mortgage loans from BLG and Bayview
    Financial having outstanding principal balances of
    $5.5 billion and $5.9 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. Amounts recorded as capitalized
    servicing assets for such loans totaled $40 million at
    December 31, 2009 and $58 million at December 31,
    2008. In addition, capitalized servicing rights at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 also included $17 million
    and $28 million, respectively, for servicing rights that
    were purchased from Bayview Financial related to residential
    mortgage loans with outstanding principal balances of
    $4.1 billion and $4.6 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. Revenues from servicing residential
    and small-balance commercial mortgage loans purchased from BLG
    and Bayview Financial were $50 million, $54 million
    and $48 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    M&T Bank provided $34 million and $71 million of
    credit facilities to Bayview Financial at December 31, 2009
    and December 31, 2008, respectively, of which
    $24 million and $57 million was outstanding at
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.
    At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company held
    $25 million and $32 million, respectively, of
    collateralized mortgage obligations in its

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio that were securitized by Bayview
    Financial. In addition, the Company held $352 million and
    $412 million of similar investment securities in its

held-to-maturity

portfolio at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
    respectively.
