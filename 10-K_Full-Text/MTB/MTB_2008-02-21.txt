Item 1.

Business.

M&T Bank Corporation (“Registrant” or
    “M&T”) is a New York business corporation which
    is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding
    Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”) and under

Article III-A

of the New York Banking Law (“Banking Law”). The
    principal executive offices of the Registrant are located at One
    M&T Plaza, Buffalo, New York 14203. The Registrant was
    incorporated in November 1969. The Registrant and its direct and
    indirect subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the
    “Company.” As of December 31, 2007 the Company
    had consolidated total assets of $64.9 billion, deposits of
    $41.3 billion and stockholders’ equity of
    $6.5 billion. The Company had 12,422 full-time and
    1,447 part-time employees as of December 31, 2007.

At December 31, 2007, the Registrant had two wholly owned
    bank subsidiaries: M&T Bank and M&T Bank, National
    Association (“M&T Bank, N.A.”). The banks
    collectively offer a wide range of commercial banking, trust and
    investment services to their customers. At December 31,
    2007, M&T Bank represented 99% of consolidated assets of
    the Company. M&T Bank operates branch offices in New York,
    Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Virginia, West
    Virginia and the District of Columbia.

The Company from time to time considers acquiring banks, thrift
    institutions, branch offices of banks or thrift institutions, or
    other businesses within markets currently served by the Company
    or in other locations that would complement the Company’s
    business or its geographic reach. The Company has pursued
    acquisition opportunities in the past, continues to review
    different opportunities, including the possibility of major
    acquisitions, and intends to continue this practice.

Relationship
    With Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c.

On April 1, 2003, M&T completed the acquisition of
    Allfirst Financial Inc. (“Allfirst”), a bank holding
    company headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland from Allied Irish
    Banks, p.l.c. (“AIB”). Under the terms of the
    Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated September 26,
    2002 by and among AIB, Allfirst and M&T (the
    “Reorganization Agreement”), M&T combined with
    Allfirst through the acquisition of all of the issued and
    outstanding Allfirst stock in exchange for
    26,700,000 shares of M&T common stock and $886,107,000
    in cash paid to AIB. In addition, there were several M&T
    corporate governance changes that resulted from the transaction.
    While it maintains a significant ownership in M&T, AIB will
    have representation on the M&T board, the M&T Bank
    board and key M&T board committees and will have certain
    protections of its rights as a substantial M&T shareholder.
    In addition, AIB will have rights that will facilitate its
    ability to maintain its proportionate ownership position in
    M&T. M&T will also have representation on the AIB
    board while AIB remains a significant shareholder. The following
    is a description of the ongoing relationship between M&T
    and AIB. The following description is qualified in its entirety
    by the terms of the Reorganization Agreement. The Reorganization
    Agreement was filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on
    October 3, 2002 as Exhibit 2 to the Current Report on

Form 8-K

of M&T dated September 26, 2002.

Board of
    Directors; Management

At December 31, 2007, AIB held approximately 24.3% of the
    issued and outstanding shares of M&T common stock. In
    defining their relationship after the acquisition, M&T and
    AIB negotiated certain agreements regarding share ownership and
    corporate governance issues such as board representation, with
    the number of AIB’s representatives on the M&T and
    M&T Bank boards of directors being dependent upon the
    amount of M&T common stock held by AIB. M&T has the
    right to one seat on the AIB board of directors until AIB no
    longer holds at least 15% of the outstanding shares of M&T
    common stock. Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, AIB has
    the right to name four members to serve on the Boards of
    Directors of M&T and M&T Bank, each of whom must be
    reasonably acceptable to M&T (collectively, the “AIB
    Designees”). Further, one of the AIB Designees will serve
    on each of the Executive Committee, Nomination, Compensation and
    Governance Committee, and Audit and Risk Committee (or any
    committee or committees performing comparable functions) of the
    M&T board of directors. In order to serve, the AIB
    Designees must meet the requisite independence and expertise
    requirements prescribed under applicable law or stock exchange
    rules. In addition, the Reorganization Agreement provides that
    the board of directors of M&T Bank will include four
    members designated by AIB, each of whom must be reasonably
    acceptable to M&T.



As long as AIB remains a significant shareholder of M&T,
    AIB will have representation on the boards of directors of both
    M&T and M&T Bank as follows:

•

As long as AIB holds at least 15% of the outstanding shares of
    M&T common stock, AIB will be entitled to designate four
    persons on both the M&T and M&T Bank boards of
    directors and representation on the committees of the M&T
    board described above.

•

If AIB holds at least 10%, but less than 15%, of the outstanding
    shares of M&T common stock, AIB will be entitled to
    designate at least two people on both the M&T and M&T
    Bank boards of directors.

•

If AIB’s ownership interest in M&T is at least 5%, but
    less than 10%, of the outstanding shares of M&T common
    stock, AIB will be entitled to designate at least one person on
    both the M&T and M&T Bank boards of directors.

•

As long as AIB holds at least 15% of the outstanding shares of
    M&T common stock, neither M&T’s board of
    directors nor M&T Bank’s board of directors will
    consist of more than twenty-eight directors without the consent
    of the AIB Designees.

•

If AIB’s holdings of M&T common stock fall below 15%,
    but not lower than 12% of the outstanding shares of M&T
    common stock, AIB will continue to have the same rights that it
    would have had if it owned 15% of the outstanding shares of
    M&T common stock, as long as AIB restores its ownership
    percentage to 15% within one year. Additionally, as described in
    more detail below, M&T has agreed to repurchase shares of
    M&T common stock in order to offset dilution to AIB’s
    ownership interests that may otherwise be caused by issuances of
    M&T common stock under M&T employee and director
    benefit or stock purchase plans. Dilution of AIB’s
    ownership position caused by such issuances will not be counted
    in determining whether the “Sunset Date” has occurred
    or whether any of AIB’s other rights under the
    Reorganization Agreement have terminated. The “Sunset
    Date” is the date on which AIB no longer holds at least 15%
    of the M&T common stock, calculated as described in this
    paragraph.

The AIB Designees at December 31, 2007 were Michael D.
    Buckley, Colm E. Doherty, Richard G. King and Eugene J. Sheehy.
    Mr. Buckley serves as a member of the Executive Committee
    and the Nomination, Compensation and Governance Committee, and
    Mr. King serves as a member of the Audit and Risk
    Committee. Robert G. Wilmers, Chairman of the Board and Chief
    Executive Officer of M&T, is a member of the AIB board of
    directors.

Amendments
    to M&T’s Bylaws

Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, M&T amended and
    restated its bylaws. The following is a description of the
    amended bylaws:

The amended bylaws provide that until the Sunset Date, the
    M&T board of directors may not take or make any
    recommendation to M&T’s shareholders regarding the
    following actions without the approval of the Executive
    Committee, including the approval of the AIB Designee serving on
    the committee:

•

Any amendment of M&T’s Certificate of Incorporation or
    bylaws that would be inconsistent with the rights described
    herein or that would otherwise have an adverse effect on the
    board representation, committee representation or other rights
    of AIB contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement;

•

Any activity not permissible for a U.S. bank holding
    company;

•

The adoption of any shareholder rights plan or other measures
    having the purpose or effect of preventing or materially
    delaying completion of any transaction involving a change in
    control of M&T; and

•

Any public announcement disclosing M&T’s desire or
    intention to take any of the foregoing actions.

The amended bylaws also provide that until the Sunset Date, the
    M&T board of directors may only take or make any
    recommendation to M&T’s shareholders regarding the
    following actions if the action has been approved by the
    Executive Committee (in the case of the first four items and
    sixth item below) or Nomination, Compensation and Governance
    Committee (in the case of the fifth item below)



and the members of such committee not voting in favor of the
    action do not include the AIB Designee serving on such committee
    and at least one other member of the committee who is not an AIB
    Designee:

•

Any reduction in M&T’s cash dividend policy such that
    the ratio of cash dividends to net income is less than 15%, or
    any extraordinary dividends or distributions to holders of
    M&T common stock;

•

Any acquisition of any assets or businesses, (1) if the
    consideration is in M&T common stock, where the stock
    consideration paid by M&T exceeds 10% of the aggregate
    voting power of M&T common stock and (2) if the
    consideration is cash, M&T stock or other consideration,
    where the fair market value of the consideration paid by
    M&T exceeds 10% of the market capitalization of M&T,
    as determined under the Reorganization Agreement;

•

Any sale of any assets or businesses in which the value of the
    aggregate consideration to be received exceeds 10% of the market
    capitalization of M&T, as determined under the
    Reorganization Agreement;

•

Any liquidation or dissolution of M&T;

•

The appointment or election of the Chairman of the board of
    directors or the Chief Executive Officer of M&T; and

•

Any public announcement disclosing M&T’s desire or
    intention to take any of the foregoing actions prior to
    obtaining the requisite committee approval.

The provisions of the bylaws described above may not be amended
    or repealed without the unanimous approval of the entire
    M&T board of directors or the approval of the holders of
    not less than 80% of the outstanding shares of M&T common
    stock. The provisions of the bylaws described above will
    automatically terminate when AIB holds less than 5% of the
    outstanding shares of M&T common stock.

Investment
    Parameters

The Reorganization Agreement provides that through the second
    anniversary of the Sunset Date, without prior written consent of
    the M&T board of directors, AIB will not, directly or
    indirectly, acquire or offer to acquire (except by way of stock
    dividends, offerings made available to M&T shareholders
    generally, or pursuant to compensation plans) more than 25% of
    the then outstanding shares of M&T common stock. Further,
    during this period, AIB and AIB’s subsidiaries have agreed
    not to participate in any proxy solicitation or to otherwise
    seek to influence any M&T shareholder with respect to the
    voting of any shares of M&T common stock for the approval
    of any shareholder proposals.

The Reorganization Agreement also provides that, during this
    period, AIB will not make any public announcement with respect
    to any proposal or offer by AIB or any AIB subsidiary with
    respect to certain transactions (such as mergers, business
    combinations, tender or exchange offers, the sale or purchase of
    securities or similar transactions) involving M&T or any of
    the M&T subsidiaries. The Reorganization Agreement also
    provides that, during this period, AIB may not subject any
    shares of M&T common stock to any voting trust or voting
    arrangement or agreement and will not execute any written
    consent as a shareholder with respect to the M&T common
    stock.

The Reorganization Agreement also provides that, during this
    period, AIB will not seek to control or influence the
    management, the board of directors or policies of M&T,
    including through communications with shareholders of M&T
    or otherwise, except through non-public communications with the
    directors of M&T, including the AIB Designees.

These restrictions on AIB will no longer apply if a third party
    commences or announces its intention to commence a tender offer
    or an exchange offer and, within a reasonable time, the M&T
    board of directors either does not recommend that shareholders
    not accept the offer or fails to adopt a shareholders rights
    plan, or if M&T or M&T Bank becomes subject to any
    regulatory capital directive or becomes an institution in
    “troubled” condition under applicable banking
    regulations. However, in the event the tender offer or exchange
    offer is not commenced or consummated in accordance with its
    terms, the restrictions on AIB described above will thereafter
    continue to apply.

Anti-Dilution
    Protections

M&T has agreed that until the Sunset Date, in the event
    M&T issues shares of M&T stock (other than certain
    issuances to employees pursuant to option and benefit plans),
    subject to applicable law and



regulatory requirements, AIB will have the right to purchase at
    fair market value up to the number of shares of M&T common
    stock required to increase or maintain its equity interest in
    M&T to 22.5% of the then outstanding M&T common stock.

M&T has also agreed that until the Sunset Date, in
    connection with any issuance of M&T stock pursuant to
    employee option or benefit plans, M&T will as soon as
    reasonably practicable, taking into account applicable law,
    regulatory capital requirements, capital planning and risk
    management, take such necessary actions so that AIB’s
    proportionate ownership of M&T common stock is not reduced
    as a result of such issuances, including by funding such
    issuances through purchases of M&T common stock in the open
    market or by undertaking share repurchase programs.

Sale of
    M&T Common Stock; Right of First Refusal in Certain
    Circumstances

The M&T common stock issued to AIB was not registered under
    the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and
    may only be disposed of by AIB pursuant to an effective
    registration statement or pursuant to an exemption from
    registration under the Securities Act and subject to the
    provisions of the Reorganization Agreement.

M&T and AIB have entered into a registration rights
    agreement that provides that upon AIB’s request, M&T
    will file a registration statement relating to all or a portion
    of AIB’s shares of M&T common stock providing for the
    sale of such shares by AIB from time to time on a continuous
    basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act,
    provided that M&T need only effect one such “shelf
    registration” in any

12-month

period. In addition, the registration rights agreement provides
    that AIB is entitled to demand registration under the Securities
    Act of all or part of its shares of M&T stock, provided
    that M&T is not obligated to effect two such “demand
    registrations” in any

12-month

period. Any demand or shelf registration must cover no less than
    one million shares.

The registration rights agreement further provides that in the
    event M&T proposes to file a registration statement other
    than pursuant to a shelf registration or demand registration or

Forms S-8

or

S-4,

for
    an offering and sale of shares by M&T in an underwritten
    offering or an offering and sale of shares on behalf of one or
    more selling shareholders, M&T must give AIB notice at
    least 15 days prior to the anticipated filing date, and AIB
    may request that all or a portion of its M&T common shares
    be included in the registration statement. M&T will honor
    the request, unless the managing underwriter advises M&T in
    writing that in its opinion the inclusion of all shares
    requested to be included by M&T, the other selling
    shareholders, if any, and AIB would materially and adversely
    affect the offering, in which case M&T may limit the number
    of shares included in the offering to a number that would not
    reasonably be expected to have such an effect. In such event,
    the number of shares to be included in the registration
    statement shall first include the number of shares requested to
    be included by M&T and then the shares requested by other
    selling shareholders, including AIB, on a pro rata basis
    according to the number of shares requested to be included in
    the registration statement by each shareholder.

As long as AIB holds 5% or more of the outstanding shares of
    M&T common stock, AIB will not dispose of any of its shares
    of M&T common stock except, subject to the terms and
    conditions of the Reorganization Agreement and applicable law,
    in a widely dispersed public distribution; a private placement
    in which no one party acquires the right to purchase more than
    2% of the outstanding shares of M&T common stock; an
    assignment to a single party (such as a broker or investment
    banker) for the purpose of conducting a widely dispersed public
    distribution on AIB’s behalf; pursuant to Rule 144
    under the Securities Act; pursuant to a tender or exchange offer
    to M&T’s shareholders not opposed by M&T’s
    board of directors, or open market purchase programs made by
    M&T; with the consent of M&T, which consent will not
    be unreasonably withheld, to a controlled subsidiary of AIB; or
    pursuant to M&T’s right of first refusal as described
    below.

The Reorganization Agreement provides that until AIB no longer
    holds at least 5% of the outstanding shares of M&T common
    stock, if AIB wishes to sell or otherwise transfer any of its
    shares of M&T common stock other than as described in the
    preceding paragraph, AIB must first submit an offer notice to
    M&T identifying the proposed transferee and setting forth
    the proposed terms of the transaction, which shall be limited to
    sales for cash, cash equivalents or marketable securities.
    M&T will have the right, for 20 days following receipt
    of an offer notice from AIB, to purchase all (but not less than
    all) of the shares of M&T common stock that AIB wishes to
    sell, on the proposed terms specified in



the offer notice. If M&T declines or fails to respond to
    the offer notice within 20 days, AIB may sell all or a
    portion of the M&T shares specified in the offer notice to
    the proposed transferee at a purchase price equal to or greater
    than the price specified in the offer notice, at any time during
    the three months following the date of the offer notice, or, if
    prior notification to or approval of the sale by the Federal
    Reserve Board or another regulatory agency is required, AIB
    shall pursue regulatory approval expeditiously and the sale may
    occur on the first date permitted under applicable law.

Certain
    Post-Closing Bank Regulatory Matters

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
    (“Federal Reserve Board”) deems AIB to be
    M&T’s bank holding company for purposes of the BHCA.
    In addition, the New York Banking Superintendent (“Banking
    Superintendent”) deems AIB to be M&T’s bank
    holding company for purposes of

Article III-A

of the Banking Law. Among other things, this means that, should
    M&T propose to make an acquisition or engage in a new type
    of activity that requires the submission of an application or
    notice to the Federal Reserve Board or the Banking
    Superintendent, AIB, as well as M&T, may also be required
    to file an application or notice. The Reorganization Agreement
    generally provides that AIB will make any applications, notices
    or filings that M&T determines to be necessary or
    desirable. The Reorganization Agreement also requires AIB not to
    take any action that would have a material adverse effect on
    M&T and to advise M&T prior to entering into any
    material transaction or activity. These provisions of the
    Reorganization Agreement would no longer apply if AIB ceased to
    be M&T’s bank holding company and also was not
    otherwise considered to control M&T for purposes of the
    BHCA.

Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, if, as a result of any
    administrative enforcement action under Section 8 of the
    Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDI Act”),
    memorandum of understanding, written agreement, supervisory
    letter or any other action or determination of any regulatory
    agency relating to the status of AIB (but not relating to the
    conduct of M&T or any subsidiary of M&T), M&T or
    M&T Bank also becomes subject to such an action,
    memorandum, agreement or letter that relates to M&T or any
    M&T subsidiary, or experiences any fact, event or
    circumstance that affects M&T’s regulatory status or
    compliance, and that in either case would be reasonably likely
    to create a material burden on M&T or to cause any material
    adverse economic or operating consequences to M&T or an
    M&T subsidiary (a “Material Regulatory Event”),
    then M&T will notify AIB thereof in writing as promptly as
    practicable. Should AIB fail to cure the Material Regulatory
    Event within 90 days following the receipt of such notice,
    AIB will, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than
    30 days from the end of the cure period, take any and all
    such actions (with the reasonable cooperation of M&T as
    requested by AIB) as may be necessary or advisable in order that
    it no longer has “control” of M&T for purposes of
    the BHCA, including, if necessary, by selling some or all of its
    shares of M&T common stock (subject to the right of first
    refusal provisions of the Reorganization Agreement) and
    divesting itself as required of its board and committee
    representation and governance rights as set forth in the
    Reorganization Agreement. If, at the end of such

30-day

period, the Material Regulatory Event is continuing and AIB has
    not terminated its control of M&T, then M&T will have
    the right to repurchase, at fair market value, such amount of
    the M&T common stock owned by AIB as would result in AIB
    holding no less than 4.9% of the outstanding shares of M&T
    common stock, pursuant to the procedures detailed in the
    Reorganization Agreement.

As long as AIB is considered to “control” M&T for
    purposes of the BHCA or the federal Change in Bank Control Act,
    if AIB acquires any insured depository institution with total
    assets greater than 25% of the assets of M&T’s largest
    insured depository institution subsidiary, then within two years
    AIB must terminate its affiliation with the insured depository
    institution or take such steps as may be necessary so that none
    of M&T’s bank subsidiaries would be subject to
    “cross guarantee” liability for losses incurred if the
    institution AIB acquired potentially were to fail. This
    liability applies under the FDI Act to insured depository
    institutions that are commonly controlled. The actions AIB would
    take could include disposing of shares of M&T common stock

and/or

surrendering its representation or governance rights. Also, if
    such an insured depository institution that is controlled by AIB
    and of the size described in the first sentence of this
    paragraph that would be considered to be commonly controlled
    with M&T’s insured depository institution subsidiaries
    fails to meet applicable requirements to be “adequately
    capitalized” under applicable U.S. banking laws, then
    AIB will have to take the actions described in the previous



sentence no later than 180 days after the date that the
    institution failed to meet those requirements, unless the
    institution is sooner returned to “adequately
    capitalized” status.

Segment
    Information, Principal Products/Services and Foreign
    Operations

Information about the Registrant’s business segments is
    included in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements filed
    herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data” and is further discussed
    in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.” The Registrant’s reportable segments have
    been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting
    system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain
    strategic business units have been combined for segment
    information reporting purposes where the nature of the products
    and services, the type of customer and the distribution of those
    products and services are similar. The reportable segments are
    Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate,
    Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail
    Banking. The Company’s international activities are
    discussed in note 16 of Notes to Financial Statements filed
    herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data.”

The only activity that, as a class, contributed 10% or more of
    the sum of consolidated interest income and other income in any
    of the last three years was lending transactions. The amount of
    income from such sources during those years is set forth on the
    Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income filed herewith
    in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data.”

Supervision
    and Regulation of the Company

The banking industry is subject to extensive state and federal
    regulation and continues to undergo significant change. The
    following discussion summarizes certain aspects of the banking
    laws and regulations that affect the Company. Proposals to
    change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry
    are frequently raised in Congress, in state legislatures, and
    before the various bank regulatory agencies. The likelihood and
    timing of any changes and the impact such changes might have on
    the Company are impossible to determine with any certainty. A
    change in applicable laws or regulations, or a change in the way
    such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies
    or courts, may have a material impact on the business,
    operations and earnings of the Company. To the extent that the
    following information describes statutory or regulatory
    provisions, it is qualified entirely by reference to the
    particular statutory or regulatory provision.

Financial
    Services Modernization

Under the BHCA, bank holding companies are permitted to offer
    their customers virtually any type of financial service that is
    financial in nature or incidental thereto, including banking,
    securities underwriting, insurance (both underwriting and
    agency), and merchant banking.

In order to engage in these financial activities, a bank holding
    company must qualify and register with the Federal Reserve Board
    as a “financial holding company” by demonstrating that
    each of its bank subsidiaries is “well capitalized,”
    “well managed,” and has at least a
    “satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment
    Act of 1977 (“CRA”). M&T currently satisfies the
    qualifications for registering as a financial holding company,
    but has not elected to do so to date. For as long as AIB owns at
    least 15% of M&T’s outstanding common stock, M&T
    may not become a financial holding company without



the approval of the Executive Committee of the M&T board of
    directors, which must also include the affirmative approval of
    the AIB Designee on such committee, as described above under the
    caption “Amendments to M&T’s Bylaws.”

The financial activities authorized by the BHCA may also be
    engaged in by a “financial subsidiary” of a national
    or state bank, except for insurance or annuity underwriting,
    insurance company portfolio investments, real estate investment
    and development, and merchant banking, which must be conducted
    in a financial holding company. In order for these financial
    activities to be engaged in by a financial subsidiary of a
    national or state bank, federal law requires each of the parent
    bank (and its sister-bank affiliates) to be well capitalized and
    well managed; the aggregate consolidated assets of all of that
    bank’s financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of
    45% of its consolidated total assets or $50 billion; the
    bank must have at least a satisfactory CRA rating; and, if that
    bank is one of the 100 largest national banks, it must meet
    certain financial rating or other comparable requirements.
    M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. currently satisfy the
    qualifications for engaging in financial activities through
    financial subsidiaries, but neither has elected to do so to
    date. Current federal law also establishes a system of
    functional regulation under which the federal banking agencies
    will regulate the banking activities of financial holding
    companies and banks’ financial subsidiaries, the
    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will regulate their
    securities activities, and state insurance regulators will
    regulate their insurance activities. Rules developed by the
    federal financial institutions regulators under these laws
    require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some
    circumstances, allow consumers to prevent the disclosure of
    certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties.

Bank
    Holding Company Regulation

As a registered bank holding company, the Registrant and its
    nonbank subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation
    under the BHCA by the Federal Reserve Board and under the
    Banking Law by the Banking Superintendent. The Federal Reserve
    Board requires regular reports from the Registrant and is
    authorized by the BHCA to make regular examinations of the
    Registrant and its subsidiaries.

The Registrant may not acquire direct or indirect ownership or
    control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company,
    including a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal
    Reserve Board, except as specifically authorized under the BHCA.
    The Registrant is also subject to regulation under the Banking
    Law with respect to certain acquisitions of domestic banks.
    Under the BHCA, the Registrant, subject to the approval of the
    Federal Reserve Board, may acquire shares of non-banking
    corporations the activities of which are deemed by the Federal
    Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or
    controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.

The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement powers over bank
    holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries, among
    other things, to interdict activities that represent unsafe or
    unsound practices or constitute violations of law, rule,
    regulation, administrative orders or written agreements with a
    federal bank regulator. These powers may be exercised through
    the issuance of

cease-and-desist

orders, civil money penalties or other actions.

Under the Federal Reserve Board’s statement of policy with
    respect to bank holding company operations, a bank holding
    company is required to serve as a source of financial strength
    to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit all
    available resources to support such institutions in
    circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy.
    Although this “source of strength” policy has been
    challenged in litigation, the Federal Reserve Board continues to
    take the position that it has authority to enforce it. For a
    discussion of circumstances under which a bank holding company
    may be required to guarantee the capital levels or performance
    of its subsidiary banks, see “Capital Adequacy,”
    below. Consistent with this “source of strength”
    policy, the Federal Reserve Board takes the position that a bank
    holding company generally should not maintain a rate of cash
    dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders
    has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the
    prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent
    with the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall
    financial condition. The Federal Reserve also has the authority
    to terminate any activity of a bank holding company that
    constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or
    stability of any subsidiary depository institution or to
    terminate its control of any bank or nonbank subsidiaries.



The BHCA generally permits bank holding companies to acquire
    banks in any state, and preempts all state laws restricting the
    ownership by a bank holding company of banks in more than one
    state. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDI Act”)
    also permits a bank to merge with an

out-of-state

bank and convert any offices into branches of the resulting bank
    if both states have not opted out of interstate branching;
    permits a bank to acquire branches from an

out-of-state

bank if the law of the state where the branches are located
    permits the interstate branch acquisition; and permits banks to
    establish and operate de novo interstate branches whenever the
    host state opts-in to de novo branching. Bank holding companies
    and banks seeking to engage in transactions authorized by these
    laws must be adequately capitalized and managed.

The Banking Law authorizes interstate branching by merger or
    acquisition on a reciprocal basis, and permits the acquisition
    of a single branch without restriction, but does not provide for
    de novo interstate branching.

Bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks are also
    subject to the provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of the
    CRA, the Federal Reserve Board (or other appropriate bank
    regulatory agency) is required, in connection with its
    examination of a bank, to assess such bank’s record in
    meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that bank,
    including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. During these
    examinations, the Federal Reserve Board (or other appropriate
    bank regulatory agency) rates such bank’s compliance with
    the CRA as “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,”
    “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial
    Noncompliance.” The failure of a bank to receive at least a
    “Satisfactory” rating could inhibit such bank or its
    bank holding company from undertaking certain activities,
    including acquisitions of other financial institutions or
    opening or relocating a branch office, as further discussed
    below. M&T Bank has a CRA rating of “Outstanding”
    and M&T Bank, N.A. has a CRA rating of
    “Satisfactory.” Furthermore, such assessment is also
    required of any bank that has applied, among other things, to
    merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the
    liabilities of a federally-regulated financial institution, or
    to open or relocate a branch office. In the case of a bank
    holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or bank
    holding company, the Federal Reserve Board will assess the
    record of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding
    company in considering the application. The Banking Law contains
    provisions similar to the CRA which are applicable to New
    York-chartered banks. M&T Bank has a CRA rating of
    “Outstanding” as determined by the New York State
    Banking Department.

Supervision
    and Regulation of Bank Subsidiaries

The Registrant’s bank subsidiaries are subject to
    supervision and regulation, and are examined regularly, by
    various bank regulatory agencies: M&T Bank by the Federal
    Reserve Board and the Banking Superintendent; and M&T Bank,
    N.A. by the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). The
    Registrant and its direct non-banking subsidiaries are
    affiliates, within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, of
    the Registrant’s subsidiary banks and their subsidiaries.
    As a result, the Registrant’s subsidiary banks and their
    subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on loans or extensions
    of credit to, purchases of assets from, investments in, and
    transactions with the Registrant and its direct non-banking
    subsidiaries and on certain other transactions with them or
    involving their securities. Similar restrictions are imposed on
    the Registrant’s subsidiary banks making loans or extending
    credit to, purchasing assets from, investing in, or entering
    into transactions with, their financial subsidiaries.

Under the “cross-guarantee” provisions of the FDI Act,
    insured depository institutions under common control are
    required to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered by the FDIC
    as a result of the default of a commonly controlled insured
    depository institution or for any assistance provided by the
    FDIC to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in
    danger of default. Thus, any insured depository institution
    subsidiary of M&T could incur liability to the FDIC in the
    event of a default of another insured depository institution
    owned or controlled by M&T. The FDIC’s claim under the
    cross-guarantee provisions is superior to claims of stockholders
    of the insured depository institution or its holding company and
    to most claims arising out of obligations or liabilities owed to
    affiliates of the institution, but is subordinate to claims of
    depositors, secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt
    (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured
    depository institution. The FDIC may decline to enforce the
    cross-guarantee provisions if it determines that a waiver is in
    the best interest of the DIF.



Dividends
    from Bank Subsidiaries

The Registrant is a legal entity separate and distinct from its
    banking and other subsidiaries. The majority of the
    Registrant’s revenue is from dividends paid to the
    Registrant by its subsidiary banks. M&T Bank and M&T
    Bank, N.A. are subject, under one or more of the banking laws,
    to restrictions on the amount of dividend declarations. Future
    dividend payments to the Registrant by its subsidiary banks will
    be dependent on a number of factors, including the earnings and
    financial condition of each such bank, and are subject to the
    limitations referred to in note 22 of Notes to Financial
    Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8,
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and to
    other statutory powers of bank regulatory agencies.

An insured depository institution is prohibited from making any
    capital distribution to its owner, including any dividend, if,
    after making such distribution, the depository institution fails
    to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital
    measure, including the risk-based capital adequacy and leverage
    standards discussed herein.

Supervision
    and Regulation of M&T Bank’s Subsidiaries

M&T Bank has a number of subsidiaries. These subsidiaries
    are subject to the laws and regulations of both the federal
    government and the various states in which they conduct
    business. For example, M&T Securities is regulated by the
    Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry
    Regulatory Authority and state securities regulators.

Capital
    Adequacy

The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC have adopted
    risk-based capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding
    companies and banks under their supervision. Under these
    guidelines, the so-called “Tier 1 capital” and
    “Total capital” as a percentage of risk-weighted
    assets and certain off-balance sheet instruments must be at
    least 4% and 8%, respectively.

The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC have also
    imposed a leverage standard to supplement their risk-based
    ratios. This leverage standard focuses on a banking
    institution’s ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total
    assets, adjusted for goodwill and certain other items. Under
    these guidelines, banking institutions that meet certain
    criteria, including excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low
    interest rate exposure and good earnings, and that have received
    the highest regulatory rating must maintain a ratio of
    Tier 1 capital to total adjusted average assets of at least
    3%. Institutions not meeting these criteria, as well as
    institutions with supervisory, financial or operational
    weaknesses, along with those experiencing or anticipating
    significant growth are expected to maintain a Tier 1
    capital to total adjusted average assets ratio equal to at least
    4% to 5%. As reflected in the table in note 22 of Notes to
    Financial Statements filed herewith in Part II,
    Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data,” the risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios of
    the Registrant, M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. as of
    December 31, 2007 exceeded the required capital ratios for
    classification as “well capitalized,” the highest
    classification under the regulatory capital guidelines.

The federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve
    Board and the OCC, maintain risk-based capital standards in
    order to ensure that those standards take adequate account of
    interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk, the risk of
    nontraditional activities and equity investments in nonfinancial
    companies, as well as reflect the actual performance and
    expected risk of loss on certain multifamily housing loans. Bank
    regulators periodically propose amendments to the risk-based
    capital guidelines and related regulatory framework, and
    consider changes to the risk-based capital standards that could
    significantly increase the amount of capital needed to meet the
    requirements for the capital tiers described below. While the
    Company’s management studies such proposals, the timing of
    adoption, ultimate form and effect of any such proposed
    amendments on M&T’s capital requirements and
    operations cannot be predicted.

The federal banking agencies are required to take “prompt
    corrective action” in respect of depository institutions
    and their bank holding companies that do not meet minimum
    capital requirements. The FDI Act establishes five capital
    tiers: “well capitalized,” “adequately
    capitalized,” “undercapitalized,”
    “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically
    undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital
    tier, or that of its bank holding company, depends upon where
    its capital levels are in relation to various



relevant capital measures, including a risk-based capital
    measure and a leverage ratio capital measure, and certain other
    factors.

Under the implementing regulations adopted by the federal
    banking agencies, a bank holding company or bank is considered
    “well capitalized” if it has (i) a total
    risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, (ii) a
    Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater,
    (iii) a leverage ratio of 5% or greater and (iv) is
    not subject to any order or written directive to meet and
    maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An
    “adequately capitalized” bank holding company or bank
    is defined as one that has (i) a total risk-based capital
    ratio of 8% or greater, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based
    capital ratio of 4% or greater and (iii) a leverage ratio
    of 4% or greater (or 3% or greater in the case of a bank with a
    composite CAMELS rating of 1). A bank holding company or bank is
    considered (A) “undercapitalized” if it has
    (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%,
    (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%
    or (iii) a leverage ratio of less than 4% (or 3% in the
    case of a bank with a composite CAMELS rating of 1);
    (B) “significantly undercapitalized” if the bank
    has (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%,
    or (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than
    3% or (iii) a leverage ratio of less than 3% and
    (C) “critically undercapitalized” if the bank has
    a ratio of tangible equity to total assets equal to or less than
    2%. The Federal Reserve Board may reclassify a “well
    capitalized” bank holding company or bank as
    “adequately capitalized” or subject an
    “adequately capitalized” or
    “undercapitalized” institution to the supervisory
    actions applicable to the next lower capital category if it
    determines that the bank holding company or bank is in an unsafe
    or unsound condition or deems the bank holding company or bank
    to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice and not to have
    corrected the deficiency. M&T, M&T Bank and M&T
    Bank, N.A. currently meet the definition of “well
    capitalized” institutions.

“Undercapitalized” depository institutions, among
    other things, are subject to growth limitations, are prohibited,
    with certain exceptions, from making capital distributions, are
    limited in their ability to obtain funding from a Federal
    Reserve Bank and are required to submit a capital restoration
    plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan
    without determining, among other things, that the plan is based
    on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring
    the depository institution’s capital. In addition, for a
    capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository
    institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that
    the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan
    and provide appropriate assurances of performance. If a
    depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan,
    including if the holding company refuses or is unable to make
    the guarantee described in the previous sentence, it is treated
    as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” Failure
    to submit or implement an acceptable capital plan also is
    grounds for the appointment of a conservator or a receiver.
    “Significantly undercapitalized” depository
    institutions may be subject to a number of additional
    requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell
    sufficient voting stock to become “adequately
    capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets and
    cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.
    Moreover, the parent holding company of a “significantly
    undercapitalized” depository institution may be ordered to
    divest itself of the institution or of nonbank subsidiaries of
    the holding company. “Critically undercapitalized”
    institutions, among other things, are prohibited from making any
    payments of principal and interest on subordinated debt, and are
    subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.

Each federal banking agency prescribes standards for depository
    institutions and depository institution holding companies
    relating to internal controls, information systems, internal
    audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest
    rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, a maximum ratio of
    classified assets to capital, minimum earnings sufficient to
    absorb losses, a minimum ratio of market value to book value for
    publicly traded shares and other standards as they deem
    appropriate. The Federal Reserve Board and OCC have adopted such
    standards.

Depository institutions that are not “well
    capitalized” or “adequately capitalized” and have
    not received a waiver from the FDIC are prohibited from
    accepting or renewing brokered deposits. As of December 31,
    2007, M&T Bank had approximately $1.9 billion of
    brokered deposits, while M&T Bank, N.A. did not have any
    brokered deposits at that date.

Although M&T has issued shares of common stock in
    connection with acquisitions or at other times, the Company has
    generally maintained capital ratios in excess of minimum
    regulatory guidelines largely through internal capital
    generation (i.e. net income less dividends paid). Historically,
    M&T’s



dividend payout ratio and dividend yield, when compared with
    other bank holding companies, has been relatively low, thereby
    allowing for capital retention to support growth or to
    facilitate purchases of M&T’s common stock to be held
    as treasury stock. Management’s policy of reinvestment of
    earnings and repurchase of shares of common stock is intended to
    enhance M&T’s earnings per share prospects and thereby
    reward stockholders over time with capital gains in the form of
    increased stock price rather than high dividend income.

FDIC
    Deposit Insurance Assessments

As institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC, M&T Bank
    and M&T Bank, N.A. are subject to FDIC deposit insurance
    assessments. Under the provisions of the FDI Act, the regular
    insurance assessments to be paid by insured institutions are
    specified in schedules issued by the FDIC that specify a target
    reserve ratio designed to maintain that ratio between 1.15% and
    1.50% of estimated insured deposits.

Under the FDI Act, the FDIC imposed deposit insurance
    assessments based on one of four assessment categories depending
    on the institution’s capital classification under the
    prompt corrective action provisions described above, and an
    institution’s long-term debt issuer ratings. Effective
    January 1, 2007, the adjusted assessment rates for insured
    institutions under the modified system range from .05% to .43%
    depending upon the assessment category into which the insured
    institution is placed. The annual assessment rates for M&T
    Bank and M&T Bank N.A. during 2007 were approximately .05%.

The FDI Act also allows for a one-time assessment credit for
    eligible insured depository institutions (those institutions
    that were in existence on December 31, 1996 and paid a
    deposit insurance assessment prior to that date, or are a
    successor to any such institution). The credit is determined
    based on the assessment base of the institution as of
    December 31, 1996 as compared with the combined aggregate
    assessment base of all eligible institutions as of that date.
    The credit may be used to offset up to 100% of the 2007 DIF
    assessment, and if not completely used in 2007, may be applied
    to not more than 90% of each of the aggregate 2008, 2009 and
    2010 DIF assessments. M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A.
    offset 100% of their DIF assessments with available one-time
    assessment credits during 2007. For the first nine months of
    2007, credits utilized to offset amounts assessed for M&T
    Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. totaled $14 million and $108
    thousand, respectively. Fourth quarter 2007 assessments for
    M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A., which will be assessed in
    March 2008 and will also be completely offset by available
    credits, are estimated to be approximately $5 million and
    $30 thousand, respectively.

The current insurance assessment system is not expected to have
    a significant adverse impact on the results of operations and
    capital of M&T Bank or M&T Bank, N.A. in 2008, as
    available credits will offset 90% of such assessments. However,
    any significant increases in assessment rates or additional
    special assessments by the FDIC could have an adverse impact on
    the results of operations and capital of M&T Bank or
    M&T Bank, N.A. As of December 31, 2007, available
    credits for M&T Bank are expected to be fully utilized by
    mid-2009.

In addition to insurance fund assessments, the FDIC assesses
    deposits to fund the repayment of debt obligations of the
    Financing Corporation (“FICO”). FICO is a government
    agency-sponsored entity that was formed to borrow the money
    necessary to carry out the closing and ultimate disposition of
    failed thrift institutions by the Resolution
    Trust Corporation. The current annualized rate established
    by the FDIC is 1.14 basis points (hundredths of one
    percent).

Consumer
    Protection Laws

In connection with their respective lending and leasing
    activities, M&T Bank, certain of its subsidiaries, and
    M&T Bank, N.A. are each subject to a number of federal and
    state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to
    various sectors of the economy population. These laws include
    the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act,
    the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Truth in
    Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Real
    Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and various state law
    counterparts.

In addition, federal law currently contains extensive customer
    privacy protection provisions. Under these provisions, a
    financial institution must provide to its customers, at the
    inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter,
    the institution’s policies and procedures regarding the
    handling of customers’ nonpublic personal financial
    information. These provisions also provide that, except for



certain limited exceptions, a financial institution may not
    provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties
    unless the institution discloses to the customer that such
    information may be so provided and the customer is given the
    opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. Federal law makes it
    a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain
    or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature
    by fraudulent or deceptive means.

Sarbanes-Oxley
    Act of 2002

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 implemented a broad range of
    corporate governance, accounting and reporting measures for
    companies that have securities registered under the Exchange
    Act, including publicly-held bank holding companies such as
    M&T. Specifically, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
    various regulations promulgated thereunder, established, among
    other things: (i) new requirements for audit committees,
    including independence, expertise, and responsibilities;
    (ii) additional responsibilities regarding financial
    statements for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer of the reporting company; (iii) the forfeiture of
    bonuses or other incentive-based compensation and profits from
    the sale of the reporting company’s securities by the Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in the
    twelve-month period following the initial publication of any
    financial statements that later require restatement;
    (iv) the creation of an independent accounting oversight
    board; (v) new standards for auditors and regulation of
    audits, including independence provisions that restrict
    non-audit services that accountants may provide to their audit
    clients; (vi) increased disclosure and reporting
    obligations for the reporting company and their directors and
    executive officers, including accelerated reporting of stock
    transactions and a prohibition on trading during pension
    blackout periods; (vii) a prohibition on personal loans to
    directors and officers, except certain loans made by insured
    financial institutions on nonpreferential terms and in
    compliance with other bank regulatory requirements; and
    (viii) a range of new and increased civil and criminal
    penalties for fraud and other violations of the securities laws.

USA
    Patriot Act

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate
    Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001
    (the “USA Patriot Act”) imposes additional obligations
    on U.S. financial institutions, including banks and broker
    dealer subsidiaries, to implement policies, procedures and
    controls which are reasonably designed to detect and report
    instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. In
    addition, provisions of the USA Patriot Act require the federal
    financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the
    effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money
    laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank
    holding company acquisitions. The Registrant and its impacted
    subsidiaries have approved policies and procedures that are
    believed to be compliant with the USA Patriot Act.

Regulatory
    Impact of M&T’s Relationship With AIB

As described above under the caption “Relationship With
    Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c.,” AIB owns approximately 24.3%
    of the issued and outstanding shares of M&T common stock
    and has representation on the M&T and M&T Bank boards
    of directors. As a result, AIB has become M&T’s bank
    holding company under the BHCA and the Banking Law and
    AIB’s relationship with M&T is subject to the statutes
    and regulations governing bank holding companies described
    above. Among other things, AIB will have to join M&T in
    applications by M&T for acquisitions and new activities.
    The Reorganization Agreement requires AIB to join in such
    applications at M&T’s request, subject to certain
    limitations. In addition, because AIB is regulated by the
    Central Bank of Ireland (“CBI”), the CBI may assert
    jurisdiction over M&T as a company controlled by AIB.
    Additional discussion of the regulatory implications of the
    Allfirst acquisition for M&T is set forth above under the
    caption “Certain Post-Closing Bank Regulatory Matters.”

Governmental
    Policies

The earnings of the Company are significantly affected by the
    monetary and fiscal policies of governmental authorities,
    including the Federal Reserve Board. Among the instruments of
    monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement
    these objectives are open-market operations in
    U.S. Government



securities and federal funds, changes in the discount rate on
    member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements
    against member bank deposits. These instruments of monetary
    policy are used in varying combinations to influence the overall
    level of bank loans, investments and deposits, and the interest
    rates charged on loans and paid for deposits. The Federal
    Reserve Board frequently uses these instruments of monetary
    policy, especially its open-market operations and the discount
    rate, to influence the level of interest rates and to affect the
    strength of the economy, the level of inflation or the price of
    the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The monetary policies of
    the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the
    operating results of banking institutions in the past and are
    expected to continue to do so in the future. It is not possible
    to predict the nature of future changes in monetary and fiscal
    policies, or the effect which they may have on the
    Company’s business and earnings.

Competition

The Company competes in offering commercial and personal
    financial services with other banking institutions and with
    firms in a number of other industries, such as thrift
    institutions, credit unions, personal loan companies, sales
    finance companies, leasing companies, securities firms and
    insurance companies. Furthermore, diversified financial services
    companies are able to offer a combination of these services to
    their customers on a nationwide basis. The Company’s
    operations are significantly impacted by state and federal
    regulations applicable to the banking industry. Moreover, the
    provisions of Gramm-Leach have allowed for increased competition
    among diversified financial services providers, and the
    Interstate Banking Act and the Banking Law may be considered to
    have eased entry into New York State by

out-of-state

banking institutions. As a result, the number of financial
    services providers and banking institutions with which the
    Company competes may grow in the future.

Other
    Legislative Initiatives

Proposals may be introduced in the United States Congress and in
    the New York State Legislature and before various bank
    regulatory authorities which would alter the powers of, and
    restrictions on, different types of banking organizations and
    which would restructure part or all of the existing regulatory
    framework for banks, bank holding companies and other providers
    of financial services. Moreover, other bills may be introduced
    in Congress which would further regulate, deregulate or
    restructure the financial services industry. It is not possible
    to predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted
    into law or, even if enacted, the effect which they may have on
    the Company’s business and earnings.

Interest income data are on a
    taxable-equivalent basis. The apportionment of changes resulting
    from the combined effect of both volume and rate was based on
    the separately determined volume and rate changes.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

M&T and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by
    various risks and uncertainties which are difficult to predict.
    As a financial institution, the Company has significant exposure
    to market risk, including interest-rate risk, liquidity risk and
    credit risk, among others. Adverse experience with these or
    other risks could have a material impact on the Company’s
    financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the
    value of the Company’s financial instruments in general,
    and M&T’s common stock, in particular.



Interest Rate Risk — The Company is exposed to
    interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and
    deposit-taking since assets and liabilities reprice at different
    times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a
    result, net interest income, which represents the largest
    revenue source for the Company, is subject to the effects of
    changing interest rates. The Company closely monitors the
    sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates
    and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as
    interest rates change. The Company makes use of both on- and
    off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to
    interest rate risk. Possible actions to mitigate such risk
    include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan
    and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to,
    modifying or terminating interest rate swap agreements or other
    financial instruments used for interest rate risk management
    purposes.

Liquidity Risk — Liquidity refers to the
    Company’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and
    liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future
    financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit
    withdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporate
    purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of
    financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.
    The Company obtains funding through deposits and various
    short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal
    funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to
    repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, offshore branch
    deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New
    York and others. Should the Company experience a substantial
    deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or
    should the availability of funding become restricted due to
    disruption in the financial markets, the Company’s ability
    to obtain funding from these or other sources could be
    negatively impacted. The Company attempts to quantify such
    credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the
    liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade
    over various grading levels. The Company estimates such impact
    by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines
    of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and
    securitizable assets. To mitigate such risk, the Company
    maintains available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve
    Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York that
    are secured by loans and investment securities. On an ongoing
    basis, management closely monitors the Company’s liquidity
    position for compliance with internal policies and believes that
    available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding
    needs in the normal course of business.

Credit Risk — Factors that influence the
    Company’s credit loss experience include overall economic
    conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and,
    due to the size of the Company’s real estate loan portfolio
    and mortgage-related investment securities portfolio, real
    estate valuations, in particular. Other factors that can
    influence the Company’s credit loss experience, in addition
    to general economic conditions and borrowers’ specific
    abilities to repay loans, include: (i) the impact of
    declining real estate values on the Company’s portfolio of
    loans to residential real estate builders and developers;
    (ii) the repayment performance associated with the
    Company’s portfolio of alternative residential mortgage
    loans and residential and other mortgage loans supporting
    mortgage-related securities; (iii) the concentration of
    commercial real estate loans in the Company’s loan
    portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured
    by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York
    City metropolitan area, in particular; (iv) the amount of
    commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New
    York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in
    central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less
    economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other
    regions of the country; and (v) the size of the
    Company’s portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which
    historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a
    percentage of loans outstanding than many other loan types.
    Although the national economy experienced moderate growth in
    2007 with inflation being reasonably well contained, concerns
    exist about the level and volatility of energy prices; a
    weakening housing market; the troubled state of financial and
    credit markets; Federal Reserve positioning of monetary policy;
    sluggish job creation and rising unemployment, which could cause
    consumer spending to slow; the underlying impact on
    businesses’ operations and abilities to repay loans should
    consumer spending slow; continued stagnant population growth in
    the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions; and
    continued slowing of domestic automobile sales. All of these
    factors can affect the Company’s credit loss experience. To
    help manage credit risk, the Company maintains a detailed credit
    policy and utilizes various committees that include members of
    senior management to approve significant extensions of credit.
    The Company also maintains a credit review department that
    regularly reviews the



Company’s loan and lease portfolios to ensure compliance
    with established credit policy. The Company maintains an
    allowance for credit losses that in management’s judgment
    is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease
    portfolio. In addition, the Company regularly reviews its
    investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost
    that might be characterized as “other than temporary.”
    Any declines in value below amortized cost that are deemed to be
    “other than temporary” are charged to earnings.

Supervision and Regulation — The Company is subject to
    extensive state and federal laws and regulations governing the
    banking industry, in particular, and public companies, in
    general, including laws related to corporate taxation. Many of
    those laws and regulations are described in Part I,
    Item 1 “Business.” Changes in those or other laws
    and regulations, or the degree of the Company’s compliance
    with those laws and regulations as judged by any of several
    regulators, including tax authorities, that oversee the Company,
    could have a significant effect on the Company’s operations
    and its financial results.

Detailed discussions of the specific risks outlined above and
    other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

in Part I, Item 1 “Business,” and
    Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
    Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading
    “Forward-Looking Statements” is included a description
    of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by
    management that are difficult to predict and that could
    materially affect the Company’s financial condition and
    results of operations, as well as the value of the
    Company’s financial instruments in general, and M&T
    common stock, in particular.

In addition, the market price of M&T common stock may
    fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other
    factors, including changes in securities analysts’
    estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market
    prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in
    market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting
    policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory agencies.

Item 2.

Properties.

Both M&T and M&T Bank maintain their executive offices
    at One M&T Plaza in Buffalo, New York. This twenty-one
    story headquarters building, containing approximately
    278,000 rentable square feet of space, is owned in fee by
    M&T Bank and was completed in 1967. M&T, M&T Bank
    and their subsidiaries occupy approximately 88% of the building
    and the remainder is leased to non-affiliated tenants. At
    December 31, 2007, the cost of this property (including
    improvements subsequent to the initial construction), net of
    accumulated depreciation, was $6.2 million.

In September 1992, M&T Bank acquired an additional facility
    in Buffalo, New York with approximately 365,000 rentable
    square feet of space. Approximately 89% of this facility, known
    as M&T Center, is occupied by M&T Bank and its
    subsidiaries, with the remainder leased to non-affiliated
    tenants. At December 31, 2007, the cost of this building
    (including improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of
    accumulated depreciation, was $12.1 million.

M&T Bank also owns and occupies two separate facilities in
    the Buffalo area which support certain back-office and
    operations functions of the Company. The total square footage of
    these facilities approximates 215,000 square feet and their
    combined cost (including improvements subsequent to
    acquisition), net of accumulated depreciation, was
    $17.3 million at December 31, 2007.

M&T Bank also owns a facility in Syracuse, New York with
    approximately 150,000 rentable square feet of space.
    Approximately 43% of this facility is occupied by M&T Bank.
    At December 31, 2007, the cost of this building (including
    improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of accumulated
    depreciation, was $7.9 million.

M&T Bank also owns facilities in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
    and Millsboro, Delaware with approximately 206,000 and
    322,000 rentable square feet of space, respectively.
    M&T Bank occupies approximately 38% and 84% of these
    respective facilities. At December 31, 2007, the cost of
    these buildings



(including improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of
    accumulated depreciation, was $12.8 million and
    $7.7 million, respectively.

No other properties owned by M&T Bank have more than
    100,000 square feet of space. The cost, net of accumulated
    depreciation and amortization, of the Company’s premises
    and equipment is detailed in note 6 of Notes to Financial
    Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8,
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Of the
    705 domestic banking offices of the Registrant’s subsidiary
    banks at December 31, 2007, 293 are owned in fee and 412
    are leased.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings.

In October 2007, Visa completed a reorganization in
    contemplation of its initial public offering (“IPO”)
    expected to occur in 2008. As part of that reorganization,
    M&T Bank and other member banks of Visa received shares of
    common stock of Visa, Inc. Those banks are also obligated under
    various agreements with Visa to share in losses stemming from
    certain litigation (“Covered Litigation”). M&T
    Bank is not a named defendant in any of the Covered Litigation.
    Although Visa is expected to set aside a portion of the proceeds
    from its IPO in an escrow account to fund any judgments or
    settlements that may arise out of the Covered Litigation, recent
    guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) indicates that Visa member banks should record
    a liability for the fair value of the contingent obligation to
    Visa. The estimation of the Company’s proportionate share
    of any potential losses related to the Covered Litigation is
    extremely difficult and involves a great deal of judgment.
    Nevertheless, in the fourth quarter of 2007 the Company recorded
    a pre-tax charge of $23 million ($14 million after tax
    effect) related to the Covered Litigation. In accordance with
    GAAP and consistent with the SEC guidance, the Company did not
    recognize any value for its common stock ownership interest in
    Visa, Inc.

M&T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course
    of business to various pending and threatened legal proceedings
    in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. Management,
    after consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that
    the aggregate ultimate liability arising out of litigation
    pending against M&T or its subsidiaries will be material to
    M&T’s consolidated financial position, but at the
    present time is not in a position to determine whether such
    litigation will have a material adverse effect on
    M&T’s consolidated results of operations in any future
    reporting period.

Item 4.

Submission
    of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

No matters were submitted to a vote of M&T’s security
    holders during the fourth quarter of 2007.

Corporate
    Profile and Significant Developments

M&T Bank Corporation (“M&T”) is a bank
    holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York with
    consolidated assets of $64.9 billion at December 31,
    2007. The consolidated financial information presented herein
    reflects M&T and all of its subsidiaries, which are
    referred to collectively as “the Company.”
    M&T’s wholly owned bank subsidiaries are M&T Bank
    and M&T Bank, National Association (“M&T Bank,
    N.A.”).

M&T Bank, with total assets of $64.1 billion at
    December 31, 2007, is a New York-chartered commercial bank
    with 704 banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania,
    Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Virginia, West Virginia and the
    District of Columbia, and an office in the Cayman Islands.
    M&T Bank and its subsidiaries offer a broad range of
    financial services to a diverse base of consumers, businesses,
    professional clients, governmental entities and financial
    institutions located in its markets. Lending is largely focused
    on consumers residing in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland,
    northern Virginia and Washington, D.C., and on small and
    medium size businesses based in those areas, although
    residential and commercial real estate loans are originated
    through lending offices in 20 other states. Certain lending
    activities are also conducted in other states through various
    subsidiaries. M&T Bank’s subsidiaries include:
    M&T Credit Services, LLC, a consumer lending and commercial
    leasing and lending company; M&T Real Estate Trust, a
    commercial mortgage lender; M&T Realty Capital Corporation,
    a multi-family commercial mortgage lender; M&T Securities,
    Inc., which provides brokerage, investment advisory and
    insurance services; MTB Investment Advisors, Inc., which serves
    as investment advisor to the MTB Group of Funds, a family of
    proprietary mutual funds, and other funds and institutional
    clients; and M&T Insurance Agency, Inc., an insurance
    agency.

M&T Bank, N.A., with total assets of $376 million at
    December 31, 2007, is a national bank with an office in
    Oakfield, New York. M&T Bank, N.A. offers selected deposit
    and loan products on a nationwide basis, largely through
    telephone and direct mail marketing techniques.

On November 30, 2007, M&T acquired Partners
    Trust Financial Group, Inc. (“Partners Trust”), a
    bank holding company headquartered in Utica, New York. Partners
    Trust Bank, the primary banking subsidiary of Partners
    Trust, was merged into M&T Bank on that date. Partners
    Trust Bank operated 33



branch offices in upstate New York at the date of acquisition.
    The results of operations acquired in the Partners Trust
    transaction have been included in the Company’s financial
    results since November 30, 2007, but did not have a
    significant effect on the Company’s results of operations
    in 2007. After application of the election, allocation and
    proration procedures contained in the merger agreement with
    Partners Trust, M&T paid $282 million in cash and
    issued 3,096,861 shares of M&T common stock in
    exchange for Partners Trust shares outstanding at the time of
    acquisition. In addition, based on the merger agreement,
    M&T paid $9 million in cash to holders of outstanding
    and unexercised stock options granted by Partners Trust. The
    purchase price was approximately $559 million based on the
    cash paid to Partners Trust shareholders, the fair value of
    M&T common stock exchanged, and the cash paid to holders of
    Partners Trust stock options. The acquisition of Partners Trust
    expands M&T’s presence in upstate New York, making
    M&T Bank the deposit market share leader in the Utica-Rome
    and Binghamton markets, while strengthening its lead position in
    Syracuse.

Assets acquired from Partners Trust on November 30, 2007
    totaled $3.5 billion, including $2.2 billion of loans
    and leases, (largely residential real estate and consumer
    loans), liabilities assumed aggregated $3.0 billion,
    including $2.2 billion of deposits (largely savings,
    money-market and time deposits), and $277 million was added
    to stockholders’ equity. In connection with the
    acquisition, the Company recorded approximately
    $288 million of goodwill and $50 million of core
    deposit intangible. The core deposit intangible is being
    amortized over 7 years using an accelerated method.

As a condition of the approval of the Partners Trust acquisition
    by regulators, M&T Bank was required to divest three of the
    acquired branch offices in Binghamton, New York having
    approximately $95 million of deposits as of June 30,
    2006. M&T Bank has reached an agreement to sell three
    branches in a transaction expected to close in 2008.

On December 7, 2007, M&T Bank acquired the
    Mid-Atlantic retail banking franchise of First Horizon Bank
    (“First Horizon”), a subsidiary of First Horizon
    National Corporation, in a cash transaction, including
    $214 million of loans, $216 million of deposits and
    $80 million of trust and investment assets under
    management. The transaction did not have a significant effect on
    the Company’s results of operations during 2007. In
    connection with the transaction, the Company recorded
    approximately $15 million of core deposit and other
    intangible assets that are being amortized using accelerated
    methods over a weighted average life of 7 years.

The Company incurred merger-related expenses associated with the
    Partners Trust and First Horizon transactions related to systems
    conversions and other costs of integrating and conforming
    acquired operations with and into the Company of approximately
    $15 million ($9 million net of applicable income
    taxes, or $.08 of diluted earnings per share) during 2007. Those
    expenses consisted largely of professional services and other
    temporary help fees associated with the conversion of systems

and/or

integration of operations; costs related to branch and office
    consolidations; incentive compensation; initial marketing and
    promotion expenses designed to introduce the Company to
    customers of the acquired operations; travel costs; printing,
    postage and supplies; and other costs of commencing operations
    in new offices. The Company expects to incur additional
    merger-related expenses relating to those transactions, although
    such costs are expected to be substantially less than the amount
    incurred in 2007. In accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, (“GAAP”), included in the
    determination of goodwill associated with the Partners Trust
    acquisition were charges totaling $14 million, net of
    applicable income taxes ($18 million before tax effect),
    for severance costs for former Partners Trust employees,
    termination of Partners Trust contracts for various services and
    other items. As of December 31, 2007, the remaining unpaid
    portion of merger-related expenses and charges included in the
    determination of goodwill were $5 million and
    $13 million, respectively. The resolution of Partners
    Trust’s preacquisition contingencies in future periods
    could have an impact on the purchase price and the amount of
    goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition, however,
    management does not presently expect that any such adjustments
    will be material to the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheet.

On February 5, 2007, M&T invested $300 million to
    acquire a minority interest in Bayview Lending Group LLC
    (“BLG”), a privately-held commercial mortgage lender
    that specializes in originating, securitizing and servicing
    small balance commercial real estate loans in the United States,
    and to a significantly lesser extent, in Canada and the United
    Kingdom. M&T recognizes income from BLG using the equity
    method of accounting. M&T’s pro-rata portion of the
    results of operations of BLG was pre-tax



income of $9 million ($5 million after tax effect) in
    2007, which has been recorded as a component of other income in
    the consolidated statement of income. Including expenses
    associated with M&T’s investment in BLG, most notably
    interest expense, that investment reduced the Company’s net
    income in 2007 by $4 million (after tax effect) or $.04 per
    diluted share.

On June 30, 2006, M&T Bank completed the acquisition
    of 21 branch offices in Buffalo and Rochester, New York from
    Citibank, N.A., including approximately $269 million of
    loans, mostly to consumers, small businesses and middle market
    customers, and approximately $1.0 billion of deposits.
    Expenses associated with integrating the acquired branches into
    M&T Bank and introducing the customers associated with
    those branches to M&T Bank’s products and services
    aggregated $3 million, after applicable tax effect, or $.03
    of diluted earnings per share during the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

The Company’s significant accounting policies conform with
    GAAP and are described in note 1 of Notes to Financial
    Statements. In applying those accounting policies, management of
    the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many
    of the methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized.
    Certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent
    on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility
    in the Company’s reported financial performance should the
    assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes
    in circumstances. Some of the more significant areas in which
    management of the Company applies critical assumptions and
    estimates include the following:

•

Allowance for credit losses — The allowance for credit
    losses represents the amount which, in management’s
    judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in
    the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. A
    provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of
    the allowance as deemed necessary by management. In estimating
    losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, assumptions and
    judgment are applied to measure amounts and timing of expected
    future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to
    determine the borrowers’ abilities to repay obligations.
    Historical loss trends are also considered, as are economic
    conditions, industry trends, portfolio trends and
    borrower-specific financial data. Changes in the circumstances
    considered when determining management’s estimates and
    assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and
    assumptions, which may result in adjustment of the allowance. A
    detailed discussion of facts and circumstances considered by
    management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit
    losses is included herein under the heading “Provision for
    Credit Losses.”

•

Valuation methodologies — Management of the Company
    applies various valuation methodologies to assets and
    liabilities which often involve a significant degree of
    judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the
    particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred
    to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as
    trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real
    estate loans held for sale and related commitments. However, for
    those items for which an observable liquid market does not
    exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions
    to value such items. Examples of these items include capitalized
    servicing assets, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible
    assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations,
    value ascribed to stock-based compensation, estimated residual
    values of property associated with commercial and consumer
    leases, and certain derivative and other financial instruments.
    These valuations require the use of various assumptions,
    including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on
    assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of
    servicing and liquidation values. The use of different
    assumptions could produce significantly different results, which
    could have material positive or negative effects on the
    Company’s results of operations. In addition to valuation,
    the Company must assess whether there are any declines in value
    below the carrying value of assets that should be considered
    other than temporary or otherwise require an adjustment in
    carrying value and recognition of a loss in the consolidated
    statement of income. Examples include investment securities,
    other investments, mortgage servicing rights, goodwill, core
    deposit and other intangible assets, among others. Specific
    assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed
    in detail herein in management’s discussion



and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
    and in notes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 17, 18 and 19 of Notes
    to Financial Statements.

•

Commitments, contingencies and off-balance sheet
    arrangements — Information regarding the
    Company’s commitments and contingencies, including
    guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation,
    and their potential effects on the Company’s results of
    operations is included in note 20 of Notes to Financial
    Statements. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to
    examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such
    examinations may result in challenges to the tax return
    treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions.
    Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to
    record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate.
    Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that
    management’s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and
    adjustments required could have a material effect on the
    Company’s results of operations. Information regarding the
    Company’s income taxes is presented in note 12 of
    Notes to Financial Statements. The recognition or de-recognition
    in the Company’s consolidated financial statements of
    assets and liabilities held by so-called variable interest
    entities is subject to the interpretation and application of
    complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that
    require management to estimate and assess the probability of
    financial outcomes in future periods. Information relating to
    the Company’s involvement in such entities and the
    accounting treatment afforded each such involvement is included
    in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Overview

The Company’s net income for 2007 was $654 million or
    $5.95 of diluted earnings per common share, representing
    declines of 22% and 19%, respectively, from $839 million or
    $7.37 of diluted earnings per share in 2006. Basic earnings per
    common share decreased 20% to $6.05 in 2007 from $7.55 in 2006.
    Net income in 2005 aggregated $782 million, while diluted
    and basic earnings per share were $6.73 and $6.88, respectively.
    The after-tax impact of acquisition and integration-related
    expenses (included herein as merger-related expenses) associated
    with the November 30 acquisition of Partners Trust and the
    December 7 transaction with First Horizon was $9 million
    ($15 million pre-tax) or $.08 of basic and diluted earnings
    per share in 2007. Similar costs related to the June 30,
    2006 branch acquisition were $3 million ($5 million
    pre-tax) or $.03 of basic and diluted earnings per share in
    2006. There were no similar expenses in 2005. Net income
    expressed as a rate of return on average assets in 2007 was
    1.12%, compared with 1.50% in 2006 and 1.44% in 2005. The return
    on average common stockholders’ equity was 10.47% in 2007,
    13.89% in 2006 and 13.49% in 2005.

The Company’s financial results for 2007 were adversely
    impacted by several events. Turmoil in the residential real
    estate market, which began in early 2007, significantly affected
    the Company’s financial results in a number of ways.
    Problems experienced by lenders in the

sub-prime

residential mortgage lending market also had negative
    repercussions on the rest of the residential real estate
    marketplace. Through early 2007, the Company had been an active
    participant in the origination of alternative

(“Alt-A”)

residential real estate loans and the sale of such loans in the
    secondary market.

Alt-A

loans
    originated by M&T typically included some form of limited
    documentation requirements as compared with more traditional
    residential real estate loans. Unfavorable market conditions
    during the first quarter of 2007, including a lack of liquidity,
    impacted the Company’s willingness to sell Alt-A loans, as
    an auction of such loans initiated by the Company received fewer
    bids than normal and the pricing of those bids was substantially
    lower than expected. As a result, $883 million of Alt-A
    loans previously held for sale (including $808 million of
    first mortgage loans and $75 million of second mortgage
    loans) were transferred in March to the Company’s

held-for-investment

loan portfolio. In accordance with GAAP, loans held for sale
    must be recorded at the lower of cost or market value.
    Accordingly, prior to reclassifying the Alt-A mortgage loans to
    the

held-for-investment

portfolio, the carrying value of such loans was reduced by
    $12 million ($7 million after tax effect, or $.07 of
    diluted earnings per share). Those loans were reclassified
    because management believed at that time that the value of the
    Alt-A residential real estate loans was greater than the amount
    implied by the few bidders who were active in the market. The
    downturn in the residential real estate market, specifically
    related to declining real estate valuations and higher
    delinquencies, continued throughout the remainder of 2007 and
    had a negative



effect on the majority of financial institutions active in
    residential real estate lending. Margins earned by the Company
    from sales of residential real estate loans in the secondary
    market were lower in 2007 than in 2006.

The Company is contractually obligated to repurchase some
    previously sold residential real estate loans that do not
    ultimately meet investor sale criteria, including instances
    where mortgagors fail to make timely payments during the first
    90 days subsequent to the sale date. Requests from
    investors for the Company to repurchase residential real estate
    loans increased significantly in early 2007, particularly
    related to Alt-A loans. As a result, during 2007’s first
    quarter the Company reduced mortgage banking revenues by
    $6 million ($4 million after tax effect, or $.03 of
    diluted earnings per share) related to declines in market values
    of previously sold residential real estate loans that the
    Company may be required to repurchase.

The Company had $1.2 billion of Alt-A residential real
    estate loans in its

held-for-investment

loan portfolio at December 31, 2007. Lower real estate
    values and higher levels of delinquencies and charge-offs
    contributed to increased losses in that portfolio during 2007,
    which led to an assessment of the Company’s accounting
    practices during the fourth quarter as they relate to the timing
    of the classification of residential real estate loans as
    nonaccrual and when such loans are charged off. Residential real
    estate loans previously classified as nonaccrual when payments
    were 180 days past due now stop accruing interest when
    principal or interest is delinquent 90 days. The excess of
    such loan balances over the net realizable value of the property
    collateralizing the loan is now charged off when the loans
    become 150 days delinquent, whereas previously the Company
    provided an allowance for credit losses for such amounts and
    charged-off loans upon foreclosure of the underlying property.
    The impact of the acceleration of the classification of
    residential real estate loans as nonaccrual resulted in an
    increase in nonperforming loans of $84 million at
    December 31, 2007 and a corresponding decrease in loans
    past due 90 days and accruing interest. As a result of that
    acceleration, previously accrued interest of $2 million was
    reversed and charged against income. Included in the
    $114 million of net charge-offs for 2007 were
    $15 million resulting from the change in accounting
    procedure. The declining residential real estate values also
    contributed to specific allocations of the allowance for credit
    losses related to two residential real estate builders and
    developers during the fourth quarter of 2007. Considering these
    and other factors as discussed herein under the heading
    “Provision for Credit Losses,” the Company
    significantly increased the provision for credit losses in 2007
    to $192 million, compared with $80 million in 2006.

The turmoil in the residential real estate market in 2007 also
    negatively affected the Company’s investment securities
    portfolio. Three collateralized debt obligations were purchased
    in the first quarter of 2007 for approximately
    $132 million. The securities are backed largely by
    residential

mortgage-backed

securities (collateralized by a mix of prime, mid-prime and

sub-prime

residential mortgage loans) and are held in the Company’s

available-for-sale

portfolio. Although these securities were highly rated when
    purchased, two of the three securities were downgraded by the
    rating agencies in late-2007. After a thorough analysis,
    management concluded that the impairment of the market value of
    these securities was other than temporary. As a result, the
    Company recorded an impairment charge of $127 million
    ($78 million after tax effect, or $.71 of diluted earnings
    per share) in the fourth quarter of 2007. The impairment charge
    reduced the Company’s exposure to collateralized debt
    obligations backed by residential mortgage securities to
    approximately $4 million.

Finally, during the last quarter of 2007, Visa completed a
    reorganization in contemplation of its initial public offering
    (“IPO”) expected to occur in 2008. As part of that
    reorganization M&T Bank and other member banks of Visa
    received shares of common stock of Visa, Inc. Those banks are
    also obligated under various agreements with Visa to share in
    losses stemming from certain litigation involving Visa
    (“Covered Litigation”). Although Visa is expected to
    set aside a portion of the proceeds from its IPO in an escrow
    account to fund any judgments or settlements that may arise out
    of the Covered Litigation, recent guidance from the Securities
    and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) indicates that Visa
    member banks should record a liability for the fair value of the
    contingent obligation to Visa. The estimation of the
    Company’s proportionate share of any potential losses
    related to the Covered Litigation is extremely difficult and
    involves a great deal of judgment. Nevertheless, in the fourth
    quarter of 2007 the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of
    $23 million ($14 million after tax effect, or $.13 per
    diluted



share) related to the Covered Litigation. In accordance with
    GAAP and consistent with the SEC guidance, the Company did not
    recognize any value for its common stock ownership interest in
    Visa, Inc.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 2% to
    $1.87 billion in 2007 from $1.84 billion in 2006. The
    impact of higher average earning asset balances was largely
    offset by a decline in the Company’s net interest margin,
    or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as a
    percentage of average earning assets. Average earning assets
    increased 5% to $52.0 billion in 2007 from
    $49.7 billion in 2006 due to higher loan and lease
    balances, partially offset by lower average balances of
    investment securities. Average loans and leases outstanding in
    2007 rose $2.7 billion or 7% to $44.1 billion from
    $41.4 billion in 2006, the result of growth in commercial
    loans and leases of $858 million, or 8%, commercial real
    estate loans of $653 million, or 4%, consumer real estate
    loans of $1.0 billion, or 20%, and consumer loans and
    leases of $186 million, or 2%. The $2.4 billion of
    loans acquired in the Partners Trust and First Horizon
    transactions did not have a significant impact on average loans
    and leases for 2007. The average balance of investment
    securities outstanding declined $717 million, or 9%, to
    $7.3 billion in 2007 from $8.0 billion in 2006 due
    largely to net paydowns and maturities of mortgage-backed
    securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and
    U.S. federal agency securities. The Company’s net
    interest margin narrowed 10 basis points (hundredths of one
    percent) to 3.60% in 2007 from 3.70% in 2006. That narrowing was
    the result of several factors, including higher rates paid on
    deposit accounts and variable-rate borrowings that were only
    partially offset by higher yields earned on loans and investment
    securities.

Net interest income expressed on a taxable-equivalent basis in
    2006 was 1% higher than $1.81 billion in 2005. The positive
    impact of higher average earning assets was largely offset by a
    decline in net interest margin. Average earning assets rose 3%
    to $49.7 billion in 2006 from $48.1 billion in 2005,
    the result of increased balances of loans and leases, offset, in
    part, by a decline in average outstanding balances of investment
    securities. Average loans and leases of $41.4 billion in
    2006 were $1.9 billion or 5% higher than $39.5 billion
    in 2005, due to growth in commercial loans and leases of
    $863 million, or 8%, commercial real estate loans of
    $755 million, or 5%, and consumer real estate loans of
    $1.1 billion, or 28%, partially offset by an
    $804 million, or 7%, decline in consumer loans and leases.
    Average balances of investment securities decreased 5% to
    $8.0 billion in 2006 from $8.5 billion in 2005. The
    net interest margin declined 7 basis points to 3.70% in
    2006 from 3.77% in 2005, largely due to higher short-term
    interest rates resulting from the Federal Reserve raising its
    benchmark overnight federal funds target rate 100 basis
    points during the first six months of 2006, continuing a trend
    of rate increases that began in June 2004. Such interest rate
    increases had the effect of increasing rates paid on
    interest-bearing liabilities more rapidly than yields on earning
    assets during 2005 and the first half of 2006.

The provision for credit losses rose to $192 million in
    2007 from $80 million in 2006 and $88 million in 2005.
    Deteriorating credit conditions that were reflected in rising
    levels of charge-offs and delinquencies as well as rapidly
    declining residential real estate valuations during 2007 and
    their impact on the Company’s portfolio of Alt-A
    residential mortgage loans and loans to residential builders and
    developers contributed significantly to the increase in the
    provision from 2006 to 2007. The levels of the provision during
    2006 and 2005 were reflective of generally favorable credit
    quality during those years. Net charge-offs were
    $114 million in 2007, up from $68 million in 2006 and
    $77 million in 2005. Net charge-offs as a percentage of
    average loans and leases outstanding rose to .26% in 2007 from
    .16% in 2006 and .19% in 2005. The provision in each year
    represents the result of management’s analysis of the
    composition of the loan and lease portfolio and other factors,
    including concern regarding uncertainty about economic
    conditions, both nationally and in many of the markets served by
    the Company, and the impact of such conditions and prospects on
    the abilities of borrowers to repay loans.

Noninterest income declined 11% to $933 million in 2007
    from $1.05 billion in 2006. That decline resulted from the
    $127 million

other-than-temporary

impairment charge in 2007 related to collateralized debt
    obligations held in the Company’s

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio. The market value of those
    collateralized debt obligations, which are backed by residential
    mortgage-backed securities, declined sharply as a result of the
    residential real estate market crisis in 2007. That charge is
    reflected in losses from bank investment securities in the
    consolidated statement of income. Excluding the impairment
    charge, noninterest income was $1.06 billion in 2007, 1%
    higher than in 2006. Higher service charges on deposit accounts,
    trust income, and trading account and foreign exchange gains,
    and



$9 million related to M&T’s pro-rata portion of
    the operating results of BLG were largely offset by a
    $31 million decline in mortgage banking revenues.
    Contributing to the decline in mortgage banking revenues were
    changing market conditions, which led to slimmer margins
    realized on sales of residential real estate loans. In addition,
    the Company recognized $18 million of losses in the first
    quarter related to its Alt-A loan portfolio due to declines in
    the market values of such loans. Included in noninterest income
    in 2006 was a $13 million gain resulting from the
    accelerated recognition of a purchase accounting premium related
    to the call of a $200 million Federal Home Loan Bank
    (“FHLB”) of Atlanta borrowing assumed in a previous
    acquisition.

Noninterest income in 2006 increased 10% from $950 million
    in 2005. In addition to the $13 million gain noted above,
    higher mortgage banking revenues, service charges on deposit
    accounts, trust income, brokerage services income, and other
    revenues contributed to that improvement. Furthermore, losses
    from bank investment securities in 2005 included a
    $29 million

other-than-temporary

impairment charge related to preferred stock issuances of the
    Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) and the
    Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”).
    Excluding the impact of securities gains and losses in both
    years and the $13 million gain on the called borrowing in
    2006, noninterest income rose 5% from 2005 to 2006.

Noninterest expense in 2007 aggregated $1.63 billion, up 5%
    from $1.55 billion in 2006. Noninterest expense in 2005 was
    $1.49 billion. Included in such amounts are expenses
    considered by M&T to be “nonoperating” in nature,
    consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible
    assets of $66 million, $63 million and
    $57 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and
    merger- related expenses of $15 million in 2007 and
    $5 million in 2006. There were no merger-related expenses
    in 2005. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest
    operating expenses aggregated $1.55 billion in 2007,
    $1.48 billion in 2006 and $1.43 billion in 2005.
    Noninterest operating expenses in 2007 included a
    $23 million charge representing the Company’s
    estimated liability related to litigation involving Visa as
    already discussed. Included in operating expenses in 2006 was an
    $18 million tax-deductible contribution made to The
    M&T Charitable Foundation, a tax-exempt private charitable
    foundation. There were no similar contributions made in 2007 or
    in 2005. Excluding the impact of the Visa charge in 2007 and the
    charitable contribution in 2006, operating expenses in 2007 were
    up 4% from 2006, largely due to a higher level of salaries and
    employee benefits expense reflecting the impact of merit pay
    increases, increased incentive compensation and higher costs for
    providing medical benefits to employees. Excluding the impact of
    the charitable contribution, operating expenses in 2006
    increased $37 million, or 3%, from 2005. The most
    significant contributor to that increase was a higher level of
    salaries expense, reflecting the impact of merit pay increases
    and higher stock-based compensation costs and other incentive
    pay.

The efficiency ratio expresses the relationship of operating
    expenses to revenues. The Company’s efficiency ratio, or
    noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of
    taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income
    (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities),
    was 52.8% in 2007, compared with 51.5% in 2006 and 51.2% in 2005.

Interest income data are on a

    represents additional income taxes that would be due if all
    interest income were subject to income taxes. This adjustment,
    which is related to interest received on qualified municipal
    securities, industrial revenue financings and preferred equity
    securities, is based on a composite income tax rate of
    approximately 39% for 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004, and 36% for

Supplemental
    Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations

As a result of business combinations and other acquisitions, the
    Company had intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core
    deposit and other intangible assets totaling $3.4 billion
    at December 31, 2007, $3.2 billion at
    December 31, 2006 and $3.0 billion at
    December 31, 2005. Included in such intangible assets was
    goodwill of $3.2 billion at December 31, 2007 and
    $2.9 billion at each of December 31, 2006 and 2005.
    Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after
    tax effect, totaled $40 million, $38 million and
    $35 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

M&T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its
    results on a “net operating” or “tangible”
    basis, in which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of
    amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and
    the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other
    intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax
    amounts, when calculating certain performance ratios) and
    expenses associated with integrating acquired operations into
    the Company, since such expenses are considered by management to
    be “nonoperating” in nature. Although “net
    operating income” as defined by M&T is not a GAAP
    measure, M&T’s management believes that this
    information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition
    activity in reported results.

Net operating income totaled $704 million in 2007, compared
    with $881 million in 2006. Diluted net operating earnings
    per share in 2007 declined 17% to $6.40 from $7.73 in 2006. Net
    operating income and diluted net operating earnings per share
    were $817 million and $7.03, respectively, during 2005.

Reconciliations of net income and diluted earnings per share
    with net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per
    share are presented in table 2.

Net operating income expressed as a rate of return on average
    tangible assets was 1.27% in 2007, compared with 1.67% in 2006
    and 1.60% in 2005. Net operating return on average tangible
    common equity was 22.58% in 2007, compared with 29.55% and
    29.06% in 2006 and 2005, respectively.



Reconciliations of average assets and equity with average
    tangible assets and average tangible equity are also presented

Net
    Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities

Net interest income expressed on a taxable-equivalent basis
    increased 2% to $1.87 billion in 2007 from
    $1.84 billion in 2006, largely the result of growth in
    average earning assets. Such assets aggregated
    $52.0 billion in 2007, 5% higher than $49.7 billion in
    2006. Growth in average loan and lease balances outstanding,
    which rose 7% to $44.1 billion in 2007 from
    $41.4 billion in 2006, was the leading factor in that
    improvement, partially offset by a decline of $717 million,
    or 9%, in average balances of investment securities. A lower net
    interest margin, which declined to 3.60% in 2007 from 3.70% in
    2006, partially offset the positive impact on taxable-equivalent
    net interest income resulting from growth in average earning
    assets.

The Company experienced growth in all major loan categories in
    2007, particularly during the second half of the year. Average
    commercial loans and leases increased 8% to $12.2 billion
    in 2007 from $11.3 billion in 2006. Commercial real estate
    loans averaged $15.7 billion in 2007, up 4% from
    $15.1 billion in 2006, due, in part, to higher average
    balances of construction loans. Average residential real estate
    loans rose 20% in 2007 to $6.0 billion from
    $5.0 billion in 2006. In March 2007, the Company
    transferred $883 million of Alt-A residential real estate
    loans from the Company’s

held-for-sale

loan portfolio to its

held-for-investment

portfolio. Residential real estate loans held for sale averaged
    $1.1 billion in 2007 and $1.5 billion during 2006.
    Consumer loans and leases averaged $10.2 billion in 2007,
    up 2% from $10.0 billion in 2006, due in part to growth in
    the automobile loan portfolio. Annualized growth experienced
    during 2007’s fourth quarter as compared with the third
    quarter of 2007 for average commercial loans and leases,
    commercial real estate loans, residential real estate loans and
    consumer loans and leases were 8%, 22%, 6% and 14%,
    respectively, excluding the impact of the fourth quarter
    acquisition transactions.

Reflecting growth in average earning assets that was largely
    offset by a narrowing of the net interest margin,
    taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 1% to
    $1.84 billion in 2006 from $1.81 billion in 2005.
    Average earning assets increased 3% to $49.7 billion in
    2006 from $48.1 billion in 2005. That growth resulted from
    a 5% increase in average outstanding balances of loans and
    leases of $1.9 billion, offset in part by a 5% decline in
    average outstanding balances of investment securities of
    $441 million. The positive impact of higher average earning
    assets on taxable-equivalent net interest income was largely
    offset by a narrowing of the Company’s net interest margin,
    which declined to 3.70% in 2006 from 3.77% in 2005.

Average loans and leases outstanding aggregated
    $41.4 billion in 2006, up 5% from $39.5 billion in
    2005. The higher average outstanding loan balances were the
    result of growth in commercial loans and leases, commercial real
    estate loans and residential real estate loans. Average
    commercial loans and leases rose 8% to $11.3 billion in
    2006 from $10.5 billion in 2005. Commercial real estate
    loans averaged $15.1 billion during 2006, 5% higher than
    $14.3 billion in 2005, reflecting a $336 million rise
    in construction loans to developers of residential real estate
    properties. The Company’s residential real estate loan
    portfolio averaged $5.0 billion in 2006, up 28% from
    $3.9 billion in 2005. Included in that portfolio were loans
    held for sale, which averaged $1.5 billion in 2006, 19%
    above the $1.2 billion averaged in 2005. Excluding such
    loans, average residential real estate loans increased
    $861 million from 2005 to 2006. That increase was largely
    the result of the Company’s decision to retain higher
    levels of residential real estate loans having certain
    characteristics, due to narrowing margins available in the
    marketplace when selling such loans and the lack of availability
    of investment securities to acquire that met the Company’s
    desired characteristics and provided suitable returns. Consumer
    loans and leases averaged $10.0 billion in 2006, down 7%
    from $10.8 billion in 2005. That decline was the result of
    lower average balances of automobile loans and leases, which
    decreased 22% to $2.9 billion in 2006 from
    $3.7 billion in 2005, reflecting the Company’s
    decision to allow such balances to decline rather than matching
    interest rates offered by competitors. During late 2006, the
    interest rate environment relating to the Company’s
    automobile lending business improved and from September 30 to
    December 31, outstanding balances of such loans increased
    slightly.

Commercial loans and leases, excluding loans secured by real
    estate, aggregated $13.1 billion at December 31, 2007,
    representing 27% of total loans and leases. Approximately
    $259 million of commercial loans were obtained in the
    December 2007 acquisition transactions. Table 5 presents
    information on commercial loans and leases as of
    December 31, 2007 relating to geographic area, size, and
    whether the loans are secured by collateral or unsecured. Of the
    $13.1 billion of commercial loans and leases outstanding at
    the end of 2007, approximately $10.4 billion, or 80%, were
    secured, while 51%, 23% and 12% were granted to businesses in
    New York State, Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively. The
    Company provides financing for leases to commercial customers,
    primarily for equipment. Commercial leases included in total
    commercial loans and leases at December 31, 2007 aggregated
    $1.4 billion, of which 47% were secured by collateral
    located in New York State, 13% were secured by collateral in
    Maryland and another 11% were secured by collateral in
    Pennsylvania.

International loans included in commercial loans and leases
    totaled $107 million and $176 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company
    participates in the insurance and guarantee programs of the
    Export-Import Bank of the United States. These programs provide
    U.S. government repayment coverage of 90% to 100% on loans
    supporting foreign borrowers’ purchases of U.S. goods
    and services. The loans generally range from $1 million to
    $10 million. The outstanding balances of loans under these
    programs at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were
    $95 million and $143 million, respectively.

Loans secured by real estate, including outstanding balances of
    home equity loans and lines of credit which the Company
    classifies as consumer loans, represented approximately 61% of
    the loan and lease portfolio during 2007, compared with 62% in
    2006 and 60% in 2005. At December 31, 2007, the Company
    held approximately $17.4 billion of commercial real estate
    loans, $6.2 billion of consumer real estate loans secured
    by

one-to-four

family residential properties (including $774 million of
    loans held for sale) and $5.5 billion of outstanding
    balances of home equity loans and lines of credit, compared with
    $15.4 billion, $6.0 billion and $5.4 billion,
    respectively, at December 31, 2006. Loans obtained in the
    December 2007 acquisition transactions included
    $343 million of commercial real estate loans,
    $1.1 billion of consumer real estate loans secured by

one-to-four

family residential mortgages and $269 million of
    outstanding home equity loans and lines of credit.

A significant portion of commercial real estate loans originated
    by the Company are secured by properties in the New York City
    metropolitan area, including areas in neighboring states
    generally considered to be within commuting distance of New York
    City, and other areas of New York State where the Company
    operates. Commercial real estate loans are also originated
    through the Company’s offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland,
    Virginia, Washington, D.C., Oregon, West Virginia and other
    states. Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company
    include fixed-rate instruments with monthly payments and a
    balloon payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity,
    in many cases five years after origination. For borrowers in
    good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the
    customer for an additional five years at the then current market
    rate of interest. The Company also originates fixed-rate
    commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater than
    five years, generally having original maturity terms of
    approximately ten years, and adjustable-rate commercial real
    estate loans. Excluding construction loans, adjustable-rate
    commercial real estate loans represented approximately 49% of
    the commercial real estate loan portfolio as of
    December 31, 2007. Table 6 presents commercial real estate
    loans by geographic area, type of collateral and size of the
    loans outstanding at December 31, 2007. Of the
    $6.0 billion of commercial real estate loans in the New
    York City metropolitan area, approximately 28% were secured by
    multifamily residential properties, 44% by retail space and 9%
    by office space. The Company’s experience has been that
    office space and retail properties tend to demonstrate more
    volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and
    changing economic conditions than do multifamily residential
    properties. Approximately 57% of the aggregate dollar amount of
    New York City-area loans were for loans with outstanding
    balances of $10 million or less, while loans of more than
    $15 million made up approximately 34% of the total.

Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located in
    other parts of New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and other
    areas tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and
    include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the
    mortgaged property in their trade or business. Approximately 70%
    of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial real estate loans
    in New York State secured by properties located outside of the
    metropolitan New York City area were for loans with outstanding
    balances of $5 million or less. Of the outstanding balances
    of commercial real estate loans in Pennsylvania and Maryland,
    approximately 72% and 51%, respectively, were for loans with
    outstanding balances of $5 million or less.

Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located
    outside of Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York State and areas of
    states neighboring New York considered to be part of the New
    York City metropolitan area, comprised 15% of total commercial
    real estate loans as of December 31, 2007.

Commercial real estate construction loans presented in table 6
    totaled $3.0 billion at December 31, 2007, or 6% of
    total loans and leases. Approximately 94% of those construction
    loans had adjustable interest rates. Included in such loans at
    December 31, 2007 were $1.5 billion of loans to
    developers of residential real estate properties. The remainder
    of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio was
    comprised of loans made for various purposes, including the
    construction of office buildings, multi-family residential
    housing, retail space and other commercial development.

M&T Realty Capital Corporation, one of the Company’s
    commercial real estate lending subsidiaries, participates in the
    FNMA Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (“DUS”)
    program, pursuant to which commercial real estate loans are
    originated in accordance with terms and conditions specified by
    FNMA and sold. Under this program, loans are sold with partial
    credit recourse to M&T Realty Capital Corporation. The
    amount of recourse is generally limited to one-third of any
    credit loss incurred by the purchaser on an individual loan,
    although in some cases the recourse amount is less than
    one-third of the outstanding principal balance. At
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately $1.0 billion
    and $939 million, respectively, of commercial real estate
    loan balances serviced for others had been sold with recourse.
    There have been no material losses incurred as a result of those
    recourse arrangements. Commercial real estate loans held for
    sale at December 31, 2007 and 2006 aggregated
    $79 million and $49 million, respectively. At
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, commercial real estate loans
    serviced for other investors by the Company were
    $5.3 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively. Those
    serviced loans are not included in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet.

Real estate loans secured by

one-to-four

family residential properties were $6.2 billion at
    December 31, 2007, including approximately 33% secured by
    properties located in New York State, 14% secured by properties
    located in Pennsylvania and 10% secured by properties located in
    Maryland. At December 31, 2007, $774 million of
    residential real estate loans were held for sale, compared with
    $1.9 billion at December 31, 2006. That decline in
    residential real estate loans held for sale resulted largely
    from the Company’s decision during 2007 to not actively
    participate in the Alt-A market. As already discussed, in March
    2007 the Company transferred $883 million of Alt-A loans
    secured by residential real estate properties from its

held-for-sale

portfolio to its

held-for-investment

loan portfolio. The Company’s portfolio of Alt-A loans held
    for investment at December 31, 2007 totaled
    $1.2 billion, compared with $584 million and
    $75 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Loans to individuals to finance the construction
    of

one-to-four

family residential properties totaled $417 million at
    December 31, 2007, or approximately 1% of total loans and
    leases, compared with $693 million or 2% at
    December 31, 2006.

Consumer loans and leases comprised approximately 23% of the
    average loan portfolio during 2007, down from 24% in 2006 and
    27% in 2005. The two largest components of the consumer loan
    portfolio are outstanding balances of home equity lines of
    credit and automobile loans and leases. Average balances of home
    equity lines of credit outstanding represented approximately 9%
    of average loans outstanding in 2007 and 10% in 2006. Automobile
    loans and leases represented approximately 7% of the
    Company’s average loan portfolio during each of 2007 and
    2006. No other consumer loan product represented more than 4% of
    average loans outstanding in 2007. Approximately 53% of home
    equity lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2007
    were secured by properties in New York State, and 20% and 21%
    were secured by properties in Pennsylvania and Maryland,
    respectively. Average outstanding balances on home equity lines
    of credit were approximately $4.2 billion in each of 2007
    and 2006. At December 31, 2007, 34% and 24% of the
    automobile loan and lease portfolio were to customers residing



in New York State and Pennsylvania, respectively. Although
    automobile loans and leases have generally been originated
    through dealers, all applications submitted through dealers are
    subject to the Company’s normal underwriting and loan
    approval procedures. From mid-2004 until late 2006, the Company
    experienced a general slowdown in its automobile loan
    origination business, resulting from increased competition from
    other lenders, including financing incentives offered by
    automobile manufacturers. Throughout that period, the Company
    chose not to match the pricing being offered by many
    competitors. Since late 2006, the pricing as it relates to those
    loans improved such that the Company began actively originating
    automobile loans, which resulted in outstanding balances in this
    portfolio increasing to $3.8 billion at December 31,
    2007 from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2006.

The Company ceased origination of automobile leases during 2003.
    Automobile leases outstanding averaged approximately
    $15 million in 2007, compared with $53 million in 2006
    and $137 million in 2005. At December 31, 2007 and
    2006, outstanding automobile leases totaled $5 million and
    $29 million, respectively.

Table 7 presents the composition of the Company’s loan and
    lease portfolio at the end of 2007, including outstanding
    balances to businesses and consumers in New York State,
    Pennsylvania, Maryland and other states. Approximately 49% of
    total loans and leases at December 31, 2007 were to New
    York State customers, while 19% and 12% were to Pennsylvania and
    Maryland customers, respectively.

Balances of investment securities averaged $7.3 billion in
    2007, compared with $8.0 billion and $8.5 billion in
    2006 and 2005, respectively. The declines in such securities
    during 2007 and 2006 largely reflect net paydowns and maturities
    of mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage
    obligations



and U.S. federal agency securities. Until the second half
    of 2007, the Company had allowed the investment securities
    portfolio to decline as the opportunity to purchase securities
    at favorable spreads, that is, the difference between the yield
    earned on a security and the rate paid on funds used to purchase
    it, had been limited. During the third quarter of 2007, spreads
    on residential mortgage-backed securities became more favorable
    and the Company purchased approximately $800 million of
    collateralized mortgage obligations and other mortgage-backed
    securities. The investment securities portfolio is largely
    comprised of residential and commercial mortgage-backed
    securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, debt
    securities issued by municipalities, debt and preferred equity
    securities issued by government-sponsored agencies and certain
    financial institutions, and shorter-term U.S. Treasury and
    federal agency notes. When purchasing investment securities, the
    Company considers its overall interest-rate risk profile as well
    as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed,
    including prepayments. In managing its investment securities
    portfolio, the Company occasionally sells investment securities
    as a result of changes in interest rates or spreads, actual or
    anticipated prepayments, credit risk associated with a
    particular security, or as a result of restructuring its
    investment securities portfolio following completion of a
    business combination. During December 2007, the Company
    securitized approximately $950 million of residential real
    estate loans obtained in the Partners Trust acquisition in a
    guaranteed mortgage securitization with FNMA. The Company
    recognized no gain or loss on the transaction as it retained all
    of the resulting securities, which are held in the

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio. As previously discussed, during
    the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recognized

other-than-temporary

impairment charges of $127 million related to
    collateralized debt obligations. The remaining balance of
    collateralized debt obligations backed by residential mortgage
    loans was $4 million at the 2007 year-end. During 2005
    the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge
    of $29 million related to its holdings of preferred stock
    of FNMA and FHLMC. The Company regularly reviews its investment
    securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might
    be characterized as “other than temporary.” As of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company concluded that the
    remaining declines were temporary in nature. Further discussion
    of that decision is included herein under the heading
    “Capital.” Additional information about the investment
    securities portfolio is included in note 3 of Notes to
    Financial Statements.

Other earning assets include deposits at banks, trading account
    assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities.
    Those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged
    $503 million in 2007, $183 million in 2006 and
    $113 million in 2005. Reflected in those balances were
    purchases of investment securities under agreements to resell
    which averaged $417 million and $50 million during
    2007 and 2006, respectively. The average balance in 2005 was
    insignificant. The higher level of resell agreements in 2007 as
    compared with 2006 was due, in part, to the need to
    collateralize deposits of municipalities. There were no
    outstanding resell agreements at December 31, 2007. The
    amounts of investment securities and other earning assets held
    by the Company are influenced by such factors as demand for
    loans, which generally yield more than investment securities and
    other earning assets, ongoing repayments, the levels of
    deposits, and management of balance sheet size and resulting
    capital ratios.

The most significant source of funding for the Company is core
    deposits, which are comprised of noninterest-bearing deposits,
    interest-bearing transaction accounts, nonbrokered savings
    deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under $100,000.
    The Company’s branch network is its principal source of
    core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than
    wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Certificates of
    deposit under $100,000 generated on a nationwide basis by
    M&T Bank, N.A. are also included in core deposits. Core
    deposits averaged $28.6 billion in 2007, $28.3 billion
    in 2006 and $27.9 billion in 2005. The Partners Trust and
    First Horizon acquisition transactions in late-2007 added
    $2.0 billion of core deposits on the respective acquisition
    dates, however, the Company’s average core deposits in 2007
    only increased $156 million from those transactions. The
    previously discussed June 30, 2006 branch acquisition added
    approximately $880 million to average core deposits during
    the second half of 2006, or approximately $443 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006. The rise in average
    balances of time deposits less than $100,000 in 2006 as compared
    with 2005 was partially due to customer response to higher
    interest rates offered on those products, resulting in a shift
    of funds from savings and noninterest-bearing deposit accounts
    to time deposits. Average core deposits of M&T Bank, N.A.
    were $208 million in 2007, $387 million in 2006 and
    $216 million in 2005. Funding provided by



core deposits represented 55% of average earning assets in 2007,
    compared with 57% in 2006 and 58% in 2005. Table 8 summarizes
    average core deposits in 2007 and percentage changes in the
    components of such deposits over the past two years.

Additional sources of funding for the Company include domestic
    time deposits of $100,000 or more, deposits originated through
    the Company’s offshore branch office, and brokered
    deposits. Domestic time deposits over $100,000, excluding
    brokered certificates of deposit, averaged $2.7 billion in
    2007, $2.9 billion in 2006 and $1.8 billion in 2005.
    Offshore branch deposits, primarily comprised of accounts with
    balances of $100,000 or more, averaged $4.2 billion in
    2007, $3.6 billion in 2006 and $3.8 billion in 2005.
    Average brokered time deposits totaled $2.1 billion in
    2007, compared with $3.5 billion in 2006 and
    $2.7 billion in 2005, and at December 31, 2007 and
    2006 totaled $1.8 billion and $2.7 billion,
    respectively. In connection with the Company’s management
    of interest rate risk, interest rate swap agreements have been
    entered into under which the Company receives a fixed rate of
    interest and pays a variable rate and that have notional amounts
    and terms substantially similar to the amounts and terms of
    $205 million of brokered time deposits. The Company also
    had brokered money-market deposit accounts, which averaged
    $87 million, $69 million and $62 million in 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Offshore branch deposits and
    brokered deposits have been used by the Company as an
    alternative to short-term borrowings. Additional amounts of
    offshore branch deposits or brokered deposits may be solicited
    in the future depending on market conditions, including demand
    by customers and other investors for those deposits, and the
    cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time.

The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers,
    various FHLBs, and others as sources of funding. The average
    balance of short-term borrowings was $5.4 billion in 2007,
    $4.5 billion in 2006 and $4.9 billion in 2005.
    Included in short-term borrowings were unsecured federal funds
    borrowings, which generally mature daily, that averaged
    $4.6 billion, $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion in
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Overnight federal funds
    borrowings represent the largest component of short-term
    borrowings and are obtained from a wide variety of banks and
    other financial institutions. Also included in short-term
    borrowings is a $500 million revolving asset-backed
    structured borrowing secured by automobile loans that were
    transferred to M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC, a special
    purpose subsidiary of M&T Bank, all of which was in use at
    the 2007, 2006 and 2005 year-ends. The subsidiary, the
    loans and the borrowings are included in the consolidated
    financial statements of the Company. The average balance of this
    borrowing was $437 million in 2007 and $500 million in
    each of 2006 and 2005. Additional information about M&T
    Auto Receivables I, LLC and the revolving borrowing
    agreement is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial
    Statements. Average short-term borrowings during 2007 included
    $160 million of borrowings from the FHLB of New York. There
    were no similar short-term borrowings in 2005 or 2006.

Long-term borrowings averaged $8.4 billion in 2007,
    $6.0 billion in 2006 and $6.4 billion in 2005.
    Included in average long-term borrowings were amounts borrowed
    from the FHLBs of $4.3 billion in 2007 and
    $3.8 billion in each of 2006 and 2005, and subordinated
    capital notes of $1.6 billion in 2007, $1.2 billion in
    2006 and $1.3 billion in 2005. M&T Bank issued
    $400 million and $500 million of subordinated notes in
    December 2007 and 2006, respectively, in part to maintain
    appropriate regulatory



capital ratios. The notes issued in December 2007 bear a fixed
    rate of interest of 6.625% and mature in December 2017. The 2006
    notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.629% until December
    2016 and a floating rate thereafter until maturity in December
    2021, at a rate equal to the three-month London Interbank
    Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus .64%. Beginning December
    2016, M&T Bank may, at its option and subject to prior
    regulatory approval, redeem some or all of those notes on any
    interest payment date. The Company has utilized interest rate
    swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of
    certain components of long-term debt. Those swap agreements are
    used to hedge approximately $637 million of fixed rate
    subordinated notes and $1.5 billion of long-term
    variable-rate FHLB borrowings. Further information on interest
    rate swap agreements is provided in note 17 of Notes to
    Financial Statements. Junior subordinated debentures associated
    with trust preferred securities that were included in average
    long-term borrowings were $716 million, $712 million
    and $711 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures,
    as well as information regarding contractual maturities of
    long-term borrowings, is provided in note 9 of Notes to
    Financial Statements. Also included in long-term borrowings were
    agreements to repurchase securities, which averaged
    $1.6 billion, $258 million and $549 million
    during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The agreements, which
    were entered into due to favorable rates available, have various
    repurchase dates through 2017, however, the contractual
    maturities of the underlying securities extend beyond such
    repurchase dates. Long-term borrowings include $300 million
    of senior notes issued by M&T in May 2007, which averaged
    $182 million during 2007. Those notes bear a fixed rate of
    interest of 5.375% and mature in May 2012.

Changes in the composition of the Company’s earning assets
    and interest-bearing liabilities as described herein, as well as
    changes in interest rates and spreads, can impact net interest
    income. Net interest spread, or the difference between the yield
    on earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing
    liabilities, declined 9 basis points from 3.10% in 2006 to
    3.01% in 2007. The yield on earning assets during 2007 was
    6.86%, 15 basis points higher than 6.71% in 2006, while the
    rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased
    24 basis points to 3.85% from 3.61% in 2006. The yield on
    the Company’s earning assets rose 88 basis points in
    2006 from 5.83% in 2005, while the rate paid on interest-bearing
    liabilities in 2006 was up 110 basis points from 2.51% in
    2005. As a result, the Company’s net interest spread
    decreased from 3.32% in 2005 to 3.10% in 2006. During the period
    from February 2005 until June 29, 2006, the Federal Reserve
    raised its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate twelve
    times, each increase representing a 25 basis point
    increment over the previously effective target rate.
    Specifically, during 2005, eight increases were initiated, while
    during the first half of 2006, four increases were initiated.
    Those rate increases resulted in the rates the Company paid on
    interest-bearing liabilities, most notably short-term
    borrowings, rising more rapidly than the yields on earning
    assets during 2005 and 2006. In September 2007, the Federal
    Reserve began lowering its federal funds target rate, first by
    50 basis points, then two more times during the fourth
    quarter by 25 basis points. As a result, the rate of
    increase from 2006 to 2007 for interest rates earned and paid by
    the Company slowed, and during the final quarter of 2007, those
    rates actually declined as compared with that year’s third
    quarter. Contributing to the decline in net interest spread from
    2006 to 2007 was the impact of funding the $300 million BLG
    investment in February 2007 as well as higher rates paid on
    deposits and variable-rate borrowings that were only partially
    offset by higher yields on loans and investment securities.

Net interest-free funds consist largely of noninterest-bearing
    demand deposits and stockholders’ equity, partially offset
    by bank owned life insurance and non-earning assets, including
    goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets and, in 2007,
    M&T’s investment in BLG. Net interest-free funds
    averaged $7.9 billion in 2007, compared with
    $8.2 billion in 2006 and $8.6 billion in 2005.
    Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged
    $3.2 billion in 2007, $3.1 billion in 2006, and
    $3.0 billion in 2005. The cash surrender value of bank
    owned life insurance averaged $1.1 billion in each of 2007
    and 2006 and $1.0 billion in 2005. Increases in the cash
    surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in
    interest income, but rather are recorded in “other revenues
    from operations.” The contribution of net interest-free
    funds to net interest margin was .59% in 2007, .60% in 2006 and
    .45% in 2005. The impact of slightly higher rates on
    interest-bearing liabilities during 2007 as compared with 2006,
    which are used to value such contribution, was offset by the
    effect of a lower balance of interest-free funds. The rise in
    the contribution to net interest margin ascribed to net
    interest-free funds in 2006 as



compared with 2005 resulted largely from the impact of
    significantly higher interest rates on interest-bearing
    liabilities used to value such contribution.

Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the
    contribution of interest-free funds as described herein, the
    Company’s net interest margin was 3.60% in 2007, compared
    with 3.70% in 2006 and 3.77% in 2005. Future changes in market
    interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition
    of the Company’s portfolios of earning assets and
    interest-bearing liabilities that result in reductions in
    spreads, could adversely impact the Company’s net interest
    income and net interest margin.

Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in
    interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income
    under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate
    risk, the Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to
    modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its
    portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
    Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are
    generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or the
    rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The notional amount
    of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate
    risk management purposes was $2.3 billion at
    December 31, 2007. Under the terms of $842 million of
    these swap agreements that are designated as fair value hedges,
    the Company receives payments based on the outstanding notional
    amount of the swaps at fixed rates and makes payments at
    variable rates. Under the terms of the remaining
    $1.5 billion of swap agreements outstanding at the
    2007 year-end that are designated as cash flow hedges, the
    Company pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable
    rate. In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative
    (the interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value
    of the hedged item are recorded in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss
    recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes
    in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the
    hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in
    “other revenues from operations” in the Company’s
    consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, unlike
    in a fair value hedge, the effective portion of the
    derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a
    component of other comprehensive income and subsequently
    reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction
    affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is
    reported in “other revenues from operations”
    immediately. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in
    2007, 2006 and 2005 were not material to the Company’s
    results of operations. The estimated aggregate fair value of
    interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges
    represented a gain of approximately $17 million at
    December 31, 2007 and a loss of approximately
    $15 million at December 31, 2006. The fair values of
    such swap agreements were substantially offset by changes in the
    fair values of the hedged items. The estimated fair values of
    the interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges
    were losses of approximately $17 million at
    December 31, 2007. Net of applicable income taxes, such
    losses were approximately $10 million and have been
    included in “accumulated other comprehensive income,
    net” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.
    There were no swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges at
    December 31, 2006. The changes in the fair values of the
    interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items result from
    the effects of changing interest rates. Additional information
    about those swap agreements and the items being hedged is
    included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. The
    average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements
    entered into for interest rate risk management purposes, the
    related effect on net interest income and margin, and the
    weighted-average interest rates paid or received on those swap
    agreements are presented in table 9.

Provision
    for Credit Losses

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in
    management’s judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent
    in the loan and lease portfolio. A provision for credit losses
    is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed
    necessary by management. The provision for credit losses was
    $192 million in 2007, up from $80 million in 2006 and
    $88 million in 2005. Net loan charge-offs increased to
    $114 million in 2007 from $68 million and
    $77 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net loan
    charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were
    .26% in 2007, compared with .16% in 2006 and .19% in 2005. The
    significant increase in the provision for credit losses in 2007
    as compared with the two preceding years was due, in part, to a
    pronounced downturn in the residential real estate market.
    Declining real estate valuations and higher levels of
    delinquencies and charge-offs throughout 2007 significantly
    affected the quality of the Company’s residential real
    estate loan portfolio. Specifically, the Company’s Alt-A
    residential real estate loan portfolio and its residential real
    estate builder and developer loan portfolio experienced the
    majority of the credit problems related to the turmoil in the
    residential real estate marketplace. In response to the
    deteriorating quality of the Alt-A portfolio, the Company
    decided in 2007’s fourth quarter to accelerate the timing
    related to when residential real estate loans are charged off.
    The excess of such loan balances over the net realizable value
    of the property collateralizing the loan is now charged off when
    the loan becomes past due 150 days, whereas the
    Company’s past practice had been to provide an allowance
    for credit losses for such amounts and charge off those loans
    upon foreclosure of the underlying property. The change in
    accounting procedure resulted in $15 million of additional
    charge-offs in 2007. The declining real estate valuations also
    contributed to provisions for credit losses related to two
    residential builders and developers during the final quarter of
    2007. A summary of the Company’s loan charge-offs,
    provision and allowance for credit losses is presented in table
    10.

Nonperforming loans, consisting of nonaccrual and restructured
    loans, aggregated $447 million or .93% of outstanding loans
    and leases at December 31, 2007, compared with
    $224 million or .52% at December 31, 2006 and
    $156 million or .39% at December 31, 2005. Major
    factors contributing to the rise in nonperforming loans from the
    2006 year-end to December 31, 2007 were a
    $133 million increase in residential real estate loans and
    an $83 million increase in loans to residential builders
    and developers. The increase in nonperforming residential real
    estate loans was the result of the residential real estate
    market turmoil and its impact on the portfolio of Alt-A loans
    and reflected the change in accounting procedure in December
    2007 whereby residential real estate loans previously classified
    as nonaccrual when payments were 180 days past due now stop
    accruing interest when principal or interest is delinquent
    90 days. The impact of the acceleration of the
    classification of such loans as nonaccrual resulted in an
    increase in nonperforming loans of $84 million and a
    corresponding decrease in loans past due 90 days and
    accruing interest. The higher level of nonaccrual builder and
    developer loans was largely due to deteriorating residential
    real estate values. The increase in nonperforming loans at
    December 31, 2006 from a year earlier was largely due to
    the 2006 addition of four relationships with automobile dealers
    totaling approximately $41 million. During 2007,
    outstanding nonaccrual loan balances relating to those four
    relationships declined $36 million, largely the result of
    payments received.



Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were
    $77 million or .16% of total loans and leases at
    December 31, 2007, compared with $111 million or .26%
    at December 31, 2006 and $129 million or .32% at
    December 31, 2005. Those loans included loans guaranteed by
    government-related entities of $73 million,
    $77 million and $106 million at December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Such guaranteed loans
    included

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company that
    were repurchased to reduce associated servicing costs, including
    a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that
    had not been received from individual mortgagors. Despite the
    loans being purchased by the Company, the insurance or guarantee
    by the applicable government-related entity remains in force.
    The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans are
    fully guaranteed by government-related entities and totaled
    $67 million at December 31, 2007, $65 million at
    December 31, 2006 and $79 million at December 31,
    2005. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest
    that were guaranteed by government-related entities also
    included foreign commercial and industrial loans supported by
    the Export-Import Bank of the United States that totaled
    $5 million at December 31, 2007, compared with
    $11 million and $26 million at December 31, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. A summary of nonperforming assets and
    certain past due loan data and credit quality ratios is

Factors that influence the Company’s credit loss experience
    include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and
    consumers, in general, and due to the size of the Company’s
    real estate loan portfolios, real estate valuations, in
    particular. Commercial real estate valuations can be highly
    subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions. Such
    valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short
    periods of time by changes in business climate, economic
    conditions, interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of
    operations of businesses and other occupants of the real
    property. Likewise, residential real estate values in certain
    areas in the United States can be subject to rapid movements due
    to changes in economic conditions, interest rates and liquidity
    in the secondary markets for loans secured by residential real
    estate.

Net charge-offs of commercial loans and leases totaled
    $24 million in 2007, $20 million in 2006 and
    $26 million in 2005. Nonperforming commercial loans and
    leases were $79 million at each of



December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    and $39 million at December 31, 2005. The addition of
    a number of smaller credits (less than $5 million) to the
    nonperforming loan category during 2007 was largely offset by a
    $27 million net decline in nonperforming loans to
    automobile dealers predominantly due to payments received.
    Reflecting the granularity of the Company’s commercial loan
    and lease portfolio, there were only two loans classified as
    nonperforming in the portfolio that exceeded $5 million.
    The increase from the 2005 year-end to December 31,
    2006 largely reflects the addition of four relationships with
    automobile dealers aggregating $41 million. Continued
    slowing of domestic automobile sales in 2006 resulted in a
    difficult operating environment for certain automobile dealers,
    leading to deteriorating financial results. As noted above,
    during 2007 the Company’s nonperforming automobile dealer
    loans declined significantly.

Net charge-offs of commercial real estate loans during 2007 and
    2006 were $6 million and $1 million, respectively,
    compared with net recoveries of $1 million in 2005.
    Reflected in 2007’s charge-offs were $4 million
    related to loans to residential real estate builders and
    developers. Commercial real estate loans classified as
    nonperforming totaled $118 million at December 31,
    2007, compared with $57 million at December 31, 2006
    and $44 million at December 31, 2005. The rise in such
    loans during 2007 was the result of the addition of
    $83 million of loans to residential homebuilders and
    developers, reflecting the impact of the downturn in the
    residential real estate market, including declining real estate
    values. The increase from the end of 2005 to the
    2006 year-end was largely due to the addition of a
    $10 million loan to an assisted living facility (which was
    subsequently paid off in 2007).

Residential real estate loans charged off, net of recoveries,
    were $19 million in 2007, $4 million in 2006 and
    $2 million in 2005. Nonperforming residential real estate
    loans at the end of 2007 totaled $181 million, compared
    with $42 million and $29 million at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. As already noted, the significant
    increase in such loans from December 31, 2006 includes the
    effect of the change in accounting procedure for nonaccrual
    residential real estate loans. Declining real estate values and
    higher levels of delinquencies have also contributed to the rise
    in residential real estate loans classified as nonaccrual,
    largely in the Company’s Alt-A portfolio, and to the level
    of charge-offs. Included in residential real estate loan net
    charge-offs and nonperforming loans were net charge-offs of
    Alt-A loans in 2007 of $12 million, while nonperforming
    Alt-A loans aggregated $90 million at the
    2007 year-end. Net charge-offs of Alt-A loans in 2006 were
    insignificant and nonperforming Alt-A loans at December 31,
    2006 totaled $19 million. The Company did not have any
    Alt-A charge-offs in 2005, nor any nonperforming Alt-A loans at
    the 2005 year-end. Residential real estate loans past due
    90 days or more and accruing interest totaled
    $66 million, $92 million and $96 million at
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A
    substantial portion of such amounts related to guaranteed loans
    repurchased from government-related entities.

Net charge-offs of consumer loans and leases during 2007 were
    $65 million, representing .63% of average consumer loans
    and leases outstanding, compared with $43 million or .43%
    in 2006 and $50 million or .47% in 2005. Indirect
    automobile loans and leases represented the most significant
    category of consumer loan charge-offs during the past three
    years. Net charge-offs of indirect automobile loans and leases
    were $28 million during 2007, $24 million during 2006
    and $37 million during 2005. Consumer loan charge-offs also
    include recreational vehicle loans and leases of
    $11 million, $9 million and $8 million during
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and home equity loans and
    lines of credit secured by one-to-four family residential
    properties of $16 million during 2007 and $2 million
    during each of 2006 and 2005. The increase in charge-offs of
    home equity loans and lines of credit from 2006 to 2007 was
    largely due to a rise in Alt-A charge-offs. Nonperforming
    consumer loans and leases were $69 million at
    December 31, 2007, representing .61% of outstanding
    consumer loans and leases, compared with $46 million or
    .46% at December 31, 2006 and $44 million or .42% at
    December 31, 2005. The Company experienced a rise in
    delinquencies in the consumer loan portfolio during 2007, as
    compared with the preceding two years. At the 2007, 2006 and
    2005 year-ends, consumer loans and leases delinquent

30-90 days

totaled $155 million, $122 million and
    $115 million, respectively, or 1.38%, 1.23% and 1.10% of
    outstanding consumer loans. Consumer loans and leases past due
    90 days or more and accruing interest totaled
    $1 million at each of December 31, 2007 and 2005, and
    $3 million at December 31, 2006.



Management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for
    credit losses by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and
    lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing
    economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial
    condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in
    which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the
    value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of
    any guarantees or indemnifications. Management evaluated the
    impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic
    conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment
    obligations when quantifying the Company’s exposure to
    credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the Company’s
    allowance for such losses as of each reporting date. Factors
    also considered by management when performing its assessment, in
    addition to general economic conditions and the other factors
    described above, included, but were not limited to: (i) the
    impact of declining residential real estate values on the
    Company’s portfolio of loans to residential real estate
    builders and developers; (ii) the repayment performance
    associated with the Company’s portfolio of Alt-A
    residential mortgage loans; (iii) the concentration of
    commercial real estate loans in the Company’s loan
    portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured
    by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York
    City metropolitan area, in particular; (iv) the amount of
    commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New
    York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in
    central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less
    economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other
    regions of the country; and (v) the size of the
    Company’s portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which
    historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a
    percentage of loans outstanding than other loan types. The level
    of the allowance is adjusted based on the results of
    management’s analysis.

Management cautiously and conservatively evaluated the allowance
    for credit losses as of December 31, 2007 in light of
    (i) the declining residential real estate values and
    emergence of higher levels of delinquencies of residential real
    estate loans; (ii) the sluggish pace of economic growth in
    many of the markets served by the Company; (iii) continuing
    weakness in industrial employment in upstate New York and
    central Pennsylvania; (iv) the significant subjectivity
    involved in commercial real estate valuations for properties
    located in areas with stagnant or low growth economies; and
    (v) the amount of loan growth experienced by the Company in
    late 2007. Although the national economy experienced moderate
    growth in 2006 and 2007 with inflation being reasonably well
    contained, concerns exist about the level and volatility of
    energy prices; a weakening housing market; the troubled state of
    financial and credit markets; Federal Reserve positioning of
    monetary policy; sluggish job creation and rising unemployment,
    which could cause consumer spending to slow; the underlying
    impact on businesses’ operations and abilities to repay
    loans should consumer spending slow; continued stagnant
    population growth in the upstate New York and central
    Pennsylvania regions; and continued slowing of domestic
    automobile sales.

In ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses,
    the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled
    credits and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and
    leases. For purposes of determining the level of the allowance
    for credit losses, the Company segments its loan and lease
    portfolio by loan type. The amount of specific loss components
    in the Company’s loan and lease portfolios is determined
    through a loan by loan analysis of commercial and commercial
    real estate loans greater than $350,000 which are in nonaccrual
    status. Measurement of the specific loss components is typically
    based on expected future cash flows, collateral values and other
    factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay.
    Impaired loans, as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 114, “Accounting by
    Creditors for Impairment of a Loan,” as amended, are
    evaluated for specific loss components. Except for consumer
    loans and leases and residential real estate loans that are
    considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated
    collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired for
    purposes of applying SFAS No. 114 when, based on
    current information and events, it is probable that the Company
    will be unable to collect all amounts according to the
    contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is
    delinquent 90 days or more. Loans less than 90 days
    delinquent are deemed to have a minimal delay in payment and are
    generally not considered to be impaired for purposes of applying
    SFAS No. 114.

The inherent base level loss components are generally determined
    by applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan
    type and management’s classification of such loans under
    the Company’s loan grading system. The Company utilizes an
    extensive loan grading system which is applied to all commercial
    and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers are
    responsible for continually



assigning grades to these loans based on standards outlined in
    the Company’s Credit Policy. Internal loan grades are also
    extensively monitored by the Company’s loan review
    department to ensure consistency and strict adherence to the
    prescribed standards.

Loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component
    computations exclude loans and leases for which specific
    allocations are maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss
    component factors that reflect the Company’s loss estimate
    for each group of loans and leases. Factors considered in
    assigning loan grades and loss component factors include
    borrower-specific information related to expected future cash
    flows and operating results, collateral values, financial
    condition, payment status, and other information; levels of and
    trends in portfolio charge-offs and recoveries; levels of and
    trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans; changes in
    the risk profile of specific portfolios; trends in volume and
    terms of loans; effects of changes in credit concentrations; and
    observed trends and practices in the banking industry.

To better classify inherent losses by specific loan categories,
    beginning in 2006 amounts previously included in the inherent
    unallocated portion of the allowance for such things as
    customer, industry and geographic concentrations as well as for
    certain national and local economic conditions have been
    included in the inherent base level loss component. As a result,
    probable losses resulting from (i) comparatively poorer
    economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in many
    market regions served by the Company, specifically upstate New
    York and central Pennsylvania, that resulted in such regions
    experiencing significantly poorer economic growth and vitality
    as compared with much of the rest of the country;
    (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding loan type,
    collateral type and geographic location, in particular the large
    concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by
    properties in the New York City metropolitan area and other
    areas of New York State; and (iii) additional risk
    associated with the Company’s portfolio of consumer loans,
    in particular automobile loans and leases, which generally have
    higher rates of loss than other types of collateralized loans,
    have been included in the inherent base level loss components at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006.

In evaluating collateral, the Company relies extensively on
    internally and externally prepared valuations. In 2007,
    valuations of residential real estate, which are usually based
    on sales of comparable properties, declined significantly in
    many regions across the United States. Commercial real estate
    valuations also refer to sales of comparable properties but
    oftentimes are based on calculations that utilize many
    assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective.
    Specifically, commercial real estate values in the New York City
    metropolitan area can be significantly affected over relatively
    short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic
    conditions and interest rates, and, in many cases, the results
    of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real
    property. Additionally, management is aware that there is
    oftentimes a delay in the recognition of credit quality changes
    in loans in assigned loan grades due to the elapse of time
    between the manifestation and reporting of underlying events
    that impact credit quality and, accordingly, loss estimates
    derived from the inherent base level loss component computation
    are adjusted for current national and local economic conditions
    and trends. Economic indicators in the most significant market
    regions served by the Company were mixed during 2007. Private
    sector job growth in the upstate New York market was 0.5%, or
    well below the 1.3% national average. The manufacturing-oriented
    metropolitan areas of Buffalo, Rochester and Binghamton
    continued to experience weakness, including continued industrial
    downsizing. Job growth in areas of Pennsylvania served by the
    Company and in Maryland matched the national average. The
    results for the Pennsylvania markets are particularly noteworthy
    since job growth in that region had significantly lagged
    national averages for several years prior to 2007. Job growth in
    New York City (1.8%) and the Greater Washington D.C. region
    (1.8%) was higher than the national average in 2007. These mixed
    signals on private sector job growth, combined with concerns
    about a possible economic recession, real estate valuations,
    high levels of consumer indebtedness, high and volatile energy
    prices, weak population growth in the upstate New York and
    central Pennsylvania regions that lagged national population
    growth trends and other factors, continue to indicate to
    management an environment of economic uncertainty, particularly
    in the markets served by the Company in New York and
    Pennsylvania where two-thirds of its lending business is
    conducted.

The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss
    components together comprise the total base level or
    “allocated” allowance for credit losses. Such
    allocated portion of the allowance



represents management’s
    assessment of losses existing in specific larger balance loans
    that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other
    loans that are not individually analyzed. In addition, the
    Company has always provided an inherent unallocated portion of
    the allowance that is intended to recognize probable losses that
    are not otherwise identifiable. The inherent unallocated
    allowance includes management’s subjective determination of
    amounts necessary for such things as: (i) the effect of
    expansion into new markets, including market areas entered
    through acquisitions, for which the Company does not have the
    same degree of familiarity and experience regarding portfolio
    performance in changing market conditions; (ii) the
    introduction of new loan and lease product types, including
    loans and leases to foreign and domestic borrowers obtained
    through acquisitions; and (iii) the possible use of
    imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the
    allowance.

A comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for
    each of the past five year-ends is presented in table 12.
    Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on
    information available to management at the time of each year-end
    assessment and using the methodology described herein.
    Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category
    as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in
    management’s estimate of specific loss components and
    inherent base level loss components, including the impact of the
    increased delinquencies and nonaccrual loans that are secured by
    residential real estate in 2007, and beginning in 2006, the
    allocation of losses that were previously unallocated for such
    things as customer, industry and geographic concentrations,
    certain national and local economic conditions, and other
    factors. As described in note 4 of Notes to Financial
    Statements, loans considered impaired pursuant to the
    requirements of SFAS No. 114 were $225 million at
    December 31, 2007 and $153 million at
    December 31, 2006. The allocated portion of the allowance
    for credit losses related to impaired loans totaled
    $55 million at December 31, 2007 and $23 million
    at December 31, 2006. The unallocated portion of the
    allowance for credit losses was equal to .19% and .21% of gross
    loans outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Given the inherent imprecision in the many
    estimates used in the determination of the allocated portion of
    the allowance, management deliberately remained cautious and
    conservative in establishing the overall allowance for credit
    losses. Given the Company’s high concentration of real
    estate loans and considering the other factors already discussed
    herein, management considers the allocated and unallocated
    portions of the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and
    reasonable. Nevertheless, the Company’s allowance is
    general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any
    loan or lease category.

Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at
    December 31, 2007 was adequate to absorb credit losses
    inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for
    credit losses was $759 million or 1.58% of total loans and
    leases at December 31, 2007, compared with
    $650 million or 1.51% at December 31, 2006 and
    $638 million or 1.58% at December 31, 2005. The
    increase in the level



of the allowance as a percentage of outstanding loans and leases
    at December 31, 2007 as compared with a year earlier
    reflects management’s evaluation of the loan portfolio as
    described herein, including the impact of lower residential real
    estate values and higher levels of delinquencies and charge-offs
    in the Company’s portfolio of Alt-A loans and lower
    residential real estate valuations related to loans to
    residential builders and developers. The decline in the level of
    the allowance as a percentage of outstanding loans and leases
    from the 2005 year-end to December 31, 2006 reflects
    management’s evaluation of the loan portfolio as described
    herein, including a change in portfolio mix resulting from
    higher balances of residential real estate loans and lower
    balances of consumer loans. In general, through 2006 the Company
    had historically experienced significantly lower charge-off
    rates on residential real estate loans than on consumer loans.
    Should the various credit factors considered by management in
    establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should
    management’s assessment of losses inherent in the loan
    portfolios also change, the level of the allowance as a
    percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future
    periods. The ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans at
    the end of 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 170%, 290% and 408%,
    respectively. The level of the allowance reflects
    management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as
    of each respective date.

In establishing the allowance for credit losses, management
    follows the methodology described herein, including taking a
    conservative view of borrowers’ abilities to repay loans.
    The establishment of the allowance is extremely subjective and
    requires management to make many judgments about borrower,
    industry, regional and national economic health and performance.
    In order to present examples of the possible impact on the
    allowance from certain changes in credit quality factors, the
    Company assumed the following scenarios for possible
    deterioration of credit quality:

•

For consumer loans and leases considered smaller balance
    homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 20 basis
    point increase in loss factors;

•

For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and
    lines of credit, also considered smaller balance homogenous
    loans and evaluated collectively, a 20% increase in estimated
    inherent losses; and

•

For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, which are
    not similar in nature, a migration of loans to lower-ranked risk
    grades resulting in a 30% increase in the balance of classified
    credits in each risk grade.

For possible improvement in credit quality factors, the
    scenarios assumed were:

•

For consumer loans and leases, a 10 basis point decrease in
    loss factors;

•

For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and
    lines of credit, a 5% decrease in estimated inherent
    losses; and

•

For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, a
    migration of loans to higher-ranked risk grades resulting in a
    5% decrease in the balance of classified credits in each risk
    grade.

The scenario analyses resulted in an additional $63 million
    in losses that could be identifiable under the assumptions for
    credit deterioration, whereas under the assumptions for credit
    improvement a $15 million reduction in such losses could
    occur. These examples are only a few of numerous reasonably
    possible scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the
    sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses based on changes
    in assumptions and other factors.

Commercial real estate loans secured by properties used in
    providing retail goods and services in the New York City
    metropolitan area represented 6% of loans outstanding at
    December 31, 2007. The Company had no concentrations of
    credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded 10% of
    total loans at December 31, 2007. Outstanding loans to
    foreign borrowers were $107 million at December 31,
    2007, or .2% of total loans and leases.

Assets acquired in settlement of defaulted loans totaled
    $40 million at December 31, 2007, compared with
    $12 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. The increase from the prior year-ends to
    December 31, 2007 resulted from higher residential real
    estate loan defaults in 2007.



Other
    Income

Other income declined 11% to $933 million in 2007 from
    $1.05 billion in 2006. That decline resulted from the
    previously discussed $127 million

other-than-temporary

impairment charge in 2007 related to collateralized debt
    obligations held in M&T’s

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio. Excluding that charge, other
    income was $1.06 billion in 2007, 1% higher than in 2006.
    Higher service charges on deposit accounts, trust income, and
    trading account and foreign exchange gains, and $9 million
    related to M&T’s pro-rata portion of the operating
    results of BLG were largely offset by a $31 million decline
    in mortgage banking revenues and a $13 million gain in 2006
    from the accelerated recognition of a purchase accounting
    premium related to the call of a $200 million borrowing
    from the FHLB of Atlanta. The December 2007 acquisition
    transactions did not contribute significantly to other income in
    2007.

Other income in 2006 was 10% above the $950 million earned
    in 2005. Higher levels of mortgage banking revenues, service
    charges on deposit accounts, trust income, brokerage services
    income, and other revenues contributed to that improvement.
    Included in other income for 2006 was the $13 million gain
    related to the call of an FHLB borrowing, while other income in
    2005 reflected a $29 million

other-than-temporary

impairment charge related to the Company’s investment in
    certain preferred stock issuances of FNMA and FHLMC held in the

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio. Excluding gains and losses from
    investment securities from both years and the $13 million
    gain on the called borrowing in 2006, other income increased 5%
    from 2005 to 2006.

Mortgage banking revenues were $112 million in 2007,
    $143 million in 2006 and $136 million in 2005.
    Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both residential and
    commercial mortgage banking activities. The Company’s
    involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities is largely
    comprised of the origination, sales and servicing of loans in
    conjunction with the FNMA DUS program.

Residential mortgage banking revenues, consisting of realized
    gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan
    servicing rights, unrealized gains and losses on residential
    mortgage loans held for sale and related commitments,
    residential mortgage loan servicing fees, and other residential
    mortgage loan-related fees and income, decreased 25% to
    $86 million in 2007 from $114 million in 2006. The
    decline in residential mortgage banking revenues in 2007 as
    compared with 2006 resulted from lower realized gains from sales
    of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights due to
    slimmer margins realized by the Company resulting from changes
    in market conditions. Residential mortgage banking revenues in
    2006 were 7% higher than the $107 million earned in 2005.
    Higher revenue from servicing residential mortgage loans for
    others was the leading factor in the improvement.

Residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other
    investors totaled approximately $5.6 billion in 2007,
    compared with $6.4 billion in 2006 and $6.5 billion in
    2005. Residential mortgage loans sold to investors totaled
    $5.3 billion in each of 2007 and 2005 and $5.0 billion
    in 2006. Realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans
    and loan servicing rights and recognized net unrealized gains or
    losses attributable to residential mortgage loans held for sale,
    commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell
    loans totaled $3 million in 2007, compared with
    $41 million in 2006 and $42 million in 2005. Changing
    market conditions that led to substantial reductions in investor
    demand for Alt-A residential mortgage loans resulted in an
    overall narrowing of margins realized from the sale of loans.
    That narrowing contributed significantly to the $38 million
    decline in revenues from 2006 to 2007 that was noted above. Also
    reflected in the 2007 results were $18 million of losses
    recognized in the first quarter specifically related to Alt-A
    residential mortgage loans. Unfavorable market conditions and a
    lack of market liquidity impacted the Company’s willingness
    to sell Alt-A mortgage loans during the first quarter of 2007.
    As a result, the Company reclassified $883 million of Alt-A
    loans previously held for sale (including $808 million of
    first mortgage loans and $75 million of second mortgage
    loans) to its

held-for-investment

loan portfolio during 2007’s first quarter. In accordance
    with GAAP, loans held for sale must be recorded at the lower of
    cost or market value. Accordingly, prior to reclassifying the
    $883 million of Alt-A mortgage loans to held for
    investment, the carrying value of such loans was reduced by
    $12 million to reflect estimated market value. In addition,
    the Company is contractually obligated to repurchase some
    previously sold Alt-A loans that do not ultimately meet investor
    sale criteria, including instances when mortgagors fail to make
    timely payments during the first 90 days subsequent to the
    sale date. As a result, during the first quarter of 2007, the
    Company accrued $6 million



to provide for declines in market value of previously sold Alt-A
    mortgage loans that the Company may be required to repurchase.

Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others
    rose to $73 million in 2007 from $66 million in 2006
    and $58 million in 2005. Included in such servicing
    revenues were amounts related to purchased servicing rights
    associated with small balance commercial mortgage loans totaling
    $21 million, $14 million and $10 million in 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Residential mortgage loans serviced
    for others totaled $19.4 billion at December 31, 2007,
    $16.7 billion a year earlier and $15.6 billion at
    December 31, 2005, including the small balance commercial
    mortgage loans noted above of approximately $4.9 billion,
    $3.3 billion and $2.4 billion at December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capitalized residential
    mortgage loan servicing assets, net of a valuation allowance for
    possible impairment, totaled $170 million at
    December 31, 2007, compared with $153 million and
    $140 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The valuation allowance for possible impairment of
    capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets totaled
    $6 million, $10 million and $20 million at the
    2007, 2006 and 2005 year-ends, respectively. Included in
    capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets were purchased
    servicing rights associated with the small balance commercial
    mortgage loans noted above of $57 million, $36 million
    and $23 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Servicing rights for the small balance commercial
    mortgage loans were purchased from BLG or its affiliates. In
    addition, at December 31, 2007 capitalized servicing rights
    included $40 million for servicing rights for
    $4.6 billion of residential real estate loans that were
    purchased from affiliates of BLG. Additional information about
    the Company’s relationship with BLG and its affiliates is
    provided in note 24 of Notes to Financial Statements.
    Additional information about the Company’s capitalized
    residential mortgage loan servicing assets, including
    information about the calculation of estimated fair value, is
    presented in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements.
    Commitments to sell residential mortgage loans and commitments
    to originate residential mortgage loans for sale at
    pre-determined rates were $772 million and
    $492 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007,
    $1.8 billion and $680 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2006 and $923 million and
    $352 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005. Net
    unrealized losses on hedged residential mortgage loans held for
    sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate
    loans for sale were $7 million and $5 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2005, respectively, compared with net
    unrealized gains of $4 million at December 31, 2006.
    Changes in such net unrealized gains and losses are recorded in
    mortgage banking revenues and resulted in net decreases in
    revenue of $23 million (including $12 million to
    record the Alt-A mortgage loans transferred from held for sale
    to held for investment at the lower of cost or market value) in
    2007 and $8 million in 2005, and a net increase in revenue
    of $2 million in 2006.

Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $26 million in
    2007 and $29 million in each of 2006 and 2005. Revenues
    from loan origination and sales activities were $13 million
    in 2007, compared with $15 million in 2006 and
    $14 million in 2005. Loan servicing revenues totaled
    $13 million in 2007, $14 million in 2006 and
    $15 million in 2005. Capitalized commercial mortgage loan
    servicing assets totaled $20 million at December 31,
    2007 and $21 million at each of December 31, 2006 and
    2005. Commercial mortgage loans serviced for other investors
    totaled $5.3 billion, $4.9 billion and
    $4.3 billion at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, and included $1.0 billion, $939 million
    and $941 million, respectively, of loan balances for which
    investors had recourse to the Company if such balances are
    ultimately uncollectible. Commitments to sell commercial
    mortgage loans and commitments to originate commercial mortgage
    loans for sale were $174 million and $97 million,
    respectively, at December 31, 2007, $115 million and
    $66 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006 and
    $241 million and $42 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2005. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale
    totaled $79 million, $49 million and $199 million
    at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Service charges on deposit accounts rose 7% to $409 million
    in 2007 from $381 million in 2006. Deposit account service
    charges in 2005 were $370 million. The higher levels of
    such revenues in 2007 and 2006 as compared with 2005 were
    largely due to consumer service charges related to overdraft
    fees and higher debit card transaction volumes.

Trust income includes fees for trust and custody services
    provided to personal, corporate and institutional customers, and
    investment management and advisory fees that are often based on
    a percentage of the market value of assets under management.
    Trust income rose 8% to $153 million in



2007 from $141 million in 2006, due in part to the impact
    of higher balances in proprietary money-market mutual funds and
    higher revenues from providing personal trust and investment
    management services. Trust income totaled $135 million in
    2005. Higher personal trust revenues contributed to the rise in
    revenues from 2005 to 2006. Total trust assets, which include
    assets under management and assets under administration,
    aggregated $146.1 billion at December 31, 2007,
    compared with $142.4 billion at December 31, 2006.
    Trust assets under management were $15.5 billion and
    $14.8 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The Company’s proprietary mutual funds, the
    MTB Group of Funds, had assets of $10.5 billion and
    $8.9 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Brokerage services income, which includes revenues
    from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities
    brokerage fees, aggregated $60 million in each of 2007 and
    2006, and was $56 million in 2005. The increase from 2005
    to 2006 was due largely to increased revenues earned from the
    sale of annuities.

Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains
    of $30 million in 2007, $25 million in 2006 and
    $23 million in 2005. The improvement in 2007 as compared
    with 2006 reflected higher income related to interest rate swap
    agreements due to higher volumes of transactions executed on
    behalf of commercial customers. The higher gains in 2006 as
    compared with 2005 resulted largely from net increases in the
    market values of trading assets held in connection with deferred
    compensation plans. The Company enters into interest rate and
    foreign exchange contracts with customers who need such services
    and concomitantly enters into offsetting trading positions with
    third parties to minimize the risks involved with these types of
    transactions. Information about the notional amount of interest
    rate, foreign exchange and other contracts entered into by the
    Company for trading account purposes is included in note 17
    of Notes to Financial Statements and herein under the heading
    “Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate
    Sensitivity.” Trading account revenues related to interest
    rate and foreign exchange contracts totaled $21 million in
    2007 and $15 million in each of 2006 and 2005. Trading
    account assets held in connection with deferred compensation
    plans were $47 million and $45 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Trading account
    revenues resulting from net increases in the market values of
    such assets were $4 million in 2007, $5 million in
    2006 and $3 million in 2005. A largely offsetting expense
    resulting from corresponding increases in liabilities related to
    deferred compensation is included in other costs of operations.

As previously described, an

other-than-temporary

impairment charge of $127 million was recognized in the
    fourth quarter of 2007 in light of significant deterioration in
    the residential real estate market and the resulting decline in
    market value of the Company’s collateralized debt
    obligations held in the

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio. Reflecting that charge, losses
    on investment securities were $126 million in 2007,
    compared with gains of $3 million in 2006 and losses of
    $28 million during 2005. The losses in 2005 reflect the
    previously described $29 million charge for the

other-than-temporary

impairment in value of FNMA and FHLMC preferred stock.
    M&T’s pro-rata allocation of the operating results of
    BLG, in which it invested in during the first quarter of 2007
    and that is recognized using the equity method of accounting,
    amounted to $9 million of revenue in 2007.

Other revenues from operations were $286 million in 2007,
    compared with $293 million in 2006 and $259 million in
    2005. An $8 million increase in credit-related and
    corporate advisory fees in 2007 was more than offset by a
    $6 million decline in income from bank owned life insurance
    and the previously noted $13 million gain in 2006 from the
    call of an FHLB borrowing. Significant contributors to the 13%
    rise in other revenues from operations from 2005 to 2006 were
    the $13 million gain from the call of an FHLB borrowing and
    an increase of $9 million in insurance-related revenues,
    largely the result of the February 1, 2006 acquisition by
    M&T Bank of a commercial insurance and surety brokerage
    agency based in Maryland. Also contributing to the increase from
    2005 to 2006 were higher income from educational lending
    services of $8 million and income from bank owned life
    insurance of $6 million.

Included in other revenues from operations were the following
    significant components. Letter of credit and other
    credit-related fees totaled $81 million, $77 million
    and $75 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Tax-exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance
    aggregated $47 million in each of 2007 and 2005, and
    $53 million in 2006. Such income includes increases in cash
    surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits
    received. Revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees
    were $35 million in 2007, $32 million in 2006 and
    $30 million in 2005. Insurance-related sales commissions
    and other revenues totaled $33 million in 2007,
    $32 million in 2006 and $22 million in



2005. The higher revenues in 2006 as compared with 2005 were
    primarily the result of the noted insurance agency acquisition
    in February 2006. Automated teller machine (“ATM”)
    usage fees aggregated $15 million in each of 2007 and 2006
    and $22 million in 2005. The decrease in such fees from
    2005 was largely the result of the reduction or elimination of
    fees charged for use of ATMs at certain non-branch locations.

Other
    Expense

Other expense aggregated $1.63 billion in 2007, compared
    with $1.55 billion in 2006 and $1.49 billion in 2005.
    Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be
    “nonoperating” in nature consisting of amortization of
    core deposit and other intangible assets of $66 million,
    $63 million and $57 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, and merger-related integration expenses of
    $15 million in 2007 and $5 million in 2006. There were
    no merger-related expenses in 2005. Exclusive of these
    nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were
    $1.55 billion in 2007, up 4% from $1.48 billion in
    2006. Included in 2007’s noninterest operating expenses was
    the $23 million charge taken in the fourth quarter related
    to the Visa litigation, while 2006’s operating expenses
    reflected an $18 million contribution to The M&T
    Charitable Foundation. The most significant contributor to the
    remaining increase in noninterest expense in 2007 was a higher
    level of salaries and employee benefits expense. The December
    2007 acquisitions did not contribute significantly to
    noninterest operating expenses in 2007. Noninterest operating
    expenses were $1.43 billion in 2005. Excluding the
    charitable contribution in 2006, operating expenses in 2006 were
    less than 3% above those in 2005, due primarily to higher
    salaries costs, including merit pay increases and incentive
    compensation. Table 2 provides a reconciliation of other expense
    to noninterest operating expense.

Salaries and employee benefits expense totaled $908 million
    in 2007, up 4% from $873 million in 2006. The most
    significant contributor to the increase was a higher level of
    salaries expense in 2007, reflecting the impact of merit pay
    increases and higher incentive compensation pay. Salaries and
    employee benefits expense was $822 million in 2005. The
    higher expense level for 2006 as compared with 2005 was due
    largely to salaries-related costs, including the impact of merit
    pay increases and higher stock-based compensation costs and
    other incentive pay. The Company recognizes expense for
    stock-based compensation using the fair value method of
    accounting for all stock-based compensation granted to employees
    after January 1, 1995. As a result, salaries and employee
    benefits expense included stock-based compensation of
    $51 million in each of 2007 and 2006, and $45 million
    in 2005. The higher level of stock-based compensation in 2007
    and 2006 as compared with 2005 was largely due to the adoption
    of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
    Payment,” (“SFAS No. 123R”), effective
    January 1, 2006. As required, coincident with the adoption
    of SFAS No. 123R, the Company began accelerating the
    recognition of compensation costs for stock-based awards granted
    to retirement-eligible employees and employees who will become
    retirement-eligible prior to full vesting of the award. As a
    result, stock-based compensation expense during each of 2007 and
    2006 included $4 million that would otherwise have been
    recognized over the normal four year vesting period if not for
    the required adoption of SFAS No. 123R. That
    acceleration had no effect on the value of stock-based
    compensation awarded to employees. The number of full-time
    equivalent employees was 13,246 at December 31, 2007
    (including 648 from the December acquisition transactions),
    compared with 12,721 and 12,780 at December 31, 2006 and
    2005, respectively.

The Company provides pension and other postretirement benefits
    (including a retirement savings plan) for its employees.
    Expenses related to such benefits totaled $54 million in
    each of 2007 and 2006, and $59 million in 2005. The Company
    sponsors both defined benefit and defined contribution pension
    plans. Pension benefit expense for those plans was
    $27 million in 2007, $28 million in 2006 and
    $38 million in 2005. Included in those amounts are
    $8 million in 2007 and $7 million in 2006 for a
    defined contribution pension plan that the Company began on
    January 1, 2006. The determination of pension expense and
    the recognition of net pension assets and liabilities for
    defined benefit pension plans requires management to make
    various assumptions that can significantly impact the actuarial
    calculations related thereto. Those assumptions include the
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the rate of
    increase in future compensation levels and the discount rate.
    Changes in any of those assumptions will impact the
    Company’s pension expense. The expected long-term rate of
    return assumption is determined by taking into consideration
    asset allocations, historical returns on the types of assets
    held and current



economic factors. Returns on invested assets are periodically
    compared with target market indices for each asset type to aid
    management in evaluating such returns. The discount rate used by
    the Company to determine the present value of the Company’s
    future benefit obligations reflects specific market yields for a
    hypothetical portfolio of highly rated corporate bonds that
    would produce cash flows similar to the Company’s benefit
    plan obligations and the level of market interest rates in
    general as of the year-end. Other factors used to estimate the
    projected benefit obligations include actuarial assumptions for
    mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate and disability
    rate. Those other factors do not tend to change significantly
    over time. The Company reviews its pension plan assumptions
    annually to ensure that such assumptions are reasonable and
    adjusts those assumptions, as necessary, to reflect changes in
    future expectations. The Company utilizes actuaries and others
    to aid in that assessment.

The Company’s 2007 pension expense for its defined benefit
    plans was determined using the following assumptions: a
    long-term rate of return on assets of 8.00%; a rate of future
    compensation increase of 4.70%; and a discount rate of 5.75%. To
    demonstrate the sensitivity of pension expense to changes in the
    Company’s pension plan assumptions, 25 basis point
    increases in: the rate of return on plan assets would have
    resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $1 million;
    the rate of increase in compensation would have resulted in an
    increase in pension expense of $.3 million; and the
    discount rate would have resulted in a decrease in pension
    expense of $3 million. Decreases of 25 basis points in
    those assumptions would have resulted in similar changes in
    amount, but in the opposite direction from the changes presented
    in the preceding sentence. The accounting guidance for defined
    benefit pension plans reflects the long-term nature of benefit
    obligations and the investment horizon of plan assets, and has
    the effect of reducing expense volatility related to short-term
    changes in interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains
    and losses include the impact of plan amendments, in addition to
    various gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions
    and investment returns which are different from that which is
    assumed. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had
    cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of approximately
    $125 million that could result in an increase in the
    Company’s future pension expense depending on several
    factors, including whether such losses at each measurement date
    exceed ten percent of the greater of the projected benefit
    obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. In
    accordance with GAAP, net unrecognized gains or losses that
    exceed that threshold are required to be amortized over the
    expected service period of active employees, and are included as
    a component of net pension cost. Amortization of these net
    unrealized losses had the effect of increasing the
    Company’s pension expense by approximately $6 million
    in 2007, $8 million in 2006 and $5 million in 2005.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans,” which requires an employer to
    recognize in its balance sheet as an asset or liability the
    overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit
    postretirement plan, measured as the difference between the fair
    value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. For a pension
    plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit
    obligation; for any other postretirement benefit plan, such as a
    retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the
    accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.
    SFAS No. 158 requires that gains or losses and prior
    service costs or credits that arise during the period, but are
    not included as components of net periodic benefit cost be
    recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. The
    Company adopted SFAS No. 158 in 2006. As of
    December 31, 2007, the combined benefit obligations (as
    defined under SFAS No. 158) of the Company’s
    defined benefit postretirement plans exceeded the fair value of
    the assets of such plans by approximately $186 million. Of
    that amount, $66 million was related to qualified defined
    benefit plans that are periodically funded by the Company and
    $120 million related to non-qualified pension and other
    postretirement plans that are generally not funded until
    benefits are paid. Pursuant to the criteria of
    SFAS No. 158, the Company was required to have a net
    pension and postretirement benefit liability for those plans
    that was at least equal to $186 million at
    December 31, 2007. Accordingly, as of December 31,
    2007 the Company recorded an additional postretirement benefit
    liability of $76 million. After applicable tax effect, that
    liability reduced accumulated other comprehensive income (and
    thereby stockholders’ equity) by $46 million. The
    result of this was a

year-over-year

increase of $30 million to the required minimum
    postretirement benefit liability from the $46 million
    recorded at December 31, 2006. After applicable tax effect,
    the $30 million increase in the minimum required liability
    reduced accumulated other comprehensive income in 2007 by an
    additional $18 million from the prior



year-end amount of $28 million. The $30 million
    increase to the liability was necessary to reflect losses that
    occurred during 2007 resulting from actual experience differing
    from assumptions and from changes in actuarial assumptions. The
    significant factors contributing to such losses were: migration
    to newer mortality tables in order to better reflect current
    life expectancy among plan participants and losses resulting
    from the qualified defined benefit plan asset return being lower
    than the expected return, partially offset by actuarial gains
    resulting from increasing the discount rate to 6.00% at
    December 31, 2007 from the 5.75% discount rate used at
    December 31, 2006. A 25 basis point decrease in the
    assumed discount rate as of December 31, 2007 to 5.75%
    would have resulted in increases in the combined benefit
    obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans
    (including pension and other plans) of $25 million. Under
    that scenario, the minimum postretirement liability adjustment
    at December 31, 2007 would have been $101 million,
    rather than the $76 million that was actually recorded, and
    the corresponding after tax-effect charge to accumulated other
    comprehensive income at December 31, 2007 would have been
    $62 million, rather than the $46 million that was
    actually recorded. A 25 basis point increase in the assumed
    discount rate to 6.25% would have decreased the combined benefit
    obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans by
    $24 million. Under this latter scenario, the aggregate
    minimum liability adjustment at December 31, 2007 would
    have been $52 million rather than the $76 million
    actually recorded and the corresponding after tax-effect charge
    to accumulated other comprehensive income would have been
    $32 million rather than $46 million. The Company made
    contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in
    2007 and 2006 of $66 million and $36 million,
    respectively. Information about the Company’s pension
    plans, including significant assumptions utilized in completing
    actuarial calculations for the plans, is included in
    note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company amended certain
    provisions of its defined benefit pension plans. Such amendments
    had the effect of reducing future benefits earned under the
    plans. The formula was changed to reduce the future accrual of
    benefits by lowering the accrual percentage and through use of a
    career-average-pay formula as opposed to the previous
    final-average-pay formula. The amendments affected benefits
    earned for service periods beginning after December 31,
    2005. Active participants at that time had the choice of
    electing to remain in the defined benefit plan under the reduced
    benefit formula or electing to participate in a new qualified
    defined contribution pension plan. Under the new defined
    contribution pension plan, the Company makes contributions to
    the plan each year in an amount that is based on an individual
    participant’s total compensation (generally defined as
    total wages, incentive compensation, commissions and bonuses)
    and years of service. Participants do not contribute to the
    defined contribution pension plan. New employees are not
    eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan, but do
    participate in the defined contribution pension plan. The
    amendment caused the projected benefit obligation associated
    with the defined benefit plans to decrease by approximately
    $98 million as of December 31, 2005. Certain gains
    associated with the $98 million in pension benefit
    obligation reduction attributable to employees who remained in
    the plan are not subject to the ten percent corridor previously
    noted. Guidance contained in SFAS No. 87,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions,” requires
    that these gains be amortized and recognized as a component of
    net periodic benefit cost over the remaining expected service
    period for active employees. Amortization of these gains had the
    effect of reducing the Company’s pension expense for each
    of 2006 and 2007 by approximately $7 million.

In addition to the changes described above, the Company also
    amended its retirement savings plan (“RSP”), effective
    January 1, 2006, to allow for greater amounts of employee
    compensation to be eligible for contribution to the RSP. The RSP
    is a defined contribution plan in which eligible employees of
    the Company may defer up to 50% of qualified compensation via
    contributions to the plan. The Company makes an employer
    matching contribution in an amount equal to 75% of an
    employee’s contribution, up to 4.5% of the employee’s
    qualified compensation. RSP expense totaled $22 million in
    2007, $21 million in 2006 and $17 million in 2005.

As a result of the amendments to the defined benefit pension
    plans and the RSP and the introduction of the defined
    contribution pension plan, the Company hoped to limit increases
    in future period expenses associated with these plans.
    Reflecting the impact of these changes, expenses associated with
    the defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans and
    the RSP totaled $49 million in each of 2007 and 2006, and
    $55 million in 2005. Expense associated with providing
    medical and other postretirement benefits was $5 million in
    each of 2007 and 2006, and $4 million in 2005.



Excluding the nonoperating expense items already noted,
    nonpersonnel operating expenses totaled $639 million in
    2007, up 5% from $611 million in 2006. The principal
    factors for that increase were the $23 million charge taken
    in 2007 related to the Visa litigation, the impact of net
    partial reversals of the valuation allowance for impairment of
    capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, which totaled
    $4 million in 2007 and $10 million in 2006, and higher
    merchant and credit card costs and other real estate owned and
    foreclosure-related expenses, offset, in part, by the
    $18 million charitable contribution in 2006. As previously
    noted, during the fourth quarter of 2007, Visa completed a
    reorganization in contemplation of its IPO expected to occur in
    2008. As part of that reorganization, M&T Bank and other
    member banks of Visa received shares of common stock of Visa,
    Inc. Those banks are also obligated under various agreements
    with Visa to share in losses stemming from certain Covered
    Litigation. Although Visa is expected to set aside a portion of
    the proceeds from its IPO in an escrow account to fund any
    judgments or settlements that may arise out of the Covered
    Litigation, recent guidance from the SEC indicates that Visa
    member banks should record a liability for the fair value of the
    contingent obligation to Visa. The Covered Litigation includes
    the following:

•

American Express litigation–Visa announced in November 2007
    that this litigation was settled.

•

Discover litigation–Visa recorded an accrual related to
    this litigation in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
    “Accounting for Contingencies,” in September 2007,
    although the case was not settled as of December 31, 2007.

•

Interchange and Attridge litigation, and any other litigation
    that challenges Visa’s reorganization or the consummation
    thereof. The status of such initiated litigation as of
    December 31, 2007 was open with discovery incomplete.

Based on the facts and circumstances of each individual case as
    the Company understands them, a liability has been established
    by the Company in accordance with FASB Interpretation
    (“FIN”) No. 45, “Guarantor’s
    Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including
    Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” The
    estimation of the Company’s proportionate share of any
    potential losses related to the Covered Litigation is extremely
    difficult and involves a great deal of judgment. Nevertheless,
    in the fourth quarter of 2007 the Company recorded a pre-tax
    charge of $23 million ($14 million after tax effect,
    or $.13 per diluted share) related to the Covered Litigation. In
    accordance with GAAP and consistent with the SEC guidance, the
    Company did not recognize any value for its common stock
    ownership interest in Visa, Inc.

Nonpersonnel operating expenses were $606 million in 2005.
    The increase from 2005 to 2006 reflects the $18 million
    charitable contribution made in 2006. Exclusive of the
    contribution, nonpersonnel operating expenses in 2006 decreased
    $13 million or 2% from 2005, due largely to lower costs for
    professional services, furniture and equipment.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $309 million in 2007,
    compared with $392 million in 2006 and $389 million in
    2005. The effective tax rates were 32.1%, 31.9% and 33.2% in
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company adopted
    FIN No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes,” on January 1, 2007. That adoption did not have
    a material effect on the Company’s financial position or on
    its results of operations during 2007. The decline in the
    Company’s effective tax rate from 2005 to 2006 reflects
    higher levels of income that were exempt from tax in certain
    jurisdictions and a $3 million favorable impact from
    settlement of refund claims originally filed by an entity
    subsequently acquired by M&T. The refunds received,
    consisting of income taxes and taxable interest, exceeded the
    amounts previously accrued for such items by $5 million
    (pre-tax).

The Company’s effective tax rate in future periods will be
    affected by the results of operations allocated to the various
    tax jurisdictions within which the Company operates, any change
    in income tax regulations within those jurisdictions, or
    interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the
    Company’s interpretations by any of various tax authorities
    that may examine tax returns filed by M&T or any of its
    subsidiaries. Information about amounts accrued for uncertain
    tax positions and a reconciliation of income tax expense to the
    amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax
    rate to pre-tax income is provided in note 12 of Notes to
    Financial Statements.



International
    Activities

The Company’s net investment in international assets
    totaled $120 million at December 31, 2007 and
    $185 million at December 31, 2006. Such assets
    included $107 million and $176 million, respectively,
    of loans to foreign borrowers. Offshore deposits totaled
    $5.9 billion at December 31, 2007 and
    $5.4 billion at December 31, 2006. The Company uses
    such deposits to facilitate customer demand and as an
    alternative to short-term borrowings when the costs of such
    deposits seem reasonable.

Liquidity,
    Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity

As a financial intermediary, the Company is exposed to various
    risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to
    the Company’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow
    and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future
    financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit
    withdrawals, funding operating costs, and other corporate
    purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of
    financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.

Core deposits have historically been the most significant
    funding source for the Company, and are generated from a large
    base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. That
    customer base has, over the past several years, become more
    geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion
    of the Company’s businesses. Nevertheless, in recent years
    the Company has faced increased competition in offering products
    and services from a large array of financial market
    participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities
    dealers and others. Core deposits financed 54% of the
    Company’s earning assets at December 31, 2007,
    compared with 57% at each of December 31, 2006 and 2005.

The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits
    with various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings,
    including federal funds purchased and securities sold under
    agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit,
    offshore branch deposits and borrowings from the FHLBs and
    others. At December 31, 2007, M&T Bank had short-term
    and long-term credit facilities with the FHLBs aggregating
    $8.2 billion. Outstanding borrowings under these credit
    facilities totaled $6.5 billion and $3.4 billion at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Such borrowings
    are secured by loans and investment securities. M&T Bank
    and M&T Bank, N.A. had available lines of credit with the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York of approximately
    $4.5 billion at December 31, 2007. The amounts of
    those lines are dependent upon the balances of loans and
    securities pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings
    outstanding under these lines of credit at either
    December 31, 2007 or 2006. As an additional source of
    funding, M&T issued $300 million of senior notes in
    May 2007. Those notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.375%
    and are due on May 24, 2012. The Company also obtains
    funding by maintaining a $500 million revolving
    asset-backed structured borrowing which is collateralized by
    approximately $557 million of automobile loans and related
    assets that have been transferred to a special purpose
    consolidated subsidiary of M&T Bank. That subsidiary, the
    loans and the borrowing are included in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements. As existing loans of the
    subsidiary pay down, monthly proceeds, after payment of certain
    fees and debt service costs, have been used in the past to
    obtain additional automobile loans from M&T Bank or other
    subsidiaries to replenish the collateral and maintain the
    existing borrowing base. Additional information about this
    borrowing is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial
    Statements.

The Company has issued subordinated capital notes from time to
    time to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios.
    Such notes qualify for inclusion in the Company’s total
    capital as defined by federal regulators. M&T Bank issued
    $400 million of subordinated notes in December 2007. The
    notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 6.625% and mature in
    December 2017. In December 2006, M&T Bank issued
    $500 million of subordinated notes, which bear a fixed rate
    of interest of 5.629% for ten years and a floating rate
    thereafter, at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus .64%. The
    notes are redeemable at the Company’s option after the
    fixed-rate period ends, subject to prior regulatory approval.
    Additional information about the Company’s borrowings is
    included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company has informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of
    funding available through various arrangements for unsecured
    short-term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other
    financial institutions. Short-term federal funds borrowings were
    $4.2 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. In general, those borrowings were
    unsecured and matured on the next business



day. As already noted, offshore branch deposits and brokered
    certificates of deposit have been used by the Company as an
    alternative to short-term borrowings. Offshore branch deposits
    also generally mature on the next business day and totaled
    $5.9 billion and $5.4 billion at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2007, the
    weighted-average remaining term to maturity of brokered time
    deposits was 12 months. Certain of these brokered deposits
    have provisions that allow for early redemption. Information
    regarding such deposits is included under the heading “Net
    Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities.”

The Company’s ability to obtain funding from these or other
    sources could be negatively affected should the Company
    experience a substantial deterioration in its financial
    condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of
    short-term funding become restricted due to a disruption in the
    financial markets. The Company attempts to quantify such
    credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the
    liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade
    over various grading levels. Such impact is estimated by
    attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of
    credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and
    securitizable assets. Information about the credit ratings of
    M&T and M&T Bank is presented in table 13. Additional
    information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the
    Company’s short-term and long-term borrowings is provided
    in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to
    deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include
    maturities of investment securities and other earning assets,
    repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash
    generated from operations, such as fees collected for services.

Certain customers of the Company obtain financing through the
    issuance of variable rate demand bonds (“VRDBs”). The
    VRDBs are generally enhanced by direct-pay letters of credit
    provided by M&T Bank. M&T Bank oftentimes acts as
    remarketing agent for the VRDBs and, at its discretion, may from

time-to-time

own some of the VRDBs while such instruments are remarketed.
    When this occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading assets in
    the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Nevertheless,
    M&T Bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the
    VRDBs. The value of VRDBs in the Company’s trading account
    totaled $63 million and $6 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At both
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the VRDBs outstanding backed by
    M&T Bank letters of credit totaled $1.7 billion.
    M&T Bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those
    bonds.

The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal
    course of business which require future cash payments. The
    contractual amounts and timing of those payments as of
    December 31, 2007 are summarized in table 15. Off-balance
    sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity, including
    commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit,
    commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and
    indemnification contracts, and commitments to sell real estate
    loans. Because many of these commitments or contracts expire
    without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts
    are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further
    discussion of these commitments is provided in note 20 of
    Notes to Financial Statements. Table 15 summarizes the
    Company’s other commitments as of December 31, 2007
    and the timing of the expiration of such commitments.

M&T’s primary source of funds to pay for operating
    expenses, shareholder dividends and common stock repurchases has
    historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking
    subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory
    limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T
    are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary
    in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of
    the test, approximately $296 million at December 31,
    2007 was available for payment of dividends to M&T from
    banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval. These
    historic sources of cash flow have been augmented in the past by
    the issuance of trust preferred securities and in the second
    quarter of 2007 by the issuance of $300 million of senior
    notes payable. Information regarding trust preferred securities,
    the related junior subordinated debentures and the senior notes
    is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.
    M&T also maintains a $30 million line of credit with
    an unaffiliated commercial bank, of which there were no
    borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2007. A similar
    $30 million line of credit was entirely available for
    borrowing at December 31, 2006.

Maturities are reflected based

    be significantly shorter as a result of loan repayments in the
    underlying mortgage pools.

Management closely monitors the Company’s liquidity
    position for compliance with internal policies and believes that
    available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding
    needs anticipated in the normal course of business. Management
    does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either



currently or in the long-term, for which adequate funding would
    not be available and would therefore result in a significant
    strain on liquidity at either M&T or its subsidiary banks.

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the
    market prices

and/or

interest rates of the Company’s financial instruments. The
    primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate
    risk. Interest rate risk arises from the Company’s core
    banking activities of lending and deposit-taking, because assets
    and liabilities reprice at different times and by different
    amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest
    income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of
    changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk
    by calculating the variability of net interest income in future
    periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected
    balances for earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and
    derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Management’s
    philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the
    variability of net interest income. The balances of financial
    instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth
    from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments
    of loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of
    investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a
    “value of equity” model to supplement the modeling
    technique described above. Those supplemental analyses are based
    on discounted cash flows associated with on- and off-balance
    sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to
    reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a
    long-term interest rate risk metric. The Company has entered
    into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to
    interest rate risk. At December 31, 2007, the aggregate
    notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into
    for interest rate risk management purposes was
    $2.3 billion. Information about interest rate swap
    agreements entered into for interest rate risk management
    purposes is included herein under the heading “Net Interest
    Income/Lending and Funding Activities” and in note 17
    of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company’s Risk Management Committee, which includes
    members of senior management, monitors the sensitivity of the
    Company’s net interest income to changes in interest rates
    with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest
    income under different interest rate scenarios. In modeling
    changing interest rates, the Company considers different yield
    curve shapes that consider both parallel (that is, simultaneous
    changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve) and
    non-parallel (that is, allowing interest rates at points on the
    yield curve to vary by different amounts) shifts in the yield
    curve. In utilizing the model, market implied forward interest
    rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to
    determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest
    income simulation. That calculated base net interest income is
    then compared to the income calculated under the varying
    interest rate scenarios. The model considers the impact of
    ongoing lending and deposit-gathering activities, as well as
    interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing
    of financial instruments, including the effect of changing
    interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When
    deemed prudent, management has taken actions to mitigate
    exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on-or
    off-balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in
    the future. Possible actions include, but are not limited to,
    changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying
    the composition of



earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to,
    modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements
    or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk
    management purposes.

Table 18 displays as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 the
    estimated impact on net interest income from non-trading
    financial instruments in the base scenario described above
    resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across
    repricing categories during the first modeling year.

The Company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact
    that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income.
    The more significant of those assumptions included the rate of
    prepayments of mortgage-related assets, cash flows from
    derivative and other financial instruments held for non-trading
    purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit
    maturities. In the scenarios presented, the Company also assumed
    gradual changes in rates during a twelve-month period of 100 and
    200 basis points, as compared with the assumed base
    scenario. In the event that a 100 or 200 basis point rate
    change cannot be achieved, the applicable rate changes are
    limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates cannot be
    less than zero. The assumptions used in interest rate
    sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and, as a result,
    the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in
    interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ
    significantly from those presented due to the timing, magnitude
    and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market
    conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between
    maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as
    those previously described, which management may take to counter
    such changes. In light of the uncertainties and assumptions
    associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table
    are not considered significant to the Company’s past or
    projected net interest income.

In accordance with industry practice, table 19 presents
    cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a
    contractual basis within the specified time frames, as adjusted
    for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for
    interest rate risk management purposes. Management believes that
    this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk
    since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all
    categories of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities
    equally nor, as assumed in the table, on the contractual
    maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this static
    presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect
    of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected
    changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest
    rate risk management activities the Company is likely to
    implement.

The Company engages in trading activities to meet the financial
    needs of customers, to fund the Company’s obligations under
    certain deferred compensation plans and, to a limited extent, to
    profit from perceived market opportunities. Financial
    instruments utilized in trading activities consist predominantly
    of interest rate contracts, such as swap agreements, and forward
    and futures contracts related to foreign currencies, but have
    also included forward and futures contracts related to
    mortgage-backed securities and investments in U.S. Treasury
    and other government securities, mortgage-backed securities and
    mutual funds and, as previously described, a limited number of
    VRDBs. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and
    interest rate risk associated with trading activities by
    entering into offsetting trading positions. The amounts of gross
    and net trading positions, as well as the type of trading
    activities conducted by the Company, are subject to a
    well-defined series of potential loss exposure limits
    established by management and approved by M&T’s Board
    of Directors. However, as with any non-government guaranteed
    financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk
    associated with counterparties to the Company’s trading
    activities.

The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for
    trading purposes aggregated $11.7 billion at
    December 31, 2007 and $7.6 billion at
    December 31, 2006. The notional amounts of foreign currency
    and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading
    purposes totaled $801 million and $613 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Although the
    notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in
    the consolidated balance sheet, the fair values of all financial
    instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the
    consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of trading account
    assets and liabilities were $281 million and
    $143 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007 and
    $137 million and $65 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2006. Included in trading account assets at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $47 million and
    $45 million, respectively, of assets related to deferred
    compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of such assets are
    recorded as



trading account and foreign exchange gains in the consolidated
    statement of income. Included in other liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007 and 2006
    were $50 million and $49 million, respectively, of
    liabilities related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in
    the balances of such liabilities due to the valuation of
    allocated investment options to which the liabilities are
    indexed are recorded in “other costs of operations” in
    the consolidated statement of income.

Given the Company’s policies, limits and positions,
    management believes that the potential loss exposure to the
    Company resulting from market risk associated with trading
    activities was not material, however, as previously noted, the
    Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties
    to transactions associated with the Company’s trading
    activities. Additional information related to trading derivative
    contracts is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial
    Statements.

Capital

Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2007 totaled
    $6.5 billion and represented 10.00% of total assets,
    compared with $6.3 billion or 11.01% at December 31,
    2006 and $5.9 billion or 10.66% at December 31, 2005.
    On a per share basis, stockholders’ equity was $58.99 at
    December 31, 2007, up 4% from $56.94 at the
    2006 year-end and 13% higher than $52.39 at
    December 31, 2005. Tangible equity per share was $27.98 at
    December 31, 2007, compared with $28.57 and $25.91 at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In the
    calculation of tangible equity per share, stockholders’
    equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core
    deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred
    tax balances. A reconciliation of total stockholders’
    equity and tangible equity as of December 31, 2007, 2006
    and 2005 is presented in table 2. The ratio of average total
    stockholders’ equity to average total assets was 10.67%,
    10.82% and 10.71% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Stockholders’ equity reflects accumulated other
    comprehensive income or loss, which includes the net after-tax
    impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities
    classified as available for sale, gains or losses associated
    with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow
    hedges, and adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined
    benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Net unrealized
    losses on

available-for-sale

investment securities were $59 million, or $.54 per common
    share, at December 31, 2007, compared with losses of
    $25 million, or $.23 per share, at December 31, 2006
    and $49 million, or $.43 per share, at December 31,
    2005. Such unrealized losses are generally due to changes in
    interest rates

and/or

a
    temporary lack of liquidity in the market, and represent the
    difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the
    estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities
    classified as available for sale. Included in net unrealized
    losses on investment securities at December 31, 2007 were
    pre-tax unrealized losses of $58 million on privately
    issued mortgage-backed securities having a cost basis of
    $2.8 billion at December 31, 2007. As of that date,
    the Company believed it would receive all contractual principal
    and interest on such securities. The Company also had pre-tax
    net unrealized losses of $29 million on variable-rate
    preferred stock issuances of government-sponsored entities with
    a cost basis of $161 million at December 31, 2007.
    Substantially all of those unrealized losses occurred in
    late-2007. The Company concluded that as of December 31,
    2007 the impairment of such securities was the result of the
    housing market downturn and its impact on those
    government-sponsored agencies, requiring the recapitalization of
    their balance sheets through the issuance of new, high yielding
    preferred stock in December 2007, and that it was too soon to
    conclude that such unrealized losses represented an

other-than-temporary

impairment. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had the
    ability and intent to hold each of its impaired securities to
    recovery. The Company intends to closely monitor the performance
    of the privately issued mortgage-backed securities, the
    preferred stock of the government-sponsored agencies, and other
    securities to assess if changes in their underlying credit
    performance or other events cause the cost basis of these
    securities to become other than temporarily impaired. However,
    because the unrealized losses described have already been
    reflected in the financial statement values for investment
    securities and stockholders’ equity, any recognition of an

other-than-temporary

decline in value of these investment securities would have no
    effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition.

Also reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income is a
    gain of $1 million, representing the unamortized gain on
    the termination of an interest rate swap agreement designated as
    a cash flow hedge that was entered into in anticipation of the
    Company issuing senior notes payable in the second



quarter of 2007. In addition, net unrealized fair value losses
    associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash
    flow hedges were $10 million at December 31, 2007,
    representing approximately $.09 per share. There were no
    outstanding interest rate swap agreements designated as cash
    flow hedges at December 31, 2006 or 2005.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 effective
    December 31, 2006. Prior to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 158, the Company was required to recognize
    additional minimum pension liability amounts pursuant to the
    provisions of SFAS No. 87. Adjustments to reflect the
    funded status of defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement plans as required under SFAS No. 158,
    net of applicable tax effect, reduced accumulated other
    comprehensive income by $46 million, or $.42 per share, at
    December 31, 2007 and $28 million, or $.26 per share,
    at December 31, 2006. Similar adjustments to recognize
    minimum pension liabilities as then required by
    SFAS No. 87, net of applicable tax effect, reduced
    stockholders’ equity by $49 million at
    December 31, 2005, or by $.44 per share. Information about
    the funded status of the Company’s pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans is included in note 11 of
    Notes to Financial Statements.

Cash dividends paid in 2007 on M&T’s common stock
    totaled $282 million, compared with $250 million and
    $199 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. M&T
    increased the quarterly dividend on its common stock in the
    second quarter of 2005 from $.40 to $.45 per share, again in the
    second quarter of 2006 to $.60 per share, and to $.70 per share
    in the third quarter of 2007. Dividends per common share totaled
    $2.60 in 2007, up 16% from $2.25 in 2006 and 49% above $1.75 in
    2005.

M&T repurchased 4,514,800 shares of its common stock
    in 2007, 3,259,000 shares in 2006 and 4,891,800 shares
    in 2005 at a cost of $509 million, $374 million and
    $510 million, respectively. In December 2004 and November
    2005, M&T had announced plans to purchase up to
    5,000,000 shares of its common stock. These repurchase
    plans were completed in December 2005 and March 2007,
    respectively. In February 2007, M&T announced that it had
    been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up to an
    additional 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. Through
    December 31, 2007, M&T had repurchased a total of
    2,818,500 shares of common stock pursuant to such plan at
    an average cost of $108.30 per share.

Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to
    maintain “core capital” and “total capital”
    ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk-adjusted
    total assets. In addition to the risk-based measures, Federal
    bank regulators have also implemented a minimum
    “leverage” ratio guideline of 3% of the quarterly
    average of total assets. As of December 31, 2007, core
    capital included $721 million of the trust preferred
    securities described in note 9 of Notes to Financial
    Statements and total capital further included $1.7 billion
    of subordinated notes. As previously noted, in December 2007,
    M&T Bank issued $400 million of 6.625% fixed rate
    subordinated notes due 2017. The capital ratios of the Company
    and its banking subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and
    2006 are presented in note 22 of Notes to Financial
    Statements. To further supplement its regulatory capital, in
    January 2008, M&T issued $350 million of Enhanced
    Trust Preferred Securities that pay a fixed rate of
    interest of 8.50%.

The Company generates significant amounts of regulatory capital.
    The rate of regulatory core capital generation, or net operating
    income (as previously defined) less the sum of dividends paid
    and the after-tax effect of merger-related expenses expressed as
    a percentage of regulatory “core capital” at the
    beginning of each year, was 10.73% in 2007, 17.52% in 2006 and
    18.50% in 2005.

Fourth
    Quarter Results

Net income totaled $65 million during the fourth quarter of
    2007, compared with $213 million in the year-earlier
    quarter. Diluted and basic earnings per share were each $.60 in
    the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with $1.88 and $1.93,
    respectively, in the final quarter of 2006. The annualized rates
    of return on average assets and average common
    stockholders’ equity for the fourth quarter of 2007 were
    .42% and 4.05%, respectively, compared with 1.50% and 13.55%,
    respectively, in the year-earlier period.

Net operating income aggregated $84 million in the fourth
    quarter of 2007, compared with $225 million in the last
    quarter of 2006. Diluted net operating earnings per share were
    $.77 in the recently completed quarter, compared with $1.98 in
    the fourth quarter of 2006. The annualized net operating returns
    on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity
    were .57% and 10.49%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of
    2007, compared with 1.67% and 28.71%, respectively, in the



corresponding 2006 quarter. Core deposit and other intangible
    asset amortization, after tax effect, totaled $10 million
    ($.09 per diluted share) and $11 million ($.10 per diluted
    share) in the fourth quarters of 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    The after-tax impact of merger-related expenses associated with
    the Partners Trust and First Horizon acquisition transactions
    was $9 million ($15 million pre-tax) or $.08 of
    diluted earnings per share in the final 2007 quarter. There were
    no similar expenses in the fourth quarter of 2006.
    Reconciliations of GAAP results with non-GAAP results for the
    quarterly periods of 2007 and 2006 are provided in table 21.

The Company’s fourth quarter results were adversely
    impacted by several notable items including the
    $127 million

other-than-temporary

impairment charge related to collateralized debt obligations,
    the $23 million accrual related to Covered Litigation of
    Visa, and $15 million of merger-related expenses associated
    with acquisitions completed in the quarter. Furthermore, the
    Company experienced significant loan growth during the second
    half and fourth quarter of 2007. Total loans, exclusive of loans
    obtained through the two acquisition transactions, increased
    $2.8 billion, or 6% (13% annualized), from June 30 to
    December 31, 2007, including growth in commercial and
    commercial real estate loans of $2.2 billion. During the
    fourth quarter, total loans, exclusive of loans obtained through
    the acquisitions, increased $1.8 billion, or 4% (16%
    annualized), including growth in commercial and commercial real
    estate loans of $1.6 billion. During the second half of
    2007, lower real estate values and higher levels of
    delinquencies and charge-offs contributed to increased losses in
    the Company’s portfolio of Alt-A residential mortgage
    loans. Declining real estate values also contributed to the
    recognition of additional losses on loans to two residential
    real estate builders and developers. Considering each of these
    factors, the Company increased the provision for credit losses
    to $101 million, or $48 million more than the
    $53 million of net charge-offs during the recent quarter.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 1% to
    $476 million in the last quarter of 2007 from
    $472 million in the year-earlier quarter. That growth was
    the result of a 9% rise in average earning assets, that was
    substantially offset by a narrowing of the Company’s net
    interest margin. Average earning assets totaled
    $54.8 billion in the final quarter of 2007, compared with
    $50.2 billion in the year-earlier period. The acquisitions
    completed in 2007’s final quarter added approximately
    $1.1 billion to average earning assets for the quarter,
    including $742 million of average loans. Average loans and
    leases for the recently completed quarter totaled
    $46.1 billion, up 8% from $42.5 billion during the
    final quarter of 2006. Increases of $1.0 billion in each of
    commercial loans and leases and commercial real estate loans, a
    $790 million rise in residential real estate loans, and a
    $795 million increase in consumer loans represented the
    growth in average loans outstanding. The yield on earning assets
    was 6.65% in the fourth quarter of 2007, down 27 basis
    points from 6.92% in the fourth quarter of 2006. The rate paid
    on interest-bearing liabilities was 3.75% in the last quarter of
    2007, 8 basis points lower than 3.83% in the corresponding
    period in 2006. The resulting net interest spread was 2.90% in
    the recent quarter, down 19 basis points from 3.09% in the
    fourth quarter of 2006. That decline was attributable to several
    factors, including significantly higher loan balances funded
    partially by wholesale borrowings, higher levels of investment
    securities and other earning assets that generally yield less
    than loans, lower commercial real estate loan prepayment fees,
    reversal of interest on nonaccrual loans including the effect of
    the change in accounting practice for past-due residential real
    estate loans, and the impact of the two acquisition
    transactions. The contribution of net interest-free funds to the
    Company’s net interest margin was .55% in the final 2007
    quarter, down from .64% in the year-earlier quarter. That
    decline reflects the impact of lower interest rates on
    interest-bearing liabilities used to value such contribution and
    a lower balance of interest-free funds. As a result, the
    Company’s net interest margin narrowed to 3.45% in the
    recent quarter from 3.73% in the last quarter of 2006.

As noted above, the provision for credit losses rose to
    $101 million during the three-month period ended
    December 31, 2007 from $28 million in the year-earlier
    period. The higher level of the provision reflects changes in
    the loan portfolio, the impact of declining residential real
    estate valuations and higher delinquencies and charge-offs
    related to the Alt-A residential real estate loan portfolio, and
    declining real estate values related to residential real estate
    builder and developer loan collateral. Net charge-offs of loans
    were $53 million in 2007’s fourth quarter,
    representing an annualized .46% of average loans and leases
    outstanding, compared with $24 million or .23% during the
    final three months of 2006. The impact of the recent
    quarter’s change in accounting procedure for charging-off
    residential real estate



loans when they become 150 days delinquent from the
    previous policy of waiting until foreclosure of the underlying
    property was $15 million. If not for that change,
    charge-offs would have been $38 million or an annualized
    .33% of average outstanding loans in the fourth quarter of 2007.
    The increase from the year-earlier period was due, in part, to
    higher charge-offs of Alt-A loans.

Other income totaled $160 million in the last quarter of
    2007, down 37% from $256 million in the year-earlier
    quarter. That decline resulted from the $127 million

other-than-temporary

impairment charge in the recent quarter related to
    collateralized debt obligations held in the Company’s

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio. Excluding that charge, other
    income was $288 million, up 12% from the year-earlier
    quarter. That improvement was due to higher service charges on
    deposit accounts, trust income, and trading account and foreign
    exchange gains, and $15 million related to M&T’s
    pro-rata portion of the operating results of BLG.

Other expense in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased to
    $445 million from $384 million in the year-earlier
    quarter. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be
    “nonoperating” in nature consisting of amortization of
    core deposit and other intangible assets of $16 million and
    $19 million in the final quarter of 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, and merger-related expenses of $15 million in
    the fourth quarter of 2007. Exclusive of these nonoperating
    expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $415 million
    in the recently completed quarter, up 14% from $365 million
    in the last three months of 2006. Higher costs for salaries and
    benefits, including the impact of the acquisitions completed in
    the recent quarter, and the Visa litigation charge were the
    leading contributors to that rise in operating expense. The
    Company’s efficiency ratio during the fourth quarter of
    2007 and 2006 was 54.3% and 50.2%, respectively. Table 21
    includes a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest
    operating expense for each of the quarters of 2007 and 2006.

Segment
    Information

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131,
    “Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
    Information,” the Company’s reportable segments have
    been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting
    system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain
    strategic business units have been combined for segment
    information reporting purposes where the nature of the products
    and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of
    those products and services are similar. The reportable segments
    are Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real
    Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking,
    and Retail Banking. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the
    Company began reporting its Business Banking strategic business
    unit as a separate reportable segment. Prior to that date, that
    unit was included in the Retail Banking reportable segment.
    Prior year information has been restated to reflect the change
    in reportable segments.

The financial information of the Company’s segments was
    compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in
    note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management
    accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment
    financial information are highly subjective and, unlike
    financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance
    similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the
    financial information of the reported segments are not
    necessarily comparable with similar information reported by
    other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management
    structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result
    in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial
    information about the Company’s segments is presented in
    note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Business Banking segment provides a wide range of services
    to small businesses and professionals through the Company’s
    branch network, business banking centers and other delivery
    channels such as telephone banking, Internet banking and
    automated teller machines within markets served by the Company.
    Services provided by this segment include various business loans
    and leases, including loans guaranteed by the Small Business
    Administration, business credit cards, deposit products, and
    financial services such as cash management, payroll and direct
    deposit, merchant credit card and letters of credit. Net income
    for the Business Banking segment totaled $133 million in
    2007, up 3% from the $128 million earned in 2006. The
    improvement from a year earlier was largely the result of a
    $15 million increase in net interest income, attributable
    to a 38 basis point widening of the deposit net interest
    margin, and higher service charges on deposit accounts of
    $3 million. Those factors were partially offset by
    $4 million increases in each of personnel costs and the
    provision for credit losses. The Business



Banking segment’s net income was $115 million in 2005.
    The most significant contributor to the improvement from 2005 to
    2006 was a $35 million increase in net interest income,
    largely due to an 87 basis point widening of the deposit
    net interest margin. Partially offsetting that increase were
    higher noninterest expenses of $7 million, mainly the
    result of higher personnel costs, and a $6 million increase
    in the provision for credit losses due to higher net charge-offs
    of loans.

The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit
    products and banking services for middle-market and large
    commercial customers, largely within the markets served by the
    Company. Services provided by this segment include commercial
    lending and leasing, deposit products, and cash management
    services. The Commercial Banking segment’s net income
    increased 2% to $231 million in 2007 from $226 million
    in 2006. Contributing to that improvement was higher net
    interest income of $11 million, attributable to a
    $953 million increase in average loan balances outstanding
    offset, in part, by a 32 basis point narrowing of the net
    interest margin, and increases in fees received for providing
    corporate advisory and loan syndication services of
    $4 million each. Partially offsetting those favorable
    factors were a $7 million rise in the provision for credit
    losses, largely attributable to loan growth, and higher
    personnel costs of $5 million. Net income earned by the
    Commercial Banking segment was $219 million in 2005. The
    improvement in 2006 as compared with 2005 was primarily the
    result of a $25 million rise in net interest income,
    partially offset by higher noninterest expenses, most
    significantly personnel costs that were up $7 million. The
    higher net interest income was predominantly due to a widening
    of the net interest margin and an 8% increase in average loan
    balances outstanding, offset, in part, by the impact of a 17%
    decrease in average demand deposit balances.

The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit
    services to its customers. Real estate securing loans in this
    segment is generally located in the New York City metropolitan
    area, upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of
    Columbia, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and the
    northwestern portion of the United States. Commercial real
    estate loans may be secured by apartment/multifamily buildings;
    office, retail and industrial space; or other types of
    collateral. Activities of this segment also include the
    origination, sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans
    through the FNMA DUS program and other programs. The Commercial
    Real Estate segment recorded net income of $135 million in
    each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. When
    comparing 2007’s results with 2006, a rise in net interest
    income of $6 million was offset by a higher provision for
    credit losses of $4 million and a $2 million increase
    in personnel costs. The higher net interest income resulted from
    a $426 million increase in average loan balances
    outstanding, net of a 10 basis point narrowing of the net
    interest margin associated with such balances. This segment
    contributed net income of $143 million in 2005. The decline
    in 2006’s net income as compared with 2005 was the result
    of an $8 million decrease in net interest income,
    predominantly due to a narrowing of net interest margin on loans
    outstanding, higher noninterest expenses of $6 million and
    lower commercial mortgage credit-related fees and other revenues
    of $4 million.

The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and
    trading securities, residential mortgage loans and other assets;
    short-term and long-term borrowed funds; brokered certificates
    of deposit and interest rate swap agreements related thereto;
    and offshore branch deposits. This segment also provides foreign
    exchange services to customers. Included in the assets of the
    Discretionary Portfolio segment are the collateralized debt
    obligations and preferred stock issuances of FNMA and FHLMC
    owned by the Company. In March 2007, the Company transferred
    $883 million of Alt-A mortgage loans to this segment’s

held-for-investment

loan portfolio. Such loans were previously included in loans
    held for sale in the Residential Mortgage Banking segment. The
    Discretionary Portfolio segment incurred a net loss of
    $7 million in 2007, compared with net income of
    $96 million in 2006. The main factor resulting in the
    unfavorable performance in 2007 was the $127 million

other-than-temporary

impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter related to
    collateralized debt obligations backed by

sub-prime

residential mortgage securities. As previously discussed, the
    impairment charge was recognized in light of significant
    deterioration in the residential real estate market and the
    resulting decline in market value of the debt obligations. Also
    contributing to the decline in this segment’s results when
    compared with 2006 was a $26 million increase in the
    provision for credit losses, primarily resulting from increased
    loan balances and higher net charge-offs of Alt-A mortgage
    loans, and the $13 million gain recognized in 2006
    resulting from the accelerated recognition of a purchase
    accounting premium related to the call of an FHLB



borrowing assumed in a previous acquisition. The Discretionary
    Portfolio segment’s net income in 2006 was 3% above the
    $93 million earned in 2005. Contributing to the improvement
    was the $29 million

other-than-temporary

impairment charge related to the preferred stock issuances of
    FNMA and FHLMC reflected in 2005’s results and the
    previously mentioned $13 million FHLB gain in 2006.
    Partially offsetting the favorable impact of those factors was a
    $39 million decrease in net interest income, resulting from
    a 58 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on
    investment securities and a $470 million decline in the
    average balance of the segment’s portfolio of investment
    securities.

The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services
    residential mortgage loans and sells substantially all of those
    loans in the secondary market to investors or to the
    Discretionary Portfolio segment. This segment also originates
    and services loans to developers of residential real estate
    properties. In addition to the geographic regions served by or
    contiguous with the Company’s branch network, the Company
    maintains mortgage loan origination offices in several states
    throughout the southern and western United States. The Company
    also periodically purchases the rights to service mortgage
    loans. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are included in
    this segment. As already noted, in the first quarter of 2007,
    $883 million of Alt-A mortgage loans previously included in
    this segment’s

held-for-sale

portfolio, were transferred to the Discretionary Portfolio
    segment. The Residential Mortgage Banking segment’s net
    income declined 74% to $13 million in 2007 from
    $52 million in 2006. That decline was primarily due to the
    significant deterioration of the residential real estate market
    during 2007, which resulted in a $36 million drop in
    residential mortgage banking revenues earned by this segment.
    Contributing to the lower mortgage banking revenues were lower
    gains from residential mortgage loan origination and sales
    activities of $28 million, predominantly resulting from
    slimmer margins realized due to changes in market conditions,
    and the $12 million of losses recognized in the first
    quarter of 2007 related to the Alt-A loans transferred to the
    Discretionary Portfolio segment. Additionally, due to requests
    from investors for the Company to repurchase residential real
    estate loans previously sold, the Company reduced mortgage
    banking revenues by $6 million in the first quarter of 2007
    to reflect declines in market values of some loans that the
    Company may be required to repurchase. Also contributing to the
    unfavorable performance as compared with 2006 was a
    $19 million decrease in net interest income, largely due to
    a $451 million decline in average loan balances outstanding
    and a 25 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin
    on such loans, and reversals of a portion of the valuation
    allowance for the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing
    rights, which totaled $4 million and $10 million in
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Partially offsetting those
    unfavorable factors were higher mortgage servicing revenues of
    $10 million. The Residential Mortgage Banking segment
    contributed net income of $43 million in 2005. The improved
    performance in 2006 over 2005 was predominantly due to an 11%
    increase in noninterest revenues resulting from higher income
    from servicing mortgage loans of $10 million and increased
    gains from the sales of loans to the Discretionary Portfolio
    segment of $9 million. Also contributing to the improvement
    was an $8 million increase in net interest income, mainly
    due to a 30% increase in balances of loans held for sale, net of
    a 52 basis point decline in net interest margin associated
    with such loan balances. Partially offsetting these favorable
    factors were higher personnel costs of $8 million and other
    noninterest expenses of $4 million. Included in noninterest
    expenses for 2005 was a partial reversal of the capitalized
    mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance of $8 million.

The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of services to
    consumers through several delivery channels which include branch
    offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and
    Internet banking. The Company has branch offices in New York
    State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the District of
    Columbia, West Virginia, Delaware and New Jersey. The Retail
    Banking segment also offers certain deposit and loan products on
    a nationwide basis through M&T Bank, N.A. Credit services
    offered by this segment include consumer installment loans,
    student loans, automobile loans (originated both directly and
    indirectly through dealers), and home equity loans and lines of
    credit. The segment also offers to its customers deposit
    products, including demand, savings and time accounts;
    investment products, including mutual funds and annuities; and
    other services. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the
    Retail Banking segment contributed net income of
    $316 million, compared with $282 million in 2006. The
    12% improvement resulted from a $60 million increase in net
    interest income, primarily the result of a 30 basis point
    increase in the deposit net interest margin, and higher service
    charges on deposit accounts of $25 million. Partially
    offsetting those factors was a $20 million increase in the



provision for credit losses resulting from higher average loan
    balances outstanding and net charge-offs and a $4 million
    increase in other noninterest expenses, largely due to higher
    processing costs related to debit card transactions. Net income
    for the Retail Banking segment aggregated $210 million in
    2005. The improved performance in 2006 as compared with 2005 was
    primarily due to an increase in net interest income of
    $84 million, largely resulting from a widening of the net
    interest margin on deposit products. Also contributing to the
    improvement were higher service charges on deposit accounts of
    $17 million, and declines of $9 million in each of the
    provision for credit losses and in other noninterest expenses.

The “All Other” category reflects other activities of
    the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported
    segments as determined in accordance with
    SFAS No. 131, such as the M&T Investment Group,
    which includes the Company’s trust, brokerage and insurance
    businesses. Also reflected in this category are the amortization
    of core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from the
    acquisitions of financial institutions, M&T’s equity
    in the earnings of BLG; merger-related expenses resulting from
    acquisitions and the net impact of the Company’s allocation
    methodologies for internal funds transfer pricing and the
    provision for credit losses. The various components of the
    “All Other” category resulted in net losses of
    $167 million, $80 million and $41 million in
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The higher net loss
    experienced in 2007 resulted from the impact of the
    Company’s allocation methodologies for internal transfers
    for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets
    and interest-bearing liabilities of the Company’s
    reportable segments and the provision for credit losses; the
    previously discussed $23 million charge taken in the fourth
    quarter related to Visa litigation; increases in personnel and
    professional services costs of $19 million and
    $12 million, respectively, related to the business and
    support units included in the “All Other” category;
    $15 million of merger-related expenses in 2007 associated
    with the fourth quarter acquisition transactions, compared with
    $5 million in 2006 for that year’s June branch
    acquisition; a $4 million reduction of net income resulting
    from M&T’s investment in BLG (inclusive of interest
    expense to fund that investment); and a higher charge for the
    amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets. The
    $18 million charitable contribution made to The M&T
    Charitable Foundation in 2006 partially offset those unfavorable
    factors. The higher net loss incurred during 2006 as compared
    with 2005 was primarily the result of the Company’s
    allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding
    charges and credits associated with earning assets and
    interest-bearing liabilities of the Company’s reportable
    segments. Also contributing to the net loss were the previously
    mentioned $18 million charitable contribution and higher
    charges for amortization of core deposit and other intangible
    assets and merger-related expenses incurred as a result of the
    June 2006 branch acquisition of $6 million and
    $5 million, respectively.

Recent
    Accounting Developments

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to fair value
    measurements required or permitted under other accounting
    pronouncements, but does not require any new fair value
    measurements. The definition of fair value is clarified by
    SFAS No. 157 to be the price that would be received to
    sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
    SFAS No. 157 expands disclosures about the use of fair
    value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual
    periods subsequent to initial recognition. The disclosures focus
    on the inputs used to measure fair value and the effect of the
    measurements on earnings for the period. SFAS No. 157
    is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. The provisions generally should be
    applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in
    which SFAS No. 157 is applied, with certain provisions
    required to be applied retrospectively. Many of the
    Company’s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet
    positions are required to either be accounted for or disclosed
    using fair value as their relevant measurement attribute. The
    Company adopted SFAS No. 157 effective January 1,
    2008. That adoption did not have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial position or results of operations.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities,” which permits entities to choose to measure
    eligible financial instruments and other items at fair value.
    The objective of SFAS No. 159 is to improve financial
    reporting by providing entities



with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings
    caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently
    without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions.
    After adopting SFAS No. 159, an entity shall report
    unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value
    option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting
    date. The fair value option may generally be applied on an
    instrument by instrument basis and is an irrevocable election.
    SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an
    entity’s first fiscal year that begins after
    November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 159 generally permits
    prospective application to eligible items existing at the
    effective date. The Company has not made any fair value
    elections as of January 1, 2008.

In December 2007, the FASB issued a revised
    SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS No. 141R”). SFAS No. 141R
    retains the fundamental requirements of SFAS No. 141
    that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all
    business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for
    each business combination. SFAS No. 141R defines the
    acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more
    businesses in the business combination and establishes the
    acquisition date as the date the acquirer achieves control.
    SFAS No. 141R retains the guidance in
    SFAS No. 141 for identifying and recognizing
    intangible assets separately from goodwill. With limited
    exceptions, the statement requires an acquirer to recognize the
    assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling
    interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at
    their fair value as of that date. That replaces
    SFAS No. 141’s cost-allocation process, which
    required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the
    individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
    their estimated fair values. As a result, certain
    acquisition-related costs previously included in the cost of an
    acquisition will be required to be expensed as incurred. In
    addition, certain restructuring costs previously recognized as
    if they were an assumed liability from an acquisition, will be
    required to be expensed. SFAS No. 141R also requires
    the acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages
    (sometimes referred to as a step acquisition) to recognize the
    identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, at the full amounts of
    their fair values. SFAS No. 141R also requires an
    acquirer to recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    arising from contractual contingencies as of the acquisition
    date, measured at their acquisition-date fair values. An
    acquirer is required to recognize assets or liabilities arising
    from all other contingencies (noncontractual contingencies) as
    of the acquisition date, measured at their acquisition-date fair
    values, only if it is more likely than not that they meet the
    definition of an asset or a liability in FASB Concepts Statement
    No. 6, “Elements of Financial Statements.” The
    statement requires the acquirer to recognize goodwill as of the
    acquisition date measured as a residual, which in most types of
    business combinations will result in measuring goodwill as the
    excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of
    any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition
    date over the fair value of the identifiable net assets
    acquired. SFAS No. 141R also eliminates the
    recognition of a separate valuation allowance as of the
    acquisition date for assets acquired in a business combination
    that are measured at their acquisition-date fair values because
    the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows are included
    in the fair value measurement. SFAS No. 141R should be
    applied prospectively to business combinations for which the
    acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company is still
    evaluating the provisions of SFAS No. 141R, but
    believes that its adoption will significantly impact its
    accounting for any acquisitions it may consummate in 2009 and
    beyond.

Also in December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51.” A
    noncontrolling interest, sometimes called a minority interest,
    is a portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable,
    directly or indirectly, to a parent. SFAS No. 160
    requires that the ownership interest in subsidiaries held by
    parties other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled and
    presented in the consolidated statement of financial position
    within equity, but separate from the parent’s equity. The
    amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and
    to the noncontrolling interest is required to be clearly
    identified and presented on the face of the consolidated
    statement of income. SFAS No. 160 also requires
    entities to provide disclosures that clearly identify and
    distinguish between the interests of the parent and the
    interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160
    should be applied prospectively as of the beginning of a fiscal
    year beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier
    adoption is prohibited. The Company does not anticipate that the



adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have a significant
    impact to its reporting of its financial condition or results of
    its operations.

In November 2007, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
    (“SAB”) No. 109, which reverses previous
    conclusions expressed by the SEC staff regarding written loan
    commitments that are accounted for at fair value through
    earnings under GAAP. Specifically, the SEC staff now believes
    that the expected net future cash flows related to the
    associated servicing of the loan should be included in the fair
    value measurement of the derivative loan commitment. The
    expected net future cash flows related to the associated
    servicing of the loan that are included in the fair value
    measurement of a derivative loan commitment or a written loan
    commitment should be determined in the same manner that the fair
    value of a recognized servicing asset or liability is measured
    under SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities,” as amended by SFAS No. 156,
    “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets.” The
    SEC staff expects registrants to apply the accounting described
    in SAB No. 109 for loan commitments accounted for as
    derivatives that are issued or modified in fiscal quarters
    beginning after December 15, 2007. In accordance with the
    new guidance, the Company has adopted the provisions of
    SAB No. 109 effective January 1, 2008. As of
    December 31, 2007, the value ascribed to the previously
    excluded cash flows related to associated servicing of the loans
    was approximately $5 million. In accordance with
    SAB No. 105, the Company has not included this amount
    in the value of loan commitments accounted for as derivatives at
    December 31, 2007. Rather, recognition of such value will
    be deferred until the loans are actually sold or securitized.
    Had SAB No. 109 been in effect during 2007, such
    amounts would have been recognized in mortgage banking revenues
    in 2007. As a result of adopting SAB No. 109 on
    January 1, 2008, the Company expects that there will be an
    acceleration of the recognition of mortgage banking revenues to
    reflect the value ascribed to the associated servicing of the
    loans for all new or modified loan commitments accounted for as
    derivatives in the first quarter of 2008.

The Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) reached a
    final consensus on Issue

06-04,

“Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement
    Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance
    Arrangements” and on Issue

06-10,

“Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement
    Benefit Aspects of Collateral Assignment Split-Dollar Life
    Insurance Arrangements,” at its September 2006 and March
    2007 meetings, respectively. The EITF consensus for each issue
    stipulates that an agreement by an employer to share a portion
    of the proceeds of a life insurance policy with an employee
    during the postretirement period is a postretirement benefit
    arrangement required to be accounted for under
    SFAS No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,” or Accounting
    Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 12,
    “Omnibus Opinion — 1967.” Each consensus
    concludes that the purchase of a split-dollar life insurance
    policy does not constitute a settlement under
    SFAS No. 106 and, therefore, a liability for the
    postretirement obligation must be recognized under
    SFAS No. 106 if the benefit is offered under an
    arrangement that constitutes a plan or under APB No. 12 if
    it is not part of a plan. Issue

06-04

and
    Issue

06-10

are effective for annual or interim reporting periods beginning
    after December 15, 2007. The provisions of both Issue

06-04

and
    Issue

06-10

should be applied through either a cumulative effect adjustment
    to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption
    or retrospective application. The Company has endorsement and
    collateral assignment split-dollar life insurance policies that
    it inherited through certain acquisitions that are associated
    with individuals who are no longer active employees. The
    adoption of the provisions of Issue

06-04

and
    Issue

06-10

on January 1, 2008 did not have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Forward-Looking
    Statements

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations and other sections of this Annual
    Report contain forward-looking statements that are based on
    current expectations, estimates and projections about the
    Company’s business, management’s beliefs and
    assumptions made by management. These statements are not
    guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks,
    uncertainties and assumptions (“Future Factors”) which
    are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results
    may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in
    such forward-looking statements.



Future Factors include changes in interest rates, spreads on
    earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and interest
    rate sensitivity; prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit
    losses and market values on loans and other assets; sources of
    liquidity; common shares outstanding; common stock price
    volatility; fair value of and number of stock-based compensation
    awards to be issued in future periods; legislation affecting the
    financial services industry as a whole, and M&T and its
    subsidiaries individually or collectively, including tax
    legislation; regulatory supervision and oversight, including
    monetary policy and required capital levels; changes in
    accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory
    agencies; increasing price and product/service competition by
    competitors, including new entrants; rapid technological
    developments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce
    competitive new products and services on a timely,
    cost-effective basis; the mix of products/services; containing
    costs and expenses; governmental and public policy changes;
    protection and validity of intellectual property rights;
    reliance on large customers; technological, implementation and
    cost/financial risks in large, multi-year contracts; the outcome
    of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings,
    including tax-related examinations and other matters; continued
    availability of financing; financial resources in the amounts,
    at the times and on the terms required to support M&T and
    its subsidiaries’ future businesses; and material
    differences in the actual financial results of merger,
    acquisition and investment activities compared with
    M&T’s initial expectations, including the full
    realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements.

These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect
    the outcome of the forward-looking statements. In addition, such
    statements could be affected by general industry and market
    conditions and growth rates, general economic and political
    conditions, either nationally or in the states in which M&T
    and its subsidiaries do business, including interest rate and
    currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes and trends in the
    securities markets, and other Future Factors.

Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting at M&T
    Bank Corporation and subsidiaries (“the Company”).
    Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007 based on criteria described in
    “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on that assessment, management concluded that
    the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007.

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, that was engaged to express an opinion
    as to the fairness of presentation of such financial statements.
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was also engaged to assess the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting. The report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
    follows this report.

M&T BANK CORPORATION

Robert
    G. Wilmers

Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer

René
    F. Jones

Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and
    Stockholders of

M&T Bank Corporation

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of M&T Bank Corporation and its
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) at December 31, 2007
    and 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
    opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for these financial statements, for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting, included in the accompanying Report on Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
    express opinions on these financial statements and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements

1.

Significant
    accounting policies

M&T Bank Corporation (“M&T”) is a bank
    holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York. Through
    subsidiaries, M&T provides individuals, corporations and
    other businesses, and institutions with commercial and retail
    banking services, including loans and deposits, trust, mortgage
    banking, asset management, insurance and other financial
    services. Banking activities are largely focused on consumers
    residing in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and
    the District of Columbia and on small and medium-size businesses
    based in those areas. Banking services are also provided in
    Delaware, West Virginia and New Jersey, while certain
    subsidiaries also conduct activities in other states.

The accounting and reporting policies of M&T and
    subsidiaries (“the Company”) conform to generally
    accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and to general
    practices within the banking industry. The preparation of
    financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
    accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
    at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates. The more significant
    accounting policies are as follows:

Consolidation

Except as described in note 18, the consolidated financial
    statements include M&T and all of its subsidiaries. All
    significant intercompany accounts and transactions of
    consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.
    The financial statements of M&T included in note 25
    report investments in subsidiaries under the equity method.
    Information about some limited purpose entities that are
    affiliates of the Company but are not included in the
    consolidated financial statements appears in note 18.

Consolidated
    Statement of Cash Flows

For purposes of this statement, cash and due from banks and
    federal funds sold are considered cash and cash equivalents.

Securities
    purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under
    agreements to repurchase

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities
    sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as
    collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at
    amounts equal to the cash or other consideration exchanged. It
    is generally the Company’s policy to take possession of
    collateral pledged to secure agreements to resell.

Trading
    account

Financial instruments used for trading purposes are stated at
    fair value. Realized gains and losses and unrealized changes in
    fair value of financial instruments utilized in trading
    activities are included in trading account and foreign exchange
    gains in the consolidated statement of income.

Investment
    securities

Investments in debt securities are classified as held to
    maturity and stated at amortized cost when management has the
    positive intent and ability to hold such securities to maturity.
    Investments in other debt securities and equity securities
    having readily determinable fair values are classified as
    available for sale and stated at estimated fair value. Except
    for investment securities for which the Company has entered into
    a related fair value hedge, unrealized gains or losses on
    investment securities available for sale are reflected in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable
    income taxes.

Other securities are stated at cost and include stock of the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank
    of New York.

Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts for
    investment securities available for sale and held to maturity
    are included in interest income. The cost basis of individual
    securities is written down to estimated fair value through a
    charge to earnings when declines in value below amortized cost



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

are considered to be other than temporary. Realized gains and
    losses on the sales of investment securities are determined
    using the specific identification method.

Loans
    and leases

Interest income on loans is accrued on a level yield method.
    Loans are placed on nonaccrual status and previously accrued
    interest thereon is charged against income when principal or
    interest is delinquent 90 days, unless management
    determines that the loan status clearly warrants other
    treatment. Loan balances are charged off when it becomes evident
    that such balances are not fully collectible. Loan fees and
    certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and
    recognized as an interest yield adjustment over the life of the
    loan. Net deferred fees have been included in unearned discount
    as a reduction of loans outstanding. Commitments to sell real
    estate loans are utilized by the Company to hedge the exposure
    to changes in fair value of real estate loans held for sale. The
    carrying value of hedged real estate loans held for sale
    recorded in the consolidated balance sheet includes changes in
    estimated fair market value during the hedge period, typically
    from the date of close through the sale date. Valuation
    adjustments made on these loans and commitments are included in
    mortgage banking revenues.

Except for consumer and residential mortgage loans that are
    considered smaller balance homogenous loans and are evaluated
    collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired for
    purposes of applying Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 114, “Accounting by Creditors
    for Impairment of a Loan,” as amended, when, based on
    current information and events, it is probable that the Company
    will be unable to collect all amounts according to the
    contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is
    delinquent 90 days. Impaired loans are classified as either
    nonaccrual or as loans renegotiated at below market rates. Loans
    less than 90 days delinquent are deemed to have an
    insignificant delay in payment and are generally not considered
    impaired for purposes of applying SFAS No. 114.
    Impairment of a loan is measured based on the present value of
    expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s
    effective interest rate, the loan’s observable market
    price, or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral
    dependent. Interest received on impaired loans placed on
    nonaccrual status is applied to reduce the carrying value of the
    loan or, if principal is considered fully collectible,
    recognized as interest income.

Residual value estimates for commercial leases are generally
    determined through internal or external reviews of the leased
    property. The Company reviews commercial lease residual values
    at least annually and recognizes residual value impairments
    deemed to be other than temporary. Initial estimates of residual
    value for automobile leases are recorded based on published
    industry standards and historical residual value losses incurred
    relative to the published industry standards. Automobile leases
    are considered small homogenous leases and, as such, impairments
    to residual value are determined based on projected residual
    value losses relative to the initially recorded residual values.

Allowance
    for credit losses

The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in
    management’s judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit
    losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the
    balance sheet date. The adequacy of the allowance is determined
    by management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio
    based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated
    with each loan category, the current financial condition of
    specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers
    operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any
    collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any
    guarantees or indemnifications.

Premises
    and equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation expense is computed principally using
    the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets.

Capitalized
    servicing rights

Capitalized servicing assets are included in other assets in the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Effective
    January 1, 2007, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of
    Financial Assets — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 140,” which requires that all separately
    recognized



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

servicing assets be initially measured at fair value and permits
    an entity to choose its subsequent measurement method for each
    class of separately recognized servicing assets as either the
    amortization method or fair value method. M&T has not
    elected to subsequently measure any of its capitalized servicing
    rights at fair value, but rather uses the amortization method
    under which capitalized servicing assets are charged to expense
    in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing
    income. Prior to January 1, 2007, the Company initially
    measured servicing assets retained in sales and securitization
    transactions for which it was the transferor under the relative
    fair value method prescribed in SFAS No. 140,
    “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities,” and subsequently
    charged such assets to expense using the amortization method.

To estimate the fair value of servicing rights, the Company
    considers market prices for similar assets and the present value
    of expected future cash flows associated with the servicing
    rights calculated using assumptions that market participants
    would use in estimating future servicing income and expense.
    Such assumptions include estimates of the cost of servicing
    loans, loan default rates, an appropriate discount rate, and
    prepayment speeds. For purposes of evaluating and measuring
    impairment of capitalized servicing rights, the Company
    stratifies such assets based on the predominant risk
    characteristics of the underlying financial instruments that are
    expected to have the most impact on projected prepayments, cost
    of servicing and other factors affecting future cash flows
    associated with the servicing rights. Such factors may include
    financial asset or loan type, note rate and term. The amount of
    impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value
    of the capitalized servicing rights for a stratum exceeds
    estimated fair value. Impairment is recognized through a
    valuation allowance.

Sales
    and securitizations of financial assets

Transfers of financial assets for which the Company has
    surrendered control of the financial assets are accounted for as
    sales to the extent that consideration other than beneficial
    interests in the transferred assets is received in exchange.
    Interests in a sale or securitization of financial assets that
    continue to be held by the Company, other than servicing rights
    which as of January 1, 2007 are initially measured at fair
    value, are measured at the date of transfer by allocating the
    previous carrying amount between the assets transferred and the
    retained interests based on their relative estimated fair
    values. The fair values of retained debt securities are
    generally determined through reference to independent pricing
    information. The fair values of retained servicing rights and
    any other retained interests are determined based on the present
    value of expected future cash flows associated with those
    interests and by reference to market prices for similar assets.

Goodwill
    and core deposit and other intangible assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity
    over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
    Similar to goodwill, other intangible assets, which include core
    deposit intangibles, also lack physical substance but, as
    required by SFAS No. 141, “Business
    Combinations,” portions of the cost of an acquired entity
    have been assigned to such assets. The Company accounts for
    goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with
    SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets,” which, in general, requires that goodwill not be
    amortized, but rather that it be tested for impairment at least
    annually at the reporting unit level, which is either at the
    same level or one level below an operating segment. Other
    acquired intangible assets with finite lives, such as core
    deposit intangibles, are required to be amortized over their
    estimated lives. Core deposit and other intangible assets are
    generally amortized using accelerated methods over estimated
    useful lives of five to ten years. The Company periodically
    assesses whether events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amounts of core deposit and other intangible
    assets may be impaired.

Derivative
    financial instruments

The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in
    accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended.
    SFAS No. 133 requires that an entity recognize all
    derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet
    and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain
    conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated
    as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value
    of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash
    flows of a forecasted transaction or (c) a hedge of the
    foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign
    operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, an available for
    sale security, or a foreign currency denominated forecasted
    transaction. Pursuant to SFAS No. 133, the accounting
    for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the
    intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. An
    entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to
    establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use
    for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and
    the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect
    of the hedge. Those methods must be consistent with the
    entity’s approach to managing risk.

The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of
    the management of interest rate risk to modify the repricing
    characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities. For such agreements,
    amounts receivable or payable are recognized as accrued under
    the terms of the agreement and the net differential is recorded
    as an adjustment to interest income or expense of the related
    asset or liability. Interest rate swap agreements may be
    designated as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. In a
    fair value hedge, the fair values of the interest rate swap
    agreements and changes in the fair values of the hedged items
    are recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet
    with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current
    earnings. The difference between changes in the fair values of
    interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents
    hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in “other revenues
    from operations” in the Company’s consolidated
    statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, the effective portion
    of the derivative’s unrealized gain or loss is initially
    recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and
    subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted
    transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the
    unrealized gain or loss is reported in “other revenues from
    operations” immediately.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to
    hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of real estate
    loans held for sale. Commitments to originate real estate loans
    to be held for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans
    are generally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at
    estimated fair market value. However, in accordance with Staff
    Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 105,
    “Application of Accounting Principles to Loan
    Commitments,” issued by the United States Securities and
    Exchange Commission (“SEC”), value ascribable to cash
    flows that will be realized in connection with loan servicing
    activities has not been included in the determination of fair
    value of commitments to originate loans for sale. Value
    ascribable to that portion of cash flows is recognized at the
    time the underlying mortgage loans are sold.

Derivative instruments not related to mortgage banking
    activities, including financial futures commitments and interest
    rate swap agreements, that do not satisfy the hedge accounting
    requirements noted above are recorded at fair value and are
    generally classified as trading account assets or liabilities
    with resultant changes in fair value being recognized in trading
    account and foreign exchange gains in the Company’s
    consolidated statement of income.

Stock-based
    compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share Based
    Payment,” (“SFAS No. 123R”), an
    amendment of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation.” Prior to that date, the Company
    recognized expense for stock-based compensation using the fair
    value method of accounting described in SFAS No. 123.
    Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the vesting
    period of the stock-based grant based on the estimated grant
    date value of the stock-based compensation that is expected to
    vest, except that coincident with the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R, the Company began accelerating the
    recognition of compensation costs for stock-based awards granted
    to retirement-eligible employees and employees who will become
    retirement-eligible prior to full vesting of the award because
    the Company’s incentive compensation plan allows for
    vesting at the time an employee retires. Through
    December 31, 2005, stock-based compensation granted to such
    individuals was expensed over the normal vesting period and any
    remaining unrecognized compensation cost was recognized at the
    time an individual employee actually retired. Information on the
    determination of the estimated value of stock-based awards used
    to calculate stock-based compensation expense is included in
    note 10.

Income
    taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
    future tax effects attributable to differences between the
    financial statement value of existing assets and liabilities and
    their respective tax bases and carryforwards. Deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and
    laws.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial
    Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (“FIN”)
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes.” FIN No. 48 prescribes the accounting
    method to be applied to measure uncertainty in income taxes
    recognized under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
    Income Taxes.” FIN No. 48 established a
    recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
    financial statement recognition and measurement of an uncertain
    tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The
    evaluation of an uncertain tax position in accordance with
    FIN No. 48 is a two-step process. The first step is
    recognition, which requires a determination whether it is more
    likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon
    examination, including resolution of any related appeals or
    litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the
    position. The second step is measurement. Under the measurement
    step, a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not
    recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of
    benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being
    realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously
    failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold
    should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting
    period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax
    positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not
    recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first
    subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is
    no longer met. The adoption of FIN No. 48 did not
    result in any change to the Company’s liability for
    uncertain tax positions as of January 1, 2007. Information
    related to the adoption of FIN No. 48 is provided in
    note 12.

Earnings
    per common share

Basic earnings per share exclude dilution and are computed by
    dividing income available to common stockholders by the
    weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (exclusive
    of shares represented by the unvested portion of restricted
    stock grants) and common shares issuable under deferred
    compensation arrangements during the period. Diluted earnings
    per share reflect shares represented by the unvested portion of
    restricted stock grants and the potential dilution that could
    occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock
    were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the
    issuance of common stock that then shared in earnings. Proceeds
    assumed to have been received on such exercise or conversion are
    assumed to be used to purchase shares of M&T common stock
    at the average market price during the period, as required by
    the “treasury stock method” of accounting.

Treasury
    stock

Repurchases of shares of M&T common stock are recorded at
    cost as a reduction of stockholders’ equity. Reissuances of
    shares of treasury stock are recorded at average cost.

2.  Acquisitions

On November 30, 2007, M&T completed the acquisition of
    Partners Trust Financial Group, Inc. (“Partners
    Trust”), a bank holding company headquartered in Utica, New
    York. Partners Trust was merged with and into M&T on that
    date. Partners Trust Bank, the primary banking subsidiary
    of Partners Trust, was merged into Manufacturers and Traders
    Trust Company (“M&T Bank”), a wholly owned
    subsidiary of M&T, on that date. Partners Trust Bank
    operated 33 branch offices in upstate New York at the date of
    acquisition. The results of operations acquired in the Partners
    Trust transaction have been included in the Company’s
    financial results since November 30, 2007, but did not have
    a significant effect on the Company’s results of operations
    in 2007. After application of the election, allocation and
    proration procedures contained in the merger agreement with
    Partners Trust, M&T paid $282 million in cash and
    issued 3,096,861 shares of M&T common stock in
    exchange for Partners Trust shares and stock options outstanding
    at the time of acquisition. The purchase price was approximately
    $559 million based on the cash paid to Partners Trust
    shareholders, the fair value of M&T common stock exchanged,
    and the cash paid to holders of Partners Trust stock options.
    The acquisition of Partners Trust expands

M&T’s presence in upstate New York, making M&T
    Bank the deposit market share leader in the Utica-Rome and
    Binghamton markets, while strengthening its lead position in
    Syracuse.

Assets acquired from Partners Trust on November 30, 2007
    totaled $3.5 billion, including $2.2 billion of loans
    and leases (largely residential real estate and consumer loans),
    liabilities assumed aggregated $3.0 billion, including
    $2.2 billion of deposits (largely savings, money-market and
    time deposits), and $277 million was added to
    stockholders’ equity. In connection with the acquisition,
    the Company recorded approximately $288 million of goodwill
    and $50 million of core deposit intangible. The core
    deposit intangible is being amortized over 7 years using an
    accelerated method. Information regarding the allocation of
    goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition to the
    Company’s reportable segments, as well as the carrying
    amounts and amortization of core deposit and other intangible
    assets, is provided in note 8.

As a condition of the approval of the Partners Trust acquisition
    by regulators, M&T Bank was required to divest three branch
    offices in Binghamton, New York having approximately
    $95 million in deposits as of June 30, 2006. M&T
    Bank has reached an agreement to sell three branches in a
    transaction that is expected to close in 2008.

Pro forma information for the year ended December 31, 2007
    as if Partners Trust had been acquired on January 1, 2007
    is not presented since such pro forma results were not
    materially different from the Company’s actual results.

On December 7, 2007, M&T Bank acquired 13 branch
    offices in the Mid-Atlantic region from First Horizon Bank in a
    cash transaction. The offices had approximately
    $214 million of loans, $216 million of deposits and
    $80 million of trust and investment assets under management
    on the transaction date.

On June 30, 2006, M&T Bank acquired 21 branch offices
    in Buffalo and Rochester, New York from Citibank, N.A. in a cash
    transaction. The offices had approximately $269 million of
    loans and approximately $1.0 billion of deposits.

The Company incurred merger-related expenses related to systems
    conversions and other costs of integrating and conforming
    acquired operations with and into the Company of approximately
    $15 million ($9 million net of applicable income
    taxes) during 2007 and approximately $5 million
    ($3 million net of applicable income taxes) during 2006.
    There were no similar expenses in 2005. Those expenses consisted
    largely of professional services and other temporary help fees
    associated with the conversion of systems

and/or

integration of operations; costs related to branch and office
    consolidations; incentive compensation; initial marketing and
    promotion expenses designed to introduce the Company to
    customers of the acquired operations; travel costs; and
    printing, postage and supplies and other costs of commencing
    operations in new offices.

    Gross realized losses on investment securities were $381,000 in
    2007, $169,000 in 2006 and $414,000 in 2005. During 2007, the
    Company recognized a $127,300,000

other-than-temporary

impairment charge related to $131,700,000 of collateralized debt
    obligations purchased in March 2007 that were supported by
    sub-prime mortgage-backed securities. The impairment charge was
    recognized in light of significant deterioration of housing
    values in the residential real estate market, the significant
    rise in delinquencies and charge-offs of sub-prime mortgage
    loans and resulting decline in market value of collateralized
    debt obligations, in general, and specifically the steep decline
    in values of those debt obligations owned by the Company that
    are not expected to recover in the foreseeable future. Of the
    remaining collateralized debt obligations, $27,011,000 were
    obtained in the Partners Trust acquisition on November 30,
    2007 and are collateralized by trust preferred capital
    securities and subordinated notes of other banking companies.
    During 2005, the Company recognized a $29,183,000

The Company owned approximately six hundred individual
    investment securities with aggregate gross unrealized losses of
    $115,133,000 at December 31, 2007. Those investment
    securities consisted predominantly of mortgage-backed securities
    classified as available for sale. The unrealized losses on such
    securities at December 31, 2007 were generally attributable
    to the level of interest rates and a lack of liquidity in the
    market and, accordingly, were considered to be temporary in
    nature. The Company also had $30 million of unrealized
    losses on variable-rate preferred stock issuances of FNMA and
    FHLMC with a cost basis of $143 million at
    December 31, 2007. Substantially all of the decline in
    value of those securities occurred in late 2007, and the Company
    has concluded that the impairment of such securities at
    December 31, 2007 was the result of the recent issuance of
    new higher-yielding preferred stock by those
    government-sponsored agencies in response to the current housing
    market decline. As such, the Company believes it is too soon to
    conclude that such unrealized losses were other than temporary.
    As of December 31, 2007, the Company has the intent and
    ability to hold each of its impaired securities to recovery. At
    December 31, 2007, the Company had not identified events or
    changes in circumstance which may have a significant adverse
    effect on the fair value of the $506,388,000 of cost method
    investment securities.

At December 31, 2007, investment securities with a carrying
    value of $7,037,967,000, including $6,624,200,000 of investment
    securities available for sale, were pledged to secure demand
    notes issued to the U.S. Treasury, borrowings from various
    Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”), repurchase
    agreements, governmental deposits and interest rate swap
    agreements.

Investment securities pledged by the Company to secure
    obligations whereby the secured party is permitted by contract
    or custom to sell or repledge such collateral totaled
    $1,988,128,000 at December 31, 2007. The pledged securities
    are included in U.S. Treasury and federal agencies and
    mortgage-backed securities available for sale.

One-to-four

family residential mortgage loans held for sale were
    $774 million at December 31, 2007 and
    $1.9 billion at December 31, 2006. In March 2007, the
    Company transferred approximately $883 million of
    residential real estate loans (including $808 million of
    first mortgage loans and $75 million of second mortgage
    loans) from its

held-for-sale

loan portfolio to its

held-for-investment

portfolio. Those loans represented alternative
    (“Alt-A”) residential real estate loans that the
    Company had been actively originating for sale in the secondary
    market. Unfavorable market conditions and lack of market
    liquidity impacted the Company’s willingness to sell those
    loans. Accordingly, the Alt-A loans were transferred at the
    lower of cost or market value resulting in a reduction of the
    carrying value of the loans and mortgage banking revenues of
    $12 million. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale were
    $79 million at December 31, 2007 and $49 million
    at December 31, 2006. Included in consumer loans were home
    equity loans held for sale of $619 thousand at December 31,
    2007 and $65 million at December 31, 2006.

As of December 31, 2007, approximately $8 million of

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans serviced for others had been
    sold with credit recourse. As of December 31, 2007,
    approximately $1.0 billion of commercial mortgage loan
    balances serviced for others had been sold with recourse in
    conjunction with the Company’s participation in the FNMA
    Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (“DUS”) program.
    At December 31, 2007, the Company estimated that the
    recourse obligations described above were not material to the
    Company’s consolidated financial position. There have been
    no material losses incurred as a result of those credit recourse
    arrangements.

Nonperforming loans (loans on which interest was not being
    accrued or had been renegotiated at below-market interest rates)
    totaled $447,166,000 at December 31, 2007 and $224,228,000
    at December 31, 2006. If nonaccrual and renegotiated loans
    had been accruing interest at their originally contracted terms,
    interest income on such loans would have amounted to $36,207,000
    in 2007 and $17,173,000 in 2006. The actual amounts included in
    interest income during 2007 and 2006 on such loans were
    $12,492,000 and $6,770,000, respectively. Beginning in December
    2007, residential real estate loans previously classified as
    nonaccrual when payments were 180 days past due now stop
    accruing interest when principal or interest is delinquent
    90 days. The impact of the acceleration of the
    classification of residential real estate loans as nonaccrual
    resulted in an increase in nonaccrual loans of $84 million
    and a corresponding decrease in loans past due 90 days and
    accruing interest. As a result of that acceleration, previously
    accrued interest of $2 million was reversed and charged
    against interest income.

The recorded investment in loans considered impaired for
    purposes of applying SFAS No. 114 was $225,287,000 and
    $152,676,000 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    The recorded investment in loans considered impaired for which
    there was a related valuation allowance for impairment included
    in the allowance for credit losses and the amount of such
    impairment allowance were $183,488,000 and $55,050,000,
    respectively, at December 31, 2007 and $139,021,000 and
    $23,388,000, respectively, at December 31, 2006. The
    recorded investment in loans considered impaired for which there
    was no related valuation allowance for impairment was
    $41,799,000 and $13,655,000 at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The average recorded investment in impaired loans
    during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $195,597,000, $97,263,000 and
    $106,603,000, respectively. Interest income recognized on
    impaired loans totaled $7,368,000, $4,866,000 and $4,522,000 for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

Borrowings by directors and certain officers of M&T and its
    banking subsidiaries, and by associates of such persons,
    exclusive of loans aggregating less than $120,000, amounted to
    $221,202,000 and $158,032,000 at December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. During 2007, new borrowings by such persons
    amounted to $74,533,000 (including borrowings of new directors
    or officers that were outstanding at the time of their election)
    and repayments and other reductions (including reductions
    resulting from retirements) were $11,363,000.

At December 31, 2007, approximately $3.2 billion of
    commercial mortgage loans and $3.2 billion of

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans were pledged to secure
    outstanding borrowings. As described in note 18, as of
    December 31, 2007, $557 million of automobile loans
    and related assets were effectively pledged to secure a
    $500 million revolving structured borrowing.

The Company’s loan and lease portfolio includes
    (i) commercial lease financing receivables consisting of
    direct financing and leveraged leases for machinery and
    equipment, railroad equipment, commercial trucks and trailers,

Included within the estimated residual value of leased assets at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $55 million and
    $51 million, respectively, in residual value associated
    with direct financing leases that are guaranteed by the lessees.
    The Company is indemnified from loss by Allied Irish Banks,
    p.l.c. (“AIB”) on a portion of leveraged leases
    obtained in the acquisition of a former subsidiary of AIB on
    April 1, 2003 (see note 23). Amounts in the leveraged
    lease section of the table subject to such indemnification
    included lease payments receivable of $8 million and
    $9 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, and estimated residual value of leased assets of
    $31 million and unearned income of $8 million at each
    of those dates. For consumer automobile leases, substantially
    all residual values were insured by third parties for declines

Beginning in December 2007, the excess of residential real
    estate loan balances over the net realizable value of the
    property collateralizing the loan is charged off when the loans
    become 150 days delinquent, whereas previously the Company
    provided an allowance for credit losses for such amounts and
    charged-off loans upon foreclosure of the underlying property.

Charge-offs

in 2007 included $15 million related to this change in
    procedure. The effect of the change in the timing of recognizing
    those charge-offs did not have a material effect on the
    Company’s net income or on its financial position.

Residential mortgage loans serviced for others were
    $14.5 billion, $13.4 billion and $13.2 billion at
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Small
    balance commercial mortgage loans serviced for others were
    $4.9 billion, $3.3 billion and $2.4 billion at
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Commercial
    mortgage loans serviced for others were $5.3 billion,
    $4.9 billion and $4.3 billion at December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

During 2007, 2006 and 2005, $4,050,000, $9,750,000 and
    $11,078,000, respectively, of the valuation allowance for
    capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets was
    reversed because of increases in the market value of certain
    strata of servicing assets relative to the amortized cost basis
    of the servicing assets in such strata. The estimated fair value
    of capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets was
    approximately $135 million at December 31, 2007 and
    $147 million at December 31, 2006. The fair value of
    capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets was
    estimated using weighted-average discount rates of 16.1% and
    16.3% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and
    contemporaneous prepayment assumptions that vary by loan type.
    At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the discount rate
    represented a weighted-average option-adjusted spread
    (“OAS”) of 885 basis points (hundredths of one
    percent) and 1,050 basis points, respectively, over market
    implied forward London Interbank Offered Rates. The estimated
    fair value of capitalized small-balance commercial mortgage loan
    servicing assets was approximately $70 million at
    December 31, 2007 and $42 million at December 31,
    2006. The fair value of capitalized small-balance commercial
    loan servicing assets was estimated using weighted-average
    discount rates of 20.1% and 23.6% at December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively, and contemporaneous prepayment assumptions
    that vary by loan type. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    discount rate represented a weighted-average OAS of
    1,600 basis points and 1,900 basis points,
    respectively, over market



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

implied forward London Interbank
    Offered Rates. The estimated fair value of capitalized
    residential and small-balance commercial mortgage loan servicing
    rights may vary significantly in subsequent periods due to
    changing interest rates and the effect thereof on prepayment
    speeds. The estimated fair value of capitalized commercial
    mortgage loan servicing assets was approximately
    $25 million at both December 31, 2007 and 2006. An 18%
    discount rate was used to estimate the fair value of capitalized
    commercial mortgage loan servicing rights at December 31,
    2007 and 2006 with no prepayment assumptions because, in
    general, the servicing agreements allow the Company to share in
    customer loan prepayment fees and thereby recover the remaining
    carrying value of the capitalized servicing rights associated
    with such loan. The Company’s ability to realize the
    carrying value of capitalized commercial mortgage servicing
    rights is more dependent on the borrowers’ abilities to
    repay the underlying loans than on prepayments or changes in
    interest rates.

The key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of
    capitalized servicing rights at December 31, 2007 and the
    sensitivity of such value to changes in those assumptions are
    summarized in the table that follows. Those calculated
    sensitivities are hypothetical and actual changes in the fair
    value of capitalized servicing rights may differ significantly
    from the amounts presented herein. The effect of a variation in
    a particular assumption on the fair value of the servicing
    rights is calculated without changing any other assumption. In
    reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another
    which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities. The changes
    in assumptions are presumed to be instantaneous.

Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets was
    generally computed using accelerated methods over original
    amortization periods of five to ten years. The weighted-average
    original amortization period was approximately eight years. The
    remaining weighted-average amortization period as of
    December 31, 2007 was approximately seven years.
    Amortization expense for core deposit and other intangible
    assets was $66,486,000, $63,008,000, and $56,805,000 for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Estimated amortization expense in future years for such
    intangible assets is as follows:

Also in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 142, the Company completed annual goodwill
    impairment tests as of October 1, 2005, 2006 and 2007. For
    purposes of testing for impairment, the Company assigned all
    recorded goodwill to the reporting units originally intended to
    benefit from past business combinations. Goodwill was generally
    assigned based on the implied fair value of the acquired
    goodwill applicable to the benefited reporting units at the time
    of each respective acquisition. The implied fair value of the
    goodwill was determined as the difference between the estimated
    incremental overall fair value of the reporting unit and the
    estimated fair value of the net assets assigned to the reporting
    unit as of each respective acquisition date. To test for
    goodwill impairment at each evaluation date, the Company
    compared the estimated fair value of each of its reporting units
    to their respective carrying amounts and certain other assets
    and liabilities assigned to the reporting unit, including
    goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets. The
    methodologies used to estimate fair values of reporting units as
    of the acquisition dates and as of the evaluation dates were
    similar. For the Company’s core customer relationship
    business reporting units, fair value was estimated as the
    present value of the expected future cash flows of the reporting
    unit. The Company’s non-relationship business reporting
    units were individually analyzed and fair value was largely
    determined by comparisons to market transactions for similar
    businesses. Based on the results of the goodwill impairment
    tests, the Company concluded that the amount of recorded
    goodwill was not impaired at the respective testing dates.

A summary of goodwill assigned to each of the Company’s
    reportable segments for purposes of testing for impairment was

The subordinated notes of M&T Bank are unsecured and are
    subordinate to the claims of depositors and other creditors of
    M&T Bank. In December 2007, M&T Bank issued
    $400 million of subordinated notes which bear a fixed rate
    of interest of 6.625% and mature in December 2017. In December
    2006, M&T Bank issued $500 million of subordinated
    notes which bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.629% until
    December 2016 and a floating rate thereafter until maturity in
    December 2021, at a rate equal to the three-month London
    Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus .64%. Beginning
    December 2016, M&T Bank may, at its option and subject to
    prior regulatory approval, redeem some or all of the notes on
    any interest payment date. The subordinated notes due 2020 bear
    a fixed rate of interest of 5.585% until December 2015 and a
    floating rate of interest thereafter until maturity in December
    2020, at a rate equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 1.215%.
    Beginning December 2015, M&T Bank may, at its option and
    subject to prior regulatory approval, redeem some or all of the
    notes on any interest payment date. Those notes were issued as
    part of an exchange offer to holders of M&T Bank’s
    8% subordinated notes due October 2010. Coincident with the
    exchange, M&T Bank terminated $363 million of interest
    rate swap agreements that were used to hedge the
    8.0% subordinated notes that were exchanged. A

$15 million valuation adjustment on the previously hedged
    notes was included in the carrying value of the new subordinated
    notes due in 2020. That valuation adjustment is being amortized
    to interest expense over the period to expected maturity of the
    new notes. The unamortized balance of such valuation adjustment
    was $13 million and $14 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. The subordinated notes due in 2020
    have an effective rate of 7.76%. The subordinated notes due 2013
    bear a fixed rate of interest of 3.85% through March 2008
    and a floating rate of interest thereafter until maturity in
    April 2013, at a rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus
    1.50%. Beginning April 2008, M&T Bank may, at its
    option and subject to prior regulatory approval, redeem some or
    all of the notes on any interest payment date.

The subordinated notes of M&T are unsecured and subordinate
    to the general creditors of M&T. The senior medium term
    notes were issued in 1998 by Keystone Financial Mid-Atlantic
    Funding Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of M&T that was
    acquired in 2000. The notes provide for semi-annual interest
    payments at fixed rates of interest and are guaranteed by
    M&T.

The senior notes of M&T were issued in May 2007. The notes
    provide for semi-annual interest payments at a fixed rate of
    interest and mature in May 2012.

Long-term variable rate advances from the FHLB had contractual
    interest rates that ranged from 4.81% to 5.25% at
    December 31, 2007 and from 5.31% to 5.37% at
    December 31, 2006. The weighted-average contractual
    interest rates were 5.03% and 5.35% at December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively. Long-term fixed-rate advances from the
    FHLB had contractual interest rates ranging from 4.05% to 7.32%.
    The weighted-average contractual interest rates payable were
    5.18% and 5.52% at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Advances from the FHLB mature at various dates
    through 2029 and are secured by residential real estate loans,
    commercial real estate loans and investment securities.

Long-term agreements to repurchase securities had contractual
    interest rates that ranged from 3.91% to 5.14%. The
    weighted-average contractual interest rates were 4.21% and 4.24%
    at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The agreements
    outstanding at December 31, 2007 reflect various repurchase
    dates through 2017, however, the contractual maturities of the
    underlying investment securities extend beyond such repurchase
    dates.

M&T Capital Trust I (“Trust I”),
    M&T Capital Trust II (“Trust II”), and
    M&T Capital Trust III (“Trust III”)
    have issued fixed rate preferred capital securities aggregating
    $310 million. First Maryland Capital I
    (“Trust IV”) and First Maryland Capital II
    (“Trust V”) have issued floating rate preferred
    capital securities aggregating $300 million. The
    distribution rates on the preferred capital securities of
    Trust IV and Trust V adjust quarterly based on changes
    in the three-month LIBOR and were 6.24% and 5.76%, respectively,
    at December 31, 2007 and 6.37% and 6.22%, respectively, at
    December 31, 2006. As a result of the Partners Trust
    acquisition, M&T assumed responsibility for
    $31.5 million of similar preferred capital securities
    previously issued by special-purpose entities formed by Partners
    Trust consisting of $16.5 million of fixed rate preferred
    capital securities issued by BSB Capital Trust I
    (“Trust VI”) and $15 million of floating
    rate preferred capital securities issued by BSB Capital
    Trust III (“Trust VII”). The distribution
    rate on the preferred capital securities of Trust VII
    adjusts quarterly based on changes in the three-month LIBOR and
    was 8.59% at December 31, 2007. Trust I,
    Trust II, Trust III, Trust IV, Trust V,

The Junior Subordinated Debentures represent the sole assets of
    each Trust and payments under the Junior Subordinated Debentures
    are the sole source of cash flow for each Trust. The financial
    statement carrying values of junior subordinated debentures
    associated with preferred capital securities at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 of Trust III,
    Trust IV, Trust V, Trust VI and Trust VII
    include the unamortized portions of purchase accounting
    adjustments to reflect estimated fair value as of the date of
    M&T’s acquisition of the common securities of each
    respective trust. The interest rates payable on the Junior
    Subordinated Debentures of Trust IV, Trust V and
    Trust VII were 6.24%, 5.76% and 8.59%, respectively, at
    December 31, 2007 and for Trust IV and Trust V
    were 6.37% and 6.22%, respectively, at December 31, 2006.

Holders of the Capital Securities receive preferential
    cumulative cash distributions on each distribution date at the
    stated distribution rate unless M&T exercises its right to
    extend the payment of interest on the Junior Subordinated
    Debentures for up to ten semi-annual periods (in the case of
    Trust I, Trust II, Trust III and
    Trust VI) or twenty quarterly periods (in the case of
    Trust IV, Trust V and Trust VII), in which case
    payment of distributions on the respective Capital Securities
    will be deferred for comparable periods. During an extended
    interest period, M&T may not pay dividends or distributions
    on, or repurchase, redeem or acquire any shares of its capital
    stock. The agreements governing the Capital Securities, in the
    aggregate, provide a full, irrevocable and unconditional
    guarantee by M&T of the payment of distributions on, the
    redemption of, and any liquidation distribution with respect to
    the Capital Securities. The obligations under such guarantee and
    the Capital Securities are subordinate and junior in right of
    payment to all senior indebtedness of M&T.

The Capital Securities will remain outstanding until the Junior
    Subordinated Debentures are repaid at maturity, are redeemed
    prior to maturity or are distributed in liquidation to the
    Trusts. The Capital Securities are mandatorily redeemable in
    whole, but not in part, upon repayment at the stated maturity
    dates of the Junior Subordinated Debentures or the earlier
    redemption of the Junior Subordinated Debentures in whole upon
    the occurrence of one or more events set forth in the indentures
    relating to the Capital Securities, and in whole or in part at
    any time after an optional redemption contemporaneously with the
    optional redemption of the related Junior Subordinated
    Debentures in whole or in part, subject to possible regulatory
    approval.

Allfirst Preferred Capital Trust (“Allfirst Capital
    Trust”) has issued $100 million of Floating Rate
    Non-Cumulative Subordinated Trust Enhanced Securities
    (“SKATES”). Allfirst Capital Trust is a Delaware
    business trust that was formed for the exclusive purposes of
    (i) issuing the SKATES and common securities,
    (ii) purchasing Asset Preferred Securities issued by
    Allfirst Preferred Asset Trust (“Allfirst Asset
    Trust”) and (iii) engaging in only those other
    activities necessary or incidental thereto. M&T holds 100%
    of the common securities of Allfirst Capital Trust. Allfirst
    Asset Trust is a Delaware business trust that was formed for the
    exclusive purposes of (i) issuing Asset Preferred
    Securities and common securities, (ii) investing the gross
    proceeds of the Asset Preferred Securities in junior
    subordinated debentures of M&T and other permitted
    investments and (iii) engaging in only those other
    activities necessary or incidental thereto. M&T holds 100%
    of the common securities of Allfirst Asset Trust and Allfirst
    Capital Trust holds 100% of the Asset Preferred Securities of
    Allfirst Asset Trust. M&T currently has outstanding
    $105.3 million aggregate liquidation amount Floating Rate
    Junior Subordinated Debentures due July 15, 2029 that are
    payable to Allfirst Asset Trust. The interest rates payable on
    such debentures were 6.67% and 6.80% at December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively.

Distributions on the SKATES are non-cumulative. The distribution
    rate on the SKATES and on the Floating Rate Junior Subordinated
    Debentures is a rate per annum of three-month LIBOR plus 1.50%
    and three-month LIBOR plus 1.43%, respectively, reset quarterly
    two business days prior to the distribution dates of
    January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15 in
    each year. Distributions on the SKATES will be paid if, as and
    when Allfirst Capital Trust has funds available for payment. The
    SKATES are subject to mandatory redemption if the Asset
    Preferred Securities of Allfirst Asset Trust are redeemed.
    Allfirst Asset Trust will redeem the Asset Preferred Securities
    if the junior subordinated debentures of M&T held by
    Allfirst Asset Trust are redeemed. M&T may redeem such
    junior subordinated debentures, in whole or in part, at any time
    on or after July 15, 2009, subject to regulatory approval.
    Allfirst Asset Trust will redeem the Asset Preferred Securities
    at par plus accrued and unpaid distributions from the last
    distribution payment date. M&T has guaranteed, on a
    subordinated basis, the payment in full of all

Stock-based
    compensation plans

The Company recognizes expense for stock-based compensation
    using the fair value method of accounting. Stock-based
    compensation expense recognized by the Company in each of 2007
    and 2006 was $51 million, and was $45 million in 2005.
    The Company recognized $12 million, $13 million and
    $11 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, of income
    tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. As required,
    coincident with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the
    Company began accelerating the recognition of compensation costs
    for stock-based awards granted to retirement-eligible employees
    and employees who become retirement-eligible prior to full
    vesting of the award because the Company’s incentive
    compensation plans allow for vesting at the time an employee
    retires. Stock-based compensation granted to retirement-eligible
    individuals through December 31, 2005 was expensed over the
    normal vesting period with any remaining unrecognized
    compensation cost recognized at the time of retirement. This
    change affected the timing of stock-based compensation expense
    recognition in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements for years after 2005, but did not affect the value
    ascribed to stock-based compensation granted to employees nor
    the aggregate amount of stock-based compensation expense to be
    recognized by the Company. The acceleration of such expense was
    the primary reason for the higher stock-based compensation
    expense in 2007 and 2006 as compared with 2005.

The Company’s 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan allows for
    the issuance of various forms of stock-based compensation,
    including stock options, restricted stock and performance-based
    awards. Through December 31, 2007, only stock-based
    compensation awards, including stock options and restricted
    stock, that vest with the passage of time as service is provided
    have been issued. The 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan allows
    for share grants not to exceed 6,000,000 shares of stock
    plus the shares that remained available for grant under a prior
    plan. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, there
    were 5,685,802 and 7,199,903 shares available for future
    grant.

Stock
    option awards

Stock options issued generally vest over four years and are
    exercisable over terms not exceeding ten years and one day. In
    2005, the Company granted 125,600 options to substantially all
    employees who had not been previously receiving awards. The
    options granted under that award vest three years after grant
    date and are exercisable for a period of seven years thereafter.

The Company used an option pricing model to estimate the grant
    date present value of stock options granted. The
    weighted-average estimated grant date value per option was
    $28.59 in 2007, $28.10 in 2006 and $22.96 in 2005. The values
    were calculated using the following weighted-average
    assumptions: an option term of 6.5 years (representing the
    estimated period between grant date and exercise date based on
    historical data); a risk-free interest rate of 4.79% in 2007,
    4.28% in 2006 and 3.95% in 2005 (representing the yield on a
    U.S. Treasury security with a remaining term equal to the
    expected option term); expected volatility of 21% in 2007, 24%
    in 2006 and 21% in 2005 (based on historical volatility of
    M&T’s common stock price); and estimated dividend
    yields of 1.98% in 2007, 1.65% in 2006



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

and 1.57% in 2005 (representing the approximate annualized cash
    dividend rate paid with respect to a share of common stock at or
    near the grant date). Based on historical data and projected
    employee turnover rates, the Company reduced the estimated value
    of stock options for purposes of recognizing stock-based
    compensation expense by 7% in 2007 and 2006, and 8% in 2005 to
    reflect the probability of forfeiture prior to vesting.
    Aggregate fair value of options expected to vest that were
    granted in 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $48 million,
    $49 million and $41 million, respectively.

For 2007, 2006 and 2005, M&T received $66 million,
    $68 million and $85 million, respectively, in cash and
    realized $17 million, $27 million and
    $31 million, respectively, in tax benefits from the
    exercise of stock options. The intrinsic value of stock options
    exercised during those periods was $55 million,
    $86 million and $92 million, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2007, there was $41 million of total
    unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock
    options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 1.5 years. The total grant date
    fair value of stock options vested during 2007, 2006 and 2005
    was $39 million, $37 million and $41 million,
    respectively. Upon the exercise of stock options, the Company
    generally issues shares from treasury stock to the extent
    available, but may also issue new shares.

Restricted
    stock awards

Beginning in 2007, certain eligible employees of the Company
    could elect to receive all or a portion of their stock-based
    compensation awards in the form of restricted stock rather than
    stock options. Restricted stock awards vest over four years.
    During 2007, 15,083 shares of restricted stock were awarded
    with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $121.31. As of
    December 31, 2007, there were 14,804 shares of
    nonvested restricted stock outstanding. Unrecognized
    compensation expense associated with these shares was not
    significant. The Company generally will issue restricted shares
    from treasury stock to the extent available, but may also issue
    new shares.

Stock
    purchase plan

The stock purchase plan provides eligible employees of the
    Company with the right to purchase shares of M&T common
    stock through accumulated payroll deductions. Shares of M&T
    common stock will be issued at the end of an option period,
    typically one year or six months. In connection with the
    employee stock purchase plan, 1,000,000 shares of M&T
    common stock were authorized for issuance, of which
    392,955 shares have been issued. There were no shares
    issued in 2007, 102,400 shares were issued in 2006 and
    103,694 shares were issued in 2005. For 2006 and 2005,
    M&T received $10 million and $9 million,
    respectively, in cash for shares purchased through the employee
    stock purchase plan.

Similar to the stock option plans, the Company used an option
    pricing model to estimate the grant date present value of
    purchase rights under the stock purchase plan. The estimated
    weighted-average grant date value per right was $15.04 in 2007,
    $16.43 in 2006 and $14.44 in 2005. Such values were calculated
    using the following weighted-average assumptions: a term of six
    months to one year (representing the period between grant date
    and exercise date); a risk-free interest rate of 4.39% in 2007,
    4.95% in 2006 and 3.64% in 2005 (representing the yield on a
    U.S. Treasury security with a like term); expected
    volatility of 20% in 2007, 14% in 2006 and 16% in 2005 (based on
    historical volatility of



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

M&T’s common stock price); and an estimated dividend
    yield of 2.63% in 2007, 1.96% in 2006 and 1.67% in 2005
    (representing the approximate annualized cash dividend rate paid
    with respect to a share of common stock at or near the grant
    date).

Deferred
    bonus plan

The Company provides a deferred bonus plan pursuant to which
    eligible employees may elect to defer all or a portion of their
    current annual incentive compensation awards and allocate such
    awards to several investment options, including M&T common
    stock. Participants may elect the timing of distributions from
    the plan. Such distributions are payable in cash with the
    exception of balances allocated to M&T common stock which
    are distributable in the form of M&T common stock. Shares
    of M&T common stock distributable pursuant to the terms of
    the deferred bonus plan were 56,630 and 61,757 at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The obligation to
    issue shares is included in common stock issuable in the
    consolidated balance sheet. Through December 31, 2007,
    99,205 shares have been issued in connection with the
    deferred bonus plan.

Directors’
    stock plan

The Company maintained a compensation plan for non-employee
    members of the Company’s boards of directors and directors
    advisory councils that allowed such members to receive all or a
    portion of their compensation in shares of M&T common
    stock. Through December 31, 2007, 93,606 shares had
    been issued in connection with the directors’ stock plan.

Through an acquisition, the Company assumed an obligation to
    issue shares of M&T common stock related to a deferred
    directors compensation plan. Shares of common stock issuable
    under such plan were 26,282 and 29,192 at December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively. The obligation to issue shares is
    included in common stock issuable in the consolidated balance
    sheet.

Management
    stock ownership program

Through an acquisition, M&T obtained loans that are secured
    by M&T common stock purchased by former executives of the
    acquired entity. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the loan
    amounts owed M&T were less than the fair value of the
    financed stock purchased and totaled $4 million. Such loans
    are classified as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in
    the consolidated balance sheet. The amounts are due to M&T
    no later than October 5, 2010.

Pension
    plans and other postretirement benefits

The Company provides pension (defined benefit and defined
    contribution plans) and other postretirement benefits (including
    defined benefit health care and life insurance plans) to

The Company has an unfunded supplemental pension plan for
    certain key executives. The projected benefit obligation and
    accumulated benefit obligation included in the preceding data
    related to such plan were $48,872,000 and $48,134,000,
    respectively, as of December 31, 2007 and were $44,125,000
    and $43,413,000, respectively, as of December 31, 2006.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit
    pension plans was $732,502,000 and $649,925,000 at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2007, the accumulated benefit obligation and
    fair value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated
    benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $725,776,000
    (including $48,134,000 related to the unfunded supplemental
    pension plan) and $617,811,000, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2006, the accumulated benefit obligation and
    fair value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated
    benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $643,095,000
    (including $43,413,000 related to the unfunded supplemental
    pension plan) and $506,268,000, respectively.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans,” which requires an employer to recognize in its
    balance sheet as an asset or liability the overfunded or
    underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan,
    measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets
    and the benefit obligation. For a pension plan, the benefit
    obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other
    postretirement benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan,
    the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation. SFAS No. 158 requires that gains or losses
    and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period,
    but are not included as components of net periodic benefit
    expense be recognized as a component of other comprehensive
    income. As indicated in the preceding table, as of
    December 31, 2007 the Company recorded an additional
    minimum liability totaling $76,330,000 ($68,623,000 related to
    pension plans and $7,707,000 related to other postretirement
    benefits) with a corresponding reduction of stockholders’
    equity, net of applicable deferred taxes, of $46,485,000. Of the
    $68,623,000 related to pension plans, $7,932,000 was related to
    unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans. In aggregate, the
    benefit plans incurred losses during 2007 that resulted from
    actual experience differing from the assumptions utilized and
    from changes in actuarial assumptions. As a result, the Company
    increased its minimum liability from that which was recorded at
    December 31, 2006 by $29,996,000 with a corresponding
    decrease to stockholders’ equity that, net of applicable
    deferred taxes, was $18,222,000. The table below reflects the

The Company was required to initially adopt the provisions of
    SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006. As of that date,
    the Company recorded an additional minimum liability totaling
    $46,334,000 ($38,582,000 related to pension plans and $7,752,000
    related to other postretirement benefits) with a

corresponding reduction of stockholders’ equity, net of
    applicable deferred taxes, of $28,263,000. Of the $38,582,000
    related to pension plans, $7,955,000 was related to unfunded
    nonqualified defined benefit plans. Because the recognition
    requirements of SFAS No. 158 were required to be applied at
    the end of the year of adoption, the Company had to first
    recognize  the minimum liability amounts required under the
    provisions of SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting
    for Pensions.” As a result, as of December 31, 2006
    the Company decreased its previously recorded minimum pension
    liability by $50,708,000 with a corresponding increase to other
    comprehensive income that, net of applicable deferred taxes, was
    $30,932,000. In order to recognize the funded status of the
    Company’s combined postretirement defined benefit plans
    under the provisions of SFAS No. 158, the Company then
    recorded an incremental minimum liability of $16,166,000 with a
    corresponding reduction of stockholders’ equity that, net
    of applicable deferred taxes, was $9,841,000. In total, the
    Company decreased its minimum liability from that which was
    recorded at December 31, 2005 by $34,542,000 with a
    corresponding increase to stockholders’ equity that, net of
    applicable deferred taxes, was $21,091,000.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company amended certain
    provisions of its defined benefit pension plans. The formula was
    changed to reduce the future accrual of benefits by lowering the
    accrual percentage and through use of a career-average-pay
    formula as opposed to the previous final-average-pay formula.
    The amendments affected benefits earned for service periods
    beginning after December 31, 2005. The amendments caused
    the projected benefit obligation associated with the defined
    benefit plans to decrease by approximately $98 million as
    of December 31, 2005. There was no corresponding effect on
    the accumulated benefit obligation. Amortization of prior
    service credits lowered pension expense in 2006 and 2007 by
    approximately $7 million. Also effective January 1,
    2006, the Company began to provide a new qualified defined
    contribution pension plan. Active participants in the old
    defined benefit plan had the choice of electing to remain in the
    defined benefit plan under the reduced benefit formula, or
    electing to participate in the new qualified defined
    contribution plan. Under the new defined contribution pension
    plan, the Company makes contributions to the plan each year in
    an amount that is based on an individual participant’s
    total compensation (generally defined as total wages, incentive
    compensation, commissions and bonuses) and years of service.
    Participants do not contribute to the defined contribution
    pension plan. Employees who were not participants in the defined
    benefit plan as of December 31, 2005 are not eligible to
    participate in that plan, but are eligible to participate in the
    defined contribution plan. Pension expense recorded in 2007 and
    2006 associated with the defined contribution pension plan was
    approximately $8 million and $7 million, respectively.

The expected long-term rate of return assumption as of each
    measurement date was determined by taking into consideration
    asset allocations as of each such date, target allocations of
    assets, historical returns on the types of assets held and
    current economic factors. The Company’s investment policy
    for determining the asset allocation targets was developed based
    on the desire to maximize total return while placing a strong
    emphasis on preservation of capital. In general, it is hoped
    that, in the aggregate, changes in the fair value of plan assets
    will be less volatile than similar changes in appropriate market
    indices. Returns on invested assets are periodically compared
    with target market indices for each asset type to aid management
    in evaluating such returns. Furthermore, management regularly
    reviews the investment policy and may, if deemed appropriate,
    make changes to the target allocations presented above.

Pension plan assets included common stock of M&T with a
    fair value of $26,749,000 (4% of total plan assets) at
    December 31, 2007 and $40,059,000 (8% of total plan assets)
    at December 31, 2006. Pension plan assets included American
    Depositary Shares of AIB (“AIB ADSs”) with a fair
    value of $6,478,000 and $8,570,000 at December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively (see note 23).

The Company makes contributions to its funded qualified defined
    benefit pension plans as required by government regulation or as
    deemed appropriate by management after considering factors such
    as the fair value of plan assets, expected returns on such
    assets, and the present value of benefit obligations of the
    plans. Subject to the impact of actual events and circumstances
    that may occur in 2008, the Company may make contributions to
    the qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2008, but the
    amount of any such contribution has not yet been determined. No
    minimum contribution is required in 2008 under government
    regulations for the qualified defined benefit pension plans. The
    Company contributed $66 million to the qualified defined
    benefit pension plans in 2007 and $36 million in 2006. The
    Company regularly funds the payment of benefit obligations for
    the supplemental defined benefit pension and postretirement
    benefit plans because such plans do not hold assets for
    investment. Payments made by the Company for supplemental
    pension benefits were $2,665,000 and $4,835,000 in 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Payments made by the Company for
    postretirement benefits were $6,603,000 and $8,186,000 in 2007
    and 2006, respectively. Payments for supplemental pension and
    other postretirement benefits for 2008 are not expected to
    differ from those made in 2007 by an amount that will be
    material to the Company’s consolidated financial position.

Estimated benefits expected to be paid in future years related
    to the Company’s defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement benefits plans are as follows:

For measurement of other postretirement benefits, an 8% annual
    rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care
    benefits was assumed for 2008. The rate was assumed to decrease
    gradually to 5% over 3 years and remain constant
    thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a
    significant effect on the amounts reported for health care
    plans. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost
    trend rates would have had the following effects:

The Company has a retirement savings plan (“Savings
    Plan”) that is a defined contribution plan in which
    eligible employees of the Company may defer up to 50% of
    qualified compensation via contributions to the plan. The
    Company makes an employer matching contribution in an amount
    equal to 75% of an employee’s contribution, up to 4.5% of
    the employee’s qualified compensation. Employees’
    accounts, including employee contributions, employer matching
    contributions and accumulated earnings thereon, are at all times
    fully vested and nonforfeitable. Employee benefits expense
    resulting from the Company’s contributions to the Savings
    Plan totaled $21,749,000, $21,152,000 and $16,507,000 in 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return
    reflecting taxable income earned by all subsidiaries. In prior
    years, applicable federal tax law allowed certain financial
    institutions the option of deducting as bad debt expense for tax
    purposes amounts in excess of actual losses. In accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles, such financial
    institutions were not required to provide deferred income taxes
    on such excess. Recapture of the excess tax bad debt reserve
    established under the previously allowed method will result in
    taxable income if M&T Bank fails to maintain bank status as
    defined in the Internal Revenue Code or charges are made to the
    reserve for other than bad debt losses. At December 31,
    2007, M&T Bank’s tax bad debt reserve for which no
    federal income taxes have been provided was $79,121,000,
    including $5,100,000 obtained in the Partners Trust acquisition.
    No actions are planned that would cause this reserve to become
    wholly or partially taxable.

Income taxes attributable to gains or losses on bank investment
    securities were benefits of $49,308,000 and $5,434,000 in 2007
    and 2005, respectively, and an expense of $976,000 in 2006. No
    alternative minimum tax expense was recognized in 2007, 2006 or
    2005.

The income tax credits shown in the statement of income of
    M&T in note 25 arise principally from operating losses
    before dividends from subsidiaries.

At the January 1, 2007 adoption of FIN No. 48, the
    $111,266,000 of unrecognized tax benefits net of federal and
    state income tax benefits was $75,023,000 and included
    $67,309,000 that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax
    rate and $7,714,000 that related to acquired entities and would
    impact goodwill.

The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and
    penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in
    income taxes in the consolidated statement of income. The
    balance of accrued interest at December 31, 2007 is
    included in the table above. If any tax return examination by
    federal, state or local tax authorities is concluded during the
    next twelve months, it is possible that the amount of the
    accrued liability for uncertain tax positions could change. It
    is not possible to estimate the amount of any such change at
    this time. The Company’s federal, state and local income
    tax returns are routinely subject to examinations from various
    governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in
    challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to
    specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions
    and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities
    have been appropriate. Should determinations rendered by tax
    authorities ultimately indicate that management’s
    assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments
    required could have a material effect on the Company’s
    results of operations. The Company’s federal income tax
    returns for 2004-2007 may still be examined by the Internal
    Revenue Service. The Company also files income tax returns in
    over forty state and local jurisdictions. Substantially all
    material state and local matters have been concluded for years
    through 1998. Some tax returns for years after 1998 are
    presently under examination. It is not possible to estimate when
    those examinations may be completed.

International

The Company engages in certain international activities
    consisting largely of collecting Eurodollar deposits, engaging
    in foreign currency trading, providing credit to support the
    international activities of domestic companies and holding
    certain loans to foreign borrowers. Net assets identified with
    international activities amounted to $119,930,000 and
    $185,175,000 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    Such assets included $106,816,000 and $175,528,000,
    respectively, of loans to foreign borrowers. Deposits at
    M&T Bank’s offshore branch office were $5,856,427,000
    and $5,429,668,000 at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The Company uses such deposits to facilitate
    customer demand and as an alternative to short-term borrowings
    when the costs of such deposits seem reasonable.

17.

Derivative
    financial instruments

As part of managing interest rate risk, the Company enters into
    interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing
    characteristics of certain portions of the Company’s
    portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
    Interest rate swap agreements are generally entered into with
    counterparties that meet established credit standards and most
    contain collateral provisions protecting the at-risk party. The
    Company believes that the credit risk inherent in these
    contracts is not significant.

The Company designates interest rate swap agreements utilized in
    the management of interest rate risk as either fair value hedges
    or cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS No. 133. Fair
    value hedges are intended to protect against exposure to changes
    in the fair value of designated assets or liabilities. Cash flow
    hedges are intended to protect against the variability of cash
    flows associated with designated assets or liabilities.

Under the terms of these

The estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements
    represents the amount the Company would have expected to receive
    (pay) to terminate such contracts. The estimated fair value of
    such swap agreements at December 31, 2007 and 2006 included
    gross unrealized gains of $16,513,000 and $115,000,
    respectively, and gross unrealized losses of $16,694,000 and
    $15,120,000, respectively. At December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    the estimated fair values of interest rate swap agreements
    designated as fair value hedges were substantially offset by
    unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair
    values of the hedged items. The estimated fair value of interest
    rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges, net of
    applicable income taxes, is included in “Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net” in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007.

The net effect of interest rate swap agreements was to decrease
    net interest income by $2,556,000 in 2007 and $4,281,000 in 2006
    and to increase net interest income by $5,526,000 in 2005. The
    average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements
    impacting net interest income that were entered into for
    interest rate risk management purposes were $1,410,542,000 in
    2007, $774,268,000 in 2006 and $767,175,000 in 2005. The amount
    of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
    not material to the Company’s results of operations.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell residential and
    commercial real estate loans to hedge the exposure to changes in
    the fair value of real estate loans held for sale. Such
    commitments have been designated as fair value hedges. The
    Company also utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to
    offset the exposure to changes in the fair value of certain
    commitments to originate real estate loans for sale. As a result
    of these activities, net unrealized pre-tax losses related to
    hedged loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for
    sale, and commitments to sell loans were approximately
    $7 million at December 31, 2007, compared with
    unrealized pre-tax gains of $4 million at December 31,
    2006. Changes in unrealized gains or losses are included in
    mortgage banking revenues and, in general, are realized in
    subsequent periods as the related loans are sold and commitments
    satisfied.

Derivative financial instruments used for trading purposes
    included interest rate contracts, foreign exchange and other
    option contracts, foreign exchange forward and spot contracts,
    and financial futures. Interest rate contracts entered into for
    trading purposes had notional values and estimated fair value
    gains of $11.7 billion and $24,606,000, respectively, at
    December 31, 2007 and notional values and estimated fair
    value gains of $7.6 billion and $17,122,000, respectively,
    at December 31, 2006. Foreign exchange and other option and
    futures contracts totaled approximately $801 million and
    $613 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Such contracts were valued at gains of $686,000
    and $477,000 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    Trading account assets and liabilities are recorded in the

Variable
    interest entities and asset securitizations

Variable
    interest entities

Variable interest entities in which the Company holds a
    significant variable interest are described below.

M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC is a special purpose
    subsidiary of M&T Bank formed in 2002 for the purpose of
    borrowing $500 million in a revolving asset-backed
    structured borrowing with an unaffiliated conduit lender. The
    revolving asset-backed structured borrowing is secured by
    automobile loans and other assets transferred to the special
    purpose subsidiary by M&T Bank or other of its subsidiaries
    that totaled $557 million and $565 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The activities of
    M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC are generally restricted
    to purchasing and owning automobile loans for the purpose of
    securing this revolving borrowing arrangement. Proceeds from
    payments on the automobile loans are required to be applied in
    priority order for fees, principal and interest on the
    borrowing, and funding the monthly replenishment of loans. Any
    remaining proceeds are available for distribution to M&T
    Bank. The secured borrowing is prepayable, in whole or in part,
    at any time and is non-recourse to M&T Bank and the
    Company. However, 80% of the borrowing can be put back to
    M&T Bank upon demand. The Company’s maximum
    incremental exposure to loss resulting from the structure

of this borrowing arrangement is generally restricted to the
    amount that such borrowing is overcollateralized. Management
    currently estimates no material losses as a result of the
    pledging of assets and the terms of the borrowing arrangement.
    The assets and liabilities of M&T Auto Receivables I,
    LLC have been included in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

M&T has a variable interest in a trust that holds AIB ADSs
    for the purpose of satisfying options to purchase such shares
    for certain employees. The trust purchased the AIB ADSs with the
    proceeds of a loan from an entity subsequently acquired by
    M&T. Proceeds from option exercises and any dividends and
    other earnings on the trust assets are used to repay the loan
    plus interest. Option holders have no preferential right with
    respect to the trust assets and the trust assets are subject to
    the claims of M&T’s creditors. The trust has been
    included in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. As a result, included in investment securities
    available for sale were 602,088 AIB ADSs with a carrying value
    of approximately $14 million at December 31, 2007,
    compared with 651,688 AIB ADSs with a carrying value of
    approximately $15 million at December 31, 2006.
    Outstanding options granted to employees who have continued
    service with M&T totaled 329,810 and 381,460 at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. All outstanding
    options were fully vested and exercisable at both
    December 31, 2007 and 2006. The options expire at various
    dates through June 2012. M&T’s maximum exposure to
    loss is approximately $14 million at December 31, 2007.

As described in note 9, M&T has issued junior
    subordinated debentures payable to the Trusts and the Allfirst
    Asset Trust and owns the common securities of those entities.
    The Trusts and the Allfirst Asset Trust are not included in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements because the
    Company is not considered to be the primary beneficiary of those
    entities. Accordingly, at December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company included the Junior Subordinated Debentures payable to
    the Trusts and the Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures
    payable to the Allfirst Asset Trust as long-term borrowings in
    its consolidated balance sheet. The Company has recognized
    $31 million in other assets for its “investment”
    in the common securities of the Trusts and Allfirst Asset Trust
    that will be concomitantly repaid to M&T by the respective
    trust from the proceeds of M&T’s repayment of the
    junior subordinated debentures associated with preferred capital
    securities described in note 9.

The Company has invested as a limited partner in various real
    estate partnerships that collectively had total assets of
    approximately $342 million and $339 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Those
    partnerships generally construct or acquire properties for which
    the investing partners are eligible to receive certain federal
    income tax credits in accordance with government guidelines.
    Such investments may also provide tax deductible losses to the
    partners. The partnership investments also assist the Company in
    achieving its community reinvestment initiatives. As a limited
    partner, there is no recourse to the Company by creditors of the
    partnerships. However, the tax credits that result from the
    Company’s investments in such partnerships are generally
    subject to recapture should a partnership fail to comply with
    the respective government regulations. The Company’s
    maximum exposure to loss of its investments in such partnerships
    was $146 million, including $34 million of unfunded
    commitments, at December 31, 2007 and $142 million,
    including $25 million of unfunded commitments, at
    December 31, 2006. Management currently estimates that no
    material losses are probable as a result of the Company’s
    involvement with such entities. In accordance with the
    accounting provisions for variable interest entities, the
    partnership entities are not included in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Securitizations

In December 2007 and 2005, the Company securitized approximately
    $948 million and $126 million, respectively, of

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans in guaranteed mortgage
    securitizations with FNMA. The Company recognized no gain or
    loss on the transactions as it retained all of the resulting
    securities. Such securities were classified as investment
    securities available for sale. The Company expects no material
    credit-related losses on the retained securities as a result of
    the guarantees by FNMA.

In prior years, the Company transferred approximately
    $1.9 billion of

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans to qualified special purpose
    trusts in non-recourse securitization transactions. In exchange
    for the loans, the Company received cash, no more than 88% of
    the resulting securities, and the servicing rights to the loans.
    All of the retained securities were classified as investment
    securities available for sale. The qualified special purpose
    trusts are not included in the Company’s consolidated



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

financial statements. Because the
    transactions were non-recourse, the Company’s maximum
    exposure to loss as a result of its association with the trusts
    is limited to realizing the carrying value of the retained
    securities and servicing rights. The combined outstanding
    principal amount of mortgage-backed securities issued by the
    qualified special purpose trusts was $631 million at
    December 31, 2007 and $732 million at
    December 31, 2006. The principal amount of such securities
    held by the Company was $539 million and $627 million
    at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, loans of the trusts that were
    30 or more days delinquent totaled $15 million and
    $14 million, respectively. Credit losses, net of
    recoveries, for the trusts in 2007 and 2006 were insignificant.
    There were no significant repurchases of delinquent or
    foreclosed loans from the trusts by the Company in 2007 or 2006.
    Certain cash flows between the Company and the trusts were as
    follows:

A summary of the fair values of retained subordinated interests
    resulting from the Company’s residential mortgage loan
    securitization activities follows. Although the estimated fair
    values of the retained subordinated interests were obtained from
    independent pricing sources, the Company has modeled the
    sensitivity of such fair values to changes in certain
    assumptions as summarized in the table below. These calculated
    sensitivities are hypothetical and actual changes in the fair
    value may differ significantly from the amounts presented
    herein. The effect of a variation in a particular assumption on
    the fair values is calculated without changing any other
    assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in
    changes in another which may magnify or counteract the
    sensitivities. The changes in assumptions are presumed to be
    instantaneous. The hypothetical effect of adverse changes on the
    Company’s retained capitalized servicing assets at
    December 31, 2007 is included in note 7.

Fair
    value of financial instruments

SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of
    Financial Instruments,” requires disclosure of the
    estimated fair value of financial instruments. Fair value is
    generally defined as the price a willing buyer and a willing
    seller would exchange for a financial instrument in other than a
    distressed sale situation.

With the exception of marketable securities, certain off-balance
    sheet financial instruments and

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans originated for sale, the
    Company’s financial instruments are not readily marketable
    and market prices do not exist. The Company, in attempting to
    comply with the provisions of SFAS No. 107, has not
    attempted to market its financial instruments to potential
    buyers, if any exist. Since negotiated prices in illiquid
    markets depend greatly upon the then present motivations of the
    buyer and seller, it is reasonable to assume that actual sales
    prices could vary widely



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

from any estimate of fair value made without the benefit of
    negotiations. Additionally, changes in market interest rates can
    dramatically impact the value of financial instruments in a
    short period of time.

The estimated fair values of investments in readily marketable
    debt and equity securities were calculated based on quoted
    market prices at the respective year-end. In determining amounts
    to present for other financial instruments, the Company
    generally used calculations based upon discounted cash flows of
    the related financial instruments or assigned some other amount
    as required by SFAS No. 107. Additional information
    about the assumptions and calculations utilized is presented
    below.

M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

Cash
    and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits at banks,
    short-term borrowings, accrued interest receivable and accrued
    interest payable

Due to the nature of cash and cash equivalents and the near
    maturity of interest-bearing deposits at banks, short-term
    borrowings, accrued interest receivable and accrued interest
    payable, the Company estimated that the carrying amount of such
    instruments approximated estimated fair value.

Trading
    account assets and liabilities

Trading account assets and liabilities are carried in the
    consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair value which, in
    general, is based on quoted market prices. Trading account
    liabilities are included in other liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheet.

Agreements
    to resell securities

The amounts assigned to agreements to resell securities were
    based on discounted calculations of projected cash flows.

Investment
    securities

Estimated fair values of investments in readily marketable debt
    and equity securities were based on quoted market prices.
    Investment securities that were not readily marketable were
    assigned amounts based on estimates provided by brokers,
    discounted calculations of projected cash flows or, in the case
    of other investment securities, which include capital stock of
    the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan
    Bank of New York, at an amount equal to the carrying amount.

Loans
    and leases

In general, discount rates used to calculate values for loan
    products were based on the Company’s pricing at the
    respective year end. A higher discount rate was assumed with
    respect to estimated cash flows associated with nonaccrual
    loans. The allowance for credit losses represents the
    Company’s assessment of the overall level of credit losses
    inherent in the portfolio as of the respective year end and may
    not be indicative of the credit-related discount that a
    purchaser of the Company’s loans and leases would seek.

Deposits

SFAS No. 107 requires that the estimated fair value
    ascribed to noninterest-bearing deposits, savings deposits and
    NOW accounts be established at carrying value because of the
    customers’ ability to withdraw funds immediately. Time
    deposit accounts are required to be revalued based upon
    prevailing market interest rates for similar maturity
    instruments. As a result, amounts assigned to time deposits were
    based on discounted cash flow calculations using prevailing
    market interest rates based on the Company’s pricing at the
    respective year end for deposits with comparable remaining terms
    to maturity.

The Company believes that deposit accounts have a value greater
    than that prescribed by SFAS No. 107. The Company
    feels, however, that the value associated with these deposits is
    greatly influenced by characteristics of the buyer, such as the
    ability to reduce the costs of servicing the deposits and
    deposit attrition which often occurs following an acquisition.
    Accordingly, estimating the fair value of deposits with any
    degree of certainty is not practical.

Long-term
    borrowings

The amounts assigned to long-term borrowings were based on
    quoted market prices, when available, or were based on
    discounted cash flow calculations using prevailing market
    interest rates for borrowings of similar terms.

Commitments
    to originate real estate loans for sale and commitments to sell
    real estate loans

As described in note 20, the Company enters into various
    commitments to originate real estate loans for sale and
    commitments to sell real estate loans. Such commitments are
    considered to be derivative financial instruments and,
    therefore, are carried at estimated fair value on the
    consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair values of such
    commitments were generally calculated by reference to quoted
    market



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

prices for commitments to sell real estate loans to certain
    government-sponsored entities and other parties.

Interest
    rate swap agreements used for interest rate risk
    management

The estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements used
    for interest rate risk management represents the amount the
    Company would have expected to receive or pay to terminate such
    agreements.

Other
    commitments and contingencies

As described in note 20, in the normal course of business,
    various commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding,
    such as loan commitments, credit guarantees and letters of
    credit. The Company’s pricing of such financial instruments
    is based largely on credit quality and relationship, probability
    of funding and other requirements. Loan commitments often have
    fixed expiration dates and contain termination and other clauses
    which provide for relief from funding in the event of
    significant deterioration in the credit quality of the customer.
    The rates and terms of the Company’s loan commitments,
    credit guarantees and letters of credit are competitive with
    other financial institutions operating in markets served by the
    Company. The Company believes that the carrying amounts, which
    are included in other liabilities, are reasonable estimates of
    the fair value of these financial instruments.

The Company does not believe that the estimated information
    presented herein is representative of the earnings power or
    value of the Company. The preceding analysis, which is
    inherently limited in depicting fair value, also does not
    consider any value associated with existing customer
    relationships nor the ability of the Company to create value
    through loan origination, deposit gathering or fee generating
    activities.

Many of the estimates presented herein are based upon the use of
    highly subjective information and assumptions and, accordingly,
    the results may not be precise. Management believes that fair
    value estimates may not be comparable between financial
    institutions due to the wide range of permitted valuation
    techniques and numerous estimates which must be made.
    Furthermore, because the disclosed fair value amounts were
    estimated as of the balance sheet date, the amounts actually
    realized or paid upon maturity or settlement of the various
    financial instruments could be significantly different.

    typically result in the commitment being funded when the
    underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and
    third party. The credit risk associated with commitments to
    extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit is
    essentially the same as that involved with extending loans to
    customers and is subject to normal credit policies. Collateral
    may be obtained based on management’s assessment of the
    customer’s creditworthiness.

Financial guarantees and indemnification contracts are
    oftentimes similar to standby letters of credit and include
    mandatory purchase agreements issued to ensure that customer
    obligations are fulfilled, recourse obligations associated with
    sold loans, and other guarantees of customer performance or
    compliance with designated rules and regulations. Included in
    financial guarantees and indemnification contracts are loan
    principal amounts sold with recourse in conjunction with the
    Company’s involvement in the FNMA DUS program. Under this
    program, the Company’s maximum credit risk associated with
    loans sold with recourse at December 31, 2007 and 2006
    totaled $1.0 billion and $939 million, respectively.
    Those recourse amounts were approximately equal to one-third of
    each sold loan’s outstanding principal balance.

Since many loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and
    guarantees and indemnification contracts expire without being
    funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not
    necessarily indicative of future cash flows.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to
    hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of real estate loans
    held for sale. Such commitments are considered derivatives in
    accordance with SFAS No. 133 and along with
    commitments to originate real estate loans to be held for sale
    are generally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at
    estimated fair market value. However, through December 31,
    2007 when estimating that fair value for commitments to
    originate loans for sale, value ascribable to cash flows that
    will be realized in connection with loan servicing activities
    has not been included. Value ascribable to that portion of cash
    flows is recognized at the time the underlying mortgage loans
    are sold. Additional information about such derivative financial
    instruments is included in note 17.

The Company occupies certain banking offices and uses certain
    equipment under noncancellable operating lease agreements
    expiring at various dates over the next 31 years. Minimum
    lease payments under noncancellable operating leases are
    summarized in the following table:

The Company has an agreement with the Baltimore Ravens of the
    National Football League whereby the Company obtained the naming
    rights to a football stadium in Baltimore, Maryland through
    2017. Under the agreement, the Company is obligated to pay
    $5 million per year through 2013 and $6 million per
    year from 2014 through 2017.

The Company reinsures credit life and accident and health
    insurance purchased by consumer loan customers. The maximum loss
    associated with providing that reinsurance amounted to
    $47 million and $58 million at December 31, 2007
    and December 31, 2006, respectively. The Company also
    enters into reinsurance contracts with third party insurance
    companies who insure against the risk of a mortgage
    borrower’s payment default in connection with certain
    mortgage loans originated by the Company. The maximum loss
    associated with providing such reinsurance amounted to
    $22 million and $19 million at

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.
    When providing reinsurance coverage, the Company receives a
    premium in exchange for accepting a portion of the
    insurer’s risk of borrower default. The maximum loss
    exposures noted above are not necessarily indicative of losses
    which may ultimately be incurred. Such losses are expected to be
    substantially less because most loans are repaid by borrowers in
    accordance with the original loan terms. The amount of the
    Company’s recorded liability for reported reinsurance
    losses as well as estimated losses incurred but not yet reported
    was not significant at either December 31, 2007 or
    December 31, 2006.

In October 2007, Visa completed a reorganization in
    contemplation of its initial public offering (“IPO”)
    expected to occur in 2008. As part of that reorganization,
    M&T Bank and other member banks of Visa received shares of
    common stock of Visa, Inc. Those banks are also obligated under
    various agreements with Visa to share in losses stemming from
    certain litigation involving Visa (“Covered
    Litigation”). Although Visa is expected to set aside a
    portion of the proceeds from its IPO in an escrow account to
    fund any judgments or settlements that may arise out of the
    Covered Litigation, recent guidance from the SEC indicates that
    Visa member banks should record a liability for the fair value
    of the contingent obligation to Visa. The estimation of
    M&T’s proportionate share of any potential losses
    related to the Covered Litigation is extremely difficult and
    involves a great deal of judgment. Nevertheless, in the fourth
    quarter of 2007 M&T recorded a pre-tax charge of
    $23 million ($14 million after tax effect) related to
    the Covered Litigation. In accordance with GAAP and consistent
    with the SEC guidance, M&T did not recognize any value for
    its common stock ownership interest in Visa, Inc.

M&T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course
    of business to various pending and threatened legal proceedings
    in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. Management,
    after consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that
    the aggregate ultimate liability arising out of litigation
    pending against M&T or its subsidiaries will be material to
    the Company’s consolidated financial position, but at the
    present time is not in a position to determine whether such
    litigation will have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s consolidated results of operations in any future
    reporting period.

Segment
    information

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131,
    “Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
    Information,” reportable segments have been determined
    based upon the Company’s internal profitability reporting
    system, which is organized by strategic business units. Certain
    strategic business units have been combined for segment
    information reporting purposes where the nature of the products
    and services, the type of customer and the distribution of those
    products and services are similar. The reportable segments are
    Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate,
    Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail
    Banking. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company began
    reporting its Business Banking strategic business unit as a
    separate reportable segment. Prior to that date, that unit was
    included in the Retail Banking reportable segment. Prior year
    information has been restated to reflect the change in
    reportable segments.

The financial information of the Company’s segments has
    been compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in
    note 1 with certain exceptions. The more significant of
    these exceptions are described herein. The Company allocates
    interest income or interest expense using a methodology that
    charges users of funds (assets) interest expense and credits
    providers of funds (liabilities) with income based on the
    maturity, prepayment

and/or

repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities. The net
    effect of this allocation is recorded in the “All
    Other” category. A provision for credit losses is allocated
    to segments in an amount based largely on actual net charge-offs
    incurred by the segment during the period plus or minus an
    amount necessary to adjust the segment’s allowance for
    credit losses due to changes in loan balances. In contrast, the
    level of the consolidated provision for credit losses is
    determined using the methodologies described in note 1 to
    assess the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.
    Indirect fixed and variable expenses incurred by certain
    centralized support areas are allocated to segments based on
    actual usage (for example, volume measurements) and other
    criteria. Certain types of administrative expenses and bankwide
    expense accruals (including amortization of core deposit and
    other intangible assets associated with acquisitions of
    financial institutions) are generally not



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

allocated to segments. Income
    taxes are allocated to segments based on the Company’s
    marginal statutory tax rate adjusted for any tax-exempt income
    or non-deductible expenses. Equity is allocated to the segments
    based on regulatory capital requirements and in proportion to an
    assessment of the inherent risks associated with the business of
    the segment (including interest, credit and operating risk).

The management accounting policies and processes utilized in
    compiling segment financial information are highly subjective
    and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative
    guidance similar to generally accepted accounting principles. As
    a result, reported segment results are not necessarily
    comparable with similar information reported by other financial
    institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or
    allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in
    reported segment financial data. Information about the
    Company’s segments is presented in the accompanying table.

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

(a)

Net interest income is the
    difference between actual taxable-equivalent interest earned on
    assets and interest paid on liabilities by a segment and a
    funding charge (credit) based on the Company’s internal
    funds transfer pricing methodology. Segments are charged a cost
    to fund any assets (e.g. loans) and are paid a funding credit
    for any funds provided (e.g. deposits). The taxable-equivalent
    adjustment aggregated $20,833,000 in 2007, $19,667,000 in 2006
    and $17,311,000 in 2005 and is eliminated in “All
    Other” net interest income and income tax expense
    (benefit).

(b)

Including the impact in the
    “All Other” category of the merger-related expenses
    described in note 2.

The Business Banking segment provides deposit, lending, cash
    management and other financial services to small businesses and
    professionals through the Company’s banking office network
    and several other delivery channels, including business banking
    centers, telephone banking, Internet banking and automated
    teller machines. The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide
    range of credit products and banking services to middle-market
    and large commercial customers, largely within the markets the
    Company serves. Among the services provided by this segment are
    commercial lending and leasing, letters of credit, deposit
    products and cash management services. The Commercial Real
    Estate segment provides credit services which are secured by
    various types of multifamily residential and commercial real
    estate and deposit services to its customers. Activities of this
    segment include the origination, sales and servicing of
    commercial real estate loans. The Discretionary Portfolio
    segment includes securities, residential mortgage loans and
    other assets; short-term and long-term borrowed funds; brokered
    certificates of deposit and interest rate swap agreements
    related thereto; and offshore branch deposits. This segment also
    provides foreign exchange services to customers. The Residential
    Mortgage Banking segment originates and services residential
    mortgage loans for consumers and sells substantially all of
    those loans in the secondary market to investors or to the
    Discretionary Portfolio segment. The segment periodically
    purchases servicing rights to loans that have been originated by
    other entities. This segment also originates and services loans
    to developers of residential real estate properties. Residential
    mortgage loans held for sale are included in the Residential
    Mortgage Banking segment. The Retail Banking segment offers a
    variety of services to consumers through several delivery
    channels that include banking offices, automated teller
    machines, telephone banking and Internet banking. The “All
    Other” category includes other operating activities of the
    Company that are not directly attributable to the reported
    segments as determined in accordance with
    SFAS No. 131, the difference between the provision for
    credit losses and the calculated provision allocated to the
    reportable segments, goodwill and core deposit and other
    intangible assets resulting from acquisitions of financial
    institutions, M&T’s equity in the earnings of BLG,
    merger-related expenses resulting from acquisitions, the net
    impact of the Company’s internal funds transfer pricing
    methodology, eliminations of transactions between reportable
    segments, certain nonrecurring transactions, the residual
    effects of unallocated support systems and general and
    administrative expenses, and the impact of interest rate risk
    management strategies. The amount of intersegment activity
    eliminated in arriving at consolidated totals was included in
    the “All Other” category as follows:

Regulatory
    matters

Payment of dividends by M&T’s banking subsidiaries is
    restricted by various legal and regulatory limitations.
    Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T are limited by
    the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current
    year and the preceding two years. For purposes of this test, at
    December 31, 2007, approximately $295,947,000 was available
    for payment of dividends to M&T from banking subsidiaries
    without prior regulatory approval.

Banking regulations prohibit extensions of credit by the
    subsidiary banks to M&T unless appropriately secured by
    assets. Securities of affiliates are not eligible as collateral
    for this purpose.

The bank subsidiaries are required to maintain
    noninterest-earning reserves against certain deposit
    liabilities. During the maintenance periods that included
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, cash and due from banks
    included a daily average of $228,290,000 and $182,953,000,
    respectively, for such purpose.

Federal regulators have adopted capital adequacy guidelines for
    bank holding companies and banks. Failure to meet minimum
    capital requirements can result in certain mandatory, and
    possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that,
    if undertaken, could have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial statements. Under the capital adequacy
    guidelines, the so-called “Tier 1 capital” and
    “Total capital” as a percentage of risk-weighted
    assets and certain off-balance sheet financial instruments must
    be at least 4% and 8%, respectively. In addition to these
    risk-based measures, regulators also require banking
    institutions that meet certain qualitative criteria to maintain
    a minimum “leverage” ratio of “Tier 1
    capital” to average total assets, adjusted for goodwill and
    certain other items, of at least 3% to be considered adequately
    capitalized. As of December 31, 2007, M&T and each of
    its banking subsidiaries exceeded all applicable capital
    adequacy requirements. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    the most recent notifications from federal regulators
    categorized each of M&T’s bank subsidiaries as
    “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for
    prompt corrective action. To be considered “well
    capitalized,” a banking institution must maintain
    Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and
    leverage ratios of at least 6%, 10% and 5%, respectively.
    Management is unaware of any conditions or events since the
    latest notifications from federal regulators that have changed
    the capital adequacy category of M&T’s bank
    subsidiaries.

Relationship
    of M&T and AIB

AIB received 26,700,000 shares of M&T common stock on
    April 1, 2003 as a result of M&T’s acquisition of
    a subsidiary of AIB on that date. Those shares of common stock
    owned by AIB represented 24.3% of the issued and outstanding
    shares of M&T common stock on December 31, 2007. While
    AIB maintains a significant ownership in M&T, the Agreement
    and Plan of Reorganization between M&T and AIB
    (“Reorganization Agreement”) includes several
    provisions related to the corporate governance of M&T that
    provide AIB with representation on the M&T and M&T
    Bank boards of directors and key board committees and certain
    protections of its rights as a substantial M&T shareholder.
    In addition, AIB has rights that will facilitate its ability to
    maintain its proportionate ownership position in M&T.

With respect to AIB’s right to have representation on the
    M&T and M&T Bank boards of directors and key board
    committees, for as long as AIB holds at least 15% of
    M&T’s outstanding common stock, AIB is entitled to
    designate four individuals, reasonably acceptable to M&T,
    on both the M&T and M&T Bank boards of directors. In
    addition, one of the AIB designees to the M&T board of
    directors will serve on each of the Executive; Nomination,
    Compensation and Governance; and Audit and Risk committees.
    Also, as long as AIB holds at least 15% of M&T’s
    outstanding common stock, neither the M&T nor the



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

M&T Bank board of directors may consist of more than
    28 directors without the consent of the M&T directors
    designated by AIB. AIB will continue to enjoy these rights if
    its holdings of M&T common stock drop below 15%, but not
    below 12%, so long as AIB restores its ownership percentage to
    15% within one year. In the event that AIB holds at least 10%,
    but less than 15%, of M&T’s outstanding common stock,
    AIB will be entitled to designate at least two individuals on
    both the M&T and M&T Bank boards of directors and, in
    the event that AIB holds at least 5%, but less than 10%, of
    M&T’s outstanding common stock, AIB will be entitled
    to designate one individual on both the M&T and M&T
    Bank boards of directors. M&T also has the right to appoint
    one representative to the AIB board while AIB remains a
    significant shareholder.

There are several other corporate governance provisions that
    serve to protect AIB’s rights as a substantial M&T
    shareholder and are embodied in M&T’s certificate of
    incorporation and bylaws. These protections include an effective
    consent right in connection with certain actions by M&T,
    such as amending M&T’s certificate of incorporation or
    bylaws in a manner inconsistent with AIB’s rights, engaging
    in activities not permissible for a bank holding company or
    adopting any shareholder rights plan or other measures intended
    to prevent or delay any transaction involving a change in
    control of M&T. AIB has the right to limit, with the
    agreement of at least one non-AIB designee on the M&T board
    of directors, other actions by M&T, such as reducing
    M&T’s cash dividend policy such that the ratio of cash
    dividends to net income is less than 15%, acquisitions and
    dispositions of significant amounts of assets, and the
    appointment or election of the chairman of the board of
    directors or the chief executive officer of M&T. The
    protective provisions described above will cease to be
    applicable when AIB no longer owns at least 15% of
    M&T’s outstanding common stock, calculated as
    described in the Reorganization Agreement.

Relationship
    with Bayview Lending Group LLC and Bayview Financial Holdings,
    L.P.

On February 5, 2007 M&T invested $300 million to
    acquire a minority interest in Bayview Lending Group LLC
    (“BLG”), a privately-held commercial mortgage lender
    that specializes in originating, securitizing and servicing
    small balance commercial real estate loans in the United States,
    and to a lesser extent, in Canada and the United Kingdom.
    M&T recognizes income from BLG using the equity method of
    accounting.

Bayview Financial Holdings, L.P. (together with its affiliates,
    “Bayview Financial”), a privately-held specialty
    mortgage finance company, is BLG’s majority investor. In
    addition to their common investment in BLG, the Company and
    Bayview Financial conduct other business activities with each
    other. The Company has purchased loan servicing rights for small
    balance commercial mortgage loans from BLG and Bayview Financial
    having outstanding principal balances of $4.9 billion and
    $3.3 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Amounts recorded as capitalized servicing assets
    for such loans totaled $57 million at December 31,
    2007 and $36 million at December 31, 2006. In
    addition, capitalized servicing rights at December 31, 2007
    and 2006 also included $40 million and $44 million,
    respectively, for servicing rights that were purchased from
    Bayview Financial related to residential mortgage loans with
    outstanding principal balances of $4.6 billion at
    December 31, 2007 and $4.5 billion at
    December 31, 2006. Revenues from servicing residential and
    small balance commercial mortgage loans purchased from BLG and
    Bayview Financial were $48 million, $38 million and
    $27 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    M&T Bank provided a $120 million revolving line of
    credit facility to Bayview Financial at December 31, 2007
    of which $9 million was outstanding. There were no
    outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2006 on a similar
    revolving line of credit facility which aggregated
    $100 million. Finally, at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    the Company held $450 million and $198 million,
    respectively, of private collateralized mortgage obligations in
    its available for sale investment securities portfolio that were
    securitized by Bayview Financial.
