PART I

Item 1.

Business.

M&T Bank Corporation (“Registrant” or
    “M&T”) is a New York business corporation which
    is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding
    Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”) and under

Article III-A

of the New York Banking Law (“Banking Law”). The
    principal executive offices of the Registrant are located at One
    M&T Plaza, Buffalo, New York 14203. The Registrant was
    incorporated in November 1969. The Registrant and its direct and
    indirect subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the
    “Company.” As of December 31, 2008 the Company
    had consolidated total assets of $65.8 billion, deposits of
    $42.6 billion and stockholders’ equity of
    $6.8 billion. The Company had 12,167 full-time and
    1,453 part-time employees as of December 31, 2008.

At December 31, 2008, the Registrant had two wholly owned
    bank subsidiaries: M&T Bank and M&T Bank, National
    Association (“M&T Bank, N.A.”). The banks
    collectively offer a wide range of commercial banking, trust and
    investment services to their customers. At December 31,
    2008, M&T Bank represented 98% of consolidated assets of
    the Company. M&T Bank operates branch offices in New York,
    Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Virginia, West
    Virginia and the District of Columbia.

The Company from time to time considers acquiring banks, thrift
    institutions, branch offices of banks or thrift institutions, or
    other businesses within markets currently served by the Company
    or in other locations that would complement the Company’s
    business or its geographic reach. The Company has pursued
    acquisition opportunities in the past, continues to review
    different opportunities, including the possibility of major
    acquisitions, and intends to continue this practice.

Relationship
    With Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c.

On April 1, 2003, M&T completed the acquisition of
    Allfirst Financial Inc. (“Allfirst”), a bank holding
    company headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland from Allied Irish
    Banks, p.l.c. (“AIB”). Under the terms of the
    Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated September 26,
    2002 by and among AIB, Allfirst and M&T (the
    “Reorganization Agreement”), M&T combined with
    Allfirst through the acquisition of all of the issued and
    outstanding Allfirst stock in exchange for
    26,700,000 shares of M&T common stock and $886,107,000
    in cash paid to AIB. In addition, there were several M&T
    corporate governance changes that resulted from the transaction.
    While it maintains a significant ownership in M&T, AIB will
    have representation on the M&T board, the M&T Bank
    board and key M&T board committees and will have certain
    protections of its rights as a substantial M&T shareholder.
    In addition, AIB will have rights that will facilitate its
    ability to maintain its proportionate ownership position in
    M&T. M&T will also have representation on the AIB
    board while AIB remains a significant shareholder. The following
    is a description of the ongoing relationship between M&T
    and AIB. The following description is qualified in its entirety
    by the terms of the Reorganization Agreement. The Reorganization
    Agreement was filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on
    October 3, 2002 as Exhibit 2 to the Current Report on

Form 8-K

of M&T dated September 26, 2002.

Board of
    Directors; Management

At December 31, 2008, AIB held approximately 24.2% of the
    issued and outstanding shares of M&T common stock. In
    defining their relationship after the acquisition, M&T and
    AIB negotiated certain agreements regarding share ownership and
    corporate governance issues such as board representation, with
    the number of AIB’s representatives on the M&T and
    M&T Bank boards of directors being dependent upon the
    amount of M&T common stock held by AIB. M&T has the
    right to one seat on the AIB board of directors until AIB no
    longer holds at least 15% of the outstanding shares of M&T
    common stock. Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, AIB has
    the right to name four members to serve on the Boards of
    Directors of M&T and M&T Bank, each of whom must be
    reasonably acceptable to M&T (collectively, the “AIB
    Designees”). Further, one of the AIB Designees will serve
    on each of the Executive Committee, Nomination, Compensation and
    Governance Committee, and Audit and Risk Committee (or any
    committee or committees performing comparable functions) of the
    M&T board of directors. In order to serve, the AIB
    Designees must meet the requisite independence and expertise
    requirements prescribed under applicable law or stock exchange
    rules. In addition, the Reorganization Agreement provides that
    the board of directors of M&T Bank will include four
    members designated by AIB, each of whom must be reasonably
    acceptable to M&T.



As long as AIB remains a significant shareholder of M&T,
    AIB will have representation on the boards of directors of both
    M&T and M&T Bank as follows:

•

As long as AIB holds at least 15% of the outstanding shares of
    M&T common stock, AIB will be entitled to designate four
    persons on both the M&T and M&T Bank boards of
    directors and representation on the committees of the M&T
    board described above.

•

If AIB holds at least 10%, but less than 15%, of the outstanding
    shares of M&T common stock, AIB will be entitled to
    designate at least two people on both the M&T and M&T
    Bank boards of directors.

•

If AIB’s ownership interest in M&T is at least 5%, but
    less than 10%, of the outstanding shares of M&T common
    stock, AIB will be entitled to designate at least one person on
    both the M&T and M&T Bank boards of directors.

•

As long as AIB holds at least 15% of the outstanding shares of
    M&T common stock, neither M&T’s board of
    directors nor M&T Bank’s board of directors will
    consist of more than twenty-eight directors without the consent
    of the AIB Designees.

•

If AIB’s holdings of M&T common stock fall below 15%,
    but not lower than 12% of the outstanding shares of M&T
    common stock, AIB will continue to have the same rights that it
    would have had if it owned 15% of the outstanding shares of
    M&T common stock, as long as AIB restores its ownership
    percentage to 15% within one year. Additionally, as described in
    more detail below, M&T has agreed to repurchase shares of
    M&T common stock in order to offset dilution to AIB’s
    ownership interests that may otherwise be caused by issuances of
    M&T common stock under M&T employee and director
    benefit or stock purchase plans. Dilution of AIB’s
    ownership position caused by such issuances will not be counted
    in determining whether the “Sunset Date” has occurred
    or whether any of AIB’s other rights under the
    Reorganization Agreement have terminated. The “Sunset
    Date” is the date on which AIB no longer holds at least 15%
    of the M&T common stock, calculated as described in this
    paragraph.

The AIB Designees at December 31, 2008 were Michael D.
    Buckley, Colm E. Doherty, Richard G. King and Eugene J. Sheehy.
    Mr. Buckley serves as a member of the Executive Committee
    and the Nomination, Compensation and Governance Committee, and
    Mr. King serves as a member of the Audit and Risk
    Committee. Robert G. Wilmers, Chairman of the Board and Chief
    Executive Officer of M&T, is a member of the AIB board of
    directors.

Amendments
    to M&T’s Bylaws

Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, M&T amended and
    restated its bylaws. The following is a description of the
    amended bylaws:

The amended bylaws provide that until the Sunset Date, the
    M&T board of directors may not take or make any
    recommendation to M&T’s shareholders regarding the
    following actions without the approval of the Executive
    Committee, including the approval of the AIB Designee serving on
    the committee:

•

Any amendment of M&T’s Certificate of Incorporation or
    bylaws that would be inconsistent with the rights described
    herein or that would otherwise have an adverse effect on the
    board representation, committee representation or other rights
    of AIB contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement;

•

Any activity not permissible for a U.S. bank holding
    company;

•

The adoption of any shareholder rights plan or other measures
    having the purpose or effect of preventing or materially
    delaying completion of any transaction involving a change in
    control of M&T; and

•

Any public announcement disclosing M&T’s desire or
    intention to take any of the foregoing actions.

The amended bylaws also provide that until the Sunset Date, the
    M&T board of directors may only take or make any
    recommendation to M&T’s shareholders regarding the
    following actions if the action has been approved by the
    Executive Committee (in the case of the first four items and
    sixth item below) or Nomination, Compensation and Governance
    Committee (in the case of the fifth item below)



and the members of such committee not voting in favor of the
    action do not include the AIB Designee serving on such committee
    and at least one other member of the committee who is not an AIB
    Designee:

•

Any reduction in M&T’s cash dividend policy such that
    the ratio of cash dividends to net income is less than 15%, or
    any extraordinary dividends or distributions to holders of
    M&T common stock;

•

Any acquisition of any assets or businesses, (1) if the
    consideration is in M&T common stock, where the stock
    consideration paid by M&T exceeds 10% of the aggregate
    voting power of M&T common stock and (2) if the
    consideration is cash, M&T stock or other consideration,
    where the fair market value of the consideration paid by
    M&T exceeds 10% of the market capitalization of M&T,
    as determined under the Reorganization Agreement;

•

Any sale of any assets or businesses in which the value of the
    aggregate consideration to be received exceeds 10% of the market
    capitalization of M&T, as determined under the
    Reorganization Agreement;

•

Any liquidation or dissolution of M&T;

•

The appointment or election of the Chairman of the board of
    directors or the Chief Executive Officer of M&T; and

•

Any public announcement disclosing M&T’s desire or
    intention to take any of the foregoing actions prior to
    obtaining the requisite committee approval.

The provisions of the bylaws described above may not be amended
    or repealed without the unanimous approval of the entire
    M&T board of directors or the approval of the holders of
    not less than 80% of the outstanding shares of M&T common
    stock. The provisions of the bylaws described above will
    automatically terminate when AIB holds less than 5% of the
    outstanding shares of M&T common stock.

Investment
    Parameters

The Reorganization Agreement provides that through the second
    anniversary of the Sunset Date, without prior written consent of
    the M&T board of directors, AIB will not, directly or
    indirectly, acquire or offer to acquire (except by way of stock
    dividends, offerings made available to M&T shareholders
    generally, or pursuant to compensation plans) more than 25% of
    the then outstanding shares of M&T common stock. Further,
    during this period, AIB and AIB’s subsidiaries have agreed
    not to participate in any proxy solicitation or to otherwise
    seek to influence any M&T shareholder with respect to the
    voting of any shares of M&T common stock for the approval
    of any shareholder proposals.

The Reorganization Agreement also provides that, during this
    period, AIB will not make any public announcement with respect
    to any proposal or offer by AIB or any AIB subsidiary with
    respect to certain transactions (such as mergers, business
    combinations, tender or exchange offers, the sale or purchase of
    securities or similar transactions) involving M&T or any of
    the M&T subsidiaries. The Reorganization Agreement also
    provides that, during this period, AIB may not subject any
    shares of M&T common stock to any voting trust or voting
    arrangement or agreement and will not execute any written
    consent as a shareholder with respect to the M&T common
    stock.

The Reorganization Agreement also provides that, during this
    period, AIB will not seek to control or influence the
    management, the board of directors or policies of M&T,
    including through communications with shareholders of M&T
    or otherwise, except through non-public communications with the
    directors of M&T, including the AIB Designees.

These restrictions on AIB will no longer apply if a third party
    commences or announces its intention to commence a tender offer
    or an exchange offer and, within a reasonable time, the M&T
    board of directors either does not recommend that shareholders
    not accept the offer or fails to adopt a shareholders rights
    plan, or if M&T or M&T Bank becomes subject to any
    regulatory capital directive or becomes an institution in
    “troubled” condition under applicable banking
    regulations. However, in the event the tender offer or exchange
    offer is not commenced or consummated in accordance with its
    terms, the restrictions on AIB described above will thereafter
    continue to apply.

Anti-Dilution
    Protections

M&T has agreed that until the Sunset Date, in the event
    M&T issues shares of M&T stock (other than certain
    issuances to employees pursuant to option and benefit plans),
    subject to applicable law and



regulatory requirements, AIB will have the right to purchase at
    fair market value up to the number of shares of M&T common
    stock required to increase or maintain its equity interest in
    M&T to 22.5% of the then outstanding M&T common stock.

M&T has also agreed that until the Sunset Date, in
    connection with any issuance of M&T stock pursuant to
    employee option or benefit plans, M&T will as soon as
    reasonably practicable, taking into account applicable law,
    regulatory capital requirements, capital planning and risk
    management, take such necessary actions so that AIB’s
    proportionate ownership of M&T common stock is not reduced
    as a result of such issuances, including by funding such
    issuances through purchases of M&T common stock in the open
    market or by undertaking share repurchase programs.

Sale of
    M&T Common Stock; Right of First Refusal in Certain
    Circumstances

The M&T common stock issued to AIB was not registered under
    the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and
    may only be disposed of by AIB pursuant to an effective
    registration statement or pursuant to an exemption from
    registration under the Securities Act and subject to the
    provisions of the Reorganization Agreement.

M&T and AIB have entered into a registration rights
    agreement that provides that upon AIB’s request, M&T
    will file a registration statement relating to all or a portion
    of AIB’s shares of M&T common stock providing for the
    sale of such shares by AIB from time to time on a continuous
    basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act,
    provided that M&T need only effect one such “shelf
    registration” in any

12-month

period. In addition, the registration rights agreement provides
    that AIB is entitled to demand registration under the Securities
    Act of all or part of its shares of M&T stock, provided
    that M&T is not obligated to effect two such “demand
    registrations” in any

12-month

period. Any demand or shelf registration must cover no less than
    one million shares.

The registration rights agreement further provides that in the
    event M&T proposes to file a registration statement other
    than pursuant to a shelf registration or demand registration or

Forms S-8

or

S-4,

for
    an offering and sale of shares by M&T in an underwritten
    offering or an offering and sale of shares on behalf of one or
    more selling shareholders, M&T must give AIB notice at
    least 15 days prior to the anticipated filing date, and AIB
    may request that all or a portion of its M&T common shares
    be included in the registration statement. M&T will honor
    the request, unless the managing underwriter advises M&T in
    writing that in its opinion the inclusion of all shares
    requested to be included by M&T, the other selling
    shareholders, if any, and AIB would materially and adversely
    affect the offering, in which case M&T may limit the number
    of shares included in the offering to a number that would not
    reasonably be expected to have such an effect. In such event,
    the number of shares to be included in the registration
    statement shall first include the number of shares requested to
    be included by M&T and then the shares requested by other
    selling shareholders, including AIB, on a pro rata basis
    according to the number of shares requested to be included in
    the registration statement by each shareholder.

As long as AIB holds 5% or more of the outstanding shares of
    M&T common stock, AIB will not dispose of any of its shares
    of M&T common stock except, subject to the terms and
    conditions of the Reorganization Agreement and applicable law,
    in a widely dispersed public distribution; a private placement
    in which no one party acquires the right to purchase more than
    2% of the outstanding shares of M&T common stock; an
    assignment to a single party (such as a broker or investment
    banker) for the purpose of conducting a widely dispersed public
    distribution on AIB’s behalf; pursuant to Rule 144
    under the Securities Act; pursuant to a tender or exchange offer
    to M&T’s shareholders not opposed by M&T’s
    board of directors, or open market purchase programs made by
    M&T; with the consent of M&T, which consent will not
    be unreasonably withheld, to a controlled subsidiary of AIB; or
    pursuant to M&T’s right of first refusal as described
    below.

The Reorganization Agreement provides that until AIB no longer
    holds at least 5% of the outstanding shares of M&T common
    stock, if AIB wishes to sell or otherwise transfer any of its
    shares of M&T common stock other than as described in the
    preceding paragraph, AIB must first submit an offer notice to
    M&T identifying the proposed transferee and setting forth
    the proposed terms of the transaction, which shall be limited to
    sales for cash, cash equivalents or marketable securities.
    M&T will have the right, for 20 days following receipt
    of an offer notice from AIB, to purchase all (but not less than
    all) of the shares of M&T common stock that AIB wishes to
    sell, on the proposed terms specified in



the offer notice. If M&T declines or fails to respond to
    the offer notice within 20 days, AIB may sell all or a
    portion of the M&T shares specified in the offer notice to
    the proposed transferee at a purchase price equal to or greater
    than the price specified in the offer notice, at any time during
    the three months following the date of the offer notice, or, if
    prior notification to or approval of the sale by the Federal
    Reserve Board or another regulatory agency is required, AIB
    shall pursue regulatory approval expeditiously and the sale may
    occur on the first date permitted under applicable law.

Certain
    Post-Closing Bank Regulatory Matters

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
    (“Federal Reserve Board”) deems AIB to be
    M&T’s bank holding company for purposes of the BHCA.
    In addition, the New York Banking Superintendent (“Banking
    Superintendent”) deems AIB to be M&T’s bank
    holding company for purposes of

Article III-A

of the Banking Law. Among other things, this means that, should
    M&T propose to make an acquisition or engage in a new type
    of activity that requires the submission of an application or
    notice to the Federal Reserve Board or the Banking
    Superintendent, AIB, as well as M&T, may also be required
    to file an application or notice. The Reorganization Agreement
    generally provides that AIB will make any applications, notices
    or filings that M&T determines to be necessary or
    desirable. The Reorganization Agreement also requires AIB not to
    take any action that would have a material adverse effect on
    M&T and to advise M&T prior to entering into any
    material transaction or activity. These provisions of the
    Reorganization Agreement would no longer apply if AIB ceased to
    be M&T’s bank holding company and also was not
    otherwise considered to control M&T for purposes of the
    BHCA.

Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, if, as a result of any
    administrative enforcement action under Section 8 of the
    Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDI Act”),
    memorandum of understanding, written agreement, supervisory
    letter or any other action or determination of any regulatory
    agency relating to the status of AIB (but not relating to the
    conduct of M&T or any subsidiary of M&T), M&T or
    M&T Bank also becomes subject to such an action,
    memorandum, agreement or letter that relates to M&T or any
    M&T subsidiary, or experiences any fact, event or
    circumstance that affects M&T’s regulatory status or
    compliance, and that in either case would be reasonably likely
    to create a material burden on M&T or to cause any material
    adverse economic or operating consequences to M&T or an
    M&T subsidiary (a “Material Regulatory Event”),
    then M&T will notify AIB thereof in writing as promptly as
    practicable. Should AIB fail to cure the Material Regulatory
    Event within 90 days following the receipt of such notice,
    AIB will, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than
    30 days from the end of the cure period, take any and all
    such actions (with the reasonable cooperation of M&T as
    requested by AIB) as may be necessary or advisable in order that
    it no longer has “control” of M&T for purposes of
    the BHCA, including, if necessary, by selling some or all of its
    shares of M&T common stock (subject to the right of first
    refusal provisions of the Reorganization Agreement) and
    divesting itself as required of its board and committee
    representation and governance rights as set forth in the
    Reorganization Agreement. If, at the end of such

30-day

period, the Material Regulatory Event is continuing and AIB has
    not terminated its control of M&T, then M&T will have
    the right to repurchase, at fair market value, such amount of
    the M&T common stock owned by AIB as would result in AIB
    holding no less than 4.9% of the outstanding shares of M&T
    common stock, pursuant to the procedures detailed in the
    Reorganization Agreement.

As long as AIB is considered to “control” M&T for
    purposes of the BHCA or the federal Change in Bank Control Act,
    if AIB acquires any insured depository institution with total
    assets greater than 25% of the assets of M&T’s largest
    insured depository institution subsidiary, then within two years
    AIB must terminate its affiliation with the insured depository
    institution or take such steps as may be necessary so that none
    of M&T’s bank subsidiaries would be subject to
    “cross guarantee” liability for losses incurred if the
    institution AIB acquired potentially were to fail. This
    liability applies under the FDI Act to insured depository
    institutions that are commonly controlled. The actions AIB would
    take could include disposing of shares of M&T common stock

and/or

surrendering its representation or governance rights. Also, if
    such an insured depository institution that is controlled by AIB
    and of the size described in the first sentence of this
    paragraph that would be considered to be commonly controlled
    with M&T’s insured depository institution subsidiaries
    fails to meet applicable requirements to be “adequately
    capitalized” under applicable U.S. banking laws, then
    AIB will have to take the actions described in the previous



sentence no later than 180 days after the date that the
    institution failed to meet those requirements, unless the
    institution is sooner returned to “adequately
    capitalized” status.

Segment
    Information, Principal Products/Services and Foreign
    Operations

Information about the Registrant’s business segments is
    included in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements filed
    herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data” and is further discussed
    in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.” The Registrant’s reportable segments have
    been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting
    system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain
    strategic



business units have been combined for segment information
    reporting purposes where the nature of the products and
    services, the type of customer and the distribution of those
    products and services are similar. The reportable segments are
    Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate,
    Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail
    Banking. The Company’s international activities are
    discussed in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements filed
    herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data.”

The only activities that, as a class, contributed 10% or more of
    the sum of consolidated interest income and other income in any
    of the last three years were interest on loans and investment
    securities, and fees for providing deposit account services. The
    amount of income from such sources during those years is set
    forth on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income
    filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Supervision
    and Regulation of the Company

The banking industry is subject to extensive state and federal
    regulation and continues to undergo significant change. The
    following discussion summarizes certain aspects of the banking
    laws and regulations that affect the Company. Proposals to
    change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry
    are frequently raised in Congress, in state legislatures, and
    before the various bank regulatory agencies. The likelihood and
    timing of any changes and the impact such changes might have on
    the Company are impossible to determine with any certainty. A
    change in applicable laws or regulations, or a change in the way
    such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies
    or courts, may have a material impact on the business,
    operations and earnings of the Company. To the extent that the
    following information describes statutory or regulatory
    provisions, it is qualified entirely by reference to the
    particular statutory or regulatory provision.

Financial
    Services Modernization

Under the BHCA, bank holding companies are permitted to offer
    their customers virtually any type of financial service that is
    financial in nature or incidental thereto, including banking,
    securities underwriting, insurance (both underwriting and
    agency), and merchant banking.

In order to engage in these financial activities, a bank holding
    company must qualify and register with the Federal Reserve Board
    as a “financial holding company” by demonstrating that
    each of its bank subsidiaries is “well capitalized,”
    “well managed,” and has at least a
    “satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment
    Act of 1977 (“CRA”). To date, M&T has not elected
    to register as a financial holding company. For as long as AIB
    owns at least 15% of M&T’s outstanding common stock,
    M&T may not become a financial holding company without the
    approval of the Executive Committee of the M&T board of
    directors, which must also include the affirmative approval of
    the AIB Designee on such committee, as described above under the
    caption “Amendments to M&T’s Bylaws.”

The financial activities authorized by the BHCA may also be
    engaged in by a “financial subsidiary” of a national
    or state bank, except for insurance or annuity underwriting,
    insurance company portfolio investments, real estate investment
    and development, and merchant banking, which must be conducted
    in a financial holding company. In order for these financial
    activities to be engaged in by a financial subsidiary of a
    national or state bank, federal law requires each of the parent
    bank (and its sister-bank affiliates) to be well capitalized and
    well managed; the aggregate consolidated assets of all of that
    bank’s financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of
    45% of its consolidated total assets or $50 billion; the
    bank must have at least a satisfactory CRA rating; and, if that
    bank is one of the 100 largest national banks, it must meet
    certain financial rating or other comparable requirements.
    M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. have not elected to engage
    in financial activities through financial subsidiaries. Current
    federal law also establishes a system of functional regulation
    under which the federal banking agencies will regulate the
    banking activities of financial holding companies and
    banks’ financial subsidiaries, the U.S. Securities and
    Exchange Commission will regulate their securities activities,
    and state insurance regulators will regulate their insurance
    activities. Rules developed by the federal financial
    institutions regulators under these laws require disclosure of
    privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow
    consumers to prevent the disclosure of certain personal
    information to nonaffiliated third parties.



Bank
    Holding Company Regulation

As a registered bank holding company, the Registrant and its
    nonbank subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation
    under the BHCA by the Federal Reserve Board and under the
    Banking Law by the Banking Superintendent. The Federal Reserve
    Board requires regular reports from the Registrant and is
    authorized by the BHCA to make regular examinations of the
    Registrant and its subsidiaries.

The Registrant may not acquire direct or indirect ownership or
    control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company,
    including a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal
    Reserve Board, except as specifically authorized under the BHCA.
    The Registrant is also subject to regulation under the Banking
    Law with respect to certain acquisitions of domestic banks.
    Under the BHCA, the Registrant, subject to the approval of the
    Federal Reserve Board, may acquire shares of non-banking
    corporations the activities of which are deemed by the Federal
    Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or
    controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.

The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement powers over bank
    holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries, among
    other things, to interdict activities that represent unsafe or
    unsound practices or constitute violations of law, rule,
    regulation, administrative orders or written agreements with a
    federal bank regulator. These powers may be exercised through
    the issuance of

cease-and-desist

orders, civil money penalties or other actions.

Under the Federal Reserve Board’s statement of policy with
    respect to bank holding company operations, a bank holding
    company is required to serve as a source of financial strength
    to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit all
    available resources to support such institutions in
    circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy.
    Although this “source of strength” policy has been
    challenged in litigation, the Federal Reserve Board continues to
    take the position that it has authority to enforce it. For a
    discussion of circumstances under which a bank holding company
    may be required to guarantee the capital levels or performance
    of its subsidiary banks, see “Capital Adequacy,”
    below. Consistent with this “source of strength”
    policy, the Federal Reserve Board takes the position that a bank
    holding company generally should not maintain a rate of cash
    dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders
    has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the
    prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent
    with the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall
    financial condition. The Federal Reserve also has the authority
    to terminate any activity of a bank holding company that
    constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or
    stability of any subsidiary depository institution or to
    terminate its control of any bank or nonbank subsidiaries.

The BHCA generally permits bank holding companies to acquire
    banks in any state, and preempts all state laws restricting the
    ownership by a bank holding company of banks in more than one
    state. The FDI Act also permits a bank to merge with an
    out-of-state bank and convert any offices into branches of the
    resulting bank if both states have not opted out of interstate
    branching; permits a bank to acquire branches from an
    out-of-state bank if the law of the state where the branches are
    located permits the interstate branch acquisition; and permits
    banks to establish and operate de novo interstate branches
    whenever the host state opts-in to de novo branching. Bank
    holding companies and banks seeking to engage in transactions
    authorized by these laws must be adequately capitalized and
    managed.

The Banking Law authorizes interstate branching by merger or
    acquisition on a reciprocal basis, and permits the acquisition
    of a single branch without restriction, but does not provide for
    de novo interstate branching.

Bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks are also
    subject to the provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of the
    CRA, the Federal Reserve Board (or other appropriate bank
    regulatory agency) is required, in connection with its
    examination of a bank, to assess such bank’s record in
    meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that bank,
    including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. During these
    examinations, the Federal Reserve Board (or other appropriate
    bank regulatory agency) rates such bank’s compliance with
    the CRA as “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,”
    “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial
    Noncompliance.” The failure of a bank to receive at least a
    “Satisfactory” rating could inhibit such bank or its
    bank holding company from undertaking certain activities,
    including acquisitions of other financial institutions or
    opening or relocating a branch office, as further discussed
    below. M&T Bank has a CRA rating of “Outstanding”
    and M&T Bank, N.A. has a CRA rating of
    “Satisfactory.” Furthermore, such assessment is also
    required of any bank that has applied, among other things, to



merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the
    liabilities of a federally-regulated financial institution, or
    to open or relocate a branch office. In the case of a bank
    holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or bank
    holding company, the Federal Reserve Board will assess the
    record of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding
    company in considering the application. The Banking Law contains
    provisions similar to the CRA which are applicable to New
    York-chartered banks. M&T Bank has a CRA rating of
    “Outstanding” as determined by the New York State
    Banking Department.

Supervision
    and Regulation of Bank Subsidiaries

The Registrant’s bank subsidiaries are subject to
    supervision and regulation, and are examined regularly, by
    various bank regulatory agencies: M&T Bank by the Federal
    Reserve Board and the Banking Superintendent; and M&T Bank,
    N.A. by the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). The
    Registrant and its direct non-banking subsidiaries are
    affiliates, within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, of
    the Registrant’s subsidiary banks and their subsidiaries.
    As a result, the Registrant’s subsidiary banks and their
    subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on loans or extensions
    of credit to, purchases of assets from, investments in, and
    transactions with the Registrant and its direct non-banking
    subsidiaries and on certain other transactions with them or
    involving their securities. Similar restrictions are imposed on
    the Registrant’s subsidiary banks making loans or extending
    credit to, purchasing assets from, investing in, or entering
    into transactions with, their financial subsidiaries.

Under the “cross-guarantee” provisions of the FDI Act,
    insured depository institutions under common control are
    required to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered by the FDIC
    as a result of the default of a commonly controlled insured
    depository institution or for any assistance provided by the
    FDIC to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in
    danger of default. Thus, any insured depository institution
    subsidiary of M&T could incur liability to the FDIC in the
    event of a default of another insured depository institution
    owned or controlled by M&T. The FDIC’s claim under the
    cross-guarantee provisions is superior to claims of stockholders
    of the insured depository institution or its holding company and
    to most claims arising out of obligations or liabilities owed to
    affiliates of the institution, but is subordinate to claims of
    depositors, secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt
    (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured
    depository institution. The FDIC may decline to enforce the
    cross-guarantee provisions if it determines that a waiver is in
    the best interest of the DIF.

Dividends

The Registrant is a legal entity separate and distinct from its
    banking and other subsidiaries. The majority of the
    Registrant’s revenue is from dividends paid to the
    Registrant by its subsidiary banks. M&T Bank and M&T
    Bank, N.A. are subject, under one or more of the banking laws,
    to restrictions on the amount of dividend declarations. Future
    dividend payments to the Registrant by its subsidiary banks will
    be dependent on a number of factors, including the earnings and
    financial condition of each such bank, and are subject to the
    limitations referred to in note 23 of Notes to Financial
    Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8,
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and to
    other statutory powers of bank regulatory agencies.

An insured depository institution is prohibited from making any
    capital distribution to its owner, including any dividend, if,
    after making such distribution, the depository institution fails
    to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital
    measure, including the risk-based capital adequacy and leverage
    standards discussed herein.

As described herein under the heading “The Emergency
    Economic Stabilization Act of 2008,” in connection with the
    issuance of Series A Preferred Stock to the U.S. Treasury
    Department (“U.S. Treasury”), M&T is restricted
    from increasing its common stock dividend.

Supervision
    and Regulation of M&T Bank’s Subsidiaries

M&T Bank has a number of subsidiaries. These subsidiaries
    are subject to the laws and regulations of both the federal
    government and the various states in which they conduct
    business. For example, M&T Securities is regulated by the
    Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry
    Regulatory Authority and state securities regulators.



Capital
    Adequacy

The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC have adopted
    risk-based capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding
    companies and banks under their supervision. Under these
    guidelines, the so-called “Tier 1 capital” and
    “Total capital” as a percentage of risk-weighted
    assets and certain off-balance sheet instruments must be at
    least 4% and 8%, respectively.

The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC have also
    imposed a leverage standard to supplement their risk-based
    ratios. This leverage standard focuses on a banking
    institution’s ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total
    assets, adjusted for goodwill and certain other items. Under
    these guidelines, banking institutions that meet certain
    criteria, including excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low
    interest rate exposure and good earnings, and that have received
    the highest regulatory rating must maintain a ratio of
    Tier 1 capital to total adjusted average assets of at least
    3%. Institutions not meeting these criteria, as well as
    institutions with supervisory, financial or operational
    weaknesses, along with those experiencing or anticipating
    significant growth are expected to maintain a Tier 1
    capital to total adjusted average assets ratio equal to at least
    4% to 5%. As reflected in the table in note 23 of Notes to
    Financial Statements filed herewith in Part II,
    Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data,” the risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios of
    the Registrant, M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. as of
    December 31, 2008 exceeded the required capital ratios for
    classification as “well capitalized,” the highest
    classification under the regulatory capital guidelines.

The federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve
    Board and the OCC, maintain risk-based capital standards in
    order to ensure that those standards take adequate account of
    interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk, the risk of
    nontraditional activities and equity investments in nonfinancial
    companies, as well as reflect the actual performance and
    expected risk of loss on certain multifamily housing loans. Bank
    regulators periodically propose amendments to the risk-based
    capital guidelines and related regulatory framework, and
    consider changes to the risk-based capital standards that could
    significantly increase the amount of capital needed to meet the
    requirements for the capital tiers described below. While the
    Company’s management studies such proposals, the timing of
    adoption, ultimate form and effect of any such proposed
    amendments on M&T’s capital requirements and
    operations cannot be predicted.

The federal banking agencies are required to take “prompt
    corrective action” in respect of depository institutions
    and their bank holding companies that do not meet minimum
    capital requirements. The FDI Act establishes five capital
    tiers: “well capitalized,” “adequately
    capitalized,” “undercapitalized,”
    “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically
    undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital
    tier, or that of its bank holding company, depends upon where
    its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital
    measures, including a risk-based capital measure and a leverage
    ratio capital measure, and certain other factors.

Under the implementing regulations adopted by the federal
    banking agencies, a bank holding company or bank is considered
    “well capitalized” if it has (i) a total
    risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, (ii) a
    Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater,
    (iii) a leverage ratio of 5% or greater and (iv) is
    not subject to any order or written directive to meet and
    maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An
    “adequately capitalized” bank holding company or bank
    is defined as one that has (i) a total risk-based capital
    ratio of 8% or greater, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based
    capital ratio of 4% or greater and (iii) a leverage ratio
    of 4% or greater (or 3% or greater in the case of a bank with a
    composite CAMELS rating of 1). A bank holding company or bank is
    considered (A) “undercapitalized” if it has
    (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%,
    (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%
    or (iii) a leverage ratio of less than 4% (or 3% in the
    case of a bank with a composite CAMELS rating of 1);
    (B) “significantly undercapitalized” if the bank
    has (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%,
    or (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than
    3% or (iii) a leverage ratio of less than 3% and
    (C) “critically undercapitalized” if the bank has
    a ratio of tangible equity to total assets equal to or less than
    2%. The Federal Reserve Board may reclassify a “well
    capitalized” bank holding company or bank as
    “adequately capitalized” or subject an
    “adequately capitalized” or
    “undercapitalized” institution to the supervisory
    actions applicable to the next lower capital category if it
    determines that the bank holding company or bank is in an unsafe
    or unsound condition or deems the bank holding company or bank
    to



be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice and not to have
    corrected the deficiency. M&T, M&T Bank and M&T
    Bank, N.A. met the definition of “well capitalized”
    institutions as of December 31, 2008.

“Undercapitalized” depository institutions, among
    other things, are subject to growth limitations, are prohibited,
    with certain exceptions, from making capital distributions, are
    limited in their ability to obtain funding from a Federal
    Reserve Bank and are required to submit a capital restoration
    plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan
    without determining, among other things, that the plan is based
    on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring
    the depository institution’s capital. In addition, for a
    capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository
    institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that
    the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan
    and provide appropriate assurances of performance. If a
    depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan,
    including if the holding company refuses or is unable to make
    the guarantee described in the previous sentence, it is treated
    as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” Failure
    to submit or implement an acceptable capital plan also is
    grounds for the appointment of a conservator or a receiver.
    “Significantly undercapitalized” depository
    institutions may be subject to a number of additional
    requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell
    sufficient voting stock to become “adequately
    capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets and
    cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.
    Moreover, the parent holding company of a “significantly
    undercapitalized” depository institution may be ordered to
    divest itself of the institution or of nonbank subsidiaries of
    the holding company. “Critically undercapitalized”
    institutions, among other things, are prohibited from making any
    payments of principal and interest on subordinated debt, and are
    subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.

Each federal banking agency prescribes standards for depository
    institutions and depository institution holding companies
    relating to internal controls, information systems, internal
    audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest
    rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, a maximum ratio of
    classified assets to capital, minimum earnings sufficient to
    absorb losses, a minimum ratio of market value to book value for
    publicly traded shares and other standards as they deem
    appropriate. The Federal Reserve Board and OCC have adopted such
    standards.

Depository institutions that are not “well
    capitalized” or “adequately capitalized” and have
    not received a waiver from the FDIC are prohibited from
    accepting or renewing brokered deposits. As of December 31,
    2008, M&T Bank had approximately $1.0 billion of
    brokered deposits, while M&T Bank, N.A. did not have any
    brokered deposits at that date.

Although M&T has issued shares of common stock in
    connection with acquisitions or at other times, the Company has
    generally maintained capital ratios in excess of minimum
    regulatory guidelines largely through internal capital
    generation (i.e. net income less dividends paid). Historically,
    M&T’s dividend payout ratio and dividend yield, when
    compared with other bank holding companies, has been relatively
    low, thereby allowing for capital retention to support growth or
    to facilitate purchases of M&T’s common stock to be
    held as treasury stock. Management’s policy of reinvestment
    of earnings and repurchase of shares of common stock is intended
    to enhance M&T’s earnings per share prospects and
    thereby reward stockholders over time with capital gains in the
    form of increased stock price rather than high dividend income.

The
    Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008

In the third quarter of 2008, the Federal Reserve, the
    U.S. Treasury and the FDIC initiated measures to stabilize
    the financial markets and to provide liquidity for financial
    institutions. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008
    (“EESA”) was signed into law on October 3, 2008
    and authorizes the U.S. Treasury to provide funds to be
    used to restore liquidity and stability to the
    U.S. financial system. Under the authority of EESA, the
    U.S. Treasury instituted a voluntary capital purchase
    program to encourage U.S. financial institutions to build
    capital to increase the flow of financing to
    U.S. businesses and consumers and to support the
    U.S. economy. Under the program, the U.S. Treasury has
    been purchasing senior preferred shares of financial
    institutions which will pay cumulative dividends at a rate of 5%
    per year for five years and thereafter at a rate of 9% per year.
    The terms of the senior preferred shares indicate that the
    shares may not be redeemed for three years except with the
    proceeds of a “qualifying equity offering” and that
    after three years, the shares may be redeemed, in whole or in
    part,



at par value plus accrued and unpaid dividends. In February
    2009, legislation was signed that may result in changes in those
    terms. The senior preferred shares are non-voting and qualify as
    Tier 1 capital for regulatory reporting purposes. In
    connection with purchasing senior preferred shares, the
    U.S. Treasury also receives warrants to purchase the common
    stock of participating financial institutions having a market
    price of 15% of the amount of senior preferred shares on the
    date of investment with an exercise price equal to the market
    price of the participating institution’s common stock at
    the time of approval, calculated on a 20-trading day trailing
    average. The warrants have a term of ten years and are
    immediately exercisable, in whole or in part. For a period of
    three years, the consent of the U.S. Treasury will be
    required for participating institutions to increase their common
    stock dividend or repurchase their common stock, other than in
    connection with benefit plans consistent with past practice.
    Participation in the capital purchase program also includes
    certain restrictions on executive compensation. The minimum
    subscription amount available to a participating institution is
    one percent of total risk-weighted assets. The maximum
    subscription amount is three percent of risk-weighted assets. On
    December 23, 2008, M&T issued to the
    U.S. Treasury $600 million of Series A Preferred
    Stock and warrants to purchase 1,218,522 shares of M&T
    Common Stock at $73.86 per share. M&T elected to
    participate in the capital purchase program at an amount equal
    to approximately 1% of its risk-weighted assets at the time.

Following a systemic risk determination pursuant to the FDI Act,
    the FDIC announced a Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program
    (“TLGP”), which temporarily guarantees the senior debt
    of all FDIC-insured institutions and certain holding companies,
    as well as deposits in noninterest-bearing deposit transaction
    accounts, for those institutions and holding companies who did
    not elect to opt out of the TLGP by December 5, 2008.
    M&T chose to continue its participation in the TLGP and,
    thus, did not opt out. To further increase access to funding for
    businesses in all sectors of the economy, the Federal Reserve
    Board announced a Commercial Paper Funding Facility
    (“CPFF”) program, which provides a broad backstop for
    the commercial paper market. Beginning October 27, 2008,
    the CPFF began funding purchases of commercial paper of
    three-month maturity from high-quality issuers.

FDIC
    Deposit Insurance Assessments

As institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC, M&T Bank
    and M&T Bank, N.A. are subject to FDIC deposit insurance
    assessments. Under the provisions of the FDI Act, the regular
    insurance assessments to be paid by insured institutions are
    specified in schedules issued by the FDIC that specify a target
    reserve ratio designed to maintain that ratio between 1.15% and
    1.50% of estimated insured deposits.

Under the FDI Act, the FDIC imposed deposit insurance
    assessments based on one of four assessment categories depending
    on the institution’s capital classification under the
    prompt corrective action provisions described above, and an
    institution’s long-term debt issuer ratings. The adjusted
    assessment rates for insured institutions under the modified
    system range from .05% to .43% depending upon the assessment
    category into which the insured institution is placed. The
    annual assessment rates for M&T Bank and M&T Bank N.A.
    during 2008 were each between .05% and .06%.

The FDI Act also allows for a one-time assessment credit for
    eligible insured depository institutions (those institutions
    that were in existence on December 31, 1996 and paid a
    deposit insurance assessment prior to that date, or are a
    successor to any such institution). The credit is determined
    based on the assessment base of the institution as of
    December 31, 1996 as compared with the combined aggregate
    assessment base of all eligible institutions as of that date.
    Those institutions having credits could use them to offset up to
    100% of the 2007 DIF assessment, and if not completely used in
    2007, may apply the remaining credits to not more than 90% of
    each of the aggregate 2008, 2009 and 2010 DIF assessments.
    M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. offset 90% of their DIF
    assessments with available one-time assessment credits during
    2008. For the first nine months of 2008, credits utilized to
    offset amounts assessed for M&T Bank and M&T Bank,
    N.A. totaled $13 million and $154 thousand, respectively.
    Fourth quarter 2008 assessments for M&T Bank and M&T
    Bank, N.A., which will be assessed in March 2009 and will also
    be offset by 90% of available credits, are estimated to be
    approximately $5 million and $120 thousand, respectively.

In December 2008, the FDIC approved a final rule on deposit
    assessment rates for the first quarter of 2009. The rule raised
    assessment rates uniformly by 7 basis points (annually) for
    the first quarter of



2009 only. The FDIC expects to issue another final rule during
    the first quarter of 2009 to change the way that the FDIC’s
    assessment system differentiates for risk, make corresponding
    changes to assessment rates beginning with the second quarter of
    2009, and make certain technical and other changes to the
    assessment rules. The increase in assessment rates effective
    January 1, 2009 will more than double the Company’s
    expected assessment for 2009’s first quarter. In addition,
    available credits for M&T Bank are now expected to be fully
    utilized in the first quarter of 2009. The Company expects that
    assessment rates subsequent to the first quarter 2009 will
    continue to be significantly higher than in 2008. As a result,
    and considering the full utilization of available credits for
    M&T Bank in the first quarter of 2009, increased FDIC
    insurance expense for the Company in 2009 is expected to have an
    adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations.

In addition to the standard deposit insurance assessments, as
    noted above, in the third quarter of 2008, the FDIC announced
    the TLGP which temporarily guarantees the senior debt of all
    FDIC-insured institutions and certain holding companies, as well
    as deposits in noninterest-bearing deposit transaction accounts.
    As a result, during the final quarter of 2008, M&T Bank
    recognized additional FDIC insurance expense of approximately
    $500 thousand. M&T Bank expects assessments related to
    the TLGP in 2009 of $3 million - $5 million.

Incremental to insurance fund assessments, the FDIC assesses
    deposits to fund the repayment of debt obligations of the
    Financing Corporation (“FICO”). FICO is a government
    agency-sponsored entity that was formed to borrow the money
    necessary to carry out the closing and ultimate disposition of
    failed thrift institutions by the Resolution
    Trust Corporation. The current annualized rate established
    by the FDIC is 1.14 basis points (hundredths of one
    percent).

Consumer
    Protection Laws

In connection with their respective lending and leasing
    activities, M&T Bank, certain of its subsidiaries, and
    M&T Bank, N.A. are each subject to a number of federal and
    state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to
    various sectors of the economy. These laws include the Equal
    Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair
    and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Truth in Lending Act,
    the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Real Estate Settlement
    Procedures Act, and various state law counterparts.

In addition, federal law currently contains extensive customer
    privacy protection provisions. Under these provisions, a
    financial institution must provide to its customers, at the
    inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter,
    the institution’s policies and procedures regarding the
    handling of customers’ nonpublic personal financial
    information. These provisions also provide that, except for
    certain limited exceptions, a financial institution may not
    provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties
    unless the institution discloses to the customer that such
    information may be so provided and the customer is given the
    opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. Federal law makes it
    a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain
    or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature
    by fraudulent or deceptive means.

Sarbanes-Oxley
    Act of 2002

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 implemented a broad range of
    corporate governance, accounting and reporting measures for
    companies that have securities registered under the Exchange
    Act, including publicly-held bank holding companies such as
    M&T. Specifically, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
    various regulations promulgated thereunder, established, among
    other things: (i) requirements for audit committees,
    including independence, expertise, and responsibilities;
    (ii) responsibilities regarding financial statements for
    the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the
    reporting company; (iii) the forfeiture of bonuses or other
    incentive-based compensation and profits from the sale of the
    reporting company’s securities by the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer in the twelve-month period
    following the initial publication of any financial statements
    that later require restatement; (iv) the creation of an
    independent accounting oversight board; (v) standards for
    auditors and regulation of audits, including independence
    provisions that restrict non-audit services that accountants may
    provide to their audit clients; (vi) disclosure and
    reporting obligations for the reporting company and their
    directors and executive officers, including accelerated
    reporting of stock transactions and a



prohibition on trading during pension blackout periods;
    (vii) a prohibition on personal loans to directors and
    officers, except certain loans made by insured financial
    institutions on nonpreferential terms and in compliance with
    other bank regulatory requirements; and (viii) a range of
    civil and criminal penalties for fraud and other violations of
    the securities laws.

USA
    Patriot Act

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate
    Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001
    (the “USA Patriot Act”) imposes obligations on
    U.S. financial institutions, including banks and broker
    dealer subsidiaries, to implement policies, procedures and
    controls which are reasonably designed to detect and report
    instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. In
    addition, provisions of the USA Patriot Act require the federal
    financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the
    effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money
    laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank
    holding company acquisitions. The Registrant and its impacted
    subsidiaries have approved policies and procedures that are
    believed to be compliant with the USA Patriot Act.

Regulatory
    Impact of M&T’s Relationship With AIB

As described above under the caption “Relationship With
    Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c.,” AIB owns approximately 24.2%
    of the issued and outstanding shares of M&T common stock
    and has representation on the M&T and M&T Bank boards
    of directors. As a result, AIB has become M&T’s bank
    holding company under the BHCA and the Banking Law and
    AIB’s relationship with M&T is subject to the statutes
    and regulations governing bank holding companies described
    above. Among other things, AIB will have to join M&T in
    applications by M&T for acquisitions and new activities.
    The Reorganization Agreement requires AIB to join in such
    applications at M&T’s request, subject to certain
    limitations. In addition, because AIB is regulated by the
    Central Bank of Ireland (“CBI”), the CBI may assert
    jurisdiction over M&T as a company controlled by AIB.
    Additional discussion of the regulatory implications of the
    Allfirst acquisition for M&T is set forth above under the
    caption “Certain Post-Closing Bank Regulatory Matters.”

Governmental
    Policies

The earnings of the Company are significantly affected by the
    monetary and fiscal policies of governmental authorities,
    including the Federal Reserve Board. Among the instruments of
    monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement
    these objectives are open-market operations in
    U.S. Government securities and federal funds, changes in
    the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in
    reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These
    instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations
    to influence the overall level of bank loans, investments and
    deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans and paid for
    deposits. The Federal Reserve Board frequently uses these
    instruments of monetary policy, especially its open-market
    operations and the discount rate, to influence the level of
    interest rates and to affect the strength of the economy, the
    level of inflation or the price of the dollar in foreign
    exchange markets. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve
    Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of
    banking institutions in the past and are expected to continue to
    do so in the future. It is not possible to predict the nature of
    future changes in monetary and fiscal policies, or the effect
    which they may have on the Company’s business and earnings.

Competition

The Company competes in offering commercial and personal
    financial services with other banking institutions and with
    firms in a number of other industries, such as thrift
    institutions, credit unions, personal loan companies, sales
    finance companies, leasing companies, securities firms and
    insurance companies. Furthermore, diversified financial services
    companies are able to offer a combination of these services to
    their customers on a nationwide basis. The Company’s
    operations are significantly impacted by state and federal
    regulations applicable to the banking industry. Moreover, the
    provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 have allowed
    for increased competition among diversified financial services
    providers, and the Interstate Banking Act and the Banking Law
    may be considered to have eased



entry into New York State by out-of-state banking institutions.
    As a result, the number of financial services providers and
    banking institutions with which the Company competes may grow in
    the future.

Other
    Legislative Initiatives

Proposals may be introduced in the United States Congress and in
    the New York State Legislature and before various bank
    regulatory authorities which would alter the powers of, and
    restrictions on, different types of banking organizations and
    which would restructure part or all of the existing regulatory
    framework for banks, bank holding companies and other providers
    of financial services. Moreover, other bills may be introduced
    in Congress which would further regulate, deregulate or
    restructure the financial services industry. It is not possible
    to predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted
    into law or, even if enacted, the effect which they may have on
    the Company’s business and earnings.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

M&T and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by
    various risks and uncertainties which are difficult to predict.
    As a financial institution, the Company has significant exposure
    to market risk, including interest-rate risk, liquidity risk and
    credit risk, among others. Adverse experience with these or
    other risks could have a material impact on the Company’s
    financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the
    value of the Company’s financial instruments in general,
    and M&T’s common stock, in particular.



Interest Rate Risk — The Company is exposed to
    interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and
    deposit-taking since assets and liabilities reprice at different
    times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a
    result, net interest income, which represents the largest
    revenue source for the Company, is subject to the effects of
    changing interest rates. The Company closely monitors the
    sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates
    and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as
    interest rates change. The Company makes use of both on- and
    off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to
    interest rate risk. Possible actions to mitigate such risk
    include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan
    and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to,
    modifying or terminating interest rate swap agreements or other
    financial instruments used for interest rate risk management
    purposes.

Liquidity Risk — Liquidity refers to the
    Company’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and
    liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future
    financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit
    withdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporate
    purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of
    financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.
    The Company obtains funding through deposits and various
    short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal
    funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to
    repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, offshore branch
    deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New
    York and others. Should the Company experience a substantial
    deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or
    should the availability of funding become restricted due to
    disruption in the financial markets, the Company’s ability
    to obtain funding from these or other sources could be
    negatively impacted. The Company attempts to quantify such
    credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the
    liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade
    over various grading levels. The Company estimates such impact
    by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines
    of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and
    securitizable assets. To mitigate such risk, the Company
    maintains available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve
    Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York that
    are secured by loans and investment securities. On an ongoing
    basis, management closely monitors the Company’s liquidity
    position for compliance with internal policies and believes that
    available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding
    needs in the normal course of business.

Credit Risk — Factors that influence the
    Company’s credit loss experience include overall economic
    conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and,
    due to the size of the Company’s real estate loan portfolio
    and mortgage-related investment securities portfolio, real
    estate valuations, in particular. Other factors that can
    influence the Company’s credit loss experience, in addition
    to general economic conditions and borrowers’ specific
    abilities to repay loans, include: (i) the impact of
    declining real estate values in the Company’s portfolio of
    loans to residential real estate builders and developers;
    (ii) the repayment performance associated with the
    Company’s portfolio of alternative residential mortgage
    loans and residential and other mortgage loans supporting
    mortgage-related securities; (iii) the concentration of
    commercial real estate loans in the Company’s loan
    portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured
    by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York
    City metropolitan area, in particular; (iv) the amount of
    commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New
    York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in
    central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less
    economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other
    regions of the country; and (v) the size of the
    Company’s portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which
    historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a
    percentage of loans outstanding than many other loan types.

Throughout 2008, there had been considerable concerns about the
    deepening economic downturn in both national and international
    markets; the level and volatility of energy prices; a weakened
    housing market; the troubled state of financial and credit
    markets; Federal Reserve positioning of monetary policy; rising
    private sector layoffs and unemployment, which caused consumer
    spending to slow; the underlying impact on businesses’
    operations and abilities to repay loans as consumer spending
    slowed; continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New
    York and central Pennsylvania regions; and continued slowing of
    automobile sales. Late in 2008 the U.S economy was identified as
    having been in recession since the fourth quarter of 2007.
    However, given that approximately 70% of the Company’s
    loans are to customers in New York State and Pennsylvania,
    including a large portion to customers in the



traditionally slower growth or stagnant regions of upstate New
    York and Central Pennsylvania, the impact of deteriorating
    national market conditions was not as pronounced on borrowers in
    these regions as compared with other areas of the country. Home
    prices in upstate New York and central Pennsylvania
    increased in 2008, in sharp contrast to steep declines in values
    in other regions of the country. Therefore, despite the
    conditions, as previously described, the most severe credit
    issues experienced by the Company through 2008 were centered
    around residential real estate, including loans to developers
    and builders of residential real estate in areas other than New
    York state and Pennsylvania. In response, throughout 2008 the
    Company conducted detailed reviews of all loans to residential
    real estate builders and developers that exceeded
    $2.5 million. Those credit reviews were updated throughout
    the year and resulted in adjustments to loan grades and, if
    appropriate, commencement of intensified collection efforts,
    including foreclosure. With regard to residential real estate
    loans, with special emphasis on the portfolio of Alt-A mortgage
    loans, the Company expanded its collections and loan work-out
    staff and further refined its loss identification and estimation
    techniques by reference to loan performance and house price
    depreciation data in specific areas of the country where
    collateral that was securing the Company’s residential real
    estate loans was located.

All of these factors can affect the Company’s credit loss
    experience. To help manage credit risk, the Company maintains a
    detailed credit policy and utilizes various committees that
    include members of senior management to approve significant
    extensions of credit. The Company also maintains a credit review
    department that regularly reviews the Company’s loan and
    lease portfolios to ensure compliance with established credit
    policy. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses
    that in management’s judgment is adequate to absorb losses
    inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. In addition, the
    Company regularly reviews its investment securities for declines
    in value below amortized cost that might be characterized as
    “other than temporary.” Any declines in value below
    amortized cost that are deemed to be “other than
    temporary” are charged to earnings.

Economic Risk — The U.S. economy was in recession
    during 2008. As a result, several additional risk factors have
    been identified, as follows:

•

The significant downturn in the residential real estate market
    that began in 2007 had continued in 2008. The impact of that
    downturn has resulted in declining home prices, higher
    foreclosures and loan charge-offs, and lower market prices on
    investment securities backed by residential real estate. These
    factors could negatively impact M&T’s results of
    operations.

•

Lower demand for Company’s products and services and lower
    revenues and earnings could result from an economic recession.

•

Lower fee income from the Company’s brokerage and trust
    businesses could result from significant declines in stock
    market prices.

•

Lower earnings could result from other-than temporary impairment
    charges related to the Company’s investment securities
    portfolio.

•

Higher FDIC insurance costs due to bank failures that have
    caused the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund to fall below minimum
    required levels.

•

There is no assurance that the Emergency Economic Stabilization
    Act of 2008 will improve the condition of the financial markets.

Supervision and Regulation — The Company is subject to
    extensive state and federal laws and regulations governing the
    banking industry, in particular, and public companies, in
    general, including laws related to corporate taxation. Many of
    those laws and regulations are described in Part I,
    Item 1 “Business.” Changes in those or other laws
    and regulations, or the degree of the Company’s compliance
    with those laws and regulations as judged by any of several
    regulators, including tax authorities, that oversee the Company,
    could have a significant effect on the Company’s operations
    and its financial results.

Detailed discussions of the specific risks outlined above and
    other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

in Part  I, Item 1 “Business,” and
    Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
    Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading
    “Forward-Looking Statements” is included a description
    of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by
    management that are difficult to predict and that could



materially affect the Company’s financial condition and
    results of operations, as well as the value of the
    Company’s financial instruments in general, and M&T
    common stock, in particular.

In addition, the market price of M&T common stock may
    fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other
    factors, including changes in securities analysts’
    estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market
    prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in
    market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting
    policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory agencies.

Item 2.

Properties.

Both M&T and M&T Bank maintain their executive offices
    at One M&T Plaza in Buffalo, New York. This twenty-one
    story headquarters building, containing approximately
    279,000 rentable square feet of space, is owned in fee by
    M&T Bank and was completed in 1967. M&T, M&T Bank
    and their subsidiaries occupy approximately 92% of the building
    and the remainder is leased to non-affiliated tenants. At
    December 31, 2008, the cost of this property (including
    improvements subsequent to the initial construction), net of
    accumulated depreciation, was $6.8 million.

In September 1992, M&T Bank acquired an additional facility
    in Buffalo, New York with approximately 360,000 rentable
    square feet of space. Approximately 89% of this facility, known
    as M&T Center, is occupied by M&T Bank and its
    subsidiaries, with the remainder leased to non-affiliated
    tenants. At December 31, 2008, the cost of this building
    (including improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of
    accumulated depreciation, was $11.8 million.

M&T Bank also owns and occupies two separate facilities in
    the Buffalo area which support certain back-office and
    operations functions of the Company. The total square footage of
    these facilities approximates 215,000 square feet and their
    combined cost (including improvements subsequent to
    acquisition), net of accumulated depreciation, was
    $18.7 million at December 31, 2008.

M&T Bank also owns a facility in Syracuse, New York with
    approximately 150,000 rentable square feet of space.
    Approximately 45% of this facility is occupied by M&T Bank.
    At December 31, 2008, the cost of this building (including
    improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of accumulated
    depreciation, was $7.3 million.

M&T Bank also owns facilities in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
    and Millsboro, Delaware with approximately 207,000 and
    322,000 rentable square feet of space, respectively.
    M&T Bank occupies approximately 38% and 84% of these
    respective facilities. At December 31, 2008, the cost of
    these buildings (including improvements subsequent to
    acquisition), net of accumulated depreciation, was
    $12.5 million and $7.5 million, respectively.

No other properties owned by M&T Bank have more than
    100,000 square feet of space. The cost, net of accumulated
    depreciation and amortization, of the Company’s premises
    and equipment is detailed in note 6 of Notes to Financial
    Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8,
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Of the
    685 domestic banking offices of the Registrant’s subsidiary
    banks at December 31, 2008, 288 are owned in fee and 397
    are leased.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings.

In October 2007, Visa completed a reorganization in
    contemplation of its initial public offering (“IPO”)
    expected to occur in 2008. As part of that reorganization,
    M&T Bank and other member banks of Visa received shares of
    common stock of Visa, Inc. Those banks are also obligated under
    various agreements with Visa to share in losses stemming from
    certain litigation (“Covered Litigation”). M&T
    Bank is not a named defendant in any of the Covered Litigation.
    Although Visa was expected to set aside a portion of the
    proceeds from its IPO in an escrow account to fund any judgments
    or settlements that may arise out of the Covered Litigation,
    guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) indicated that Visa member banks should record
    a liability for the fair value of the contingent obligation to
    Visa. The estimation of the Company’s proportionate share
    of any potential losses related to the Covered



Litigation was extremely difficult and involved a great deal of
    judgment. Nevertheless, in the fourth quarter of 2007 the
    Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $23 million
    ($14 million after tax effect) related to the Covered
    Litigation. In accordance with GAAP and consistent with the SEC
    guidance, the Company did not recognize any value for its common
    stock ownership interest in Visa, Inc. at that time. During the
    first quarter of 2008, Visa completed its IPO and, as part of
    the transaction, funded an escrow account for $3 billion
    from the proceeds of the IPO to cover potential settlements
    arising out of the Covered Litigation. As a result, during 2008,
    the Company reversed approximately $15 million of the
    $23 million accrued during the fourth quarter of 2007 for
    the Covered Litigation. The initial accrual in 2007 and the
    partial reversal in 2008 were included in “other costs of
    operations” in the consolidated statement of income. In
    addition, M&T Bank was allocated 1,967,028 Class B
    common shares of Visa. Of those shares, 760,455 were mandatorily
    redeemed in March 2008 resulting in a pre-tax gain of
    $33 million ($20 million after tax), which has been
    included in “gain on bank investment securities” in
    the consolidated statement of income. During the fourth quarter
    of 2008, Visa announced that it had settled an additional
    portion of the Covered Litigation and it further funded the
    escrow account to provide for that settlement. That settlement
    and subsequent funding of the escrow account did not result in a
    material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial
    position or results of operations.

M&T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course
    of business to various pending and threatened legal proceedings
    in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. Management,
    after consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that
    the aggregate ultimate liability arising out of litigation
    pending against M&T or its subsidiaries will be material to
    M&T’s consolidated financial position, but at the
    present time is not in a position to determine whether such
    litigation will have a material adverse effect on
    M&T’s consolidated results of operations in any future
    reporting period.

    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

Corporate
    Profile and Significant Developments

M&T Bank Corporation (“M&T”) is a bank
    holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York with
    consolidated assets of $65.8 billion at December 31,
    2008. The consolidated financial information presented herein
    reflects M&T and all of its subsidiaries, which are
    referred to collectively as “the Company.”
    M&T’s wholly owned bank subsidiaries are M&T Bank
    and M&T Bank, National Association (“M&T Bank,
    N.A.”).

M&T Bank, with total assets of $64.8 billion at
    December 31, 2008, is a New York-chartered commercial bank
    with 684 banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania,
    Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Virginia, West Virginia and
    the District of Columbia, and an office in the Cayman Islands.
    M&T Bank and its subsidiaries offer a broad range of
    financial services to a diverse base of consumers, businesses,
    professional clients, governmental entities and financial
    institutions located in their markets. Lending is largely
    focused on consumers residing in New York State, Pennsylvania,
    Maryland, northern Virginia and Washington, D.C., and on
    small and medium size businesses based in those areas, although
    residential and commercial real estate loans are originated
    through lending offices in six other states. Certain lending
    activities are also conducted in other states through various
    subsidiaries. M&T Bank’s subsidiaries include:
    M&T Credit Services, LLC, a consumer lending and commercial
    leasing and lending company; M&T Real Estate Trust, a
    commercial mortgage lender; M&T Realty Capital Corporation,
    a



multifamily commercial mortgage lender; M&T Securities,
    Inc., which provides brokerage, investment advisory and
    insurance services; MTB Investment Advisors, Inc., which serves
    as investment advisor to the MTB Group of Funds, a family of
    proprietary mutual funds, and other funds and institutional
    clients; and M&T Insurance Agency, Inc., an insurance
    agency.

M&T Bank, N.A., with total assets of $939 million at
    December 31, 2008, is a national bank with an office in
    Oakfield, New York. M&T Bank, N.A. offers selected deposit
    and loan products on a nationwide basis, largely through
    telephone, Internet and direct mail marketing techniques.

On December 18, 2008, M&T entered into a definitive
    agreement to acquire Provident Bankshares Corporation
    (“Provident”), a bank holding company headquartered in
    Baltimore, Maryland, in a stock-for-stock transaction. Provident
    will merge with and into First Empire State Holding Company, a
    wholly owned direct subsidiary of M&T formed solely for the
    purposes of the merger. Immediately following the acquisition,
    Provident’s wholly owned banking subsidiary, Provident Bank
    of Maryland (“Provident Bank”) will be merged with and
    into M&T Bank. Provident Bank operates 143 branch offices
    located primarily in Maryland and Virginia. At December 31,
    2008, Provident had $6.6 billion in assets, including
    $4.4 billion of loans and leases and $1.4 billion of
    investment securities, and $5.9 billion of liabilities,
    including $4.8 billion of deposits. The merger requires the
    approval of various regulatory agencies and Provident’s
    shareholders and, assuming those approvals are obtained, is
    expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2009.
    Under the terms of the merger agreement, Provident common
    shareholders will receive 0.171625 shares of M&T
    common stock in exchange for each share of Provident common
    stock they own. Provident Series A and Series B
    preferred stock will be exchanged for series of M&T
    preferred stock on substantially the same terms. The acquisition
    of Provident will expand the Company’s presence in the
    Mid-Atlantic area, is expected to give the Company the
    second-largest deposit share in Maryland, and will triple the
    Company’s presence in Virginia.

The condition of the residential real estate marketplace and the
    U.S. economy in 2007 and 2008 has had a significant impact
    on the financial services industry as a whole, and specifically
    on the financial results of the Company. Beginning with a
    pronounced downturn in the residential real estate market in
    early 2007 that was led by problems in the sub-prime mortgage
    market, the deterioration of residential real estate values and
    higher delinquencies and charge-offs of loans continued
    throughout 2008. The drop in real estate values negatively
    impacted residential real estate builder and developer
    businesses. With the U.S. economy in recession in 2008,
    financial institutions were facing higher credit losses from
    distressed real estate values and borrower defaults, resulting
    in reduced capital levels. In addition, investment securities
    backed by residential and commercial real estate were reflecting
    substantial unrealized losses due to a lack of liquidity in the
    financial markets and anticipated credit losses. Some financial
    institutions were forced into liquidation or were merged with
    stronger institutions as losses increased and the amounts of
    available funding and capital levels lessened. The Federal
    National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and The
    Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie
    Mac”), two government-sponsored entities, were placed in
    conservatorship in September 2008 by the U.S. Government.
    The Federal Reserve also lowered its federal funds target rate
    in the fourth quarter of 2008 three times, from 2.00% at the
    beginning of the quarter to a range of 0% - .25% at
    December 31, 2008.

In the third quarter of 2008, the Federal Reserve, the
    U.S. Treasury Department (“U.S. Treasury”)
    and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)
    initiated measures to stabilize the financial markets and to
    provide liquidity for financial institutions. The Emergency
    Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”) was signed
    into law on October 3, 2008 and authorizes the
    U.S. Treasury to provide funds to be used to restore
    liquidity and stability to the U.S. financial system. Under
    the authority of EESA, the U.S. Treasury instituted a
    voluntary capital purchase program to encourage
    U.S. financial institutions to build capital to increase
    the flow of financing to U.S. businesses and consumers and
    to support the U.S. economy. Under the program, the
    U.S. Treasury has been purchasing senior preferred shares
    of financial institutions which will pay cumulative dividends at
    a rate of 5% per year for five years and thereafter at a rate of
    9% per year. The terms of the senior preferred shares indicate
    that the shares may not be redeemed for three years except with
    the proceeds of a “qualifying equity offering” and
    that after three years, the shares may be redeemed, in whole or
    in part, at par value plus accrued and unpaid dividends. In
    February 2009, legislation was signed that may result in changes
    in those terms. The senior preferred shares are non-voting and
    qualify as Tier 1 capital for regulatory reporting
    purposes. In



connection with purchasing senior preferred shares, the
    U.S. Treasury also receives warrants to purchase the common
    stock of participating financial institutions having a market
    price of 15% of the amount of senior preferred shares on the
    date of investment with an exercise price equal to the market
    price of the participating institution’s common stock at
    the time of approval, calculated on a 20-trading day trailing
    average. The warrants have a term of ten years and are
    immediately exercisable, in whole or in part. For a period of
    three years, the consent of the U.S. Treasury will be
    required for participating institutions to increase their common
    stock dividend or repurchase their common stock, other than in
    connection with benefit plans consistent with past practice.
    Participation in the capital purchase program also includes
    certain restrictions on executive compensation. The minimum
    subscription amount available to a participating institution is
    one percent of total risk-weighted assets. The maximum suggested
    subscription amount is three percent of risk-weighted assets. On
    December 23, 2008, M&T issued to the
    U.S. Treasury $600 million of Series A preferred
    stock and warrants to purchase 1,218,522 shares of M&T
    common stock at $73.86 per share. M&T elected to
    participate in the capital purchase program at an amount equal
    to approximately 1% of its risk-weighted assets at the time.

Following a systemic risk determination pursuant to the Federal
    Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC announced a Temporary Liquidity
    Guarantee Program (“TLGP”), which temporarily
    guarantees the senior debt of all FDIC-insured institutions and
    certain holding companies, as well as deposits in
    noninterest-bearing deposit transaction accounts, for those
    institutions and holding companies who did not elect to opt out
    of the TLGP by December 5, 2008. M&T chose to continue
    its participation in the TLGP and, thus, did not opt out. To
    further increase access to funding for businesses in all sectors
    of the economy, the Federal Reserve Board announced a Commercial
    Paper Funding Facility (“CPFF”) program, which
    provides a broad backstop for the commercial paper market.
    Beginning October 27, 2008, the CPFF began funding
    purchases of commercial paper of three-month maturity from
    high-quality issuers.

On November 30, 2007, M&T acquired Partners
    Trust Financial Group, Inc. (“Partners Trust”), a
    bank holding company headquartered in Utica, New York. Partners
    Trust Bank, the primary banking subsidiary of Partners
    Trust, was merged into M&T Bank on that date. Partners
    Trust Bank operated 33 branch offices in upstate New
    York at the date of acquisition. The results of operations
    acquired in the Partners Trust transaction have been included in
    the Company’s financial results since November 30,
    2007, but did not have a material effect on the Company’s
    results of operations in 2007 or in 2008. After application of
    the election, allocation and proration procedures contained in
    the merger agreement with Partners Trust, M&T paid
    $282 million in cash and issued 3,096,861 shares of
    M&T common stock in exchange for Partners Trust shares
    outstanding at the time of acquisition. In addition, based on
    the merger agreement, M&T paid $9 million in cash to
    holders of outstanding and unexercised stock options granted by
    Partners Trust. The purchase price was approximately
    $559 million based on the cash paid to Partners Trust
    shareholders, the fair value of M&T common stock exchanged,
    and the cash paid to holders of Partners Trust stock options.
    The acquisition of Partners Trust expanded the Company’s
    presence in upstate New York, making M&T Bank the deposit
    market share leader in the Utica-Rome and Binghamton markets,
    while strengthening its lead position in Syracuse.

Assets acquired from Partners Trust on November 30, 2007
    totaled $3.5 billion, including $2.2 billion of loans
    and leases (largely residential real estate and consumer loans),
    liabilities assumed aggregated $3.0 billion, including
    $2.2 billion of deposits (largely savings, money-market and
    time deposits), and $277 million was added to
    stockholders’ equity. In connection with the acquisition,
    the Company recorded approximately $283 million of goodwill
    and $50 million of core deposit intangible. The core
    deposit intangible is being amortized over 7 years using an
    accelerated method.

As a condition of the approval of the Partners Trust acquisition
    by regulators, M&T Bank was required to divest three of the
    acquired branch offices in Binghamton, New York. The three
    branches were sold on March 15, 2008, including loans of
    $13 million and deposits of $65 million. No gain or
    loss was recognized on that transaction.

On December 7, 2007, M&T Bank acquired the
    Mid-Atlantic retail banking franchise of First Horizon Bank
    (“First Horizon”), a subsidiary of First Horizon
    National Corporation, in a cash transaction, including
    $214 million of loans, $216 million of deposits and
    $80 million of trust and investment assets under
    management. The transaction did not have a significant effect on
    the Company’s results of operations during 2007 or 2008. In
    connection with the transaction, the Company recorded



approximately $15 million of core deposit and other
    intangible assets that are being amortized using accelerated
    methods over a weighted-average life of 7 years.

The Company incurred merger-related expenses associated with the
    Partners Trust and First Horizon transactions related to systems
    conversions and other costs of integrating and conforming
    acquired operations with and into the Company of approximately
    $15 million ($9 million net of applicable income
    taxes, or $.08 of diluted earnings per common share) during 2007
    and $4 million ($2 million net of applicable income
    taxes, or $.02 of diluted earnings per common share) during
    2008. Those expenses consisted largely of professional services
    and other temporary help fees associated with the conversion of
    systems

and/or

integration of operations; costs related to branch and office
    consolidations; incentive compensation; initial marketing and
    promotion expenses designed to introduce the Company to
    customers of the acquired operations; travel costs; printing,
    postage and supplies; and other costs of commencing operations
    in new offices. In accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles (“GAAP”), included in the determination of
    goodwill associated with the Partners Trust acquisition were
    charges totaling $14 million, net of applicable income
    taxes ($18 million before tax effect), for severance costs
    for former Partners Trust employees, termination of Partners
    Trust contracts for various services and other items. As of
    December 31, 2008, there were no significant amounts of
    unpaid merger-related expenses or charges included in the
    determination of goodwill.

On February 5, 2007, M&T invested $300 million to
    acquire a 20 percent minority interest in Bayview Lending
    Group LLC (“BLG”), a privately-held commercial
    mortgage lender that specializes in originating, securitizing
    and servicing small balance commercial real estate loans.
    M&T recognizes income from BLG using the equity method of
    accounting. M&T’s pro-rata portion of the results of
    operations of BLG was a loss of $37 million
    ($23 million after tax effect) in 2008 and income of
    $9 million ($5 million after tax effect) in 2007,
    which have been recorded as a component of “other
    income” in the consolidated statement of income. Including
    expenses associated with M&T’s investment in BLG, most
    notably interest expense, that investment reduced the
    Company’s net income in 2008 by $32 million (after tax
    effect) or $.29 per diluted common share and in 2007 by
    $4 million (after tax effect) or $.04 per diluted common
    share.

On June 30, 2006, M&T Bank completed the acquisition
    of 21 branch offices in Buffalo and Rochester, New York from
    Citibank, N.A., including approximately $269 million of
    loans, mostly to consumers, small businesses and middle market
    customers, and approximately $1.0 billion of deposits.
    Expenses associated with integrating the acquired branches into
    M&T Bank and introducing the customers associated with
    those branches to M&T Bank’s products and services
    aggregated $3 million, after applicable tax effect, or $.03
    of diluted earnings per common share during the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

The Company’s significant accounting policies conform with
    GAAP and are described in note 1 of Notes to Financial
    Statements. In applying those accounting policies, management of
    the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many
    of the methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized.
    Certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent
    on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility
    in the Company’s reported financial performance should the
    assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes
    in circumstances. Some of the more significant areas in which
    management of the Company applies critical assumptions and
    estimates include the following:

•

Allowance for credit losses — The allowance for credit
    losses represents the amount which, in management’s
    judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in
    the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. A
    provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of
    the allowance as deemed necessary by management. In estimating
    losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, assumptions and
    judgment are applied to measure amounts and timing of expected
    future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to
    determine the borrowers’ abilities to repay obligations.
    Historical loss trends are also considered, as are economic
    conditions, industry trends, portfolio trends and
    borrower-specific financial data. Changes in the circumstances
    considered when determining management’s estimates and
    assumptions could result in



changes in those estimates and assumptions, which may result in
    adjustment of the allowance. A detailed discussion of facts and
    circumstances considered by management in assessing the adequacy
    of the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the
    heading “Provision for Credit Losses.”

•

Valuation methodologies — Management of the Company
    applies various valuation methodologies to assets and
    liabilities which often involve a significant degree of
    judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the
    particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred
    to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as
    trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real
    estate loans held for sale and related commitments. However, for
    those items for which an observable liquid market does not
    exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions
    to value such items. Examples of these items include loans,
    deposits, borrowings, goodwill, core deposit and other
    intangible assets, and other assets and liabilities obtained or
    assumed in business combinations; capitalized servicing assets;
    pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; value
    ascribed to stock-based compensation; estimated residual values
    of property associated with leases; and certain derivative and
    other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of
    various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates,
    rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default
    rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of
    different assumptions could produce significantly different
    results, which could have material positive or negative effects
    on the Company’s results of operations. In addition to
    valuation, the Company must assess whether there are any
    declines in value below the carrying value of assets that should
    be considered other than temporary or otherwise require an
    adjustment in carrying value and recognition of a loss in the
    consolidated statement of income. Examples include investment
    securities, other investments, mortgage servicing rights,
    goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, among
    others. Specific assumptions and estimates utilized by
    management are discussed in detail herein in management’s
    discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
    operations and in notes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 18, 19
    and 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.

•

Commitments, contingencies and off-balance sheet
    arrangements — Information regarding the
    Company’s commitments and contingencies, including
    guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation,
    and their potential effects on the Company’s results of
    operations is included in note 21 of Notes to Financial
    Statements. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to
    examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such
    examinations may result in challenges to the tax return
    treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions.
    Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to
    record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate.
    Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that
    management’s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and
    adjustments required could have a material effect on the
    Company’s results of operations. Information regarding the
    Company’s income taxes is presented in note 13 of
    Notes to Financial Statements. The recognition or de-recognition
    in the Company’s consolidated financial statements of
    assets and liabilities held by so-called variable interest
    entities is subject to the interpretation and application of
    complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that
    require management to estimate and assess the probability of
    financial outcomes in future periods. Information relating to
    the Company’s involvement in such entities and the
    accounting treatment afforded each such involvement is included
    in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Overview

The Company’s net income for 2008 was $556 million or
    $5.01 of diluted earnings per common share, representing
    declines of 15% and 16%, respectively, from $654 million or
    $5.95 of diluted earnings per common share in 2007. Basic
    earnings per common share decreased 17% to $5.04 in 2008 from
    $6.05 in 2007. Net income in 2006 aggregated $839 million,
    while diluted and basic earnings per common share were $7.37 and
    $7.55, respectively. The after-tax impact of acquisition and
    integration-related expenses (included herein as merger-related
    expenses) associated with the 2007 business combination and
    branch acquisition transactions were $2 million
    ($4 million pre-tax) or $.02 of basic and diluted earnings
    per



common share in 2008 and $9 million ($15 million
    pre-tax) or $.08 of basic and diluted earnings per common share
    in 2007. Similar costs related to the 2006 branch acquisition
    transaction were $3 million ($5 million pre-tax) or
    $.03 of basic and diluted earnings per common share in 2006. Net
    income represented a rate of return on average assets in 2008 of
    .85%, compared with 1.12% in 2007 and 1.50% in 2006. The return
    on average common stockholders’ equity was 8.64% in 2008,
    10.47% in 2007 and 13.89% in 2006.

The Company’s financial results for 2008 were affected by
    several notable factors. Largely the result of the state of the
    U.S. economy and the distressed residential real estate
    marketplace, the Company’s provision for credit losses in
    2008 was $412 million, significantly higher than
    $192 million in 2007. Net charge-offs of loans rose
    dramatically in 2008, to $383 million from
    $114 million in 2007. Net loan charge-offs as a percentage
    of average loans outstanding were .78% and .26% in 2008 and
    2007, respectively. While charge-offs were up in all major
    categories of loans, the most significant contributors to the
    sharp rise were loan charge-offs related to residential real
    estate markets; charge-offs of loans to builders and developers
    of residential real estate jumped from $4 million in 2007
    to $100 million in 2008, and residential real estate loan
    charge-offs grew to $63 million in 2008 from
    $19 million in 2007. Not only did the condition of the
    residential real estate markets negatively impact the
    Company’s financial results in 2008 through a higher
    provision for credit losses, but significantly higher costs were
    incurred related to the workout process for modifying the
    residential mortgage loans of creditworthy borrowers and to the
    foreclosure process for borrowers unable to make payments on
    their loans.

During the third quarter, a $153 million (pre-tax)
    other-than-temporary impairment charge was recorded related to
    preferred stock issuances of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The
    write-down was taken on preferred stock with a basis of
    $162 million following the U.S. Government’s
    placement of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship on
    September 7, 2008. At December 31, 2008 the fair value
    of the securities of $2 million (adjusted cost basis of
    $9 million) was reflected in the Company’s
    available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. The Company
    recognized additional other-than-temporary impairment charges
    during 2008 totaling $29 million (pre-tax) related to
    certain collateralized debt obligations (obtained from Partners
    Trust) and collateralized mortgage obligations. In total,
    other-than-temporary impairment charges on investment securities
    aggregated $182 million ($111 million after tax
    effect) during 2008, thereby lowering diluted earnings per
    common share by $1.00.

Also reflected in the Company’s 2008 results was
    $29 million, or $.26 of diluted earnings per common share,
    resulting from M&T Bank’s status as a member bank of
    Visa. During the last quarter of 2007, Visa completed a
    reorganization in contemplation of its initial public offering
    (“IPO”) in 2008. As part of that reorganization
    M&T Bank and other member banks of Visa received shares of
    Class B common stock of Visa. Those banks are also
    obligated under various agreements with Visa to share in losses
    stemming from certain litigation involving Visa (“Covered
    Litigation”). As of December 31, 2007, although Visa
    was expected to set aside a portion of the proceeds from its IPO
    in an escrow account to fund any judgments or settlements that
    may arise out of the Covered Litigation, guidance from the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) indicated
    that Visa member banks should record a liability for the fair
    value of the contingent obligation to Visa. The estimation of
    the Company’s proportionate share of any potential losses
    related to the Covered Litigation was extremely difficult and
    involved a great deal of judgment. Nevertheless, in the fourth
    quarter of 2007 the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of
    $23 million ($14 million after tax effect, or $.13 per
    diluted common share) related to the Covered Litigation. In
    accordance with GAAP and consistent with the SEC guidance, the
    Company did not recognize any value for its common stock
    ownership interest in Visa as of the 2007 year-end. During
    the first quarter of 2008, Visa completed its IPO and, as part
    of the transaction, funded an escrow account with
    $3 billion from the proceeds of the IPO to cover potential
    settlements arising out of the Covered Litigation. As a result,
    during the first three months of 2008, the Company reversed
    approximately $15 million of the $23 million accrued
    during the fourth quarter of 2007 for the Covered Litigation,
    adding $9 million to net income ($.08 per diluted common
    share). In addition, M&T Bank was allocated 1,967,028
    Class B common shares of Visa based on its proportionate
    ownership of Visa. Of those shares, 760,455 were mandatorily
    redeemed in March 2008 for an after-tax gain of $20 million
    ($33 million pre-tax), which has been recorded as
    “gain on bank investment securities” in the
    consolidated statement of income, adding $.18 to diluted
    earnings per common share. During the fourth quarter of 2008,
    Visa



announced that it had settled an additional portion of the
    Covered Litigation and it further funded the escrow account to
    provide for that settlement. That settlement and subsequent
    funding of the escrow account did not result in a material
    impact to the Company’s consolidated financial position or
    results of operations.

The Company resolved certain tax issues during the third quarter
    of 2008 related to its activities in various jurisdictions
    during the years

1999-2007.

As a result, the Company paid $40 million to settle those
    issues, but was able to reduce previously accrued income tax
    expense in 2008 by $40 million, thereby adding $.36 to
    diluted earnings per common share.

The Company’s financial results for 2007 were adversely
    impacted by several events. Turmoil in the residential real
    estate market, which began in early 2007, significantly affected
    the Company’s financial results in a number of ways.
    Problems experienced by lenders in the sub-prime residential
    mortgage lending market also had negative repercussions on the
    rest of the residential real estate marketplace. Through early
    2007, the Company had been an active participant in the
    origination of alternative

(“Alt-A”)

residential real estate loans and the sale of such loans in the
    secondary market. Alt-A loans originated by M&T typically
    included some form of limited documentation requirements as
    compared with more traditional residential real estate loans.
    Unfavorable market conditions during the first quarter of 2007,
    including a lack of liquidity, impacted the Company’s
    willingness to sell Alt-A loans, as an auction of such loans
    initiated by the Company received fewer bids than normal and the
    pricing of those bids was substantially lower than expected. As
    a result, $883 million of Alt-A loans previously held for
    sale (including $808 million of first mortgage loans and
    $75 million of second mortgage loans) were transferred in
    March 2007 to the Company’s held-for-investment loan
    portfolio. In accordance with GAAP, loans held for sale must be
    recorded at the lower of cost or market value. Accordingly,
    prior to reclassifying the Alt-A mortgage loans to the
    held-for-investment portfolio, the carrying value of such loans
    was reduced by $12 million ($7 million after tax
    effect, or $.07 of diluted earnings per common share). Those
    loans were reclassified because management believed at that time
    that the value of the Alt-A residential real estate loans was
    greater than the amount implied by the few bidders who were
    active in the market. The downturn in the residential real
    estate market, specifically related to declining real estate
    valuations and higher delinquencies, continued throughout the
    remainder of 2007 and had a negative effect on the majority of
    financial institutions active in residential real estate
    lending. Margins earned by the Company from sales of residential
    real estate loans in the secondary market were lower in 2007
    than in 2006.

The Company is contractually obligated to repurchase some
    previously sold residential real estate loans that do not
    ultimately meet investor sale criteria, including instances
    where mortgagors fail to make timely payments during the first
    90 days subsequent to the sale date. Requests from
    investors for the Company to repurchase residential real estate
    loans increased significantly in early 2007, particularly
    related to Alt-A loans. As a result, during 2007’s first
    quarter the Company reduced mortgage banking revenues by
    $6 million ($4 million after tax effect, or $.03 of
    diluted earnings per common share) related to declines in market
    values of previously sold residential real estate loans that the
    Company may be required to repurchase.

The Company had $1.2 billion of Alt-A residential real
    estate loans in its held-for-investment loan portfolio at
    December 31, 2007. Lower real estate values and higher
    levels of delinquencies and charge-offs contributed to increased
    losses in that portfolio during 2007, which led to an assessment
    of the Company’s accounting practices during the fourth
    quarter as they related to the timing of the classification of
    residential real estate loans as nonaccrual and when such loans
    were charged off. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007,
    residential real estate loans were classified as nonaccrual when
    principal or interest payments became 90 days delinquent.
    Previously, residential real estate loans had been placed in
    nonaccrual status when payments were 180 days past due.
    Also in 2007’s final quarter, the Company began
    charging-off loan balances over the net realizable value of the
    property collateralizing the loan when such loans become
    150 days delinquent, whereas previously the Company
    provided an allowance for credit losses for those amounts and
    charged-off loans upon foreclosure of the underlying property.
    The impact of the acceleration of the classification of
    residential real estate loans as nonaccrual resulted in an
    increase in nonperforming loans of $84 million at
    December 31, 2007 and a corresponding decrease in loans
    past due 90 days and accruing interest. As a result of that
    acceleration, previously accrued



interest of $2 million was reversed and charged against
    income. Included in the $114 million of net charge-offs for
    2007 were $15 million resulting from the change in
    accounting procedure. The declining residential real estate
    values also contributed to specific allocations of the allowance
    for credit losses related to two residential real estate
    builders and developers during the fourth quarter of 2007.
    Considering these and other factors as discussed herein under
    the heading “Provision for Credit Losses,” the Company
    significantly increased the provision for credit losses in 2007
    to $192 million, compared with $80 million in 2006.

The turbulence in the residential real estate market in 2007
    also negatively affected the Company’s investment
    securities portfolio. Three collateralized debt obligations were
    purchased in the first quarter of 2007 for approximately
    $132 million. The securities are backed largely by
    residential mortgage-backed securities (collateralized by a mix
    of prime, mid-prime and sub-prime residential mortgage loans)
    and are held in the Company’s available-for-sale portfolio.
    Although these securities were highly rated when purchased, two
    of the three securities were downgraded by the rating agencies
    in late-2007. After a thorough analysis, management concluded
    that the impairment of the market value of these securities was
    other than temporary. As a result, the Company recorded an
    impairment charge of $127 million ($78 million after
    tax effect, or $.71 of diluted earnings per common share) in the
    fourth quarter of 2007. The impairment charge reduced the
    Company’s exposure to collateralized debt obligations
    backed by residential mortgage securities to approximately
    $4 million.

Finally, as already noted, during the last quarter of 2007, the
    Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $23 million
    ($14 million after tax effect, or $.13 per diluted common
    share) related to the Visa Covered Litigation.

Net interest income expressed on a taxable-equivalent basis in
    2008 rose 5% to $1.96 billion from $1.87 billion in
    2007. The positive impact of higher average earning assets was
    partially offset by a decline in net interest margin, or
    taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage
    of average earning assets. Average earning assets increased 12%
    to $58.0 billion in 2008 from $52.0 billion in 2007,
    the result of increased average balances of loans and leases and
    investment securities. Earning assets obtained in the fourth
    quarter 2007 acquisition transactions were $3.3 billion.
    Average loans and leases of $48.8 billion in 2008 were
    $4.7 billion or 11% higher than $44.1 billion in 2007,
    due to growth in commercial loans and leases of
    $1.6 billion, or 13%, commercial real estate loans of
    $2.7 billion, or 17%, and consumer loans and leases of
    $961 million, or 9%, partially offset by a
    $550 million, or 9%, decline in consumer real estate loans.
    Reflected in those amounts were loans obtained in the 2007
    acquisition transactions aggregating $2.4 billion at the
    respective acquisition dates, including $259 million of
    commercial loans and leases, $343 million of commercial real
    estate loans, $1.1 billion of residential real estate loans
    and $690 million of consumer loans. Of the
    $1.1 billion of residential real estate loans acquired,
    approximately $950 million were securitized into Fannie Mae
    mortgage-backed securities in December 2007. The acquired loans
    did not have a significant impact on average loans and leases
    for 2007. Average balances of investment securities increased
    23% to $9.0 billion in 2008 from $7.3 billion in 2007.
    The net interest margin declined 22 basis points
    (hundredths of one percent) to 3.38% in 2008 from 3.60% in 2007,
    largely due to a decrease in the contribution ascribed to net
    interest-free funds that resulted largely from the impact of
    lower interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities used to
    value such funds.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income in 2007 was 2% higher
    than $1.84 billion in 2006. The impact of higher average
    earning asset balances was largely offset by a decline in net
    interest margin. Average earning assets increased 5% to
    $52.0 billion in 2007 from $49.7 billion in 2006 due
    to higher loan and lease balances, partially offset by lower
    average balances of investment securities. Average loans and
    leases outstanding in 2007 rose $2.7 billion or 7% to
    $44.1 billion from $41.4 billion in 2006, the result
    of growth in commercial loans and leases of $858 million,
    or 8%, commercial real estate loans of $653 million, or 4%,
    consumer real estate loans of $1.0 billion, or 20%, and
    consumer loans and leases of $186 million, or 2%. The
    $2.4 billion of loans obtained in the 2007 acquisition
    transactions did not have a significant impact on average loans
    and leases for 2007. The average balance of investment
    securities outstanding declined $717 million, or 9%, to
    $7.3 billion in 2007 from $8.0 billion in 2006 due
    largely to net paydowns and maturities of mortgage-backed
    securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and
    U.S. federal agency securities. The Company’s net
    interest margin narrowed 10 basis points to 3.60% in 2007
    from 3.70% in 2006. That narrowing was the result of several
    factors, including higher rates paid



on deposit accounts and variable-rate borrowings that were only
    partially offset by higher yields earned on loans and investment
    securities.

The provision for credit losses rose to $412 million in
    2008 from $192 million in 2007 and $80 million in
    2006. Deteriorating credit conditions that were reflected in
    rising levels of charge-offs and delinquencies, as well as
    rapidly declining residential real estate valuations during 2007
    and continuing in 2008 and their impact on the Company’s
    portfolios of residential mortgage loans and loans to
    residential builders and developers, contributed significantly
    to the increases in the provision. Also contributing to the
    higher levels of the provision, charge-offs and delinquencies in
    2008 was the impact of the condition of the U.S. economy,
    which was in recession. The level of the provision during 2006
    was reflective of generally favorable credit quality. Net
    charge-offs were $383 million in 2008, up from
    $114 million in 2007 and $68 million in 2006. Net
    charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases
    outstanding rose to .78% in 2008 from .26% in 2007 and .16% in
    2006. The provision in each year represents the result of
    management’s analysis of the composition of the loan and
    lease portfolio and other factors, including concern regarding
    uncertainty about economic conditions, both nationally and in
    many of the markets served by the Company, and the impact of
    such conditions and prospects on the abilities of borrowers to
    repay loans.

Noninterest income in 2008 aggregated $939 million,
    compared with $933 million in 2007. Reflected in
    2008’s total were $148 million of losses from bank
    investment securities, compared with $126 million of such
    losses in the 2007 noninterest income amount. Those losses were
    due predominately to other-than-temporary impairment charges
    related to certain of M&T’s collateralized debt
    obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations, and preferred
    stock holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, all held in the
    available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. The 2008
    losses are net of the already noted $33 million gain from
    the sale of shares of Visa. Excluding the impact of those net
    securities losses, noninterest income was $1.09 billion in
    2008, 3% higher than $1.06 billion in 2007. That 3% rise
    reflected higher mortgage banking revenues and fees for
    providing deposit services that were partially offset by a
    $46 million decline in M&T’s pro-rata portion of
    the operating results of BLG.

Noninterest income in 2007 declined 11% from $1.05 billion
    in 2006. That decline resulted from the $127 million
    other-than-temporary impairment charge in 2007 related to
    collateralized debt obligations held in the Company’s
    available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. That charge
    is reflected in “losses from bank investment
    securities” in the consolidated statement of income.
    Excluding securities gains or losses, noninterest income in 2007
    was 1% higher than in 2006. Higher service charges on deposit
    accounts, trust income, and trading account and foreign exchange
    gains, and $9 million related to M&T’s pro-rata
    portion of the operating results of BLG, were largely offset by
    a $31 million decline in mortgage banking revenues.
    Contributing to the decline in mortgage banking revenues were
    changing market conditions, which led to slimmer margins
    realized on sales of residential real estate loans. In addition,
    the Company recognized $18 million of losses in the first
    quarter of 2007 related to its Alt-A loan portfolio due to
    declines in the market values of such loans. Included in
    noninterest income in 2006 was a $13 million gain resulting
    from the accelerated recognition of a purchase accounting
    premium related to the call of a $200 million Federal Home
    Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Atlanta borrowing assumed in a
    previous acquisition.

Noninterest expense in 2008 totaled $1.73 billion, up 6%
    from $1.63 billion in 2007. Noninterest expense in 2006 was
    $1.55 billion. Included in such amounts are expenses
    considered by M&T to be “nonoperating” in nature,
    consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible
    assets of $67 million, $66 million and
    $63 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and
    merger-related expenses of $4 million in 2008,
    $15 million in 2007 and $5 million in 2006. Exclusive
    of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses
    aggregated $1.66 billion in 2008, $1.55 billion in
    2007 and $1.48 billion in 2006. Noninterest expenses in
    2008 included an addition to the valuation allowance for
    capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of
    $16 million, as compared with partial reversals of the
    valuation allowance of $4 million in 2007 and
    $10 million in 2006. Also contributing to the rise in
    operating expenses were higher expenses for salaries, occupancy,
    professional services, advertising and promotion, and foreclosed
    residential real estate properties. Partially offsetting those
    factors was the $23 million charge taken in the fourth
    quarter of 2007 related to M&T Bank’s obligation as a
    member bank of Visa to share in losses stemming from certain
    litigation, compared with a partial



reversal of that charge in the first quarter of 2008 of
    $15 million. Included in operating expenses in 2006 was an
    $18 million tax-deductible contribution made to The
    M&T Charitable Foundation, a tax-exempt private charitable
    foundation. A similar $6 million contribution was made in
    2008, whereas no such contribution was made in 2007. Excluding
    the impact of the Visa charge in 2007 and the charitable
    contribution in 2006, operating expenses in 2007 were up 4% from
    2006, largely due to a higher level of salaries and employee
    benefits expense reflecting the impact of merit pay increases,
    increased incentive compensation and higher costs for providing
    medical benefits to employees.

The efficiency ratio expresses the relationship of operating
    expenses to revenues. The Company’s efficiency ratio, or
    noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of
    taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income
    (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities),
    was 54.4% in 2008, compared with 52.8% in 2007 and 51.5% in 2006.

Interest income data are on a
    taxable-equivalent basis. The taxable-equivalent adjustment
    represents additional income taxes that would be due if all
    interest income were subject to income taxes. This adjustment,
    which is related to interest received on qualified municipal
    securities, industrial revenue financings and preferred equity
    securities, is based on a composite income tax rate of
    approximately 39%.

Supplemental
    Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations

As a result of business combinations and other acquisitions, the
    Company had intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core
    deposit and other intangible assets totaling $3.4 billion
    at each of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and
    $3.2 billion at December 31, 2006. Included in such
    intangible assets was goodwill of $3.2 billion at each of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and $2.9 billion at
    December 31, 2006. Amortization of core deposit and other
    intangible assets, after tax effect, totaled $41 million,
    $40 million and $38 million during 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively.

M&T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its
    results on a “net operating” or “tangible”
    basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of
    amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and
    the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other
    intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax
    amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired
    operations into the Company, since such expenses are considered
    by management to be “nonoperating” in nature. Although



“net operating income” as defined by M&T is not a
    GAAP measure, M&T’s management believes that this
    information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition
    activity in reported results.

Net operating income totaled $599 million in 2008, compared
    with $704 million in 2007. Diluted net operating earnings
    per common share in 2008 declined 16% to $5.39 from $6.40 in
    2007. Net operating income and diluted net operating earnings
    per common share were $881 million and $7.73, respectively,
    during 2006.

Reconciliations of net income and diluted earnings per common
    share with net operating income and diluted net operating
    earnings per common share are presented in table 2.

Net operating income expressed as a rate of return on average
    tangible assets was .97% in 2008, compared with 1.27% in 2007
    and 1.67% in 2006. Net operating return on average tangible
    common equity was 19.63% in 2008, compared with 22.58% and
    29.55% in 2007 and 2006, respectively.



Reconciliations of average assets and equity with average
    tangible assets and average tangible common equity are also

Net
    Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities

Net interest income expressed on a taxable-equivalent basis rose
    5% to $1.96 billion in 2008 from $1.87 billion in
    2007, largely the result of growth in average earning assets.
    Those assets totaled $58.0 billion in 2008, up 12% from
    $52.0 billion in 2007. Growth in average loan and lease
    balances outstanding, which rose 11% to $48.8 billion in
    2008 from $44.1 billion in 2007, and average investment
    securities, which increased 23% to $9.0 billion in 2008
    from $7.3 billion in 2007, were the leading factors in that
    improvement. A lower net interest margin, which declined to
    3.38% in 2008 from 3.60% in 2007, partially offset the positive
    impact on taxable-equivalent net interest income resulting from
    growth in average earning assets.

Average loans and leases increased to $48.8 billion in 2008
    from $44.1 billion in 2007. Most of the Company’s
    major loan categories experienced growth during 2008,
    notwithstanding the impact of loans acquired in the late-2007
    acquisition transactions. Average commercial loans and leases
    increased 13% to $13.8 billion in 2008 from
    $12.2 billion in 2007. Commercial real estate loans
    averaged $18.4 billion in 2008, up 17% from
    $15.7 billion in 2007. The Company’s consumer loan
    portfolio averaged $11.2 billion in 2008, 9% higher than
    $10.2 billion in 2007. Average residential real estate
    loans declined 9% to $5.5 billion in 2008 from
    $6.0 billion in 2007, due largely to a $533 million
    decrease in average loans held for sale to $591 million in
    2008 from $1.1 billion in 2007.

Reflecting growth in average earning assets that was partially
    offset by a narrowing of the net interest margin,
    taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 2% to
    $1.87 billion in 2007 from $1.84 billion in 2006.
    Average earning assets rose $2.3 billion or 5% to
    $52.0 billion in 2007 from $49.7 billion in 2006. That
    growth resulted from a $2.7 billion or 7% increase in
    average outstanding balances of loans and leases, offset in part
    by a $717 million or 9% decline in average outstanding
    balances of investment securities. The positive impact of higher
    average earning assets on taxable-equivalent net interest income
    was offset by a narrowing of the Company’s net interest
    margin, which declined to 3.60% in 2007 from 3.70% in 2006.

The Company experienced growth in all major loan categories in
    2007, particularly during the second half of the year. Average
    commercial loans and leases increased 8% to $12.2 billion
    in 2007 from $11.3 billion in 2006. Commercial real estate
    loans averaged $15.7 billion in 2007, up 4% from
    $15.1 billion in 2006, due, in part, to higher average
    balances of construction loans. Average residential real estate
    loans rose 20% in 2007 to $6.0 billion from
    $5.0 billion in 2006. In March 2007, the Company
    transferred $883 million of Alt-A residential real estate
    loans from the Company’s held-for-sale loan portfolio to
    its held-for-investment portfolio. Residential real estate loans
    held for sale averaged $1.1 billion in 2007 and
    $1.5 billion during 2006. Consumer loans and leases
    averaged $10.2 billion in 2007, up 2% from
    $10.0 billion in 2006, due in part to growth in the
    automobile loan portfolio.

Table 4 summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in 2008
    and percentage changes in the major components of the portfolio

Commercial loans and leases, excluding loans secured by real
    estate, aggregated $14.3 billion at December 31, 2008,
    representing 29% of total loans and leases. Table 5 presents
    information on commercial loans and leases as of
    December 31, 2008 relating to geographic area, size,
    borrower industry and whether the loans are secured by
    collateral or unsecured. Of the $14.3 billion of commercial
    loans and leases outstanding at the end of 2008, approximately
    $11.3 billion, or 79%, were secured, while 53%, 23% and 15%
    were granted to businesses in New York State, Pennsylvania and
    the Mid-Atlantic area (which includes Maryland, Delaware,
    Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia),
    respectively. The Company provides financing for leases to
    commercial customers, primarily for equipment. Commercial leases
    included in total commercial loans and leases at
    December 31, 2008 aggregated $1.4 billion, of which
    48% were secured by collateral located in New York State, 16%
    were secured by collateral in the Mid-Atlantic area and another
    11% were secured by collateral in Pennsylvania.

International loans included in commercial loans and leases
    totaled $91 million and $107 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company
    participates in the insurance and guarantee programs of the
    Export-Import Bank of the United States. These programs provide
    U.S. government repayment coverage of 90% to 100% on loans
    supporting foreign borrowers’ purchases of U.S. goods
    and services. The loans generally range from $1 million to
    $10 million. The outstanding balances of loans under these
    programs at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were
    $76 million and $95 million, respectively.

Loans secured by real estate, including outstanding balances of
    home equity loans and lines of credit which the Company
    classifies as consumer loans, represented approximately 60% of
    the loan and lease portfolio during 2008, compared with 61% in
    2007 and 62% in 2006. At December 31, 2008, the Company
    held approximately $18.8 billion of commercial real estate
    loans, $4.9 billion of consumer real estate loans secured
    by one-to-four family residential properties (including
    $352 million of loans held for sale) and $5.7 billion
    of outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of
    credit, compared with $17.4 billion, $6.2 billion and
    $5.5 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2007.
    Loans obtained in the December 2007 acquisition transactions
    included $343 million of commercial real estate loans,
    $1.1 billion of consumer real estate loans secured by
    one-to-four family residential mortgages and $269 million
    of outstanding home equity loans and lines of credit. As already
    noted, approximately $950 million of the $1.1 billion
    of acquired consumer real estate loans were securitized into
    Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities in December 2007. Included
    in total loans and leases were amounts due from builders and
    developers of residential real estate aggregating
    $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

A significant portion of commercial real estate loans originated
    by the Company are secured by properties in the New York City
    metropolitan area, including areas in neighboring states
    generally considered to be within commuting distance of New York
    City, and other areas of New York State where the Company
    operates. Commercial real estate loans are also originated
    through the Company’s offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland,
    Virginia, Washington, D.C., Oregon, West Virginia and other
    states. Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company
    include fixed-rate instruments with monthly payments and a
    balloon payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity,
    in many cases five years after origination. For borrowers in
    good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the
    customer for an additional five years at the then current market
    rate of interest. The Company also originates fixed-rate
    commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater than
    five years, generally having original maturity terms of
    approximately ten years, and adjustable-rate commercial real
    estate loans. Excluding construction and development loans made
    to investors, adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans
    represented approximately 51% of the commercial real estate loan
    portfolio as of December 31, 2008. Table 6 presents
    commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of
    collateral and size of the loans outstanding at
    December 31, 2008. New York City metropolitan area
    commercial real estate loans totaled $6.6 billion at the
    2008 year-end. The $5.7 billion of investor-owned
    commercial real estate loans in the New York City metropolitan
    area were largely secured by multifamily residential properties,
    retail space, and office space. The Company’s experience
    has been that office, retail and service-related properties tend
    to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through
    economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do
    multifamily residential properties. Approximately 54% of the
    aggregate dollar amount of New York City-area loans were for
    loans with outstanding balances of $10 million or less,
    while loans of more than $30 million made up approximately
    22% of the total.

Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located in
    other parts of New York State, Pennsylvania, the Mid-Atlantic
    area and other areas tend to have a greater diversity of
    collateral types and include a significant amount of lending to
    customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or
    business (owner-occupied). Approximately 62% of the aggregate
    dollar amount of commercial real estate loans in New York State
    secured by properties located outside of the metropolitan New
    York City area were for loans with outstanding balances of
    $5 million or less. Of the outstanding balances of



commercial real estate loans in Pennsylvania and the
    Mid-Atlantic area, approximately 68% and 46%, respectively, were
    for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less.

Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located
    outside of Pennsylvania, the Mid-Atlantic area, New York State
    and areas of states neighboring New York considered to be part
    of the New York City metropolitan area, comprised 9% of total
    commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2008.

Commercial real estate construction and development loans made
    to investors presented in table 6 totaled $3.9 billion at
    December 31, 2008, or 8% of total loans and leases.
    Approximately 94% of those construction loans had adjustable
    interest rates. Included in such loans at December 31, 2008
    were $1.7 billion of loans to developers of residential
    real estate properties. Information about the credit performance
    of the Company’s loans to builders and developers of
    residential real estate properties is included herein under the
    heading “Provision For Credit Losses.” The remainder
    of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio was
    comprised of loans made for various purposes, including the
    construction of office buildings, multifamily residential
    housing, retail space and other commercial development.

M&T Realty Capital Corporation, one of the Company’s
    commercial real estate lending subsidiaries, participates in the
    Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing
    (“DUS”) program, pursuant to which commercial real
    estate loans are originated in accordance with terms and
    conditions specified by Fannie Mae and sold. Under this program,
    loans are sold with partial credit recourse to M&T Realty
    Capital Corporation. The amount of recourse is generally limited
    to one-third of any credit loss incurred by the purchaser on an
    individual loan, although in some cases the recourse amount is
    less than one-third of the outstanding principal balance. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $1.2 billion
    and $1.0 billion, respectively, of commercial real estate
    loan balances serviced for others had been sold with recourse.
    There have been no material losses incurred as a result of those
    recourse arrangements. Commercial real estate loans held for
    sale at December 31, 2008 and 2007 aggregated
    $156 million and $79 million, respectively. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, commercial real estate loans
    serviced for other investors by the Company were
    $6.4 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. Those
    serviced loans are not included in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet.

Real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential
    properties were $4.9 billion at December 31, 2008,
    including approximately 35% secured by properties located in New
    York State, 12% secured by properties located in Pennsylvania
    and 18% secured by properties located in the Mid-Atlantic area.
    At December 31, 2008, $352 million of residential real
    estate loans were held for sale, compared with $774 million
    at December 31, 2007. As already discussed, in March 2007
    the Company transferred $883 million of Alt-A loans secured
    by residential real estate properties from its held-for-sale
    portfolio to its held-for-investment loan portfolio. The
    Company’s portfolio of Alt-A loans held for investment at
    December 31, 2008 totaled $974 million, compared with
    $1.2 billion at December 31, 2007. Loans to
    individuals to finance the construction of one-to-four family
    residential properties totaled $233 million at
    December 31, 2008, or approximately .5% of total loans and
    leases, compared with $417 million or 1% at
    December 31, 2007. Information about the credit performance
    of the Company’s Alt-A mortgage loans and other residential
    mortgage loans is included herein under the heading
    “Provision For Credit Losses.”

Consumer loans comprised approximately 23% of the average loan
    portfolio during each of 2008 and 2007, compared with 24% in
    2006. The two largest components of the consumer loan portfolio
    are outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit and
    automobile loans. Average balances of home equity lines of
    credit outstanding represented approximately 9% of average loans
    outstanding in each of 2008 and 2007. Automobile loans
    represented approximately 7% of the Company’s average loan
    portfolio during each of 2008 and 2007. No other consumer loan
    product represented more than 4% of average loans outstanding in
    2008. Approximately 51% of home equity lines of credit
    outstanding at December 31, 2008 were secured by properties
    in New York State, and 21% and 26% were secured by properties in
    Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area, respectively. Average
    outstanding balances on home equity lines of credit were
    approximately $4.5 billion and $4.2 billion in 2008
    and 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2008, 33% and 22%
    of the automobile loan portfolio were to customers residing in
    New York State and Pennsylvania, respectively. Although
    automobile loans have generally been originated through dealers,
    all applications submitted through dealers are subject to the
    Company’s normal



underwriting and loan approval procedures. Outstanding
    automobile loan balances declined to $3.3 billion at
    December 31, 2008 from $3.8 billion at
    December 31, 2007.

Table 7 presents the composition of the Company’s loan and
    lease portfolio at the end of 2008, including outstanding
    balances to businesses and consumers in New York State,
    Pennsylvania, the Mid-Atlantic area and other states.
    Approximately 51% of total loans and leases at December 31,
    2008 were to New York State customers, while 19% and 17% were to
    Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area customers, respectively.

Balances of investment securities averaged $9.0 billion in
    2008, compared with $7.3 billion and $8.0 billion in
    2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase of $1.7 billion
    or 23% from 2007 to 2008 was largely due to the impact of
    residential real estate loan securitizations in June and July of
    2008 and in December 2007 and to the full-year impact of third
    quarter 2007 purchases of approximately $800 million of
    collateralized mortgage obligations and other mortgage-backed
    securities. During June and July 2008, the Company securitized
    approximately $875 million of residential real estate loans
    in guaranteed mortgage securitizations with Fannie Mae. During
    December 2007, approximately $950 million of residential
    real estate loans obtained in the Partners Trust acquisition
    were securitized in a guaranteed mortgage securitization with
    Fannie Mae. The Company recognized no gain or loss on those
    securitization transactions as it retained all of the resulting
    securities, which are held in the available-for-sale investment
    securities portfolio. The decline in average investment
    securities during 2007 as compared with 2006 largely reflects
    net paydowns and maturities of mortgage-backed securities,
    collateralized mortgage obligations and U.S. federal agency
    securities.



The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of
    residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and
    collateralized mortgage obligations, debt securities issued by
    municipalities, debt and preferred equity securities issued by
    government-sponsored agencies and certain financial
    institutions, and shorter-term U.S. Treasury and federal
    agency notes. When purchasing investment securities, the Company
    considers its overall interest-rate risk profile as well as the
    adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed,
    including credit and prepayment risk. In managing the investment
    securities portfolio, the Company occasionally sells investment
    securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads,
    actual or anticipated prepayments, credit risk associated with a
    particular security, or as a result of restructuring its
    investment securities portfolio following completion of a
    business combination.

During the third quarter of 2008, the Company purchased a
    $142 million AAA-rated private placement mortgage-backed
    security that had been securitized by Bayview Financial
    Holdings, L.P. (together with its affiliates, “Bayview
    Financial”). Bayview Financial is a privately-held company
    and is the majority investor of BLG. Upon purchase, the security
    was placed in the Company’s held-to-maturity portfolio, as
    management determined that it had the intent and ability to hold
    the security to maturity. Management subsequently reconsidered
    whether certain other similar mortgage-backed securities
    previously purchased from Bayview Financial and held in the
    Company’s available-for-sale portfolio should more
    appropriately be in the held-to-maturity portfolio. Concluding
    that it had the intent and ability to hold those securities to
    maturity as well, the Company transferred collateralized
    mortgage obligations having a fair value of $298 million
    and a cost basis of $385 million from its
    available-for-sale investment securities portfolio to the
    held-to-maturity portfolio during the third quarter of 2008.

The Company regularly reviews its investment securities for
    declines in value below amortized cost that might be
    characterized as “other than temporary.” As previously
    discussed, during the third quarter of 2008 the Company
    recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge of
    $153 million related to its holdings of preferred stock of
    Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Additional other-than-temporary
    impairment charges of $29 million were recognized in 2008
    on three collateralized mortgage obligations backed by option
    adjustable rate residential mortgages (“ARMs”) that
    had an amortized cost of $20 million and on three
    collateralized debt obligations backed by bank preferred capital
    securities that had an amortized cost of $12 million. The
    collateralized debt obligations were obtained in the Partners
    Trust transaction. As previously discussed, during 2007’s
    fourth quarter, the Company recognized other-than-temporary
    impairment charges of $127 million related to
    $132 million of collateralized debt obligations backed
    largely by residential mortgage-backed securities. As of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company concluded that the
    remaining declines associated with the rest of the investment
    securities portfolio were temporary in nature. That conclusion
    was based on management’s assessment of future cash flows
    associated with individual investment securities as of each
    respective date. A further discussion of fair values of
    investment securities is included herein under the heading
    “Capital.” Additional information about the investment
    securities portfolio is included in note 3 of Notes to
    Financial Statements.

Other earning assets include deposits at banks, trading account
    assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities.
    Those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged
    $198 million in 2008, $503 million in 2007 and
    $183 million in 2006. Reflected in those balances were
    purchases of investment securities under agreements to resell
    which averaged $96 million and $417 million during
    2008 and 2007, respectively, and $50 million in 2006. The
    higher level of resell agreements in 2007 as compared with 2008
    and 2006 was due, in part, to the need to collateralize deposits
    of municipalities. Outstanding resell agreements at
    December 31, 2008 totaled $90 million. The amounts of
    investment securities and other earning assets held by the
    Company are influenced by such factors as demand for loans,
    which generally yield more than investment securities and other
    earning assets, ongoing repayments, the levels of deposits, and
    management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios.

The most significant source of funding for the Company is core
    deposits, which are comprised of noninterest-bearing deposits,
    nonbrokered interest-bearing transaction accounts, nonbrokered
    savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under
    $100,000. The Company’s branch network is its principal
    source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest
    rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities.
    Certificates of deposit under $100,000 generated on a nationwide
    basis by M&T Bank, N.A. are also included in core deposits.
    Core deposits averaged $31.7 billion in 2008, up from



$28.6 billion in 2007 and $28.3 billion in 2006. The
    acquisition transactions in late-2007 added $2.0 billion of
    core deposits on the respective acquisition dates, however, the
    Company’s average core deposits in 2007 only increased
    $156 million from those transactions. The previously
    discussed June 30, 2006 branch acquisition added
    approximately $880 million to average core deposits during
    the second half of 2006, or approximately $443 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006. Average core deposits of
    M&T Bank, N.A. were $274 million in 2008,
    $208 million in 2007 and $387 million in 2006. Funding
    provided by core deposits represented 55% of average earning
    assets in each of 2008 and 2007, and 57% in 2006. Core deposits
    totaled $34.3 billion at December 31, 2008, compared
    with $30.7 billion at December 31, 2007. Table 8
    summarizes average core deposits in 2008 and percentage changes
    in the components of such deposits over the past two years.

Additional sources of funding for the Company include domestic
    time deposits of $100,000 or more, deposits originated through
    the Company’s offshore branch office, and brokered
    deposits. Domestic time deposits over $100,000, excluding
    brokered certificates of deposit, averaged $2.6 billion in
    2008, $2.7 billion in 2007 and $2.9 billion in 2006.
    Offshore branch deposits, primarily comprised of accounts with
    balances of $100,000 or more, averaged $4.0 billion in
    2008, $4.2 billion in 2007 and $3.6 billion in 2006.
    Average brokered time deposits totaled $1.4 billion in
    2008, compared with $2.1 billion in 2007 and
    $3.5 billion in 2006, and at December 31, 2008 and
    2007 totaled $487 million and $1.8 billion,
    respectively. In connection with the Company’s management
    of interest rate risk, interest rate swap agreements have been
    entered into under which the Company receives a fixed rate of
    interest and pays a variable rate and that have notional amounts
    and terms substantially similar to the amounts and terms of
    $70 million of brokered time deposits. The Company also had
    brokered NOW and money-market deposit accounts, which averaged
    $218 million, $87 million and $69 million in
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Offshore branch deposits and
    brokered deposits have been used by the Company as an
    alternative to short-term borrowings. Additional amounts of
    offshore branch deposits or brokered deposits may be solicited
    in the future depending on market conditions, including demand
    by customers and other investors for those deposits, and the
    cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time.

The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers,
    various FHLBs, the Federal Reserve and others as sources of
    funding. The average balance of short-term borrowings was
    $6.1 billion in 2008, $5.4 billion in 2007 and
    $4.5 billion in 2006. Beginning in the second quarter of
    2008, the Company actively sought to increase the average
    maturity of its non-deposit sources of funds and to reduce
    short-term borrowings. Average short-term borrowings for the
    2008 quarters ended June 30, September 30 and December 31
    totaled $6.9 billion, $5.4 billion and
    $5.0 billion, respectively. Included in short-term
    borrowings were unsecured federal funds borrowings, which
    generally mature daily, that averaged $4.5 billion,
    $4.6 billion and $3.7 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Overnight federal funds borrowings represented the
    largest component of average short-term borrowings and were
    obtained from a wide variety of banks and other financial
    institutions. Overnight federal funds borrowings totaled
    $809 million at December 31, 2008 and
    $4.2 billion at December 31, 2007. Also included in
    short-term borrowings in 2008 were secured borrowings with the
    Federal Reserve through their Term Auction



Facility (“TAF”). Borrowings under the TAF averaged
    $238 million during 2008, and totaled $1.0 billion at
    December 31, 2008. Such borrowings had maturities of
    84 days. Also included in average short-term borrowings was
    a $500 million revolving asset-backed structured borrowing
    secured by automobile loans that was paid off during late-2008.
    All of the available amount of that structured borrowing was in
    use at the 2007 and 2006 year-ends. The subsidiary, the
    loans and the borrowings were included in the consolidated
    financial statements of the Company. The average balance of this
    borrowing was $463 million in 2008, $437 million in
    2007 and $500 million in 2006. Additional information about
    that subsidiary, M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC, and the
    revolving borrowing agreement is included in note 19 of
    Notes to Financial Statements. Average short-term borrowings
    during 2008 and 2007 included $682 million and
    $160 million, respectively, of borrowings from the FHLB of
    New York. There were no similar short-term borrowings in 2006.

Long-term borrowings averaged $11.6 billion in 2008,
    $8.4 billion in 2007 and $6.0 billion in 2006.
    Included in average long-term borrowings were amounts borrowed
    from the FHLBs of $6.7 billion in 2008, $4.3 billion
    in 2007 and $3.8 billion in 2006, and subordinated capital
    notes of $1.9 billion in 2008, $1.6 billion in 2007
    and $1.2 billion in 2006. M&T Bank issued
    $400 million and $500 million of subordinated notes in
    December 2007 and 2006, respectively, in part to maintain
    appropriate regulatory capital ratios. The notes issued in
    December 2007 bear a fixed rate of interest of 6.625% and mature
    in December 2017. The 2006 notes bear a fixed rate of interest
    of 5.629% until December 2016 and a floating rate thereafter
    until maturity in December 2021, at a rate equal to the
    three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)
    plus .64%. Beginning December 2016, M&T Bank may, at its
    option and subject to prior regulatory approval, redeem some or
    all of those notes on any interest payment date. The Company has
    utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing
    characteristics of certain components of long-term debt. Those
    swap agreements are used to hedge approximately
    $1.0 billion of fixed rate subordinated notes. Further
    information on interest rate swap agreements is provided in
    note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Junior
    subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred
    securities that were included in average long-term borrowings
    were $1.1 billion, $716 million and $712 million
    in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During January 2008,
    M&T Capital Trust IV issued $350 million of
    Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities bearing a fixed rate of
    interest of 8.50% and maturing in 2068. The related junior
    subordinated debentures are included in long-term borrowings.
    Additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures,
    as well as information regarding contractual maturities of
    long-term borrowings, is provided in note 9 of Notes to
    Financial Statements. Also included in long-term borrowings were
    agreements to repurchase securities, which averaged
    $1.6 billion during 2008 and 2007, and $258 million
    during 2006. The agreements, which were entered into due to
    favorable rates available, have various repurchase dates through
    2017, however, the contractual maturities of the underlying
    securities extend beyond such repurchase dates. Long-term
    borrowings also include $300 million of senior notes issued
    by M&T in May 2007, which averaged $182 million during
    2007. Those notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.375% and
    mature in May 2012.

Changes in the composition of the Company’s earning assets
    and interest-bearing liabilities as described herein, as well as
    changes in interest rates and spreads, can impact net interest
    income. Net interest spread, or the difference between the yield
    on earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing
    liabilities, was 3.01% in each of 2008 and 2007. The yield on
    earning assets during 2008 was 5.69%, 117 basis points
    lower than 6.86% in 2007, while the rate paid on
    interest-bearing liabilities also decreased 117 basis
    points to 2.68% from 3.85% in 2007. The yield on the
    Company’s earning assets rose 15 basis points in 2007
    from 6.71% in 2006, while the rate paid on interest-bearing
    liabilities in 2007 was up 24 basis points from 3.61% in
    2006. As a result, the Company’s net interest spread
    decreased from 3.10% in 2006 to 3.01% in 2007. During 2008, the
    Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark overnight federal funds
    target rate seven times, representing decreases of
    400 basis points for the year, such that, at
    December 31, 2008 the Federal Reserve’s target rate
    for overnight federal funds was expressed as a range from 0% to
    .25%. In the last four months of 2007, the Federal Reserve
    lowered its federal funds target rate three times totaling
    100 basis points. Contributing to the decline in net
    interest spread from 2006 to 2007 was the impact of funding the
    $300 million BLG investment in February 2007 as well as
    higher rates paid on deposits and variable-rate borrowings that
    were only partially offset by higher yields on loans and
    investment securities.



Net interest-free funds consist largely of noninterest-bearing
    demand deposits and stockholders’ equity, partially offset
    by bank owned life insurance and non-earning assets, including
    goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets and, in 2007
    and 2008, M&T’s investment in BLG. Net interest-free
    funds averaged $8.1 billion in 2008, compared with
    $7.9 billion in 2007 and $8.2 billion in 2006.
    Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged
    $3.4 billion in 2008, $3.2 billion in 2007, and
    $3.1 billion in 2006. The cash surrender value of bank
    owned life insurance averaged $1.2 billion in 2008 and
    $1.1 billion in each of 2007 and 2006. Increases in the
    cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not
    included in interest income, but rather are recorded in
    “other revenues from operations.” The contribution of
    net interest-free funds to net interest margin was .37% in 2008,
    .59% in 2007 and .60% in 2006. The decline in the contribution
    to net interest margin ascribed to net interest free funds in
    2008 as compared with 2007 resulted largely from the impact of
    significantly lower interest rates on interest-bearing
    liabilities used to value such contribution. The impact on such
    contribution of slightly higher rates on interest-bearing
    liabilities during 2007 as compared with 2006 was offset by the
    effect of a lower balance of interest-free funds.

Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the
    contribution of interest-free funds as described herein, the
    Company’s net interest margin was 3.38% in 2008, compared
    with 3.60% in 2007 and 3.70% in 2006. Future changes in market
    interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition
    of the Company’s portfolios of earning assets and
    interest-bearing liabilities that result in reductions in
    spreads, could adversely impact the Company’s net interest
    income and net interest margin.

Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in
    interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income
    under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate
    risk, the Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to
    modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its
    portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
    Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are
    generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or the
    rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The notional amount
    of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate
    risk management purposes was $1.1 billion at
    December 31, 2008, all of which were designated as fair
    value hedges of certain fixed rate time deposits and long-term
    borrowings. Under the terms of those swap agreements, the
    Company received payments based on the outstanding notional
    amount of the agreements at fixed rates and made payments at
    variable rates. The notional amount of interest rate swap
    agreements entered into for interest rate risk management
    purposes was $2.3 billion at December 31, 2007, of
    which $842 million were designated as fair value hedges
    whereby the Company received payments at fixed rates and made
    payments at variable rates. Under the terms of the remaining
    $1.5 billion of swap agreements outstanding at the
    2007 year-end and that were designated as cash flow hedges,
    the Company paid a fixed rate of interest and received a
    variable rate. During the first quarter of 2008, those swap
    agreements were terminated by the Company, resulting in the
    realization of a loss of $37 million. That loss is being
    amortized over the original hedge period as an adjustment to
    interest expense associated with the previously hedged long-term
    borrowings.

In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the
    interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of
    the hedged item are recorded in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in
    current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair
    value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items
    represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in “other
    revenues from operations” in the Company’s
    consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, unlike
    in a fair value hedge, the effective portion of the
    derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a
    component of other comprehensive income and subsequently
    reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction
    affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is
    reported in “other revenues from operations”
    immediately. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in
    2008, 2007 and 2006 were not material to the Company’s
    results of operations. The estimated aggregate fair value of
    interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges
    represented gains of approximately $146 million at
    December 31, 2008 and $17 million at December 31,
    2007. The significant rise in fair value of those interest rate
    swap agreements resulted from sharply lower interest rates at
    the 2008 year-end as compared with December 31, 2007.
    The fair values of such swap agreements were substantially
    offset by changes in the fair values of the hedged items. The
    estimated fair values of the interest rate swap agreements
    designated as cash flow hedges were losses of approximately
    $17 million



at December 31, 2007. Net of applicable income taxes, such
    losses were approximately $10 million and were included in
    “accumulated other comprehensive income, net” in the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet. There were no swap
    agreements designated as cash flow hedges at December 31,
    2008 or at December 31, 2006. The changes in the fair
    values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items
    result from the effects of changing interest rates. Additional
    information about those swap agreements and the items being
    hedged is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial
    Statements. The average notional amounts of interest rate swap
    agreements entered into for interest rate risk management
    purposes, the related effect on net interest income and margin,
    and the weighted-average interest rates paid or received on
    those swap agreements are presented in table 9.

Provision
    for Credit Losses

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in
    management’s judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent
    in the loan and lease portfolio. A provision for credit losses
    is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed
    necessary by management. The provision for credit losses was
    $412 million in 2008, up from $192 million in 2007 and
    $80 million in 2006. Net loan charge-offs increased to
    $383 million in 2008 from $114 million and
    $68 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net loan
    charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were
    .78% in 2008, compared with .26% in 2007 and .16% in 2006. The
    significant increases in the provision for credit losses in 2007
    and 2008 reflect a pronounced downturn in the residential real
    estate market that began in early-2007 and continued throughout
    2008, and the deteriorating state of the U.S. economy,
    which was in recession during 2008. Declining real estate
    valuations and higher levels of delinquencies and charge-offs
    throughout 2007 and 2008 significantly affected the quality of
    the Company’s residential real estate loan portfolio.
    Specifically, the Company’s Alt-A residential real estate
    loan portfolio and its residential real estate builder and
    developer loan portfolio experienced the majority of the credit
    problems related to the turmoil in the residential real estate
    marketplace. In response to the deteriorating quality of the
    Alt-A portfolio, the Company decided in 2007’s fourth
    quarter to accelerate the timing related to when residential
    real estate loans are charged off. Beginning in that quarter,
    the Company began charging off the excess of residential real
    estate loan balances over the net realizable value of the
    property collateralizing the loan when such loans become past
    due 150 days, whereas previously the Company provided an
    allowance for credit losses for those amounts and charged off
    those loans upon foreclosure of the underlying property. The
    change in accounting procedure resulted in $15 million of
    additional charge-offs in 2007. A summary of the Company’s
    loan charge-offs, provision and allowance for credit losses is
    presented in table 10.

Nonaccrual loans aggregated $755 million or 1.54% of
    outstanding loans and leases at December 31, 2008, compared
    with $431 million or .90% at December 31, 2007 and
    $209 million or .49% at December 31, 2006. Major
    factors contributing to the rise in nonaccrual loans from the
    2007 year-end to December 31, 2008 were a
    $124 million increase in loans to residential builders and
    developers and a $75 million increase in residential real
    estate loans. The continuing turbulence in the residential real
    estate marketplace has resulted in deteriorating real estate
    values and increased delinquencies, both for loans to consumers
    and loans to builders and developers of residential real estate.
    The rise in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2007 from a
    year earlier was largely due to a $139 million increase in
    residential real estate loans and an $83 million increase
    in loans to residential builders and developers. The increase in
    nonaccrual residential real estate loans was the result of the
    residential real estate market turmoil and its impact on the
    portfolio of Alt-A loans and reflected the change in accounting
    procedure in December 2007 whereby residential real estate
    loans were classified as nonaccrual when principal or interest
    became 90 days delinquent. Previously, residential real
    estate loans had been placed in nonaccrual status when payments
    were 180 days past due. At December 31, 2007 the
    impact of the acceleration of the classification of such loans
    as nonaccrual resulted in an increase in nonaccrual loans of
    $84 million



and a corresponding decrease in loans past due 90 days and
    accruing interest. The higher level of nonaccrual builder and
    developer loans was largely due to deteriorating residential
    real estate values.

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were
    $159 million or .33% of total loans and leases at
    December 31, 2008, compared with $77 million or .16%
    at December 31, 2007 and $111 million or .26% at
    December 31, 2006. Those loans included loans guaranteed by
    government-related entities of $114 million,
    $73 million and $77 million at December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Such guaranteed loans included
    one-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the
    Company that were repurchased to reduce associated servicing
    costs, including a requirement to advance principal and interest
    payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors.
    Despite the loans being purchased by the Company, the insurance
    or guarantee by the applicable government-related entity remains
    in force. The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased
    loans are fully guaranteed by government-related entities and
    totaled $108 million at December 31, 2008,
    $67 million at December 31, 2007 and $65 million
    at December 31, 2006. Loans past due 90 days or more
    and accruing interest that were guaranteed by government-related
    entities also included foreign commercial and industrial loans
    supported by the Export-Import Bank of the United States that
    totaled $5 million at each of December 31, 2008 and
    2007, compared with $11 million at December 31, 2006.

    renegotiated loan data and credit quality ratios is presented in

Predominately residential
    mortgage loans.

During 2008, the Company modified loans secured by residential
    real estate having outstanding balances at December 31,
    2008 of approximately $162 million. The modified loans were
    largely from the Company’s portfolio of Alt-A loans. Of
    that total, $93 million of such loans were included in
    nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2008. After a period of
    demonstrated performance, those loans may begin to accrue
    interest in 2009. The remaining $69 million of modified
    residential real estate loans have demonstrated payment
    capability consistent with the modified terms and were
    classified as renegotiated loans, were current in their payments
    and were accruing interest at the 2008 year-end. Those
    modifications included such actions as the extension of loan
    maturity dates (generally from thirty to forty years) and
    lowering of interest rates and monthly payments. The objective
    of the modifications was to increase



loan repayments by customers and thereby reduce net charge-offs.
    In accordance with GAAP, the modified loans are included in
    impaired loans for purposes of applying Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 114,
    “Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan,” as
    described in notes 1 and 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Factors that influence the Company’s credit loss experience
    include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and
    consumers, in general, and due to the size of the Company’s
    real estate loan portfolios, real estate valuations, in
    particular. Although concerns exist about the factors and
    conditions described herein, through December 31, 2008 the
    increases in nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs have largely
    been centered in the Company’s portfolios of residential
    real estate loans, including first and second lien Alt-A
    mortgage loans, and loans to developers and builders of
    residential real estate. Commercial real estate valuations can
    be highly subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions.
    Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively
    short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic
    conditions, interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of
    operations of businesses and other occupants of the real
    property. Similarly, residential real estate valuations,
    including valuations of residential real estate development or
    construction projects, can be impacted by housing trends, the
    availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, and
    general economic conditions affecting consumers.

Net charge-offs of commercial loans and leases totaled
    $94 million in 2008, $24 million in 2007 and
    $20 million in 2006. The rise in such charge-offs from 2007
    to 2008 was largely due to charge-offs of loans to a consumer
    debt collections company, loans to two customers in the
    publishing business, and three loans to automobile dealers.
    Nonaccrual commercial loans and leases were $114 million at
    December 31, 2008 and $79 million at each of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006. The increase from the
    2007 year-end to December 31, 2008 reflects the net
    addition of relationships with automobile dealers totaling
    $12 million. Reflecting the granularity of the
    Company’s commercial loan and lease portfolio, there were
    only three loans classified as nonaccrual in the portfolio that
    exceeded $5 million. As compared with 2006, the addition of
    a number of smaller credits (less than $5 million) to the
    nonaccrual loan category during 2007 was largely offset by a
    $27 million net decline in nonaccrual loans to automobile
    dealers, predominantly due to payments received. Continued
    slowing of automobile sales over the last three years has
    resulted in a difficult operating environment for certain
    automobile dealers, leading to deteriorating financial results.

Net charge-offs of commercial real estate loans during 2008,
    2007 and 2006 were $112 million, $6 million and
    $1 million, respectively. Reflected in 2008’s
    charge-offs were $100 million of loans to residential real
    estate builders and developers, compared with $4 million in
    2007. Commercial real estate loans classified as nonaccrual
    totaled $319 million at December 31, 2008, compared
    with $118 million at December 31, 2007 and
    $57 million at December 31, 2006. The rise in such
    loans during 2008 was largely the result of an increase of
    $124 million in loans to residential homebuilders and
    developers, reflecting the impact of the deterioration of the
    residential real estate market, including declining real estate
    values. The increase from the end of 2006 to the
    2007 year-end was largely due to the addition of
    $83 million of loans to residential homebuilders and
    developers. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, loans to
    residential homebuilders and developers classified as nonaccrual
    aggregated $209 million and $85 million, respectively.
    Information about the location of nonaccrual and charged-off
    loans to residential real estate builders and developers as of
    and for the year ended December 31, 2008 is presented in
    table 12.

Includes approximately
    $.2 billion of loans either not secured by real estate or
    permanent loans to investors of apartments/multifamily
    properties.

Residential real estate loans charged off, net of recoveries,
    were $63 million in 2008, $19 million in 2007 and
    $4 million in 2006. Nonaccrual residential real estate
    loans at the end of 2008 totaled $256 million, compared
    with $181 million and $42 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Declining real estate values and
    higher levels of delinquencies have contributed to the rise in
    residential real estate loans classified as nonaccrual during
    2007 and 2008 and to the level of charge-offs, largely in the
    Company’s Alt-A portfolio. In addition, as already noted,
    the significant increase in such loans from December 31,
    2006 to the 2007 year-end includes the effect of the change
    in accounting procedure for nonaccrual residential real estate
    loans. Included in residential real estate loan net charge-offs
    and nonaccrual loans were net charge-offs of Alt-A loans in 2008
    of $44 million, while nonaccrual Alt-A loans aggregated
    $125 million at the 2008 year-end. As already noted,
    loans secured by residential real estate having outstanding
    balances of $162 million (including $12 million of
    junior lien home equity loans classified as consumer loans) at
    December 31, 2008, largely comprised of Alt-A loans, were
    modified during 2008 to assist borrowers. Of those loans,
    $93 million were in nonaccrual status at the
    2008 year-end. Net charge-offs of Alt-A loans in 2007 were
    $12 million and nonaccrual Alt-A loans at December 31,
    2007 totaled $90 million. Net charge-offs of Alt-A loans in
    2006 were insignificant and nonaccrual Alt-A loans at
    December 31, 2006 were $19 million. Residential real
    estate loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest
    totaled $108 million, $66 million and $92 million
    at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A
    substantial portion of such amounts related to guaranteed loans
    repurchased from government-related entities. Information about
    the location of nonaccrual and charged-off residential real
    estate loans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008
    is presented in table 13.

Net charge-offs of consumer loans during 2008 were
    $114 million, representing 1.03% of average consumer loans
    and leases outstanding, compared with $65 million or .63%
    in 2007 and $43 million or .43% in 2006. Automobile loans
    represented the most significant category of consumer loan
    charge-offs during the past three years. Net charge-offs of
    automobile loans were $51 million during 2008,
    $28 million during 2007 and $24 million during 2006.
    Consumer loan charge-offs also include recreational vehicle
    loans of $21 million, $11 million and $9 million
    during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and home equity loans
    and lines of credit secured by one-to-four family residential
    properties of $31 million during 2008, $16 million
    during 2007 and $2 million during 2006. The increases in
    charge-offs of home equity loans and lines of credit in 2007 and
    2008 reflect higher Alt-A charge-offs. Nonaccrual consumer loans
    were $66 million at December 31, 2008, representing
    .60% of outstanding consumer loans, compared with
    $53 million or .47% at December 31, 2007, and
    $31 million or .31% at December 31, 2006. The Company
    experienced a decline in delinquencies in the consumer loan
    portfolio during 2008, as compared with the preceding two years.
    At the 2008, 2007 and 2006 year-ends, consumer loans and
    leases delinquent

30-90 days

totaled $118 million, $155 million and
    $122 million, respectively, or 1.07%, 1.38% and 1.23% of
    outstanding consumer loans. Consumer loans past due 90 days
    or more and accruing interest totaled $1 million at each of
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, and
    $3 million at December 31, 2006. Information about the
    location of nonaccrual and charged-off home equity loans and
    lines of credit as of and for the year ended December 31,
    2008 is presented in table 13.

Management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for
    credit losses by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and
    lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing
    economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial
    condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in
    which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the
    value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of
    any guarantees or indemnifications. Management evaluated the
    impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic
    conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment
    obligations when quantifying the Company’s exposure to
    credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the Company’s
    allowance for such losses as of each reporting date. Factors
    also considered by management when performing its assessment, in
    addition to general economic conditions and the other factors
    described above, included, but were not limited to: (i) the
    impact of declining residential real estate values in the
    Company’s portfolio of loans to residential real estate
    builders and developers; (ii) the repayment performance
    associated with the Company’s portfolio of Alt-A
    residential mortgage loans; (iii) the concentration of
    commercial real estate loans in the Company’s loan
    portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured
    by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York
    City metropolitan area, in particular; (iv) the amount of
    commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New
    York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in
    central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less
    economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other
    regions of the country; and (v) the size of the
    Company’s portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which
    historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a
    percentage of loans outstanding than other loan types. The level
    of the allowance is adjusted based on the results of
    management’s analysis.

Management cautiously and conservatively evaluated the allowance
    for credit losses as of December 31, 2008 in light of
    (i) the declining residential real estate values and
    emergence of higher levels of delinquencies of residential real
    estate loans; (ii) the declining pace of economic growth in
    many of the markets served by the Company; (iii) continuing
    weakness in industrial employment in upstate New York and
    central Pennsylvania; (iv) the significant subjectivity
    involved in commercial real estate valuations for properties
    located in areas with stagnant or low growth economies; and
    (v) the amount of loan growth experienced by the Company.
    Throughout 2008, there had been considerable concerns about the
    deepening economic downturn in both national and international
    markets; the level and volatility of energy prices; a weakened
    housing market; the troubled state of financial and credit
    markets; Federal Reserve positioning of monetary policy; rising
    private sector layoffs and unemployment, which caused consumer
    spending to slow; the underlying impact on businesses’
    operations and abilities to repay loans as consumer spending
    slowed; continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New
    York and central Pennsylvania regions; and continued slowing of
    automobile sales. Late in 2008 the U.S economy was identified as
    having been in recession since the fourth quarter of 2007.
    However, given that approximately 70% of the Company’s
    loans are to customers in New York State and Pennsylvania,
    including a large portion to customers in the traditionally
    slower growth or stagnant regions of upstate New York and
    central Pennsylvania, the impact of deteriorating national
    market conditions was not as pronounced on borrowers in these
    regions as compared with other areas of the country. Home prices
    in upstate New York and central Pennsylvania increased in 2008,
    in sharp contrast to steep declines in values in other regions
    of the country. Therefore, despite the conditions, as previously
    described, the most severe credit issues experienced by the
    Company through 2008 were centered around residential real
    estate, including loans to developers and builders of
    residential real estate in areas other than New York State and
    Pennsylvania. In response, throughout 2008 the Company conducted
    detailed reviews of all loans to residential real estate
    builders and developers that exceeded $2.5 million. Those
    credit reviews were updated throughout the year and resulted in
    adjustments to loan grades and, if appropriate, commencement of
    intensified collection efforts, including foreclosure. With
    regard to residential real estate loans, with special emphasis
    on the portfolio of Alt-A mortgage loans, the Company expanded
    its collections and loan work-out staff and further refined its
    loss identification and estimation techniques by reference to
    loan performance and house price depreciation data in specific
    areas of the country where collateral that was securing the
    Company’s residential real estate loans was located.

In ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses,
    the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled
    credits identified through both normal and detailed or
    intensified credit review processes and also estimates losses
    inherent in other loans and leases. In quantifying incurred



losses, the Company considers the factors and uses the
    techniques described herein. For purposes of determining the
    level of the allowance for credit losses, the Company segments
    its loan and lease portfolio by loan type. The amount of
    specific loss components in the Company’s loan and lease
    portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of
    commercial and commercial real estate loans greater than
    $350,000 which are in nonaccrual status. Measurement of the
    specific loss components is typically based on expected future
    cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact
    the borrower’s ability to pay. Impaired loans, as defined
    in SFAS No. 114, are evaluated for specific loss
    components. Except for consumer loans and leases and residential
    real estate loans that are considered smaller balance
    homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively, the Company
    considers a loan to be impaired for purposes of applying
    SFAS No. 114 when, based on current information and
    events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to
    collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the
    loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more.
    Nevertheless, modified loans, including smaller balance
    homogenous loans, that are considered to be troubled debt
    restructurings are evaluated for impairment giving consideration
    to the impact of the modified loan terms on the present value of
    the loan’s cash flows. Loans less than 90 days
    delinquent are deemed to have a minimal delay in payment and are
    generally not considered to be impaired for purposes of applying
    SFAS No. 114.

The inherent base level loss components are generally determined
    by applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan
    type and management’s classification of such loans under
    the Company’s loan grading system. The Company utilizes an
    extensive loan grading system which is applied to all commercial
    and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers are
    responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans
    based on standards outlined in the Company’s Credit Policy.
    Internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the
    Company’s loan review department to ensure consistency and
    strict adherence to the prescribed standards.

Loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component
    computations exclude loans and leases for which specific
    allocations are maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss
    component factors that reflect the Company’s loss estimate
    for each group of loans and leases. Factors considered in
    assigning loan grades and loss component factors include
    borrower-specific information related to expected future cash
    flows and operating results, collateral values, financial
    condition, payment status, and other information; levels of and
    trends in portfolio charge-offs and recoveries; levels of and
    trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans; changes in
    the risk profile of specific portfolios; trends in volume and
    terms of loans; effects of changes in credit concentrations; and
    observed trends and practices in the banking industry.

To better classify inherent losses by specific loan categories,
    beginning in 2006 amounts previously included in the inherent
    unallocated portion of the allowance for such things as
    customer, industry and geographic concentrations as well as for
    certain national and local economic conditions have been
    included in the inherent base level loss component. As a result,
    probable losses resulting from (i) comparatively poorer
    economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in many
    market regions served by the Company, specifically upstate New
    York and central Pennsylvania, that resulted in such regions
    experiencing significantly poorer economic growth and vitality
    as compared with much of the rest of the country;
    (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding loan type,
    collateral type and geographic location, in particular the large
    concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by
    properties in the New York City metropolitan area and other
    areas of New York State; and (iii) additional risk
    associated with the Company’s portfolio of consumer loans,
    in particular automobile loans and leases, which generally have
    higher rates of loss than other types of collateralized loans,
    have been included in the inherent base level loss components at
    the last three year-ends.

In evaluating collateral, the Company relies extensively on
    internally and externally prepared valuations. In 2008,
    valuations of residential real estate, which are usually based
    on sales of comparable properties, declined significantly in
    many regions across the United States. Commercial real estate
    valuations also refer to sales of comparable properties but
    oftentimes are based on calculations that utilize many
    assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective.
    Specifically, commercial real estate values can be significantly
    affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in
    business climate, economic conditions and interest rates, and,
    in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other
    occupants of the real property. Additionally, management is
    aware that there is oftentimes a delay



in the recognition of credit quality changes in loans in
    assigned loan grades due to time delays in the manifestation and
    reporting of underlying events that impact credit quality and,
    accordingly, loss estimates derived from the inherent base level
    loss component computation are adjusted for current national and
    local economic conditions and trends. Economic indicators in the
    most significant market regions served by the Company were mixed
    during 2008, but were indicative of a slowing economy as
    compared with 2007. Private sector employment in the upstate New
    York market declined by 0.4% in 2008, slightly less than the
    national average decline of 0.5%. This was compared with growth
    in 2007 in upstate New York of 0.5%, compared with the national
    average, which grew 1.3%. Employment growth in areas of
    Pennsylvania served by the Company was flat in 2008, while
    growth in the Maryland and Greater Washington D.C. regions
    exceeded the national average. During 2007, job growth in the
    Company’s Pennsylvania markets and in Maryland matched the
    national average, while the Greater Washington D.C. region
    exceeded the national average. Job growth in New York City
    (0.6%) was higher than the national average in 2008 and 2007.
    However, significant layoffs in the financial services sector in
    the final quarter of 2008 are expected to weigh heavily on New
    York City economic growth in 2009. Nevertheless, despite the
    statistical job growth noted, at the end of 2008 there were
    significant concerns about the impact on the national economy
    resulting from the possibility of an extended national economic
    recession, rising unemployment, real estate valuations, high
    levels of consumer indebtedness, weak automobile sales and
    volatile energy prices. Those factors are expected to have a
    significant impact on the national economy in 2009.

The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss
    components together comprise the total base level or
    “allocated” allowance for credit losses. Such
    allocated portion of the allowance represents management’s
    assessment of losses existing in specific larger balance loans
    that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other
    loans that are not individually analyzed. In addition, the
    Company has always provided an inherent unallocated portion of
    the allowance that is intended to recognize probable losses that
    are not otherwise identifiable. The inherent unallocated
    allowance includes management’s subjective determination of
    amounts necessary for such things as: (i) the effect of
    expansion into new markets, including market areas entered
    through acquisitions, for which the Company does not have the
    same degree of familiarity and experience regarding portfolio
    performance in changing market conditions; (ii) the
    introduction of new loan and lease product types, including
    loans and leases to foreign and domestic borrowers obtained
    through acquisitions; (iii) the possible use of imprecise
    estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance;
    and (iv) other additional risks associated with the
    Company’s loan portfolio, which may not be specifically
    allocable.

A comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for
    each of the past five year-ends is presented in table 14.
    Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on
    information available to management at the time of each year-end
    assessment and using the methodology described herein.
    Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category
    as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in
    management’s estimate of specific loss components and
    inherent base level loss components, including the impact of the
    increased delinquencies and nonaccrual loans that are secured by
    residential real estate in 2008 and 2007. As described in
    note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements, loans considered
    impaired pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 114
    were $617 million at December 31, 2008 and
    $225 million at December 31, 2007. The allocated
    portion of the allowance for credit losses related to impaired
    loans totaled $124 million at December 31, 2008 and
    $55 million at December 31, 2007. The unallocated
    portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to .15% and
    .19% of gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The slight decline in the unallocated
    portion reflects management’s continued refinement of its
    loss estimation techniques, which has increased the precision of
    its calculation of the allocated portion of the allowance for
    credit losses. However, given the inherent imprecision in the
    many estimates used in the determination of the allocated
    portion of the allowance, management deliberately remained
    cautious and conservative in establishing the overall allowance
    for credit losses. Given the Company’s high concentration
    of real estate loans and considering the other factors already
    discussed herein, management considers the allocated and
    unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be
    prudent and reasonable. Nevertheless, the Company’s
    allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses
    from any loan or lease category.

Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at
    December 31, 2008 was adequate to absorb credit losses
    inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for
    credit losses was $788 million or 1.61% of total loans and
    leases at December 31, 2008, compared with
    $759 million or 1.58% at December 31, 2007 and
    $650 million or 1.51% at December 31, 2006. The level
    of the allowance reflects management’s evaluation of the
    loan portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors
    as described herein, including the impact of lower residential
    real estate values, largely in areas other than New York State
    and central Pennsylvania, and higher levels of delinquencies and
    charge-offs in the Company’s portfolio of residential real
    estate loans, lower residential real estate valuations related
    to loans to residential builders and developers, and the
    Company’s loan charge-off policies. Should the various
    credit factors considered by management in establishing the
    allowance for credit losses change and should management’s
    assessment of losses inherent in the loan portfolios also
    change, the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans
    could increase or decrease in future periods. The ratio of the
    allowance to nonaccrual loans at the end of 2008, 2007 and 2006
    was 104%, 176% and 311%, respectively. Given the Company’s
    position as a secured lender and its practice of charging off
    loan balances when collection is deemed doubtful, that ratio and
    changes in that ratio are generally not an indicative measure of
    the adequacy of the Company’s allowance for credit losses,
    nor does management rely upon that ratio in assessing the
    adequacy of the allowance. The level of the allowance reflects
    management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as
    of each respective date.

In establishing the allowance for credit losses, management
    follows the methodology described herein, including taking a
    conservative view of borrowers’ abilities to repay loans.
    The establishment of the allowance is extremely subjective and
    requires management to make many judgments about borrower,
    industry, regional and national economic health and performance.
    In order to present examples of the possible impact on the
    allowance from certain changes in credit quality factors, the
    Company assumed the following scenarios for possible
    deterioration of credit quality:

•

For consumer loans and leases considered smaller balance
    homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 20 basis
    point increase in loss factors;

•

For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and
    lines of credit, also considered smaller balance homogenous
    loans and evaluated collectively, a 20% increase in estimated
    inherent losses; and

•

For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, which are
    not similar in nature, a migration of loans to lower-ranked risk
    grades resulting in a 30% increase in the balance of classified
    credits in each risk grade.



For possible improvement in credit quality factors, the
    scenarios assumed were:

•

For consumer loans and leases, a 10 basis point decrease in
    loss factors;

•

For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and
    lines of credit, a 5% decrease in estimated inherent
    losses; and

•

For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, a
    migration of loans to higher-ranked risk grades resulting in a
    5% decrease in the balance of classified credits in each risk
    grade.

The scenario analyses resulted in an additional $89 million
    that could be identifiable under the assumptions for credit
    deterioration, whereas under the assumptions for credit
    improvement a $20 million reduction could occur. These
    examples are only a few of numerous reasonably possible
    scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of
    the allowance for credit losses based on changes in assumptions
    and other factors.

Investor-owned commercial real estate loans secured by retail
    properties in the New York City metropolitan area represented 4%
    of loans outstanding at December 31, 2008. The Company had
    no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry
    that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2008.
    Outstanding loans to foreign borrowers were $91 million at
    December 31, 2008, or .19% of total loans and leases.

Real estate and other foreclosed assets increased to
    $100 million at December 31, 2008 from
    $40 million at December 31, 2007 and $12 million
    at December 31, 2006. The increase from the prior year-ends
    to December 31, 2008 resulted from higher residential real
    estate loan defaults and additions from residential real estate
    development projects. At December 31, 2008, the
    Company’s holding of residential real estate-related
    properties comprised 84% of foreclosed assets.

Other
    Income

Other income increased 1% to $939 million in 2008 from
    $933 million in 2007. Reflected in those amounts were
    losses from bank investment securities in 2008 and 2007 of
    $148 million and $126 million, respectively, due in
    large part to other-than-temporary impairment charges related to
    certain of the Company’s collateralized debt obligations,
    collateralized mortgage obligations and preferred stock holdings
    of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, all held in the
    available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Excluding
    the impact of those securities losses, noninterest income was
    $1.09 billion in 2008, 3% higher than $1.06 billion in
    2007. That rise was largely due to higher mortgage banking
    revenues and fees for providing deposit account, trust,
    brokerage and credit-related services, partially offset by a
    $46 million decline in M&T’s pro-rata share of
    the operating results of BLG and lower trading account and
    foreign exchange gains.

Other income in 2007 was 11% below the $1.05 billion earned
    in 2006. As discussed above, reflected in other income in 2007
    were losses from bank investment securities of
    $126 million, compared with gains of $3 million in
    2006. Excluding the impact of securities gains or losses, other
    income of $1.06 billion in 2007 was 2% higher than
    $1.04 billion in 2006. Higher service charges on deposit
    accounts, trust income, and trading account and foreign exchange
    gains, and $9 million related to M&T’s pro-rata
    portion of the operating results of BLG, were largely offset by
    a $31 million decline in mortgage banking revenues and a
    $13 million gain in 2006 from the accelerated recognition
    of a purchase accounting premium related to the call of a
    $200 million borrowing from the FHLB of Atlanta.

Mortgage banking revenues were $156 million in 2008,
    $112 million in 2007 and $143 million in 2006.
    Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both residential and
    commercial mortgage banking activities. The Company’s
    involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities includes
    the origination, sales and servicing of loans under the
    multifamily mortgage loan programs of Fannie Mae,
    Freddie Mac and the U.S. Department of Housing and
    Urban Development.

Residential mortgage banking revenues, consisting of realized
    gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan
    servicing rights, unrealized gains and losses on residential
    mortgage loans held for sale and related commitments,
    residential mortgage loan servicing fees, and other residential
    mortgage loan-related fees and income, were $117 million in
    2008, $86 million in 2007 and $114 million in 2006.
    The lower revenues in 2007 reflect the previously described
    $18 million of

Alt-A-related

losses in that year’s first quarter and the impact of lower
    gains on residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights



due to slimmer margins realized by the Company resulting from
    changes in market conditions during that year.

Residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other
    investors totaled approximately $4.4 billion in 2008,
    compared with $5.6 billion in 2007 and $6.4 billion in
    2006. Residential mortgage loans sold to investors totaled
    $4.4 billion in 2008, $5.3 billion in 2007 and
    $5.0 billion in 2006. Realized gains from sales of
    residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights and
    recognized net unrealized gains or losses attributable to
    residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to
    originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans totaled
    $31 million in 2008, compared with $3 million in 2007
    and $41 million in 2006. Reflected in the 2008 gains were
    approximately $7 million of revenues related to the
    January 1, 2008 adoption of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
    (“SAB”) No. 109 for written loan commitments
    issued or modified after January 1, 2008. In November 2007,
    the SEC issued SAB No. 109, which reversed previous
    conclusions expressed by the SEC staff regarding written loan
    commitments that are accounted for at fair value through
    earnings. Specifically, the SEC staff now believes that the
    expected net future cash flows related to the associated
    servicing of the loan should be included in the fair value
    measurement of the derivative loan commitment. In accordance
    with SAB No. 105, “Application of Accounting
    Principles to Loan Commitments,” the Company had not
    included such amounts in the value of loan commitments accounted
    for as derivatives in 2007 or 2006. As previously described,
    reflected in the 2007 gains were $18 million of losses
    related to Alt-A residential mortgage loans that were recognized
    during the first quarter of 2007.

Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others
    rose to $81 million in 2008 from $73 million in 2007
    and $66 million in 2006. Included in such servicing
    revenues were amounts related to purchased servicing rights
    associated with small balance commercial mortgage loans totaling
    $29 million, $21 million and $14 million in 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Residential mortgage loans serviced
    for others aggregated $21.3 billion at December 31,
    2008, $19.4 billion a year earlier and $16.7 billion
    at December 31, 2006, including the small balance
    commercial mortgage loans noted above of approximately
    $5.9 billion, $4.9 billion and $3.3 billion at
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Capitalized
    residential mortgage loan servicing assets, net of a valuation
    allowance for possible impairment, totaled $143 million at
    December 31, 2008, compared with $170 million and
    $153 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The valuation allowance for possible impairment of
    capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets totaled
    $22 million, $6 million and $10 million at the
    2008, 2007 and 2006 year-ends, respectively. Included in
    capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets were purchased
    servicing rights associated with the small balance commercial
    mortgage loans noted above of $58 million, $57 million
    and $36 million at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Servicing rights for the small balance commercial
    mortgage loans were purchased from BLG or its affiliates. In
    addition, at December 31, 2008 capitalized servicing rights
    included $28 million of servicing rights for
    $4.6 billion of residential real estate loans that were
    purchased from affiliates of BLG. Additional information about
    the Company’s relationship with BLG and its affiliates is
    provided in note 25 of Notes to Financial Statements.
    Additional information about the Company’s capitalized
    residential mortgage loan servicing assets, including
    information about the calculation of estimated fair value, is
    presented in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Commitments to sell residential mortgage loans and commitments
    to originate residential mortgage loans for sale at
    pre-determined rates were $898 million and
    $871 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008,
    $772 million and $492 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2007 and $1.8 billion and
    $680 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006. Net
    unrealized gains on hedged residential mortgage loans held for
    sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate
    loans for sale were $6 million and $4 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2006, respectively, compared with net
    unrealized losses of $7 million at December 31, 2007.
    Changes in such net unrealized gains and losses are recorded in
    mortgage banking revenues and resulted in net increases in
    revenue of $13 million and $2 million in 2008 and
    2006, respectively, and a net decrease in revenue of
    $23 million (including $12 million to record the Alt-A
    mortgage loans transferred from held for sale to held for
    investment at the lower of cost or market value) in 2007.

Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $39 million in
    2008, $26 million in 2007 and $29 million in 2006.
    Revenues from loan origination and sales activities were
    $27 million in 2008,



compared with $13 million in 2007 and $15 million in
    2006. The increased revenues in 2008 reflect higher loan
    origination volumes. Commercial mortgage loans originated for
    sale to other investors totaled approximately $1.4 billion
    in 2008, compared with $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion
    in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Loan servicing revenues totaled
    $12 million in 2008, $13 million in 2007 and
    $14 million in 2006. Capitalized commercial mortgage loan
    servicing assets aggregated $26 million at
    December 31, 2008, $20 million at December 31,
    2007 and $21 million at December 31, 2006. Commercial
    mortgage loans serviced for other investors totaled
    $6.4 billion, $5.3 billion and $4.9 billion at
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and
    included $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion and
    $939 million, respectively, of loan balances for which
    investors had recourse to the Company if such balances are
    ultimately uncollectible. Commitments to sell commercial
    mortgage loans and commitments to originate commercial mortgage
    loans for sale were $408 million and $252 million,
    respectively, at December 31, 2008, $176 million and
    $97 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007 and
    $115 million and $66 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2006. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale
    totaled $156 million, $79 million and $49 million
    at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Service charges on deposit accounts rose 5% to $431 million
    in 2008 from $409 million in 2007. Deposit account service
    charges in 2006 were $381 million. The higher level of
    service charges on deposit accounts in 2008 as compared with
    2007 was largely due to increases in service charges on
    commercial accounts and consumer debit card fees due to higher
    transaction volumes. The higher level of such revenues in 2007
    as compared with 2006 was largely due to consumer service
    charges related to overdraft fees and higher debit card
    transaction volumes.

Trust income includes fees for trust and custody services
    provided to personal, corporate and institutional customers, and
    investment management and advisory fees that are often based on
    a percentage of the market value of assets under management.
    Trust income rose 2% to $156 million in 2008 from
    $153 million in 2007, due in part to the impact of higher
    balances in proprietary money- market mutual funds. Trust income
    totaled $141 million in 2006. Higher balances in
    proprietary

money-market

mutual funds and higher revenues from providing personal trust
    and investment management services contributed to the rise in
    revenues from 2006 to 2007. Total trust assets, which include
    assets under management and assets under administration,
    aggregated $111.0 billion at December 31, 2008,
    compared with $146.1 billion at December 31, 2007. The
    decrease in total trust assets was due, in part, to declines in
    the market values of such assets. Trust assets under management
    were $12.8 billion and $15.5 billion at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    Company’s proprietary mutual funds, the MTB Group of Funds,
    had assets of $11.5 billion and $10.5 billion at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale
    of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees,
    aggregated $64 million in 2008 and $60 million in each
    of 2007 and 2006. The improvement from 2007 to 2008 was due
    largely to increased revenues earned from the sale of annuities.
    Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains
    of $18 million in 2008, $30 million in 2007 and
    $25 million in 2006. The decline from 2007 to 2008 resulted
    from declines in the market values of trading assets held in
    connection with deferred compensation plans. The improvement in
    2007 as compared with 2006 reflected higher income related to
    interest rate swap agreements due to higher volumes of
    transactions executed on behalf of commercial customers. The
    Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange contracts
    with customers who need such services and concomitantly enters
    into offsetting trading positions with third parties to minimize
    the risks involved with these types of transactions. Information
    about the notional amount of interest rate, foreign exchange and
    other contracts entered into by the Company for trading account
    purposes is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial
    Statements and herein under the heading “Liquidity, Market
    Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity.” Trading account
    revenues related to interest rate and foreign exchange contracts
    totaled $21 million in each of 2008 and 2007, and
    $15 million in 2006. Trading account assets held in
    connection with deferred compensation plans were
    $33 million and $47 million at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively. Trading account losses resulting from
    net declines in the market values of such assets were
    $12 million in 2008, compared with revenues of
    $4 million in 2007 and $5 million in 2006. A largely
    offsetting impact on expenses resulting from corresponding
    increases or decreases in liabilities related to deferred
    compensation is included in “other costs of
    operations.”



As previously described, other-than-temporary impairment charges
    of $182 million were recognized in 2008, largely in light
    of significant turbulence in the financial markets, including
    the residential real estate market, and the resulting declines
    in fair value of the Company’s preferred stock of Fannie
    Mae and Freddie Mac and certain privately issued mortgage-backed
    securities held in the available-for-sale investment securities
    portfolio. Partially offsetting the 2008 impairment charges was
    a gain of $33 million related to the mandatory redemption
    of common shares of Visa during the first quarter of that year.
    Reflecting those events, losses on investment securities were
    $148 million in 2008, compared with losses of
    $126 million in 2007 and gains of $3 million during
    2006. The losses in 2007 reflect the previously described
    $127 million charge for the other-than-temporary impairment
    in value of collateralized debt obligations held in the
    Company’s available-for-sale investment securities
    portfolio. Those collateralized debt obligations were backed by
    residential mortgage-backed securities. Each reporting period
    the Company reviews its impaired investment securities for
    other-than-temporary impairment. For equity securities, such as
    the Company’s investment in the preferred stock of Fannie
    Mae and Freddie Mac, the Company considers various factors to
    determine if the decline in value is other than temporary,
    including the duration and extent of the decline in value, the
    factors contributing to the decline in fair value, including the
    financial condition of the issuer as well as the conditions of
    the industry in which it operates, and the prospects for a
    recovery in fair value of the equity security. For debt
    securities, the Company analyzes the creditworthiness of the
    issuer or reviews the credit performance of the underlying loan
    collateral supporting the bond. For debt securities backed by
    pools of loans, such as privately issued mortgage-backed
    securities, the Company attempts to estimate the cash flows of
    the underlying loan collateral using forward-looking assumptions
    of default rates, loss severities and prepayment speeds.
    Estimated collateral cash flows are then utilized to estimate
    bond-specific cash flows to determine the ultimate
    collectibility of the bond. If it is deemed probable that the
    Company will not collect the contractual cash flows of a bond or
    if the Company no longer has the ability or intent to hold a
    bond until it fully recovers in value, an other-than-temporary
    impairment loss is recognized. If an other-than-temporary
    impairment loss is deemed to have occurred, the investment
    security’s cost basis is adjusted to its fair value with
    the loss being recognized in the consolidated statement of
    income.

M&T’s pro-rata share of the operating loss of BLG in
    2008 was $37 million, compared with a gain of
    $9 million in 2007. The operating loss of BLG in 2008
    resulted from the disruptions in the commercial mortgage-backed
    securities market and reflected lower gains from loan
    securitization and sales activities, lower values ascribed to
    loans held for sale, and costs associated with severance and
    certain lease terminations incurred by BLG as it downsized its
    operations. Despite the credit and liquidity disruptions that
    began in 2007, BLG had been successfully securitizing and
    selling significant volumes of small-balance commercial real
    estate loans until the first quarter of 2008. In response to the
    illiquidity in the marketplace, BLG reduced its originations
    activities, scaled back its workforce and made use of its
    contingent liquidity sources. The Company believes that
    significant fluctuations are expected as part of the business
    cycle of any mortgage origination and securitization business.
    In addition to BLG’s mortgage origination and sales
    activities, BLG also is entitled to cash flows from mortgage
    assets that it owns or that are owned by its affiliates and from
    asset management and other services provided by its affiliates.
    Accordingly, the Company believes that BLG is capable of
    realizing positive cash flows that could be available for
    distribution to its owners, including M&T, despite a lack
    of positive GAAP-earnings. Nevertheless, if BLG is not able to
    realize sufficient cash flows for the benefit of M&T, the
    Company may be required to recognize an other-than-temporary
    impairment charge in a future period for some portion of the
    $271 million book value of its investment in BLG.
    Information about the Company’s relationship with BLG and
    its affiliates is included in note 25 of Notes to Financial
    Statements.

Other revenues from operations were $300 million in 2008,
    compared with $286 million in 2007 and $293 million in
    2006. The primary contributor to the 5% improvement from 2007 to
    2008 was a $16 million increase in letter of credit and
    other credit-related fees. The decline in other revenues from
    operations from 2006 to 2007 resulted from a $6 million
    decrease in income from bank owned life insurance and the
    previously noted $13 million gain in 2006 from the call of
    an FHLB borrowing, partially offset by an $8 million
    increase in credit-related and corporate advisory fees in 2007.

Included in other revenues from operations were the following
    significant components. Letter of credit and other
    credit-related fees totaled $97 million, $81 million
    and $77 million in 2008, 2007 and



2006, respectively. The rise in such fees from 2007 to 2008 was
    due predominately to higher income from providing loan
    syndication and letter of credit services. Tax-exempt income
    earned from bank owned life insurance aggregated
    $49 million in 2008, $47 million in 2007 and
    $53 million in 2006. Such income includes increases in cash
    surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits
    received. Revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees
    were $40 million in 2008, $35 million in 2007 and
    $32 million in 2006. Insurance-related sales commissions
    and other revenues totaled $31 million in 2008,
    $33 million in 2007 and $32 million in 2006. Automated
    teller machine usage fees aggregated $17 million in 2008
    and $15 million in each of 2007 and 2006.

Other
    Expense

Other expense aggregated $1.73 billion in 2008, compared
    with $1.63 billion in 2007 and $1.55 billion in 2006.
    Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be
    “nonoperating” in nature consisting of amortization of
    core deposit and other intangible assets of $67 million,
    $66 million and $63 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, and merger-related expenses of $4 million in
    2008, $15 million in 2007 and $5 million in 2006.
    Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating
    expenses were $1.66 billion in 2008, up 7% from
    $1.55 billion in 2007. The higher level of operating
    expenses in 2008 as compared with 2007 was due largely to
    increased expenses for salaries, occupancy, professional
    services, advertising and promotion, and foreclosed residential
    real estate properties. Also contributing to the rise in
    operating expenses was an addition to the valuation allowance
    for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of
    $16 million in 2008, as compared with a partial reversal of
    the allowance of $4 million in 2007. Partially offsetting
    those factors was a $23 million charge taken in the fourth
    quarter of 2007 related to M&T Bank’s obligation as a
    member bank of Visa to share in losses stemming from certain
    litigation against Visa, compared with a partial reversal of
    that charge in 2008’s initial quarter of $15 million.
    Noninterest operating expenses were $1.48 billion in 2006.
    The rise in operating expenses from 2006 to 2007 reflects the
    $23 million charge taken in the fourth quarter related to
    the Visa litigation, partially offset by an $18 million
    contribution to The M&T Charitable Foundation in 2006. The
    most significant contributor to the remaining increase in
    noninterest expense in 2007 was a higher level of salaries and
    employee benefits expense. Table 2 provides a reconciliation of
    other expense to noninterest operating expense.

Salaries and employee benefits expense totaled $957 million
    in 2008, up 5% from $908 million in 2007. The most
    significant contributors to the increase were the impact of
    annual merit increases, higher incentive compensation and the
    fourth quarter 2007 acquisition transactions. Salaries and
    employee benefits expense was $873 million in 2006. The
    higher expense level for 2007 as compared with 2006 was due
    largely to salaries-related costs, including the impact of merit
    pay increases and higher incentive compensation. Stock-based
    compensation totaled $50 million in 2008, and
    $51 million in each of 2007 and 2006. The number of
    full-time equivalent employees was 12,978 at December 31,
    2008, compared with 13,246 and 12,721 at December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively.

The Company provides pension and other postretirement benefits
    (including a retirement savings plan) for its employees.
    Expenses related to such benefits totaled $52 million in
    2008, and $54 million in each of 2007 and 2006. The Company
    sponsors both defined benefit and defined contribution pension
    plans. Pension benefit expense for those plans was
    $23 million in 2008, $27 million in 2007 and
    $28 million in 2006. Included in those amounts are
    $10 million in 2008, $8 million in 2007 and
    $7 million in 2006 for a defined contribution pension plan
    that the Company began on January 1, 2006. The
    determination of pension expense and the recognition of net
    pension assets and liabilities for defined benefit pension plans
    requires management to make various assumptions that can
    significantly impact the actuarial calculations related thereto.
    Those assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return
    on plan assets, the rate of increase in future compensation
    levels and the discount rate. Changes in any of those
    assumptions will impact the Company’s pension expense. The
    expected long-term rate of return assumption is determined by
    taking into consideration asset allocations, historical returns
    on the types of assets held and current economic factors.
    Returns on invested assets are periodically compared with target
    market indices for each asset type to aid management in
    evaluating such returns. The discount rate used by the Company
    to determine the present value of the Company’s future
    benefit obligations reflects specific market yields for a
    hypothetical portfolio of highly rated corporate bonds that



would produce cash flows similar to the Company’s benefit
    plan obligations and the level of market interest rates in
    general as of the year-end. Other factors used to estimate the
    projected benefit obligations include actuarial assumptions for
    mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate and disability
    rate. Those other factors do not tend to change significantly
    over time. The Company reviews its pension plan assumptions
    annually to ensure that such assumptions are reasonable and
    adjusts those assumptions, as necessary, to reflect changes in
    future expectations. The Company utilizes actuaries and others
    to aid in that assessment.

The Company’s 2008 pension expense for its defined benefit
    plans was determined using the following assumptions: a
    long-term rate of return on assets of 7.50%; a rate of future
    compensation increase of 4.60%; and a discount rate of 6.00%. To
    demonstrate the sensitivity of pension expense to changes in the
    Company’s pension plan assumptions, 25 basis point
    increases in: the rate of return on plan assets would have
    resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $2 million;
    the rate of increase in compensation would have resulted in an
    increase in pension expense of $.3 million; and the
    discount rate would have resulted in a decrease in pension
    expense of $3 million. Decreases of 25 basis points in
    those assumptions would have resulted in similar changes in
    amount, but in the opposite direction from the changes presented
    in the preceding sentence. The accounting guidance for defined
    benefit pension plans reflects the long-term nature of benefit
    obligations and the investment horizon of plan assets, and has
    the effect of reducing expense volatility related to short-term
    changes in interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains
    and losses include the impact of plan amendments, in addition to
    various gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions
    and investment returns which are different from that which is
    assumed. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had
    cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of approximately
    $334 million that could result in an increase in the
    Company’s future pension expense depending on several
    factors, including whether such losses at each measurement date
    exceed ten percent of the greater of the projected benefit
    obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. In
    accordance with GAAP, net unrecognized gains or losses that
    exceed that threshold are required to be amortized over the
    expected service period of active employees, and are included as
    a component of net pension cost. Amortization of these net
    unrealized losses had the effect of increasing the
    Company’s pension expense by approximately $4 million
    in 2008, $6 million in 2007 and $8 million in 2006.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans,” which requires an employer to
    recognize in its balance sheet as an asset or liability the
    overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit
    postretirement plan, measured as the difference between the fair
    value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. For a pension
    plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit
    obligation; for any other postretirement benefit plan, such as a
    retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the
    accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.
    SFAS No. 158 requires that gains or losses and prior
    service costs or credits that arise during the period, but are
    not included as components of net periodic benefit cost, be
    recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. The
    Company adopted SFAS No. 158 in 2006. As of
    December 31, 2008, the combined benefit obligations of the
    Company’s defined benefit postretirement plans exceeded the
    fair value of the assets of such plans by approximately
    $263 million. Of that amount, $152 million was related
    to qualified defined benefit plans that are periodically funded
    by the Company and $111 million related to non-qualified
    pension and other postretirement plans that are generally not
    funded until benefits are paid. Pursuant to the criteria of
    SFAS No. 158, the Company was required to have a net
    pension and postretirement benefit liability for those plans
    that was at least equal to $263 million at
    December 31, 2008. Accordingly, as of December 31,
    2008 the Company recorded an additional postretirement benefit
    liability of $286 million. After applicable tax effect,
    that liability reduced accumulated other comprehensive income
    (and thereby stockholders’ equity) by $174 million.
    The result of this was a year-over-year increase of
    $210 million to the required minimum postretirement benefit
    liability from the $76 million recorded at
    December 31, 2007. After applicable tax effect, the
    $210 million increase in the minimum required liability
    reduced accumulated other comprehensive income in 2008 by an
    additional $128 million from the prior year-end amount of
    $46 million. The $210 million increase to the
    liability was necessary to reflect losses that occurred during
    2008 resulting from actual experience differing from assumptions
    and from changes in actuarial assumptions. The main factor
    contributing to those losses was the poor performance of the



qualified defined benefit plan assets, reflecting the overall
    significant decline in global financial markets. In determining
    the benefit obligation for defined benefit postretirement plans
    the Company used a discount rate of 6% at December 31, 2008
    and 2007. A 25 basis point decrease in the assumed discount
    rate as of December 31, 2008 to 5.75% would have resulted
    in increases in the combined benefit obligations of all defined
    benefit postretirement plans (including pension and other plans)
    of $28 million. Under that scenario, the minimum
    postretirement liability adjustment at December 31, 2008
    would have been $314 million, rather than the
    $286 million that was actually recorded, and the
    corresponding after tax-effect charge to accumulated other
    comprehensive income at December 31, 2008 would have been
    $191 million, rather than the $174 million that was
    actually recorded. A 25 basis point increase in the assumed
    discount rate to 6.25% would have decreased the combined benefit
    obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans by
    $27 million. Under this latter scenario, the aggregate
    minimum liability adjustment at December 31, 2008 would
    have been $259 million rather than the $286 million
    actually recorded and the corresponding after tax-effect charge
    to accumulated other comprehensive income would have been
    $158 million rather than $174 million. The Company
    made contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension
    plans in 2008 and 2007 of $140 million and
    $66 million, respectively. Information about the
    Company’s pension plans, including significant assumptions
    utilized in completing actuarial calculations for the plans, is
    included in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company also provides a retirement savings plan
    (“RSP”) that is a defined contribution plan in which
    eligible employees of the Company may defer up to 50% of
    qualified compensation via contributions to the plan. The
    Company makes an employer matching contribution in an amount
    equal to 75% of an employee’s contribution, up to 4.5% of
    the employee’s qualified compensation. RSP expense totaled
    $23 million in 2008, $22 million in 2007 and
    $21 million in 2006.

Expenses associated with the defined benefit and defined
    contribution pension plans and the RSP totaled $47 million
    in 2008 and $49 million in each of 2007 and 2006. Expense
    associated with providing medical and other postretirement
    benefits was $5 million in each of 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Excluding the nonoperating expense items already noted,
    nonpersonnel operating expenses totaled $700 million in
    2008, up 9% from $639 million in 2007. Contributing to that
    rise were increases in costs for occupancy, professional
    services, advertising and promotion, contributions to The
    M&T Charitable Foundation, and foreclosed residential real
    estate properties. Also contributing to the higher level of
    operating expenses was an addition to the valuation allowance
    for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of
    $16 million in 2008, as compared with a partial reversal of
    the allowance of $4 million in 2007. Partially offsetting
    those factors was the $23 million charge taken in the
    fourth quarter of 2007 related to M&T Bank’s
    obligation as a member bank of Visa to share in losses stemming
    from certain litigation against Visa, compared with a partial
    reversal of that charge in 2008’s initial quarter of
    $15 million. Nonpersonnel operating expenses were
    $611 million in 2006. The principal factors for the
    increase from 2006 to 2007 were the $23 million charge
    taken in 2007 related to the Visa litigation, the impact of net
    partial reversals of the valuation allowance for impairment of
    capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, which totaled
    $4 million in 2007 and $10 million in 2006, and higher
    costs related to the merchant and credit card business and
    foreclosed residential real estate properties, offset, in part,
    by an $18 million contribution to The M&T Charitable
    Foundation in 2006. That foundation did not need incremental
    funding in 2007.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $184 million in 2008,
    compared with $309 million in 2007 and $392 million in
    2006. The effective tax rates were 24.9%, 32.1% and 31.9% in
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The significant decline in
    the Company’s effective tax rate from 2007 to 2008 reflects
    the resolution in 2008 of previously uncertain tax positions
    related to the Company’s activities in various
    jurisdictions during the years

1999-2007

that allowed the Company to reduce its accrual for income taxes
    in the third quarter of 2008 by $40 million. Exclusive of
    the impact of the $40 million credit to income taxes, the
    effective tax rate in 2008 was 30.3%.

The effective tax rate is impacted by the level of income earned
    that is exempt from tax relative to the overall level of pre-tax
    income and by the level of income allocated to the various state
    and local jurisdictions where the Company operates, because tax
    rates differ among those jurisdictions. Although



the other-than-temporary impairment charges during 2008 and 2007
    are fully deductible for purposes of computing income tax
    expense, those charges had an impact on the effective tax rate
    because they significantly lowered pre-tax income relative to
    the amounts of tax-exempt income and other permanent differences
    that impact the effective tax rate. Excluding the impact of the
    (i) other-than-temporary impairment charges from pre-tax
    income and income tax expense in 2008 and 2007 and (ii) the
    $40 million credit to income tax expense in 2008 resulting
    from the resolution of previously unrecognized tax benefits, the
    Company’s effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 would have
    been 32.0% and 32.9%, respectively.

The Company’s effective tax rate in future periods will
    also be affected by the results of operations allocated to the
    various tax jurisdictions within which the Company operates, any
    change in income tax regulations within those jurisdictions, or
    interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the
    Company’s interpretations by any of various tax authorities
    that may examine tax returns filed by M&T or any of its
    subsidiaries. Information about amounts accrued for uncertain
    tax positions and a reconciliation of income tax expense to the
    amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax
    rate to pre-tax income is provided in note 13 of Notes to
    Financial Statements.

International
    Activities

The Company’s net investment in international assets
    totaled $99 million at December 31, 2008 and
    $120 million at December 31, 2007. Such assets
    included $91 million and $107 million, respectively,
    of loans to foreign borrowers. Offshore deposits totaled
    $4.0 billion at December 31, 2008 and
    $5.9 billion at December 31, 2007. The Company uses
    such deposits to facilitate customer demand and as an
    alternative to short-term borrowings when the costs of such
    deposits seem reasonable.

Liquidity,
    Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity

As a financial intermediary, the Company is exposed to various
    risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to
    the Company’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow
    and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future
    financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit
    withdrawals, funding operating costs, and other corporate
    purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of
    financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.

Core deposits have historically been the most significant
    funding source for the Company, and are generated from a large
    base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. That
    customer base has, over the past several years, become more
    geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion
    of the Company’s businesses. Nevertheless, in recent years
    the Company has faced increased competition in offering products
    and services from a large array of financial market
    participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities
    dealers and others. Core deposits financed 60% of the
    Company’s earning assets at December 31, 2008,
    compared with 54% and 57% at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits
    with various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings,
    including federal funds purchased and securities sold under
    agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit,
    offshore branch deposits and borrowings from the FHLBs and
    others. At December 31, 2008, M&T Bank had short-term
    and long-term credit facilities with the FHLBs aggregating
    $8.8 billion. Outstanding borrowings under these credit
    facilities totaled $8.0 billion and $6.5 billion at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Such borrowings
    are secured by loans and investment securities. M&T Bank
    and M&T Bank, N.A. had available lines of credit with the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York that totaled approximately
    $7.4 billion at December 31, 2008. The amounts of
    those lines are dependent upon the balances of loans and
    securities pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2008,
    secured short-term borrowings from the Federal Reserve totaled
    $1.0 billion. Those borrowings were bid for by the Company
    through the Federal Reserve’s TAF program and had
    maturities of 84 days. There were no borrowings outstanding
    under these lines of credit at December 31, 2007.

As a source of funding and to enhance regulatory capital ratios,
    during January 2008, M&T Capital Trust IV issued
    $350 million of Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities
    bearing a fixed rate of interest of 8.50% and maturing in 2068.
    The related junior subordinated debentures are included in
    long-term borrowings. Such securities qualify for inclusion in
    the Company’s Tier I Capital as defined by Federal



Regulators. As an additional source of funding, M&T issued
    $300 million of senior notes in May 2007. Those notes bear
    a fixed rate of interest of 5.375% and are due on May 24,
    2012.

The Company has issued subordinated capital notes from time to
    time to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios.
    Such notes qualify for inclusion in the Company’s total
    capital as defined by federal regulators. M&T Bank issued
    $400 million of subordinated notes in December 2007. The
    notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 6.625% and mature in
    December 2017. In December 2006, M&T Bank issued
    $500 million of subordinated notes, which bear a fixed rate
    of interest of 5.629% for ten years and a floating rate
    thereafter, at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus .64%. The
    notes are redeemable at the Company’s option after the
    fixed-rate period ends, subject to prior regulatory approval.
    Additional information about the Company’s borrowings is
    included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company has informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of
    funding available through various arrangements for unsecured
    short-term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other
    financial institutions. Short-term federal funds borrowings were
    $809 million and $4.2 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. In general, those borrowings were
    unsecured and matured on the next business day. As already
    noted, offshore branch deposits and brokered certificates of
    deposit have been used by the Company as an alternative to
    short-term borrowings. Offshore branch deposits also generally
    mature on the next business day and totaled $4.0 billion
    and $5.9 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Outstanding brokered time deposits at
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 were
    $487 million and $1.8 billion, respectively. At
    December 31, 2008, the weighted-average remaining term to
    maturity of brokered time deposits was 14 months. Certain
    of these brokered deposits have provisions that allow for early
    redemption. Information regarding such deposits is included
    under the heading “Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding
    Activities.”

The Company’s ability to obtain funding from these or other
    sources could be negatively affected should the Company
    experience a substantial deterioration in its financial
    condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of
    short-term funding become restricted due to a disruption in the
    financial markets. The Company attempts to quantify such
    credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the
    liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade
    over various grading levels. Such impact is estimated by
    attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of
    credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and
    securitizable assets. Information about the credit ratings of
    M&T and M&T Bank is presented in table 15. Additional
    information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the
    Company’s short-term and long-term borrowings is provided
    in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to
    deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include
    maturities of investment securities and other earning assets,
    repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash
    generated from operations, such as fees collected for services.

Certain customers of the Company obtain financing through the
    issuance of variable rate demand bonds (“VRDBs”). The
    VRDBs are generally enhanced by direct-pay letters of credit
    provided by M&T



Bank. M&T Bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the
    VRDBs and, at its discretion, may from time-to-time own some of
    the VRDBs while such instruments are remarketed. When this
    occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading assets in the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Nevertheless,
    M&T Bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the
    VRDBs. The value of VRDBs in the Company’s trading account
    totaled $29 million and $63 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the VRDBs outstanding backed by
    M&T Bank letters of credit totaled $1.9 billion and
    $1.7 billion, respectively. M&T Bank also serves as
    remarketing agent for most of those bonds.

The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal
    course of business which require future cash payments. The
    contractual amounts and timing of those payments as of
    December 31, 2008 are summarized in table 17. Off-balance
    sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity, including
    commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit,
    commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and
    indemnification contracts, and commitments to sell real estate
    loans. Because many of these commitments or contracts expire
    without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts
    are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further
    discussion of these commitments is provided in note 21 of
    Notes to Financial Statements. Table 17 summarizes the
    Company’s other commitments as of December 31, 2008
    and the timing of the expiration of such commitments.

M&T’s primary source of funds to pay for operating
    expenses, shareholder dividends and common stock repurchases has
    historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking
    subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory
    limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T
    are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary
    in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of
    the test, approximately $832 million at December 31,
    2008 was available for payment of dividends to M&T from
    banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval. These
    historic sources of cash flow have been augmented in the past by
    the issuance of trust preferred securities, including
    $350 million of Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities
    issued by M&T Capital Trust IV in January 2008, and in
    the second quarter of 2007 by the issuance of $300 million
    of senior notes payable. Information regarding trust preferred
    securities, the related junior subordinated debentures and the
    senior notes is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial
    Statements. M&T also maintains a $30 million line of
    credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank, of which there were
    no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2008. A similar
    $30 million line of credit was entirely available for
    borrowing at December 31, 2007.

Management closely monitors the Company’s liquidity
    position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal
    policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are
    adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the normal course
    of business. Management does not anticipate engaging in any
    activities, either currently or in the long-term, for which
    adequate funding would not be available and would therefore
    result in a significant strain on liquidity at either M&T
    or its subsidiary banks.

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the
    market prices

and/or

interest rates of the Company’s financial instruments. The
    primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate
    risk. Interest rate risk arises from the Company’s core
    banking activities of lending and deposit-taking, because assets
    and liabilities reprice at different times and by different
    amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest
    income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of
    changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk
    by calculating the variability of net interest income in future
    periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected
    balances for earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and
    derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Management’s
    philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the
    variability of net interest income. The balances of financial
    instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth
    from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments
    of loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of
    investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a
    “value of equity” model to supplement the modeling
    technique described above. Those supplemental analyses are based
    on discounted cash flows associated with on- and off-balance
    sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to
    reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a
    long-term interest rate risk metric. The Company has entered
    into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to
    interest rate risk. At December 31, 2008, the aggregate
    notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into
    for interest rate risk management purposes was
    $1.1 billion. Information about interest rate swap
    agreements entered into for interest rate risk management
    purposes is included herein under the heading “Net Interest
    Income/Lending and Funding Activities” and in note 18
    of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company’s Risk Management Committee, which includes
    members of senior management, monitors the sensitivity of the
    Company’s net interest income to changes in interest rates
    with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest
    income under different interest rate scenarios. In modeling
    changing interest rates, the Company considers different yield
    curve shapes that consider both parallel (that is, simultaneous
    changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve) and
    non-parallel (that is, allowing interest rates at points on the
    yield curve to vary by different amounts) shifts in the yield
    curve. In utilizing the model, market implied forward interest
    rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to
    determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest
    income simulation. That calculated base net interest income is
    then compared to the income calculated under the varying
    interest rate scenarios. The model considers the impact of
    ongoing lending and deposit-gathering activities, as well as
    interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing
    of financial instruments, including the effect of changing
    interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When
    deemed prudent, management has taken actions to mitigate
    exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on- or
    off-balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in
    the future. Possible actions include, but are



not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit
    products, modifying the composition of earning assets and
    interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or
    terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other
    financial instruments used for interest rate risk management
    purposes.

Table 20 displays as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 the
    estimated impact on net interest income from non-trading
    financial instruments in the base scenario described above
    resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across
    repricing categories during the first modeling year.

The Company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact
    that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income.
    The more significant of those assumptions included the rate of
    prepayments of mortgage-related assets, cash flows from
    derivative and other financial instruments held for non-trading
    purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit
    maturities. In the scenarios presented, the Company also assumed
    gradual changes in rates during a twelve-month period of 100 and
    200 basis points, as compared with the assumed base
    scenario. In the event that a 100 or 200 basis point rate
    change cannot be achieved, the applicable rate changes are
    limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates cannot be
    less than zero. The assumptions used in interest rate
    sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and, as a result,
    the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in
    interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ
    significantly from those presented due to the timing, magnitude
    and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market
    conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between
    maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as
    those previously described, which management may take to counter
    such changes. In light of the uncertainties and assumptions
    associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table
    are not considered significant to the Company’s past or
    projected net interest income.

In accordance with industry practice, table 21 presents
    cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a
    contractual basis within the specified time frames, as adjusted
    for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for
    interest rate risk management purposes. Management believes that
    this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk
    since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all
    categories of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities
    equally nor, as assumed in the table, on the contractual
    maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this static
    presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect
    of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected
    changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest
    rate risk management activities the Company is likely to
    implement.

Changes in fair value of the Company’s financial
    instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for
    similar instruments in the financial markets. That impact is
    most notable on the values assigned to the Company’s
    investment securities. Information about the fair valuation of
    such securities is presented herein under the heading
    “Capital” and in note 3 of Notes to Financial
    Statements.

The Company engages in trading activities to meet the financial
    needs of customers, to fund the Company’s obligations under
    certain deferred compensation plans and, to a limited extent, to
    profit from perceived market opportunities. Financial
    instruments utilized in trading activities consist predominantly
    of interest rate contracts, such as swap agreements, and forward
    and futures contracts related to foreign currencies, but have
    also included forward and futures contracts related to
    mortgage-backed securities and investments in U.S. Treasury
    and other government securities, mortgage-backed securities and
    mutual funds and, as previously described, a limited number of
    VRDBs. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and
    interest rate risk associated with trading activities by
    entering into offsetting trading positions. The amounts of gross
    and net trading positions, as well as the type of trading
    activities conducted by the Company, are subject to a
    well-defined series of potential loss exposure limits
    established by management and approved by M&T’s Board
    of Directors. However, as with any non-government guaranteed
    financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk
    associated with counterparties to the Company’s trading
    activities.

The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for
    trading purposes aggregated $14.6 billion at
    December 31, 2008 and $11.7 billion at
    December 31, 2007. The notional amounts of foreign currency
    and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading
    purposes totaled $713 million and $801 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Although the
    notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in
    the consolidated balance sheet, the fair values of all financial
    instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the
    consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of trading account
    assets and liabilities were $618 million and
    $521 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008 and
    $281 million and $143 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2007. The significant rise in the fair value
    of both trading assets and trading liabilities was largely due
    to the impact



of sharp declines in interest rates in late 2008 on the fair
    values of interest rate swap agreements held in the trading
    portfolio. Included in trading account assets at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $33 million and
    $47 million, respectively, of assets related to deferred
    compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of such assets are
    recorded as “trading account and foreign exchange
    gains” in the consolidated statement of income. Included in
    “other liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheet
    at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $38 million and
    $50 million, respectively, of liabilities related to
    deferred compensation plans. Changes in the balances of such
    liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment options
    to which the liabilities are indexed are recorded in “other
    costs of operations” in the consolidated statement of
    income.

Given the Company’s policies, limits and positions,
    management believes that the potential loss exposure to the
    Company resulting from market risk associated with trading
    activities was not material, however, as previously noted, the
    Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties
    to transactions associated with the Company’s trading
    activities. Additional information related to trading derivative
    contracts is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial
    Statements.

Capital

Total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2008 was
    $6.8 billion and represented 10.31% of total assets,
    compared with $6.5 billion or 10.00% at December 31,
    2007 and $6.3 billion or 11.01% at December 31, 2006.
    Contributing to the growth of stockholders’ equity from the
    2007 year-end to December 31, 2008 was the
    December 23, 2008 issuance of $600 million of
    Series A Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase M&T
    common stock as part of the U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase
    Program. The holder of the preferred stock is entitled to
    cumulative cash dividends of 5% per annum until
    February 14, 2014 and 9% per annum thereafter, payable
    quarterly in arrears. The Series A Preferred Stock is
    redeemable on or after February 15, 2012, subject to
    regulatory approval. The preferred stock may be redeemed prior
    to February 15, 2012 if M&T received aggregated gross
    proceeds of not less than 25% of the aggregate liquidation
    amount of the Series A Preferred Stock from a qualified
    equity offering by M&T. Additional information related to
    M&T’s Series A Preferred Stock and the related
    warrants to purchase common stock is included in note 10 of
    Notes to Financial Statements.

Common stockholders’ equity was $6.2 billion, or
    $56.29 per share, at December 31, 2008, compared with
    $6.5 billion, or $58.99 per share, at December 31,
    2007 and $6.3 billion, or $56.94 per share, at
    December 31, 2006. Tangible equity per common share was
    $25.94 at December 31, 2008, compared with $27.98 and
    $28.57 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In the
    calculation of tangible equity per common share, common
    stockholders’ equity is reduced by the carrying values of
    goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of
    applicable deferred tax balances. A reconciliation of total
    common stockholders’ equity and tangible common equity as
    of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is presented in table
    2. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the ratio of average total
    stockholders’ equity to average total assets was 9.88%,
    10.67% and 10.82%, respectively. The ratio of average common
    stockholders’ equity to average total assets was 9.86%,
    10.67% and 10.82% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Stockholders’ equity reflects accumulated other
    comprehensive income or loss, which includes the net after-tax
    impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities
    classified as available for sale, gains or losses associated
    with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow
    hedges, and adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined
    benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Net unrealized
    losses on available-for-sale investment securities were
    $557 million, or $5.04 per common share, at
    December 31, 2008, compared with losses of
    $59 million, or $.54 per common share, at December 31,
    2007, and $25 million, or $.23 per share, at
    December 31, 2006. Such unrealized losses represent the
    difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the
    estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities
    classified as available for sale and the remaining unamortized
    losses on investment securities that have been transferred from
    available for sale to held to maturity. The increase in net
    unrealized losses resulted primarily from pre-tax net unrealized
    losses of $786 million on $3.2 billion of privately
    issued mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2008. The
    Company’s privately issued mortgage-backed securities
    classified as available for sale are generally collateralized by
    prime and

Alt-A

residential mortgage loans as depicted in table 22. Information
    in the table is as of



December 31, 2008. As with any accounting estimate or other
    data, changes in fair values and investment ratings may occur at
    any time.

All information is as of
    December 31, 2008.

Due to the severe disruption in the credit markets during the
    second half of 2008, trading activity for privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities was significantly reduced. In
    estimating values for such securities, the Company was
    significantly restricted in the level of market observable
    assumptions used in the valuation of its privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Because of the inactivity
    and the lack of observable valuation inputs, the Company
    transferred $2.2 billion of its privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities portfolio from Level 2 to
    Level 3 valuations in the third quarter of 2008. The
    remaining portion of its portfolio of privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities had already been classified as
    Level 3. To supplement its determination of fair value for
    its privately issued mortgage-backed securities, the Company
    engaged a second independent pricing source at December 31,
    2008. Additionally, to help assess the reasonableness of
    valuations received from the independent pricing sources, the
    Company performed internal modeling techniques to estimate the
    expected cash flows that may result from many of its privately
    issued mortgage-backed securities. In general, the Company
    averaged the results obtained from the independent sources when
    valuing the Level 3 privately issued mortgage-backed
    securities for financial statement purposes. During 2008 the
    Company recognized $182 million (pre-tax) of
    other-than-temporary impairment losses, $18 million of
    which related to $20 million of its privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities. Despite rising levels of
    delinquencies and losses in the underlying residential mortgage
    collateral, the Company believes that as of December 31,
    2008 it was not probable that there was insufficient
    subordination within the structures of its remaining privately
    issued mortgage-backed securities to absorb expected losses and
    has therefore concluded that such securities were not
    other-than-temporarily impaired as of that date. Nevertheless,
    given recent market conditions, it is possible that adverse
    changes in repayment performance and fair value could occur in
    2009 and later years that could impact the Company’s
    conclusions. Management has modeled various stress scenarios to
    the above portfolio and has concluded that even if home price
    depreciation and current delinquency trends persist for an
    extended period of time, the Company’s principal losses, if
    any, on its privately issued mortgage-backed securities would be
    substantially less than their current fair valuation losses.

As previously noted, given the Company’s relationship with
    Bayview Financial and related entities, during the third quarter
    of 2008, the Company reconsidered its intention to hold certain
    collateralized mortgage obligations securitized by Bayview
    Financial with a cost basis of $385 million and a fair
    value



of $298 million and transferred such securities from its
    available-for-sale investment securities portfolio to its
    held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio. As a result,
    at December 31, 2008, the Company had in its
    held-to-maturity portfolio collateralized mortgage obligations
    securitized by Bayview Financial with an amortized cost basis of
    $412 million (excluding $82 million of unamortized
    fair value adjustment (pre-tax) residing in accumulated other
    comprehensive income from the time of transfer) and a fair value
    of $319 million. At December 31, 2008, the amortized
    cost and fair value of collateralized mortgage obligations
    securitized by Bayview Financial in the Company’s
    available-for-sale investment securities portfolio were
    $40 million and $32 million, respectively, and at
    December 31, 2007 were $480 million and
    $450 million, respectively. The Company has determined that
    it expects to fully collect its contractual principal and
    interest payments on the private collateralized mortgage
    obligations securitized by Bayview Financial and therefore
    believes such securities were not other-than-temporarily
    impaired at December 31, 2008.

At December 31, 2008, the Company also had pre-tax
    unrealized losses of $90 million on $241 million of
    trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions and
    securities backed by trust preferred securities issued by
    financial institutions ($13 million of such unrealized
    losses were on $16 million of securities using a
    Level 3 valuation, with the remainder classified as
    Level 2 valuations). Pre-tax unrealized losses of
    $9 million existed on $192 million of such securities
    at December 31, 2007. After evaluating the expected
    repayment performance of financial institutions where trust
    preferred securities were held directly by the Company or were
    within the collateralized debt obligations backed by trust
    preferred securities obtained in the Partners Trust acquisition,
    the Company, during 2008, recognized an $11 million
    (pre-tax) other-than-temporary impairment loss on
    $12 million of the securities obtained in the Partners
    Trust acquisition.

Following the U.S. Government’s placement of Fannie
    Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship on September 7,
    2008, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment
    charge of $153 million (pre-tax) on its preferred stock
    holdings of those government-sponsored entities. At
    December 31, 2008, the Company’s investment in Fannie
    Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock had a remaining cost basis
    of $9 million and a fair value of $2 million. The
    Company recognized a $127 million (pre-tax)
    other-than-temporary impairment charge in 2007 resulting from
    the decline in fair value of certain collateralized debt
    obligations backed by sub-prime mortgage securities held in the
    available-for-sale investment securities portfolio based on its
    evaluation at the time that it was probable that the Company
    would not receive all payments owed to it under the terms and
    structure of the securities.

As of December 31, 2008, based on a review of each of the
    remaining securities in the investment securities portfolio, the
    Company concluded that it was not probable that it would be
    unable to realize the cost basis investment and appropriate
    interest payments on such securities. Accordingly, the Company
    concluded that the declines in the values of those securities
    were temporary and that any additional other-than-temporary
    impairment charges were not appropriate at December 31,
    2008. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had the ability
    and intent to hold each of the impaired securities, that is
    where fair value is less than the cost basis of the security, to
    recovery. The Company intends to closely monitor the performance
    of the privately issued mortgage-backed securities and other
    securities to assess if changes in their underlying credit
    performance or other events cause the cost basis of those
    securities to become other-than-temporarily impaired. However,
    because the unrealized losses described have generally already
    been reflected in the financial statement values for investment
    securities and stockholders’ equity, any recognition of an
    other-than-temporary decline in value of these investment
    securities would not have a material effect on the
    Company’s consolidated financial condition. Additional
    information concerning fair value measurements and the
    Company’s approach to the classification of such
    measurements is included in note 20 of the Notes to
    Financial Statements.

Also reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income were
    net losses of $6 million, or $.05 per common share,
    representing the remaining unrealized losses related to the
    termination of interest rate swap agreements that had been
    designated as cash flow hedges. Included in this amount were
    unamortized losses of $7 million related to swap agreements
    terminated by the Company in response to changes in its interest
    rate risk profile during the first quarter of 2008 that had been
    originally entered into as a cash flow hedge of variable rate
    long-term borrowings, and $1 million of unamortized gains
    related to terminated swap agreements that had been entered into
    as a cash flow hedge in anticipation of the



Company issuing senior notes payable in the second quarter of
    2007. In addition, net unrealized fair value losses associated
    with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow
    hedges were $10 million at December 31, 2007,
    representing approximately $.09 per common share. There were no
    outstanding interest rate swap agreements designated as cash
    flow hedges at December 31, 2008 or at December 31,
    2006.

Adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit
    pension and other postretirement plans as required under
    SFAS No. 158, net of applicable tax effect, reduced
    accumulated other comprehensive income by $174 million, or
    $1.58 per common share, at December 31, 2008,
    $46 million, or $.42 per common share, at December 31,
    2007, and $28 million, or $.26 per common share, at
    December 31, 2006. The increase in such adjustment in 2008
    was predominately the result of actual investment performance of
    assets held by the Company’s qualified pension plan being
    significantly worse than that assumed for actuarial purposes.
    Information about the funded status of the Company’s
    pension and other postretirement benefit plans is included in
    note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Cash dividends paid in 2008 on M&T’s common stock
    totaled $309 million, compared with $282 million and
    $250 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. M&T
    increased the quarterly dividend on its common stock in the
    second quarter of 2006 from $.45 to $.60 per share, and to $.70
    per share in the third quarter of 2007. Dividends per common
    share totaled $2.80 in 2008, $2.60 in 2007 and $2.25 in 2006.

M&T repurchased 4,514,800 shares of its common stock
    in 2007 and 3,259,000 shares in 2006 at a cost of
    $509 million and $374 million, respectively. There
    were no common stock repurchases by M&T in 2008. In
    November 2005, M&T had announced a plan to purchase up to
    5,000,000 shares of its common stock. That repurchase plan
    was completed in March 2007. In February 2007, M&T
    announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors
    to purchase up to an additional 5,000,000 shares of its
    common stock. Through December 31, 2008, M&T had
    repurchased a total of 2,818,500 shares of common stock
    pursuant to such plan at an average cost of $108.30 per share.

Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to
    maintain “core capital” and “total capital”
    ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk-adjusted
    total assets. In addition to the risk-based measures, Federal
    bank regulators have also implemented a minimum
    “leverage” ratio guideline of 3% of the quarterly
    average of total assets. As of December 31, 2008, core
    capital included $1.1 billion of the trust preferred
    securities described in note 9 of Notes to Financial
    Statements and $600 million of Series A Preferred
    Stock and warrants to purchase M&T’s common stock
    issued to the U.S. Treasury. Total capital further included
    $1.6 billion of subordinated notes. As previously noted, in
    January 2008, M&T Capital Trust IV issued
    $350 million of Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities
    that pay a fixed rate of interest of 8.50%, and in December 2007
    M&T Bank issued $400 million of 6.625% fixed rate
    subordinated notes due 2017. The capital ratios of the Company
    and its banking subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and
    2007 are presented in note 23 of Notes to Financial
    Statements.

The Company continues to generate amounts of regulatory capital
    in excess of dividends paid. The rate of regulatory core capital
    generation, or net operating income (as previously defined) less
    the sum of dividends paid and the after-tax effect of
    merger-related expenses expressed as a percentage of regulatory
    “core capital” at the beginning of each year, was
    7.51% in 2008, 10.73% in 2007 and 17.52% in 2006.

Fourth
    Quarter Results

Net income totaled $102 million during the fourth quarter
    of 2008, up 57% from $65 million in the year-earlier
    quarter. Diluted and basic earnings per common share were each
    $.92 in the final quarter of 2008, 53% higher than $.60 in the
    fourth quarter of 2007. The annualized rates of return on
    average assets and average common stockholders’ equity for
    the fourth quarter of 2008 were .63% and 6.41%, respectively,
    compared with .42% and 4.05%, respectively, in the year-earlier
    period.

Net operating income totaled $112 million in the fourth
    quarter of 2008, compared with $84 million in the
    year-earlier quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common
    share were $1.00 in the recent quarter, compared with $.77 in
    the final quarter of 2007. The annualized net operating returns
    on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity in
    the last quarter of 2008 were .72% and 15.01%, respectively,
    compared with .57% and 10.49%, respectively, in the similar 2007
    quarter. Core



deposit and other intangible asset amortization, after tax
    effect, totaled $10 million in each of the fourth quarters
    of 2008 and 2007 ($.08 per diluted common share and $.09 per
    diluted common share, respectively). The after-tax impact of
    merger-related expenses associated with the Partners Trust and
    First Horizon acquisition transactions was $9 million
    ($15 million pre-tax) or $.08 of diluted earnings per
    common share in the final 2007 quarter. There were no similar
    expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008. Reconciliations of GAAP
    results with non-GAAP results for the quarterly periods of 2008
    and 2007 are provided in table 24.

The Company’s financial results for the recent quarter were
    damped by three main factors. Based on a detailed review of its
    investment securities portfolio, other-than-temporary impairment
    charges of $24 million (pre-tax) were recorded by the
    Company on certain collateralized debt obligations and
    collateralized mortgage obligations. Also recorded in the fourth
    quarter was a $19 million (pre-tax) addition to the
    valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage
    servicing rights. That addition resulted from lower mortgage
    interest rates at the 2008 year-end as compared with
    September 30, 2008. Those two items reduced the
    Company’s fourth quarter 2008 net income and diluted
    earnings per common share by $26 million and $.24,
    respectively. Also negatively impacting fourth quarter 2008
    results was a significantly higher provision for credit losses,
    which rose 50% to $151 million from $101 million in
    the year-earlier quarter. The Company’s fourth quarter 2007
    results were also adversely impacted by several notable items,
    including the $127 million other-than-temporary impairment
    charge related to collateralized debt obligations, the
    $23 million accrual related to Covered Litigation of Visa,
    and $15 million of merger-related expenses associated with
    acquisitions completed in that quarter.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose 3% to
    $491 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 from
    $476 million in the year-earlier quarter. That growth was
    the result of a 6% rise in average earning assets that was
    partially offset by a narrowing of the Company’s net
    interest margin. Average earning assets totaled
    $57.9 billion in the last quarter of 2008, compared with
    $54.8 billion in the year-earlier period. Average loans and
    leases for the recently completed quarter totaled
    $48.8 billion, up 6% from $46.1 billion during the
    fourth quarter of 2007. Increases of $1.7 billion in
    commercial loans and leases, $2.2 billion in commercial
    real estate loans and $310 million in consumer loans were
    partially offset by a $1.4 billion decline in average
    residential real estate loans. The yield on earning assets was
    5.35% in the fourth quarter of 2008, down 130 basis points
    from 6.65% in the year-earlier quarter. The rate paid on
    interest-bearing liabilities was 2.32% in the final quarter of
    2008, 143 basis points lower than 3.75% in the fourth
    quarter of 2007. The resulting net interest spread was 3.03% in
    the recent quarter, up 13 basis points from 2.90% in the
    similar quarter of 2007. That improvement was largely due to
    market volatility in the fourth quarter resulting in divergence
    in the spread between the Federal Funds rate and LIBOR, wherein
    rates paid by M&T on certain short-term borrowings and
    foreign office deposits declined more than rates paid by
    M&T customers on certain variable-rate loans. The
    contribution of net interest-free funds to the Company’s
    net interest margin was .34% in the last 2008 quarter, down from
    .55% in the year-earlier quarter. That decline reflects the
    impact of lower interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities
    used to value such contribution. As a result, the Company’s
    net interest margin narrowed to 3.37% in the recent quarter from
    3.45% in the fourth quarter of 2007.

The provision for credit losses rose to $151 million during
    the three-month period ended December 31, 2008 from
    $101 million in the year-earlier period. The higher level
    of the provision reflects changes in the loan portfolio, the
    impact of declining residential real estate valuations and
    higher delinquencies and charge-offs of residential real estate
    loans, declining real estate values related to residential real
    estate builder and developer loan collateral, and the impact of
    the recession being experienced by the U.S. economy. Net
    charge-offs of loans were $144 million in 2008’s final
    three months, representing an annualized 1.17% of average loans
    and leases outstanding, compared with $53 million or .46%
    during the final quarter of 2007. Net charge-offs included:
    residential real estate loans of $19 million in the recent
    quarter, compared with $10 million a year earlier when the
    Company’s charge-off procedure was changed; loans to
    builders and developers of residential properties of
    $26 million, up from $4 million a year earlier; other
    commercial real estate loans of $3 million, compared with
    $1 million in 2007’s final quarter; commercial loans
    of $61 million, up from $9 million in 2007; and
    consumer loans of $35 million, compared with
    $29 million in the prior year fourth quarter.



Other income totaled $241 million in the recent quarter, up
    50% from $160 million in the year-earlier quarter. That
    improvement resulted from the $127 million
    other-than-temporary impairment charge in 2007’s fourth
    quarter related to collateralized debt obligations held in the
    Company’s available-for-sale investment securities
    portfolio, compared with $24 million of
    other-than-temporary impairment charges in the final quarter of
    2008. Excluding those charges, other income was
    $265 million, down 8% from $288 million in the
    year-earlier quarter. That decline was due to a decrease of
    $23 million related to M&T’s pro-rata portion of
    the operating results of BLG. In addition, higher mortgage
    banking and brokerage services revenues in the recent quarter
    were offset by lower trust income and trading account and
    foreign exchange gains.

Other expense in the fourth quarter of 2008 totaled
    $447 million, compared with $445 million in the
    year-earlier quarter. Included in such amounts are expenses
    considered to be “nonoperating” in nature consisting
    of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of
    $16 million in each of the final quarters of 2008 and 2007,
    and merger-related expenses of $15 million in the fourth
    quarter of 2007. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses,
    noninterest operating expenses were $431 million in the
    recently completed quarter, up 4% from $415 million in the
    last quarter of 2007. Higher costs for salaries and occupancy,
    and a higher addition of $17 million to the valuation
    allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights
    were the leading contributors to that rise in operating
    expenses, partially offset by the fourth quarter 2007 Visa
    litigation charge of $23 million. The Company’s
    efficiency ratio during the fourth quarter of 2008 and 2007 was
    57.0% and 54.3%, respectively. Table 24 includes a
    reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense
    for each of the quarters of 2008 and 2007.

Segment
    Information

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131,
    “Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
    Information,” the Company’s reportable segments have
    been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting
    system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain
    strategic business units have been combined for segment
    information reporting purposes where the nature of the products
    and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of
    those products and services are similar. The reportable segments
    are Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real
    Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking,
    and Retail Banking.

The financial information of the Company’s segments was
    compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in
    note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management
    accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment
    financial information are highly subjective and, unlike
    financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance
    similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the
    financial information of the reported segments are not
    necessarily comparable with similar information reported by
    other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management
    structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result
    in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial
    information about the Company’s segments is presented in
    note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Business Banking segment provides a wide range of services
    to small businesses and professionals through the Company’s
    branch network, business banking centers and other delivery
    channels such as telephone banking, Internet banking and
    automated teller machines within markets served by the Company.
    Services and products offered by this segment include various
    business loans and leases, including loans guaranteed by the
    Small Business Administration, business credit cards, deposit
    products, and financial services such as cash management,
    payroll and direct deposit, merchant credit card and letters of
    credit. The Business Banking segment’s net income for 2008
    was $120 million, down 10% from $133 million earned in
    2007. That decline was mainly due to a $15 million increase
    in the provision for credit losses, the result of higher net
    loan charge-offs, and higher noninterest expenses of
    $12 million, reflecting higher personnel costs. Partially
    offsetting those unfavorable factors was a $5 million
    increase in fees earned for providing deposit account services.
    This segment’s net income totaled $128 million in
    2006. The rise in net income in 2007 as compared with 2006 was
    largely the result of a $15 million increase in net
    interest income, attributable to a 38 basis point widening
    of the deposit net interest margin, and higher deposit account
    service fees of $3 million. Those factors were partially
    offset by $4 million increases in each of personnel costs
    and the provision for credit losses.



The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit
    products and banking services for middle-market and large
    commercial customers, mainly within the markets served by the
    Company. Services provided by this segment include commercial
    lending and leasing, letters of credit, deposit products, and
    cash management services. For the year ended December 31,
    2008, the Commercial Banking segment contributed net income of
    $213 million, compared with $217 million in 2007.
    Factors contributing to the slight decline in net income
    included a $65 million increase in the provision for credit
    losses, due to higher net charge-offs of loans, and higher
    noninterest expenses of $22 million, largely the result of
    increased personnel costs. Those increased costs were offset, in
    part, by a $51 million rise in net interest income,
    primarily the result of a $2.0 billion increase in average
    loan balances outstanding, and a $28 million increase in
    noninterest income resulting from higher fees of
    $14 million for providing credit-related services, a
    $9 million increase in deposit service fees, and a
    $3 million increase in income from providing credit card
    and merchant-related services. This segment recorded net income
    of $214 million in 2006. The improvement in 2007 as
    compared with 2006 was due to higher net interest income of
    $9 million, attributable to a $875 million increase in
    average loan balances outstanding, offset, in part, by a
    33 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin, and
    increased fee income received for providing corporate advisory
    and loan syndication services of $5 million and
    $2 million, respectively. Largely offsetting those
    favorable factors were a $6 million rise in the provision
    for credit losses, mainly attributable to loan growth, and
    higher personnel costs of $5 million.

The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit
    services to its customers. Real estate securing loans in this
    segment is generally located in the New York City metropolitan
    area, upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of
    Columbia, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and the
    northwestern portion of the United States. Commercial real
    estate loans may be secured by apartment/multifamily buildings;
    office, retail and industrial space; or other types of
    collateral. Activities of this segment also include the
    origination, sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans
    through the Fannie Mae DUS program and other programs. The
    Commercial Real Estate segment recorded net income of
    $164 million in 2008, up 11% from $148 million in
    2007. That improvement resulted primarily from a
    $31 million increase in net interest income, largely due to
    a $1.8 billion increase in average loan balances
    outstanding and higher average deposit balances of
    $189 million, and a $13 million increase in commercial
    mortgage banking revenues. Those positive factors were offset,
    in part, by an $11 million increase in the provision for
    credit losses, mainly due to higher net charge-offs of loans,
    and an increase in personnel costs of $10 million, due
    largely to higher incentive compensation related to increased
    volumes of commercial real estate loans. Net income in 2006 for
    the Commercial Real Estate segment aggregated $147 million.
    As compared with 2006, a rise in net interest income in 2007 of
    $8 million was largely offset by a higher provision for
    credit losses of $5 million and a $2 million increase
    in personnel costs. The higher net interest income resulted from
    a $504 million increase in average loan balances
    outstanding, net of a 10 basis point narrowing of the net
    interest margin associated with such balances.

The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and
    trading securities, residential mortgage loans, and other
    assets; short-term and long-term borrowed funds; brokered
    certificates of deposit and interest rate swap agreements
    related thereto; and offshore branch deposits. This segment also
    provides foreign exchange services to customers. Included in the
    assets of the Discretionary Portfolio segment are the investment
    securities for which the Company has recognized
    other-than-temporary impairment charges in each of the last two
    years and the portfolio of Alt-A mortgage loans that were
    transferred to this segment in 2007. Prior to that transfer,
    such loans were included in the Residential Mortgage Banking
    segment. The Discretionary Portfolio segment incurred net losses
    of $48 million and $7 million in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Contributing to the higher net loss in 2008 as
    compared with 2007 were net losses on investment securities
    totaling $181 million in 2008, compared with
    $126 million in 2007. Included in those losses were
    other-than-temporary impairment charges of $182 million in
    2008 and $127 million in 2007. The 2008 impairment charges
    include $153 million on the preferred stock issuances of
    Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, $18 million on certain private
    collateralized mortgage obligations and $11 million on
    collateralized debt obligations backed by bank trust preferred
    securities. The $127 million impairment charge recorded in
    2007 related to collateralized debt obligations backed by
    sub-prime residential mortgage securities. The following factors
    also contributed to the higher net loss



recorded in 2008: a $41 million increase in the provision
    for credit losses, resulting largely from higher net charge-offs
    of Alt-A loans; higher foreclosure-related costs of
    $13 million; a $6 million increase in the valuation
    allowance for capitalized mortgage servicing rights; and a
    $4 million increase in costs incurred for professional
    services. Partially offsetting those unfavorable factors was a
    $55 million rise in net interest income, primarily the
    result of a 21 basis point widening of the net interest
    margin on investment securities, and a 23% increase in the
    average balances of investment securities, reflecting purchases
    of residential mortgage-backed securities during the first
    quarter of 2008, the full-year impact of third quarter 2007
    purchases of approximately $800 million of collateralized
    mortgage obligations and other mortgage-backed securities, and
    the impact of the late-2007 and 2008 securitization
    transactions. Net income for this segment totaled
    $96 million in 2006. The main factors resulting in the
    unfavorable performance in 2007 as compared with 2006 was the
    previously mentioned $127 million other-than-temporary
    impairment charge related to collateralized debt obligations, a
    $26 million increase in the provision for credit losses,
    primarily resulting from increased loan balances and higher net
    charge-offs of Alt-A mortgage loans, and a $13 million gain
    recognized in 2006 resulting from the accelerated recognition of
    a purchase accounting premium related to the call of an FHLB
    borrowing assumed in a previous acquisition.

The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services
    residential mortgage loans and sells substantially all of those
    loans in the secondary market to investors or to the
    Discretionary Portfolio segment. This segment also originates
    and services loans to developers of residential real estate
    properties. In addition to the geographic regions served by or
    contiguous with the Company’s branch network, the Company
    maintains mortgage loan origination offices in several states
    throughout the western United States. The Company also
    periodically purchases the rights to service mortgage loans.
    Residential mortgage loans held for sale are included in this
    segment. As already noted, in the first quarter of 2007,
    $883 million of Alt-A mortgage loans previously included in
    this segment’s held-for-sale portfolio were transferred to
    the Discretionary Portfolio segment. The Residential Mortgage
    Banking segment incurred a net loss of $48 million in 2008,
    compared with net income of $13 million in 2007. The main
    factor contributing to the net loss in 2008 was the continued
    deterioration of the residential real estate market, including
    the valuation of residential real estate, which resulted in a
    $100 million increase to this segment’s provision for
    credit losses that was attributable predominately to a
    significant rise in net charge-offs of loans to builders and
    developers of residential real estate properties. Also
    contributing to the unfavorable performance of this segment was
    a $15 million decrease in net interest income, largely due
    to lower average loan balances outstanding of $369 million
    and a 17 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin
    associated with such loans, and a $10 million current year
    addition to the valuation allowance for capitalized mortgage
    servicing rights, compared with a $4 million reduction of
    such allowance in 2007. Partially offsetting those unfavorable
    factors was a $25 million increase in noninterest revenues
    from residential mortgage banking activities, largely due to the
    impact of the $18 million loss recorded in 2007 related to
    Alt-A mortgage loans and higher servicing revenues of
    $8 million in 2008. Net income earned by the Residential
    Mortgage Banking segment in 2007 was 74% lower than the
    $52 million recorded in 2006. That decline was primarily
    due to the significant deterioration of the residential real
    estate market during 2007 which resulted in a $36 million
    decrease in residential mortgage banking revenues earned by this
    segment. Contributing to the lower mortgage banking revenues
    were lower gains from residential mortgage loan origination and
    sales activities of $28 million, predominantly resulting
    from slimmer margins realized due to changes in market
    conditions, and the previously mentioned $18 million loss
    recognized in 2007 related to Alt-A residential mortgage loans.
    Also contributing to the unfavorable performance in 2007 as
    compared with 2006 were a $19 million decrease in net
    interest income, largely due to a $451 million decline in
    average loan balances outstanding and a 25 basis point
    narrowing of the net interest margin on such loans, and a lower
    partial reversal of the capitalized mortgage servicing rights
    valuation allowance of $6 million. Partially offsetting
    those unfavorable factors were higher mortgage servicing
    revenues of $10 million.

The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of services to
    consumers through several delivery channels which include branch
    offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and
    Internet banking. The Company has branch offices in New York
    State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the District of
    Columbia, West Virginia, Delaware and New Jersey. The Retail
    Banking segment also offers



certain deposit products on a nationwide basis through the
    delivery channels of M&T Bank, N.A. Credit services offered
    by this segment include consumer installment loans, student
    loans, automobile loans (originated both directly and indirectly
    through dealers), and home equity loans and lines of credit. The
    segment also offers to its customers deposit products, including
    demand, savings and time accounts; investment products,
    including mutual funds and annuities; and other services. The
    Retail Banking segment recorded net income of $250 million
    in 2008, 21% lower than the $316 million earned in 2007.
    Contributing to the unfavorable performance as compared with
    2007 were increases in: the provision for credit losses of
    $38 million, due to higher net charge-offs of loans;
    personnel costs of $22 million, reflecting merit increases
    and the impact of the late-2007 acquisitions; net occupancy
    expenses of $12 million, largely the result of the 2007
    acquisitions; and higher advertising and promotion costs of
    $6 million. Another contributing factor in the decline in
    net contribution was lower net interest income of
    $19 million, largely due to the narrowing of the net
    interest margins on deposits and loans of 34 basis points
    and 14 basis points, respectively, offset, in part, by the
    impact of higher average deposit and loan balances of
    $1.5 billion and $979 million, respectively. For the
    year ended December 31, 2006, the Retail Banking segment
    recorded net income of $282 million. The 12% improvement in
    2007 as compared with 2006 resulted from a $60 million
    increase in net interest income, primarily the result of a
    30 basis point increase in the deposit net interest margin,
    and higher service charges on deposit accounts of
    $25 million. Partially offsetting those factors was a
    $20 million increase in the provision for credit losses,
    resulting from higher average loan balances outstanding and net
    charge-offs, and a $4 million increase in noninterest
    expenses, largely due to higher processing costs related to
    debit card transactions.

The “All Other” category reflects other activities of
    the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported
    segments as determined in accordance with
    SFAS No. 131, such as the Company’s trust,
    brokerage and insurance businesses. Also reflected in this
    category are the amortization of core deposit and other
    intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of financial
    institutions; M&T’s equity in the earnings or losses
    of BLG; merger-related expenses resulting from acquisitions; and
    the net impact of the Company’s allocation methodologies
    for internal funds transfer pricing and the provision for credit
    losses. The various components of the “All Other”
    category resulted in net losses of $95 million,
    $167 million and $80 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The lower net loss in 2008 as compared with 2007
    resulted from several factors, including a $40 million
    reduction of income tax expense relating to the Company’s
    resolution in 2008 of certain tax issues related to its
    activities in various jurisdictions during the years 1999-2007;
    the previously mentioned $33 million gain realized in the
    first quarter of 2008 from the mandatory partial redemption of
    Visa stock; the impact from the $23 million accrual
    recorded in the final quarter of 2007 related to Visa litigation
    and the subsequent $15 million partial reversal of such
    accrual in the first quarter of 2008; lower merger-related costs
    associated with the 2007 acquisition transactions of
    $11 million; and the favorable impact from the
    Company’s allocation methodologies for internal transfers
    for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets
    and interest-bearing liabilities of the Company’s
    reportable segments and the provision for credit losses.
    Partially offsetting those favorable factors were a
    $32 million after-tax reduction of the contribution from
    M&T’s investment in BLG, inclusive of interest expense
    to fund that investment, in 2008, compared with a similar
    $4 million reduction in 2007; higher personnel and
    professional services costs of $15 million and
    $11 million, respectively, related to the business and
    support units included in the “All Other” category;
    and a $6 million contribution to The M&T Charitable
    Foundation. The higher net loss experienced in 2007 as compared
    with 2006 resulted from the unfavorable impact of the
    Company’s allocation methodologies for internal transfers
    for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets
    and interest-bearing liabilities of the Company’s
    reportable segments and the provision for credit losses; the
    previously discussed $23 million charge related to Visa
    litigation; increases in personnel and professional services
    costs of $19 million and $12 million, respectively,
    related to the business and support units included in the
    “All Other” category; $15 million of
    merger-related expenses in 2007 associated with the fourth
    quarter acquisition transactions, compared with $5 million
    in 2006 for that year’s June branch acquisition; a
    $4 million reduction of net income resulting from
    M&T’s investment in BLG (inclusive of interest expense
    to fund that investment); and a higher charge for the
    amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets. The
    $18 million contribution made to The M&T Charitable



Foundation in 2006 partially offset those unfavorable factors.
    There were no contributions to that foundation in 2007.

Recent
    Accounting Developments

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” for
    fair value measurements of certain of its financial instruments.
    The provisions of SFAS No. 157 that pertain to
    measurement of non-financial assets and liabilities have been
    deferred by the FASB until 2009. SFAS No. 157 defines
    fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
    GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 applies to fair value measurements
    required or permitted under other accounting pronouncements, but
    does not require any new fair value measurements. The definition
    of fair value is clarified by SFAS No. 157 to be the
    price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
    transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants at the measurement date. At December 31, 2008,
    approximately $2.5 billion or 29% of the Company’s
    $8.7 billion of assets and liabilities measured using fair
    value measurements on a recurring basis were classified as
    Level 3 valuations. The Level 3 classified assets and
    liabilities are primarily comprised of available-for-sale
    privately issued mortgage-backed securities. Such securities
    have been classified as a Level 3 valuation because of
    limited trading activities and less observable valuation inputs.
    Fair valuation losses on Level 3 available-for-sale
    investment securities of $420 million were recognized
    during the year ended December 31, 2008 as a reduction of
    other comprehensive income, with $24 million of
    other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized through
    earnings. As previously disclosed, with the exception of certain
    securities for which the Company recognized a $182 million
    other-than-temporary impairment charge in 2008, as of December
    31, 2008 the Company believed that it was not probable that it
    would be unable to collect all principal and interest payments
    on its portfolio of investment securities and, therefore, the
    Company believed that the unrealized losses on those securities
    were temporary. Nevertheless, as previously noted, the Company
    closely monitors the repayment performance of investment
    securities and underlying collateral on a regular basis and as a
    result of such monitoring it is possible that additional
    investment securities could be identified as
    other-than-temporarily impaired in future periods.

As a result of market inactivity and a lack of observable
    valuation inputs, approximately $2.2 billion of privately
    issued mortgage-backed securities in the Company’s
    available-for-sale investment securities portfolio were
    transferred out of a Level 2 classification and into a
    Level 3 classification during the third quarter of 2008.
    Offsetting the transfer into Level 3 were certain privately
    issued mortgage-backed securities of Bayview Financial with a
    fair value of $298 million that were transferred from the
    Company’s available-for-sale portfolio to its
    held-to-maturity portfolio during the quarter ended
    September 30, 2008, and thus are no longer measured at fair
    value. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

FAS 157-3,

“Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset Is Not Active”

(“FSP 157-3”).

FSP 157-3

was intended to clarify the application of
    SFAS No. 157 and provides an example to illustrate
    considerations in determining the fair value of a financial
    asset when the market for that financial asset is not active.

FSP 157-3

allows for the use of the reporting entity’s own
    assumptions about future cash flows and appropriately
    risk-adjusted discount rates when relevant observable inputs are
    not available to determine the fair value for a financial asset
    in a dislocated market. The Company considered the guidance
    provided by

FSP 157-3

in its determination of the fair value of its portfolio of
    privately issued mortgage-backed securities at December 31,
    2008. Additionally, at that date commitments to originate
    mortgage loans for sale with a net fair value gain of
    $8 million have been classified as a Level 3
    valuation. Approximately $31 million of fair value changes
    on commitments to originate mortgage loans for sale were
    recognized in mortgage banking revenues during the year ended
    December 31, 2008. Upon loan origination, the fair value of
    the derivative loan commitments becomes part of the basis of the
    closed loans held for sale. Approximately $26 million of
    fair value was transferred from Level 3 to Level 2
    classification to reflect the closing of commitments into
    originated loans held for sale during the year ended
    December 31, 2008. Information concerning fair value
    measurements and the Company’s approach to and
    classification of such measurements is included in note 20
    of Notes to Financial Statements.



In December 2007, the FASB issued a revised
    SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS No. 141R”). SFAS No. 141R
    retains the fundamental requirements of SFAS No. 141
    that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all
    business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for
    each business combination. SFAS No. 141R defines the
    acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more
    businesses in the business combination and establishes the
    acquisition date as the date the acquirer achieves control.
    SFAS No. 141R retains the guidance in
    SFAS No. 141 for identifying and recognizing
    intangible assets separately from goodwill. With limited
    exceptions, the statement requires an acquirer to recognize the
    assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling
    interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at
    their fair value as of that date. That replaces
    SFAS No. 141’s cost-allocation process, which
    required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the
    individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
    their estimated fair values. As a result, certain
    acquisition-related costs previously included in the cost of an
    acquisition will be required to be expensed as incurred. In
    addition, certain restructuring costs previously recognized as
    if they were an assumed liability from an acquisition will be
    required to be expensed. SFAS No. 141R also requires
    the acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages
    (sometimes referred to as a step acquisition) to recognize the
    identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, at the full amounts of
    their fair values. SFAS No. 141R also requires an
    acquirer to recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    arising from contractual contingencies as of the acquisition
    date, measured at their acquisition-date fair values. An
    acquirer is required to recognize assets or liabilities arising
    from noncontractual contingencies as of the acquisition date,
    measured at their acquisition-date fair values, only if it is
    more likely than not that they meet the definition of an asset
    or a liability in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6,
    “Elements of Financial Statements.”
    SFAS No. 141R requires an acquirer to recognize
    goodwill as of the acquisition date measured as a residual,
    which in most types of business combinations will result in
    measuring goodwill as the excess of the consideration
    transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest
    in the acquiree at the acquisition date over the fair value of
    the identifiable net assets acquired. SFAS No. 141R
    also eliminates the recognition of a separate valuation
    allowance, such as an allowance for credit losses, as of the
    acquisition date for assets acquired in a business combination
    that are measured at their acquisition-date fair values because
    the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows should be
    included in the fair value measurement of those assets.
    SFAS No. 141R should be applied prospectively to
    business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
    after the beginning of the first annual reporting period
    beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption
    is prohibited. The Company believes that the adoption of
    SFAS No. 141R will significantly impact its accounting
    for any acquisitions it may consummate in 2009 and beyond,
    including its announced transaction to acquire Provident in a
    stock-for-stock transaction expected to close during the second
    quarter of 2009.

Also in December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51.” A
    noncontrolling interest, sometimes called a minority interest,
    is a portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable,
    directly or indirectly, to a parent. SFAS No. 160
    requires that the ownership interest in subsidiaries held by
    parties other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled and
    presented in the consolidated statement of financial position
    within equity, but separate from the parent’s equity. The
    amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and
    to the noncontrolling interest is required to be clearly
    identified and presented on the face of the consolidated
    statement of income. SFAS No. 160 also requires
    entities to provide disclosures that clearly identify and
    distinguish between the interests of the parent and the
    interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160
    should be applied prospectively as of the beginning of a fiscal
    year beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier
    adoption is prohibited. The Company does not anticipate that the
    adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have a significant
    impact on the reporting of its financial position or results of
    its operations.

In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

FAS 140-3,

“Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishment of Liabilities”

(“FSP 140-3”).

FSP 140-3

was issued to provide guidance on accounting for a transfer of a
    financial asset and repurchase financing.

FSP 140-3

presumes that an initial transfer of a financial asset and a
    repurchase financing are considered part of the same arrangement
    (“linked transaction”) under SFAS No. 140,
    “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities.” However, if certain
    criteria are met, the initial



transfer and repurchase financing should not be evaluated as a
    linked transaction and should be evaluated separately under
    SFAS No. 140.

FSP 140-3

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2008 and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. Earlier application is not permitted.

FSP 140-3

should be applied prospectively to initial transfers and
    repurchase financings for which the initial transfer is executed
    on or after the beginning of the fiscal year for which

FSP 140-3

is effective. The Company does not believe that the adoption of

FSP 140-3

will have a material impact on its financial position or results
    of operations.

The FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” in March
    2008. SFAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosures about
    an entity’s derivative and hedging activities including
    (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments,
    (b) how derivative instruments and related hedging items
    are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting
    for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and its
    related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments
    and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial
    position, financial performance and cash flows.
    SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
    November 15, 2008, with earlier application encouraged. The
    Company intends to comply with the disclosure requirements of
    SFAS No. 161.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1,
    “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit
    Plan Assets” (“FSP 132R-1”). FSP 132R-1
    was issued to provide guidance on an employer’s disclosures
    about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other
    postretirement plan. FSP 132R-1 requires an employer to
    disclose information about how investment allocation decisions
    are made, including factors that are pertinent to an
    understanding of investment policies and strategies. An employer
    will also need to disclose separately for pension plans and
    other postretirement benefit plans the fair value of each major
    category of plan assets based on the nature and risks of the
    assets as of each annual reporting date for which a statement of
    financial position is presented. FSP 132R-1 also requires
    the disclosure of information that enables financial statement
    users to assess the inputs and valuation techniques used to
    develop fair value measurements of plan assets at the annual
    reporting date. For fair value measurements using significant
    unobservable inputs (Level 3), an employer will be required
    to disclose the effect of the measurements on changes in plan
    assets for the period. Furthermore, an employer is required to
    provide financial statement users with an understanding of
    significant concentrations of risk in plan assets.
    FSP 132R-1 should be applied for fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2009. Upon initial application, the provisions
    of FSP 132R-1 are not required for earlier periods that are
    presented for comparative purposes. Earlier application is
    permitted. The Company is still evaluating the provisions of
    FSP 132R-1 and intends to comply with its disclosure
    requirements.

In January 2009, the FASB issued FSP

EITF 99-20-1,

“Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue

No. 99-20”

(“FSP 99-20-1”).

FSP 99-20-1

amends the impairment guidance in EITF Issue

No. 99-20,

“Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased
    Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to
    Be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets.”
    The FASB stated that the objective of

FSP 99-20-1

was to achieve more consistent determination of whether an
    other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. An entity with
    beneficial interests within the scope of

FSP 99-20-1

is no longer required to solely consider market participant
    assumptions when evaluating cash flows for an adverse change
    that would be indicative of other-than-temporary impairment.

FSP 99-20-1

also retains and emphasizes the objective of an
    other-than-temporary impairment assessment and the related
    disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 115,
    “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
    Securities” and other related guidance.

FSP 99-20-1

should be applied prospectively for interim and annual reporting
    periods ending after December 15, 2008. Retrospective
    application to a prior interim or annual reporting period is not
    permitted. The Company has complied with the provisions of

FSP 99-20-1,

which had no incremental impact on its results of operations or
    financial position as of December 31, 2008.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

EITF 03-6-1,

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities”

(“FSP 03-6-1”).

FSP 03-6-1

was issued to specify that unvested share-based payment awards
    that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend
    equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating
    securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings
    per share pursuant to the two-class method.

FSP 03-6-1

is



effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods
    within those years. In January 2009, the Company issued a
    significant portion of its annual stock-based compensation
    awards in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock
    units, which are considered participating securities under

FSP 03-6-1.

Beginning for the quarter ending March 31, 2009, the
    Company’s earnings per share will be presented using the
    two-class method.

Forward-Looking
    Statements

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations and other sections of this Annual
    Report contain forward-looking statements that are based on
    current expectations, estimates and projections about the
    Company’s business, management’s beliefs and
    assumptions made by management. These statements are not
    guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks,
    uncertainties and assumptions (“Future Factors”) which
    are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results
    may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in
    such forward-looking statements.

Future Factors include changes in interest rates, spreads on
    earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and interest
    rate sensitivity; prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit
    losses and market values on loans, collateral securing loans and
    other assets; sources of liquidity; common shares outstanding;
    common stock price volatility; fair value of and number of
    stock-based compensation awards to be issued in future periods;
    legislation affecting the financial services industry as a
    whole, and M&T and its subsidiaries individually or
    collectively, including tax legislation; regulatory supervision
    and oversight, including monetary policy and required capital
    levels; changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be
    required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies; increasing
    price and product/service competition by competitors, including
    new entrants; rapid technological developments and changes; the
    ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and
    services on a timely, cost-effective basis; the mix of
    products/services; containing costs and expenses; governmental
    and public policy changes; protection and validity of
    intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers;
    technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large,
    multi-year contracts; the outcome of pending and future
    litigation and governmental proceedings, including tax-related
    examinations and other matters; continued availability of
    financing; financial resources in the amounts, at the times and
    on the terms required to support M&T and its
    subsidiaries’ future businesses; and material differences
    in the actual financial results of merger, acquisition and
    investment activities compared with M&T’s initial
    expectations, including the full realization of anticipated cost
    savings and revenue enhancements.

These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect
    the outcome of the forward-looking statements. In addition, such
    statements could be affected by general industry and market
    conditions and growth rates, general economic and political
    conditions, either nationally or in the states in which M&T
    and its subsidiaries do business, including interest rate and
    currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes and trends in the
    securities markets, and other Future Factors.

Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting at M&T
    Bank Corporation and subsidiaries (“the Company”).
    Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008 based on criteria described in
    “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on that assessment, management concluded that
    the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008.

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, that was engaged to express an opinion
    as to the fairness of presentation of such financial statements.
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was also engaged to assess the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting. The report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
    follows this report.

M&T BANK CORPORATION

Robert
    G. Wilmers

Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer

René
    F. Jones

Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and
    Stockholders of

M&T Bank Corporation

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of M&T Bank Corporation and its
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
    opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for these financial statements, for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting, included in the accompanying Report on Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
    express opinions on these financial statements and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements

1.

Significant
    accounting policies

M&T Bank Corporation (“M&T”) is a bank
    holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York. Through
    subsidiaries, M&T provides individuals, corporations and
    other businesses, and institutions with commercial and retail
    banking services, including loans and deposits, trust, mortgage
    banking, asset management, insurance and other financial
    services. Banking activities are largely focused on consumers
    residing in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and
    the District of Columbia and on small and medium-size businesses
    based in those areas. Banking services are also provided in
    Delaware, West Virginia and New Jersey, while certain
    subsidiaries also conduct activities in other states.

The accounting and reporting policies of M&T and
    subsidiaries (“the Company”) conform to generally
    accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and to general
    practices within the banking industry. The preparation of
    financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates. The more significant accounting policies are as
    follows:

Consolidation

Except as described in note 19, the consolidated financial
    statements include M&T and all of its subsidiaries. All
    significant intercompany accounts and transactions of
    consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.
    The financial statements of M&T included in note 26
    report investments in subsidiaries under the equity method.
    Information about some limited purpose entities that are
    affiliates of the Company but are not included in the
    consolidated financial statements appears in note 19.

Consolidated
    Statement of Cash Flows

For purposes of this statement, cash and due from banks and
    federal funds sold are considered cash and cash equivalents.

Securities
    purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under
    agreements to repurchase

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities
    sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as
    collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at
    amounts equal to the cash or other consideration exchanged. It
    is generally the Company’s policy to take possession of
    collateral pledged to secure agreements to resell.

Trading
    account

Financial instruments used for trading purposes are stated at
    fair value. Realized gains and losses and unrealized changes in
    fair value of financial instruments utilized in trading
    activities are included in  “trading account and foreign
    exchange gains” in the consolidated statement of income.

Investment
    securities

Investments in debt securities are classified as held to
    maturity and stated at amortized cost when management has the
    positive intent and ability to hold such securities to maturity.
    Investments in other debt securities and equity securities
    having readily determinable fair values are classified as
    available for sale and stated at estimated fair value. Except
    for investment securities for which the Company has entered into
    a related fair value hedge, unrealized gains or losses on
    investment securities available for sale are reflected in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable
    income taxes.

Other securities are stated at cost and include stock of the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank
    (“FHLB”) of New York.

Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts for
    investment securities available for sale and held to maturity
    are included in interest income. The cost basis of individual
    securities is written down to estimated fair value through a
    charge to earnings when declines in value below amortized cost



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

are considered to be other than temporary. Realized gains and
    losses on the sales of investment securities are determined
    using the specific identification method.

Loans
    and leases

Interest income on loans is accrued on a level yield method.
    Loans are placed on nonaccrual status and previously accrued
    interest thereon is charged against income when principal or
    interest is delinquent 90 days, unless management
    determines that the loan status clearly warrants other
    treatment. Loan balances are charged off when it becomes evident
    that such balances are not fully collectible. For residential
    real estate loans, the excess of the loan balances over the net
    realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan is
    charged-off when the loan becomes 150 days delinquent. Loan
    fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and
    recognized as an interest yield adjustment over the life of the
    loan. Net deferred fees have been included in unearned discount
    as a reduction of loans outstanding. Commitments to sell real
    estate loans are utilized by the Company to hedge the exposure
    to changes in fair value of real estate loans held for sale. The
    carrying value of hedged real estate loans held for sale
    recorded in the consolidated balance sheet includes changes in
    estimated fair market value during the hedge period, typically
    from the date of close through the sale date. Valuation
    adjustments made on these loans and commitments are included in
    “mortgage banking revenues.”

Except for consumer and residential mortgage loans that are
    considered smaller balance homogenous loans and are evaluated
    collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired for
    purposes of applying Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 114, “Accounting by Creditors
    for Impairment of a Loan,” as amended, when, based on
    current information and events, it is probable that the Company
    will be unable to collect all amounts according to the
    contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is
    delinquent 90 days. Impaired loans are classified as either
    nonaccrual or as loans renegotiated at below market rates. Loans
    less than 90 days delinquent are deemed to have an
    insignificant delay in payment and are generally not considered
    impaired for purposes of applying SFAS No. 114.
    Impairment of a loan is measured based on the present value of
    expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s
    effective interest rate, the loan’s observable market
    price, or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral
    dependent. Interest received on impaired loans placed on
    nonaccrual status is applied to reduce the carrying value of the
    loan or, if principal is considered fully collectible,
    recognized as interest income.

Residual value estimates for commercial leases are generally
    determined through internal or external reviews of the leased
    property. The Company reviews commercial lease residual values
    at least annually and recognizes residual value impairments
    deemed to be other than temporary.

Allowance
    for credit losses

The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in
    management’s judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit
    losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the
    balance sheet date. The adequacy of the allowance is determined
    by management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio
    based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated
    with each loan category, the current financial condition of
    specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers
    operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any
    collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any
    guarantees or indemnifications.

Assets
    taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans

Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans are primarily
    comprised of commercial and residential real property and are
    included in “other assets” in the consolidated balance
    sheet. Upon acquisition of assets taken in satisfaction of a
    defaulted loan, the excess of the remaining loan balance over
    the asset’s estimated fair value less costs to sell is
    charged off against the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent
    declines in value of the assets are recognized as “other
    expense” in the consolidated statement of income.

Premises
    and equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation expense is computed principally using
    the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets.



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

Capitalized
    servicing rights

Capitalized servicing assets are included in “other
    assets” in the consolidated balance sheet. Effective
    January 1, 2007, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of
    Financial Assets — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 140,” which requires that all separately
    recognized servicing assets be initially measured at fair value
    and permits an entity to choose its subsequent measurement
    method for servicing assets as either the amortization method or
    fair value method. The Company uses the amortization method
    under which capitalized servicing assets are charged to expense
    in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing
    income. Prior to January 1, 2007, the Company initially
    measured servicing assets retained in sales and securitization
    transactions for which it was the transferor under the relative
    fair value method prescribed in SFAS No. 140,
    “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities,” and subsequently
    charged such assets to expense using the amortization method.

To estimate the fair value of servicing rights, the Company
    considers market prices for similar assets and the present value
    of expected future cash flows associated with the servicing
    rights calculated using assumptions that market participants
    would use in estimating future servicing income and expense.
    Such assumptions include estimates of the cost of servicing
    loans, loan default rates, an appropriate discount rate, and
    prepayment speeds. For purposes of evaluating and measuring
    impairment of capitalized servicing rights, the Company
    stratifies such assets based on the predominant risk
    characteristics of the underlying financial instruments that are
    expected to have the most impact on projected prepayments, cost
    of servicing and other factors affecting future cash flows
    associated with the servicing rights. Such factors may include
    financial asset or loan type, note rate and term. The amount of
    impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value
    of the capitalized servicing rights for a stratum exceeds
    estimated fair value. Impairment is recognized through a
    valuation allowance.

Sales
    and securitizations of financial assets

Transfers of financial assets for which the Company has
    surrendered control of the financial assets are accounted for as
    sales to the extent that consideration other than beneficial
    interests in the transferred assets is received in exchange.
    Interests in a sale or securitization of financial assets that
    continue to be held by the Company, other than servicing rights
    which as of January 1, 2007 are initially measured at fair
    value, are measured at the date of transfer by allocating the
    previous carrying amount between the assets transferred and the
    retained interests based on their relative estimated fair
    values. The fair values of retained debt securities are
    generally determined through reference to independent pricing
    information. The fair values of retained servicing rights and
    any other retained interests are determined based on the present
    value of expected future cash flows associated with those
    interests and by reference to market prices for similar assets.

Goodwill
    and core deposit and other intangible assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity
    over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
    Similar to goodwill, other intangible assets, which include core
    deposit intangibles, also lack physical substance but, as
    required by SFAS No. 141, “Business
    Combinations,” portions of the cost of an acquired entity
    have been assigned to such assets. The Company accounts for
    goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with
    SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets,” which, in general, requires that goodwill not be
    amortized, but rather that it be tested for impairment at least
    annually at the reporting unit level, which is either at the
    same level or one level below an operating segment. Other
    acquired intangible assets with finite lives, such as core
    deposit intangibles, are required to be amortized over their
    estimated lives. Core deposit and other intangible assets are
    generally amortized using accelerated methods over estimated
    useful lives of five to ten years. The Company periodically
    assesses whether events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amounts of core deposit and other intangible
    assets may be impaired.

Derivative
    financial instruments

The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in
    accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended.
    SFAS No. 133 requires that an entity



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the
    balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If
    certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically
    designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the
    fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized
    firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable
    cash flows of a forecasted transaction or (c) a hedge of
    the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign
    operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, an available for
    sale security, or a foreign currency denominated forecasted
    transaction. Pursuant to SFAS No. 133, the accounting
    for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the
    intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. An
    entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to
    establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use
    for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and
    the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect
    of the hedge. Those methods must be consistent with the
    entity’s approach to managing risk.

The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of
    the management of interest rate risk to modify the repricing
    characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities. For such agreements,
    amounts receivable or payable are recognized as accrued under
    the terms of the agreement and the net differential is recorded
    as an adjustment to interest income or expense of the related
    asset or liability. Interest rate swap agreements may be
    designated as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. In a
    fair value hedge, the fair values of the interest rate swap
    agreements and changes in the fair values of the hedged items
    are recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet
    with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current
    earnings. The difference between changes in the fair values of
    interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents
    hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in “other revenues
    from operations” in the consolidated statement of income.
    In a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the
    derivative’s unrealized gain or loss is initially recorded
    as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently
    reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction
    affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gain
    or loss is reported in “other revenues from
    operations” immediately.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to
    hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of real estate
    loans held for sale. Commitments to originate real estate loans
    to be held for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans
    are generally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at
    estimated fair market value. Effective January 1, 2008, the
    Company adopted the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin
    (“SAB”) No. 109 for written loan commitments
    issued or modified after that date. SAB No. 109
    reversed previous conclusions expressed by the SEC staff
    regarding written loan commitments that are accounted for at
    fair value through earnings. Specifically, the SEC staff now
    believes that the expected net future cash flows related to the
    associated servicing of the loan should be included in the fair
    value measurement of the derivative loan commitment. In
    accordance with SAB No. 105, “Application of
    Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments,” the Company had
    not included such amount in the value of commitments to
    originate real estate loans for sale in 2006 or 2007.

Derivative instruments not related to mortgage banking
    activities, including financial futures commitments and interest
    rate swap agreements, that do not satisfy the hedge accounting
    requirements noted above are recorded at fair value and are
    generally classified as trading account assets or liabilities
    with resultant changes in fair value being recognized in
    “trading account and foreign exchange gains” in the
    consolidated statement of income.

Stock-based
    compensation

Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the vesting
    period of the stock-based grant based on the estimated grant
    date value of the stock-based compensation that is expected to
    vest, except that the recognition of compensation costs is
    accelerated for stock-based awards granted to
    retirement-eligible employees and employees who will become
    retirement-eligible prior to full vesting of the award because
    the Company’s incentive compensation plan allows for
    vesting at the time an employee retires. Information on the
    determination of the estimated value of stock-based awards used
    to calculate stock-based compensation expense is included in
    note 11.

Income
    taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
    future tax effects attributable to differences between the
    financial statement value of existing assets and liabilities and
    their respective tax bases and carryforwards. Deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and
    laws.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial
    Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (“FIN”)
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes.” FIN No. 48 prescribes the accounting
    method to be applied to measure uncertainty in income taxes
    recognized under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
    Income Taxes.” FIN No. 48 established a
    recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
    financial statement recognition and measurement of an uncertain
    tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The
    evaluation of an uncertain tax position in accordance with
    FIN No. 48 is a two-step process. The first step is
    recognition, which requires a determination whether it is more
    likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon
    examination, including resolution of any related appeals or
    litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the
    position. The second step is measurement. Under the measurement
    step, a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not
    recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of
    benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being
    realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously
    failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold
    should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting
    period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax
    positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not
    recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first
    subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is
    no longer met. The adoption of FIN No. 48 did not
    result in any change to the Company’s liability for
    uncertain tax positions as of January 1, 2007. Information
    related to the application of FIN No. 48 is provided
    in note 13.

Earnings
    per common share

Basic earnings per common share exclude dilution and are
    computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by
    the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
    (exclusive of shares represented by the unvested portion of
    restricted stock grants) and common shares issuable under
    deferred compensation arrangements during the period. Diluted
    earnings per common share reflect shares represented by the
    unvested portion of restricted stock grants and the potential
    dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to
    issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock
    or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in
    earnings. Proceeds assumed to have been received on such
    exercise or conversion are assumed to be used to purchase shares
    of M&T common stock at the average market price during the
    period, as required by the “treasury stock method” of
    accounting.

Treasury
    stock

Repurchases of shares of M&T common stock are recorded at
    cost as a reduction of stockholders’ equity. Reissuances of
    shares of treasury stock are recorded at average cost.

Acquisitions

On December 18, 2008, M&T entered into a definitive
    agreement to acquire Provident Bankshares Corporation
    (“Provident”), a bank holding company headquartered in
    Baltimore, Maryland, in a stock-for-stock transaction. Provident
    operates 143 branch offices located primarily in Maryland and
    Virginia. At December 31, 2008, Provident had
    $6.6 billion in assets, including $4.4 billion of
    loans and leases and $1.4 billion of investment securities,
    and $5.9 billion of liabilities, including
    $4.8 billion of deposits. The merger requires the approval
    of various regulatory agencies and Provident’s shareholders
    and, assuming those approvals are obtained, is expected to be
    completed during the second quarter of 2009. Under the terms of
    the merger agreement, Provident common shareholders will receive
    0.171625 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for
    each share of Provident common stock they own. At
    December 31, 2008, Provident had 33,510,889 shares of
    common stock outstanding. Series A and Series B
    preferred stock of $188 million issued by Provident will be
    exchanged for series of M&T preferred stock on
    substantially the same terms. The acquisition of Provident will
    expand the Company’s presence in the Mid-Atlantic area,



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

is expected to give the Company the second-largest deposit share
    in Maryland, and will triple the Company’s presence in
    Virginia.

On November 30, 2007, M&T completed the acquisition of
    Partners Trust Financial Group, Inc. (“Partners
    Trust”), a bank holding company headquartered in Utica, New
    York. Partners Trust operated 33 branch offices in upstate New
    York at the date of acquisition. The results of operations
    acquired in the Partners Trust transaction have been included in
    the Company’s financial results since November 30,
    2007. After application of the election, allocation and
    proration procedures contained in the merger agreement with
    Partners Trust, M&T paid $282 million in cash and
    issued 3,096,861 shares of M&T common stock in
    exchange for Partners Trust shares and stock options outstanding
    at the time of acquisition. The purchase price was approximately
    $559 million based on the cash paid to Partners Trust
    shareholders, the fair value of M&T common stock exchanged,
    and the cash paid to holders of Partners Trust stock options.
    The acquisition of Partners Trust expanded the Company’s
    presence in upstate New York, making the Company the deposit
    market share leader in the Utica-Rome and Binghamton markets,
    while strengthening its lead position in Syracuse.

Assets acquired from Partners Trust on November 30, 2007
    totaled $3.5 billion, including $2.2 billion of loans
    and leases (largely residential real estate and consumer loans),
    liabilities assumed aggregated $3.0 billion, including
    $2.2 billion of deposits (largely savings, money-market and
    time deposits), and $277 million was added to
    stockholders’ equity. In connection with the acquisition,
    the Company recorded approximately $283 million of goodwill
    and $50 million of core deposit intangible. The core
    deposit intangible is being amortized over 7 years using an
    accelerated method. Information regarding the allocation of
    goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition to the
    Company’s reportable segments, as well as the carrying
    amounts and amortization of core deposit and other intangible
    assets, is provided in note 8.

As a condition of the approval of the Partners Trust acquisition
    by regulators, M&T Bank, the principal bank subsidiary of
    M&T into which the bank subsidiary of Partners Trust was
    merged, was required to divest three branch offices in
    Binghamton, New York. The three branches were sold on
    March 15, 2008, including loans of $13 million and
    deposits of $65 million. No gain or loss was recognized on
    that transaction.

Pro forma information for the year ended December 31, 2007
    as if Partners Trust had been acquired on January 1, 2007
    is not presented since such pro forma results were not
    materially different from the Company’s actual results.

On December 7, 2007, M&T Bank acquired 13 branch
    offices in the Mid-Atlantic area from First Horizon Bank in a
    cash transaction. The offices had approximately
    $214 million of loans, $216 million of deposits and
    $80 million of trust and investment assets under management
    on the transaction date.

On June 30, 2006, M&T Bank acquired 21 branch offices
    in Buffalo and Rochester, New York from Citibank, N.A. in a cash
    transaction. The offices had approximately $269 million of
    loans and approximately $1.0 billion of deposits.

The Company incurred merger-related expenses related to systems
    conversions and other costs of integrating and conforming
    acquired operations with and into the Company of approximately
    $4 million ($2 million net of applicable income taxes)
    during 2008, $15 million ($9 million net of applicable
    income taxes) during 2007 and $5 million ($3 million
    net of applicable income taxes) during 2006. Those expenses
    consisted largely of professional services and other temporary
    help fees associated with the conversion of systems

and/or

integration of operations; costs related to branch and office
    consolidations; incentive compensation; initial marketing and
    promotion expenses designed to introduce the Company to
    customers of the acquired operations; travel costs; and
    printing, postage and supplies and other costs of commencing
    operations in new offices.

Gross realized gains on investment securities were $34,730,000
    in 2008, $1,585,000 in 2007 and $2,735,000 in 2006. Gross
    realized losses on investment securities were $259,000 in 2008,
    $381,000 in 2007 and $169,000 in 2006. During 2008, the Company
    recognized $182 million of other-than-temporary impairment
    losses, mainly attributable to a $153 million impairment
    charge recognized on its preferred stock holdings of The Federal
    National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and The
    Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”)
    with a cost basis of $162 million following the placement
    of those government-sponsored entities into conservatorship on
    September 7, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the
    Company’s investment in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
    preferred stock had a remaining cost basis of $9 million
    and a fair value of $2 million. Other-than-temporary
    charges of $18 million and $11 million were also
    recognized during 2008 on $20 million of privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities and $12 million of securities
    backed by trust preferred securities issued by financial
    institutions, respectively. During 2007, the Company recognized
    a $127,300,000 other-than-temporary impairment charge related to
    $131,700,000 of collateralized debt obligations purchased in
    March 2007 that were supported by sub-prime mortgage-backed
    securities. The impairment charges for the mortgage-related
    securities were recognized in light of significant deterioration
    of housing values in the residential real estate market, the
    significant rise in delinquencies and charge-offs of underlying
    mortgage loans and resulting decline in market value of the
    securities. The impairment charges related to the collateralized
    debt obligations backed by trust preferred securities were
    recognized as a result of evaluations of the credit status of
    the issuers of the underlying trust preferred securities and the
    likelihood of the Company receiving all principal and interest
    payments in accordance with the terms of the collateralized debt
    obligations. Of the remaining collateralized debt obligations,
    $16 million were obtained in the Partners Trust acquisition
    on November 30, 2007 and are collateralized by trust
    preferred capital securities and subordinated notes of other
    banking and insurance companies.

M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

The Company owned 699 individual investment securities with
    aggregate gross unrealized losses of $1,001,748,000 at
    December 31, 2008. Approximately $879 million of the
    unrealized losses pertain to privately issued mortgage-backed
    securities with a cost basis of $3.6 billion. The Company
    also had $90 million of unrealized losses on trust
    preferred securities issued by financial institutions and
    securities backed by trust preferred securities issued by
    financial institutions having a cost basis of $241 million.
    At December 31, 2008, based on a review of each of the
    remaining securities in the investment securities portfolio, the
    Company concluded that it was not probable that it would be
    unable to realize the cost basis investment and appropriate
    interest payments on such securities. As of December 31,
    2008, the Company has the intent and ability to hold each of its
    impaired securities to recovery. At December 31, 2008, the
    Company has not identified events or changes in circumstances
    which may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of

One-to-four family residential mortgage loans held for sale were
    $352 million at December 31, 2008 and
    $774 million at December 31, 2007. In March 2007, the
    Company transferred approximately $883 million of
    residential real estate loans (including $808 million of
    first mortgage loans and $75 million of second mortgage
    loans) from its held-for-sale loan portfolio to its
    held-for-investment portfolio. Those loans represented
    alternative (“Alt-A”) residential real estate loans
    that the Company had been actively originating for sale in the
    secondary market. Unfavorable market conditions and lack of
    market liquidity impacted the Company’s willingness to sell
    those loans. Accordingly, the Alt-A loans were transferred at
    the lower of cost or market value resulting in a reduction of
    the carrying value of the loans and mortgage banking revenues of
    $12 million. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale were
    $156 million at December 31, 2008 and $79 million
    at December 31, 2007.

As of December 31, 2008, approximately $16 million of
    one-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced for
    others had been sold with credit recourse. As of
    December 31, 2008, approximately

$1.2 billion of commercial mortgage loan balances serviced
    for others had been sold with recourse in conjunction with the
    Company’s participation in the Fannie Mae Delegated
    Underwriting and Servicing (“DUS”) program. At
    December 31, 2008 the Company estimated that the recourse
    obligations described above were not material to the
    Company’s consolidated financial position. There have been
    no material losses incurred as a result of those credit recourse
    arrangements.

Nonaccrual loans totaled $755,397,000 at December 31, 2008
    and $431,282,000 at December 31, 2007. Renegotiated loans
    (loans which had been renegotiated at below-market interest
    rates or for which other concessions were granted, but are
    accruing interest) were $91,575,000 and $15,884,000 at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During 2008, to
    assist borrowers the Company modified residential real estate
    loans having outstanding balances at December 31, 2008 of
    approximately $162 million. The modified loans were largely
    from the Company’s portfolio of Alt-A loans. Of that total,
    $93 million of such loans were included in nonaccrual loans
    at December 31, 2008. After a period of demonstrated
    performance, those loans may begin to accrue interest in 2009.
    The remaining $69 million of such modified loans were
    classified as renegotiated loans, were current in their payments
    and were accruing interest at the 2008 year-end. If
    nonaccrual and renegotiated loans had been accruing interest at
    their originally contracted terms, interest income on such loans
    would have amounted to $61,666,000 in 2008 and $36,207,000 in
    2007. The actual amounts included in interest income during 2008
    and 2007 on such loans were $36,747,000 and $12,492,000,
    respectively.

The recorded investment in loans considered impaired for
    purposes of applying SFAS No. 114 was $616,743,000 and
    $225,287,000 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    The recorded investment in loans considered impaired for which
    there was a related valuation allowance for impairment included
    in the allowance for credit losses and the amount of such
    impairment allowance were $501,873,000 and $123,674,000,
    respectively, at December 31, 2008 and $183,488,000 and
    $55,050,000, respectively, at December 31, 2007. The
    recorded investment in loans considered impaired for which there
    was no related valuation allowance for impairment was
    $114,870,000 and $41,799,000 at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The average recorded investment in impaired loans
    during 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $371,298,000, $195,597,000 and
    $97,263,000, respectively. Interest income recognized on
    impaired loans totaled $7,222,000, $7,368,000 and $4,866,000 for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Borrowings by directors and certain officers of M&T and its
    banking subsidiaries, and by associates of such persons,
    exclusive of loans aggregating less than $120,000 amounted to
    $154,128,000 and $221,202,000 at December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. During 2008, new borrowings by such persons
    amounted to $58,094,000 (including borrowings of new directors
    or officers that were outstanding at the time of their election)
    and repayments and other reductions (including reductions
    resulting from retirements) were $125,168,000.

At December 31, 2008, approximately $6.9 billion of
    commercial mortgage loans, $2.6 billion of one-to-four
    family residential mortgage loans and $1.2 billion of home
    equity loans were pledged to secure outstanding borrowings from
    the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and the Federal Reserve
    Bank of New York totaling approximately $7.9 billion.

Beginning in December 2007, the excess of residential real
    estate loan balances over the net realizable value of the
    property collateralizing the loan is charged off when the loans
    become 150 days delinquent, whereas previously the Company
    provided an allowance for credit losses for such amounts and
    charged-off loans upon foreclosure of the underlying property.
    Charge-offs in 2007 included $15 million related to this
    change in procedure. The effect of the change in the timing of
    recognizing those charge-offs did not have a material effect on
    the Company’s net income or on its financial position.

Residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled were
    $15.4 billion, $14.5 billion and $13.4 billion at
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    Small-balance commercial mortgage loans serviced for others were
    $5.9 billion, $4.9 billion and $3.3 billion at
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Commercial
    mortgage loans serviced for others were $6.4 billion,
    $5.3 billion and $4.9 billion at December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

During 2008, a provision for impairment of $16,000,000 was added
    to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage
    loan servicing assets because the carrying value of certain
    strata of capitalized servicing assets exceeded estimated fair
    value. During 2007 and 2006, $4,050,000 and $9,750,000,
    respectively, of the valuation allowance for capitalized
    residential mortgage loan servicing assets was reversed because
    of increases in the market value of certain strata of servicing
    assets relative to the amortized cost basis of the servicing
    assets in such strata. The estimated fair value of capitalized
    residential mortgage loan servicing assets was approximately
    $103 million at December 31, 2008 and
    $135 million at December 31, 2007. The fair value of
    capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets was
    estimated using weighted-average discount rates of 13.0% and
    16.1% at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and
    contemporaneous prepayment assumptions that vary by loan type.
    At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the discount rate
    represented a weighted-average option-adjusted spread
    (“OAS”) of 832 basis points (hundredths of one
    percent) and 885 basis points, respectively, over market
    implied forward London Interbank Offered Rates. The estimated
    fair value of capitalized small-balance commercial mortgage loan
    servicing assets was approximately $74 million at
    December 31, 2008 and $70 million at December 31,
    2007. The fair value of capitalized small-balance commercial
    loan servicing assets was estimated using weighted-average
    discount rates of 20.2% and 20.1% at December 31, 2008 and
    2007,



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

respectively, and contemporaneous prepayment assumptions that
    vary by loan type. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    discount rate represented a weighted-average OAS of
    1,774 basis points and 1,600 basis points,
    respectively, over market implied forward London Interbank
    Offered Rates. The estimated fair value of capitalized
    residential and small-balance commercial mortgage loan servicing
    rights may vary significantly in subsequent periods due to
    changing interest rates and the effect thereof on prepayment
    speeds. The estimated fair value of capitalized commercial
    mortgage loans servicing assets was approximately
    $31 million and $25 million at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively. An 18% discount rate was used to
    estimate the fair value of capitalized commercial mortgage loan
    servicing rights at December 31, 2008 and 2007 with no
    prepayment assumptions because, in general, the servicing
    agreements allow the Company to share in customer loan
    prepayment fees and thereby recover the remaining carrying value
    of the capitalized servicing rights associated with such loan.
    The Company’s ability to realize the carrying value of
    capitalized commercial mortgage servicing rights is more
    dependent on the borrowers’ abilities to repay the
    underlying loans than on prepayments or changes in interest
    rates.

The key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of
    capitalized servicing rights at December 31, 2008 and the
    sensitivity of such value to changes in those assumptions are
    summarized in the table that follows. Those calculated
    sensitivities are hypothetical and actual changes in the fair
    value of capitalized servicing rights may differ significantly
    from the amounts presented herein. The effect of a variation in
    a particular assumption on the fair value of the servicing
    rights is calculated without changing any other assumption. In
    reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another
    which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities. The changes
    in assumptions are presumed to be instantaneous.

Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets was
    generally computed using accelerated methods over original
    amortization periods of five to ten years. The weighted-average
    original amortization period was approximately eight years. The
    remaining weighted-average amortization period as of
    December 31, 2008 was approximately six years. Amortization
    expense for core deposit and other intangible assets was
    $66,646,000, $66,486,000 and $63,008,000 for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Estimated

Also in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 142, the Company completed annual goodwill
    impairment tests as of October 1, 2006, 2007 and 2008. For
    purposes of testing for impairment, the Company assigned all
    recorded goodwill to the reporting units originally intended to
    benefit from past business combinations, which has historically
    been the Company’s core relationship business reporting
    units. Goodwill was generally assigned based on the implied fair
    value of the acquired goodwill applicable to the benefited
    reporting units at the time of each respective acquisition. The
    implied fair value of the goodwill was determined as the
    difference between the estimated incremental overall fair value
    of the reporting unit and the estimated fair value of the net
    assets assigned to the reporting unit as of each respective
    acquisition date. To test for goodwill impairment at each
    evaluation date, the Company compared the estimated fair value
    of each of its reporting units to their respective carrying
    amounts and certain other assets and liabilities assigned to the
    reporting unit, including goodwill and core deposit and other
    intangible assets. The methodologies used to estimate fair
    values of reporting units as of the acquisition dates and as of
    the evaluation dates were similar. For the Company’s core
    customer relationship business reporting units, fair value was
    estimated as the present value of the expected future cash flows
    of the reporting unit. Based on the results of the goodwill
    impairment tests, the Company concluded that the amount of
    recorded goodwill was not impaired at the respective testing
    dates.

The following table presents a summary of goodwill assigned to

    Trust IV (“Trust IV”), a Delaware business
    trust, issued $350 million of 8.50% fixed rate Enhanced
    Trust Preferred Securities (“8.50% Enhanced
    Trust Preferred Securities”). First Maryland Capital I
    (“Trust V”) and First Maryland Capital II
    (“Trust VI”) have issued floating rate preferred
    capital securities aggregating $300 million. The

    in the three-month LIBOR and were 5.75% and 4.04%, respectively,
    at December 31, 2008 and 6.24% and 5.76%, respectively, at
    December 31, 2007. As a result of an acquisition in the
    fourth quarter of 2007, M&T assumed responsibility for
    $31.5 million of similar preferred capital securities
    previously issued by special-purpose entities consisting of
    $16.5 million of fixed rate preferred capital securities

The Junior Subordinated Debentures represent the sole assets of
    each Trust and payments under the Junior Subordinated Debentures
    are the sole source of cash flow for each Trust. The financial
    statement carrying values of junior subordinated debentures
    associated with preferred capital securities at
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 of
    Trust III, Trust V, Trust VI and Trust VII
    include the unamortized portions of purchase accounting
    adjustments to reflect estimated fair value as of the date of
    M&T’s acquisition of the common securities of each
    respective trust. The interest rates payable on the Junior
    Subordinated Debentures of Trust V, Trust VI and
    Trust VIII were 5.75%, 4.04% and 8.17%, respectively, at
    December 31, 2008 and were 6.24%, 5.76% and 8.59%,
    respectively, at December 31, 2007.

Holders of the Capital Securities receive preferential
    cumulative cash distributions on each distribution date at the
    stated distribution rate unless M&T exercises its right to
    extend the payment of interest on the Junior Subordinated
    Debentures for up to ten semi-annual periods (in the case of
    Trust  I, Trust II, Trust III and
    Trust VII), twenty quarterly periods (in the case of
    Trust V, Trust VI and Trust VIII) or, with
    respect to Trust IV, for up to twenty quarterly periods
    without being subject to the alternative payment mechanism (as
    described below), and for up to forty quarterly periods, without
    giving rise to an event of default, in which case payment of
    distributions on the respective Capital

Securities will be deferred for comparable periods. During an
    extended interest period, M&T may not pay dividends or
    distributions on, or repurchase, redeem or acquire any shares of
    its capital stock. In the event of an extended interest period
    exceeding twenty quarterly periods for the Junior Subordinated
    Debentures due January 31, 2068 held by Trust IV,
    M&T must fund the payment of accrued and unpaid interest
    through the alternative payment mechanism, which requires
    M&T to issue common stock, non-cumulative perpetual
    preferred stock or warrants to purchase common stock until
    M&T has raised an amount of eligible proceeds at least
    equal to the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid deferred
    interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures due
    January 31, 2068 held by Trust IV. The agreements
    governing the Capital Securities, in the aggregate, provide a
    full, irrevocable and unconditional guarantee by M&T of the
    payment of distributions on, the redemption of, and any
    liquidation distribution with respect to the Capital Securities.
    The obligations under such guarantee and the Capital Securities
    are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all senior
    indebtedness of M&T.

The Capital Securities will remain outstanding until the Junior
    Subordinated Debentures are repaid at maturity, are redeemed
    prior to maturity or are distributed in liquidation to the
    Trusts. The Capital Securities are mandatorily redeemable in
    whole, but not in part, upon repayment at the stated maturity
    dates of the Junior Subordinated Debentures or the earlier
    redemption of the Junior Subordinated Debentures in whole upon
    the occurrence of one or more events set forth in the indentures
    relating to the Capital Securities, and in whole or in part at
    any time after an optional redemption contemporaneously with the
    optional redemption of the related Junior Subordinated
    Debentures in whole or in part, subject to possible regulatory
    approval. In connection with the issuance of the 8.50% Enhanced
    Trust Preferred Securities by Trust IV, M&T
    entered into a replacement capital covenant that provides that
    neither M&T nor any of its subsidiaries will repay, redeem
    or purchase any of the Junior Subordinated Debentures due
    January 31, 2068 or the 8.50% Enhanced Trust Preferred
    Securities prior to January 31, 2048, with certain limited
    exceptions, except to the extent that, during the 180 days
    prior to the date of that repayment, redemption or purchase,
    M&T and its subsidiaries have received proceeds from the
    sale of qualifying securities that (i) have equity-like
    characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than,
    the applicable characteristics of the 8.50% Enhanced
    Trust Preferred Securities or the Junior Subordinated
    Debentures due January 31, 2068, as applicable, at the time
    of repayment, redemption or purchase, and (ii) M&T has
    obtained the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, if
    required.

Allfirst Preferred Capital Trust (“Allfirst Capital
    Trust”) has issued $100 million of Floating Rate
    Non-Cumulative Subordinated Trust Enhanced Securities
    (“SKATES”). Allfirst Capital Trust is a Delaware
    business trust that was formed for the exclusive purposes of
    (i) issuing the SKATES and common securities,
    (ii) purchasing Asset Preferred Securities issued by
    Allfirst Preferred Asset Trust (“Allfirst Asset
    Trust”) and (iii) engaging in only those other
    activities necessary or incidental thereto. M&T holds 100%
    of the common securities of Allfirst Capital Trust. Allfirst
    Asset Trust is a Delaware business trust that was formed for the
    exclusive purposes of (i) issuing Asset Preferred
    Securities and common securities, (ii) investing the gross
    proceeds of the Asset Preferred Securities in junior
    subordinated debentures of M&T and other permitted
    investments and (iii) engaging in only those other
    activities necessary or incidental thereto. M&T holds 100%
    of the common securities of Allfirst Asset Trust and Allfirst
    Capital Trust holds 100% of the Asset Preferred Securities of
    Allfirst Asset Trust. M&T currently has outstanding
    $105.3 million aggregate liquidation amount Floating Rate
    Junior Subordinated Debentures due July 15, 2029 that are
    payable to Allfirst Asset Trust. The interest rates payable on
    such debentures were 6.18% and 6.67% at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively.

Distributions on the SKATES are non-cumulative. The distribution
    rate on the SKATES and on the Floating Rate Junior Subordinated
    Debentures is a rate per annum of three-month LIBOR plus 1.50%
    and three-month LIBOR plus 1.43%, respectively, reset quarterly
    two business days prior to the distribution dates of
    January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15 in
    each year. Distributions on the SKATES will be paid if, as and
    when Allfirst Capital Trust has funds available for payment. The
    SKATES are subject to mandatory redemption if the Asset
    Preferred Securities of Allfirst Asset Trust are redeemed.
    Allfirst Asset Trust will redeem the Asset Preferred Securities
    if the junior subordinated debentures of M&T held by
    Allfirst Asset Trust are redeemed. M&T may redeem such
    junior subordinated debentures, in whole or in part, at any time
    on or after July 15, 2009, subject to regulatory approval.

    that Allfirst Capital Trust and Allfirst Asset Trust,

Stockholders’
    equity

On December 23, 2008, M&T issued 600,000 shares
    of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock,
    Series A, $1 par value and $1,000 liquidation
    preference per share (“Series A Preferred Stock”)
    and a ten-year warrant to purchase up to 1,218,522 shares
    of M&T Common Stock, $.50 par value, for
    $600 million in cash as part of the Troubled Asset Relief
    Program — Capital Purchase Program of the
    U.S. Department of Treasury
    (“U.S. Treasury”). The cash proceeds were
    allocated between the Series A Preferred Stock and the
    warrant to purchase common stock based on the relative estimated
    fair values at the date of issuance. Dividends on the
    Series A Preferred Stock, if declared, will accrue and be
    paid quarterly at a rate of 5% per year for the first five years
    and thereafter at a rate of 9% per year. The shares of
    Series A Preferred Stock have no stated maturity, do not
    have voting rights except in certain limited circumstances and
    are not subject to mandatory redemption or a sinking fund. The
    terms of the Series A Preferred Stock indicate that M&T
    cannot redeem the shares during the first three years except
    with the proceeds from a qualifying equity offering. Thereafter,
    the Series A Preferred Stock may be redeemed at liquidation
    preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends. M&T must
    provide at least 30 days and no more than 60 days
    notice to the holder of its intention to redeem the shares. In
    February 2009, legislation was signed that may result in changes
    in those terms. The Series A Preferred Stock has priority
    over M&T’s Common Stock with regard to the payment of
    dividends and liquidation distributions. The Series A
    Preferred Stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital. The strike
    price for the warrant is $73.86 per share. The agreement with
    the U.S. Treasury contains limitations on certain actions
    of M&T, including the payment of quarterly cash dividends
    on M&T’s common stock in excess of $.70 per share and
    the repurchase of its common stock during the first three years
    of the agreement. In addition, M&T agreed that, while the
    U.S. Treasury owns the Series A Preferred Stock,
    M&T’s employee benefit plans and other executive
    compensation arrangements for its senior executive officers must
    comply with Section 111(b) of the Emergency Economic
    Stabilization Act of 2008.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, there were no
    dividends declared or paid on the Series A Preferred Stock.
    Cumulative but undeclared dividends were $667,000 at
    December 31, 2008.

Stock-based
    compensation plans

The Company recognizes expense for stock-based compensation
    using the fair value method of accounting. Stock-based
    compensation expense recognized by the Company in 2008 was
    $50 million, and was $51 million in each of 2007 and
    2006. The Company recognized $11 million, $12 million
    and $13 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, of
    income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

The Company’s 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan allows for
    the issuance of various forms of stock-based compensation,
    including stock options, restricted stock and performance-based
    awards. Through December 31, 2008, only stock-based
    compensation awards, including stock options and

restricted stock, that vest with the passage of time as service
    is provided have been issued. The 2005 Incentive Compensation
    Plan allows for share grants not to exceed 6,000,000 shares
    of stock plus the shares that remained available for grant under
    a prior plan. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively,
    there were 3,108,342 and 5,685,802 shares available for
    future grant.

Stock
    option awards

Stock options issued generally vest over four years and are
    exercisable over terms not exceeding ten years and one day. In
    2005, the Company granted 125,600 options to substantially all
    employees who had not been previously receiving awards. The
    options granted under that award vested three years after grant
    date and are exercisable for a period of seven years thereafter.

The Company used an option pricing model to estimate the grant
    date present value of stock options granted. The
    weighted-average estimated grant date value per option was
    $15.85 in 2008, $28.59 in 2007 and $28.10 in 2006. The values
    were calculated using the following weighted-average
    assumptions: an option term of 6.5 years (representing the
    estimated period between grant date and exercise date based on
    historical data); a risk-free interest rate of 3.21% in 2008,
    4.79% in 2007 and 4.28% in 2006 (representing the yield on a
    U.S. Treasury security with a remaining term equal to the
    expected option term); expected volatility of 21% in each of
    2008 and 2007, and 24% in 2006 (based on historical volatility
    of M&T’s common stock price); and estimated dividend
    yields of 3.07% in 2008, 1.98% in 2007 and 1.65% in 2006
    (representing the approximate annualized cash dividend rate paid
    with respect to a share of common stock at or near the grant
    date). Based on historical data and projected employee turnover
    rates, the Company reduced the estimated value of stock options
    for purposes of recognizing stock-based compensation expense by
    7% in 2008, 2007, and 2006 to reflect the probability of
    forfeiture prior to vesting. Aggregate fair value of options
    expected to vest that were granted in 2008, 2007 and 2006 were
    $46 million, $48 million and $49 million,
    respectively.

For 2008, 2007 and 2006, M&T received $25 million,
    $66 million and $68 million, respectively, in cash and
    realized $4 million, $17 million and $27 million,
    respectively, in tax benefits from the exercise of stock
    options. The intrinsic value of stock options exercised during
    those periods was $13 million, $55 million and
    $86 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008,
    there was $39 million of total unrecognized compensation
    cost related to non-vested stock options. That cost is expected
    to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
    1.5 years. The total grant date fair value of stock options
    vested during 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $36 million,
    $39 million and $37 million, respectively. Upon the
    exercise of stock options, the Company generally issues shares
    from treasury stock to the extent available, but may also issue
    new shares.

Restricted
    stock awards

Beginning in 2007, certain eligible employees of the Company
    could elect to receive all or a portion of their stock-based
    compensation awards in the form of restricted stock rather than
    stock options. Restricted stock awards vest over four years.
    Unrecognized compensation expense associated with restricted
    shares was $1 million as of December 31, 2008 and is
    expected to be recognized over a

weighted average period of 1.7 years. The Company generally
    will issue restricted shares from treasury stock to the extent
    available, but may also issue new shares. During 2008 and 2007,
    the number of shares of restricted stock issued was 37,747 and
    15,083, respectively, with a weighted-average grant date fair
    value of $3,446,000 and $1,830,000, respectively.

Stock
    purchase plan

The stock purchase plan provides eligible employees of the
    Company with the right to purchase shares of M&T common
    stock through accumulated payroll deductions. Shares of M&T
    common stock will be issued at the end of an option period,
    typically one year or six months. In connection with the
    employee stock purchase plan, 1,000,000 shares of M&T
    common stock were authorized for issuance, of which
    395,332 shares have been issued. There were
    2,377 shares issued in 2008, no shares were issued in 2007,
    and 102,400 shares were issued in 2006. For 2008 and 2006,
    respectively, M&T received $173,000 and $10 million in
    cash for shares purchased through the employee stock purchase
    plan.

Similar to the stock option plans, the Company used an option
    pricing model to estimate the grant date present value of
    purchase rights under the stock purchase plan. The estimated
    weighted-average grant date value per right was $12.79 in 2008,
    $15.04 in 2007 and $16.43 in 2006. Such values were calculated
    using the following weighted-average assumptions: a term of six
    months to one year (representing the period between grant date
    and exercise date); a risk-free interest rate of 2.05% in 2008,
    4.39% in 2007 and 4.95% in 2006 (representing the yield on a
    U.S. Treasury security with a like term); expected
    volatility of 34% in 2008, 20% in 2007 and 14% in 2006 (based on
    historical volatility of M&T’s common stock price);
    and an estimated dividend yield of 3.84% in 2008, 2.63% in 2007
    and 1.96% in 2006 (representing the approximate annualized cash
    dividend rate paid with respect to a share of common stock at or
    near the grant date).

Deferred
    bonus plan

The Company provides a deferred bonus plan pursuant to which
    eligible employees may elect to defer all or a portion of their
    current annual incentive compensation awards and allocate such
    awards to several investment options, including M&T common
    stock. Participants could elect the timing of distributions from
    the plan. Such distributions are payable in cash with the
    exception of balances allocated to M&T common stock which
    are distributable in the form of M&T common stock. Shares
    of M&T common stock distributable pursuant to the terms of
    the deferred bonus plan were 54,782 and 56,630 at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The obligation to
    issue shares is included in “common stock issuable” in
    the consolidated balance sheet. Through December 31, 2008,
    105,486 shares have been issued in connection with the
    deferred bonus plan.

Directors’
    stock plan

The Company maintains a compensation plan for non-employee
    members of the Company’s boards of directors and directors
    advisory councils that allows such members to receive all or a
    portion of their compensation in shares of M&T common
    stock. Through December 31, 2008 110,414 shares had
    been issued in connection with the directors’ stock plan.

Through an acquisition, the Company assumed an obligation to
    issue shares of M&T common stock related to a deferred
    directors compensation plan. Shares of common stock issuable
    under such



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

plan were 23,665 and 26,282 at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The obligation to issue shares is included in
    “common stock issuable” in the consolidated balance
    sheet.

Management
    stock ownership program

Through an acquisition, M&T obtained loans that are secured
    by M&T common stock purchased by former executives of the
    acquired entity. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the loan
    amounts owed M&T were less than the fair value of the
    financed stock purchased and totaled $4 million. Such loans
    are classified as a reduction of “additional paid-in
    capital” in the consolidated balance sheet. The amounts are
    due to M&T no later than October 5, 2010.

Pension
    plans and other postretirement benefits

The Company provides pension (defined benefit and defined
    contribution plans) and other postretirement benefits (including
    defined benefit health care and life insurance plans) to

The Company has an unfunded supplemental pension plan for
    certain key executives. The projected benefit obligation and
    accumulated benefit obligation included in the preceding data
    related to such plan were $48,096,000 and $47,977,000,
    respectively, as of December 31, 2008 and $48,872,000 and
    $48,134,000, respectively, as of December 31, 2007.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit
    pension plans was $740,825,000 and $732,502,000 at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2008, all defined benefit pension plans had
    accumulated benefit obligations (including $47,977,000 related
    to the unfunded supplemental pension plan) in excess of plan
    assets. As of December 31, 2007, the accumulated benefit
    obligation and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with
    accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were
    $725,776,000 (including $48,134,000 related to the unfunded
    supplemental pension plan) and $617,811,000, respectively.

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans,” which requires an employer to recognize in its
    balance sheet as an asset or liability the overfunded or
    underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan,
    measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets
    and the benefit obligation. For a pension plan, the benefit
    obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other
    postretirement benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan,
    the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation. SFAS No. 158 requires that gains or losses
    and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period,
    but are not included as components of net periodic benefit
    expense be recognized as a component of other comprehensive
    income. As indicated in the preceding table, as of
    December 31, 2008 the Company recorded an additional
    minimum liability totaling $286,491,000 ($284,479,000 related to
    pension plans and $2,012,000 related to other postretirement
    benefits) with a corresponding reduction of stockholders’
    equity, net of applicable deferred taxes, of $174,330,000. Of
    the $284,479,000 related to pension plans, $6,693,000 was
    related to unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans. In
    aggregate, the benefit plans incurred losses during 2008 that
    resulted from actual experience differing from the assumptions
    utilized and from changes in actuarial assumptions. The main
    factor contributing to those losses was a negative return on
    assets in the qualified defined benefit pension plans of
    approximately $180 million as compared with an expected
    gain of approximately $46 million. As a result, the Company
    increased its minimum liability adjustment from that which was
    recorded at December 31, 2007 by $210,161,000 with a
    corresponding decrease to stockholders’ equity that, net of
    applicable deferred taxes, was $127,845,000. The table below
    reflects the changes in plan assets and benefit obligations
    recognized in other comprehensive income related to the
    Company’s postretirement benefit plans.

The Company was required to initially adopt the provisions of
    SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006. As of that
    date, the Company recorded an additional minimum liability
    totaling $46,334,000 ($38,582,000 related to pension plans and
    $7,752,000 related to other postretirement benefits) with a
    corresponding reduction of stockholders’ equity, net of
    applicable deferred taxes, of $28,263,000. Of the $38,582,000
    related to pension plans, $7,955,000 was related to unfunded
    nonqualified defined benefit plans. Because the recognition
    requirements of SFAS No. 158 were required to be
    applied at the end of the year of adoption, the Company had to
    first recognize the minimum liability amounts required under



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

the provisions of SFAS No. 87, “Employers’
    Accounting for Pensions.” As a result, as of
    December 31, 2006 the Company decreased its previously
    recorded minimum pension liability by $50,708,000 with a
    corresponding increase to other comprehensive income that, net
    of applicable deferred taxes, was $30,932,000. In order to
    recognize the funded status of the Company’s combined
    postretirement defined benefit plans under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 158, the Company then recorded an incremental
    minimum liability of $16,166,000 with a corresponding reduction
    of stockholders’ equity that, net of applicable deferred
    taxes, was $9,841,000. In total, the Company decreased its
    minimum liability from that which was recorded at
    December 31, 2005 by $34,542,000 with a corresponding
    increase to stockholders’ equity that, net of applicable
    deferred taxes, was $21,091,000.

The Company also provides a qualified defined contribution
    pension plan to eligible employees who were not participants in
    the defined benefit pension plan as of December 31, 2005
    and to other employees who have elected to participate in the
    defined contribution plan. The Company makes contributions to
    the defined contribution plan each year in an amount that is
    based on an individual participant’s total compensation
    (generally defined as total wages, incentive compensation,
    commissions and bonuses) and years of service. Participants do
    not contribute to the defined contribution pension plan. Pension
    expense recorded in 2008, 2007 and 2006 associated with the
    defined contribution pension plan was approximately
    $10 million, $8 million and $7 million,
    respectively.

On December 1, 2007, pension and other benefit obligations
    were assumed as a result of the acquisition of Partners Trust.
    Initial liabilities and net costs were determined using a 6.00%
    discount rate and other assumptions as noted above. Partners
    Trust had previously frozen all pension benefit accruals and
    participation in its plan.

Weighted-average pension plan asset allocations based on the
    fair value of such assets at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    and target allocations by asset category, are as follows:

In light of unsettled market conditions at December 31,
    2008, the qualified defined benefit pension plan held a larger
    portion of its assets in cash and short-term investments as
    compared with December 31, 2007 and the target allocation.
    The expected long-term rate of return assumption as of each
    measurement date was determined by taking into consideration
    asset allocations as of each such date, target allocations of
    assets, historical returns on the types of assets held and
    current economic



M&T

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

factors. The Company’s investment policy for determining
    the asset allocation targets was developed based on the desire
    to maximize total return while placing a strong emphasis on
    preservation of capital. In general, it is hoped that, in the
    aggregate, changes in the fair value of plan assets will be less
    volatile than similar changes in appropriate market indices.
    Returns on invested assets are periodically compared with target
    market indices for each asset type to aid management in
    evaluating such returns. Furthermore, management regularly
    reviews the investment policy and may, if deemed appropriate,
    make changes to the target allocations presented above.

Pension plan assets included common stock of M&T with a
    fair value of $18,826,000 (3% of total plan assets) at
    December 31, 2008 and $26,749,000 (4% of total plan assets)
    at December 31, 2007. Pension plan assets also included
    American Depositary Shares of AIB (“AIB ADSs”) with a
    fair value of $661,000 and $6,478,000 at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively (see note 24).

The Company makes contributions to its funded qualified defined
    benefit pension plans as required by government regulation or as
    deemed appropriate by management after considering factors such
    as the fair value of plan assets, expected returns on such
    assets, and the present value of benefit obligations of the
    plans. Subject to the impact of actual events and circumstances
    that may occur in 2009, the Company may make contributions to
    the qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2009, but the
    amount of any such contribution has not yet been determined. No
    minimum contribution is required in 2009 under government
    regulations for the qualified defined benefit pension plans. The
    Company contributed $140 million to the qualified defined
    benefit pension plans in 2008 and $66 million in 2007. The
    Company regularly funds the payment of benefit obligations for
    the supplemental defined benefit pension and postretirement
    benefit plans because such plans do not hold assets for
    investment. Payments made by the Company for supplemental
    pension benefits were $3,634,000 and $2,665,000 in 2008 and
    2007, respectively. Payments made by the Company for
    postretirement benefits were $7,450,000 and $6,603,000 in 2008
    and 2007, respectively. Payments for supplemental pension and
    other postretirement benefits for 2009 are not expected to
    differ from those made in 2008 by an amount that will be
    material to the Company’s consolidated financial position.

Estimated benefits expected to be paid in future years related
    to the Company’s defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement benefits plans are as follows:

For measurement of other postretirement benefits, an 8% annual
    rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care
    benefits was assumed for 2009. The rate was assumed to decrease
    gradually to 5% over 3 years and remain constant
    thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a
    significant effect on the amounts reported for health care
    plans. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost
    trend rates would have had the following effects:

the plan. The Company makes an employer matching contribution in

    Employees’ accounts, including employee contributions,
    employer matching contributions and accumulated earnings

Included above in total current income tax expense for 2008 is
    $40,028,000 of benefit from the resolution of previously
    uncertain tax positions related to the Company’s activities
    in various jurisdictions during the years

1999-2007.

The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return
    reflecting taxable income earned by all subsidiaries. In prior
    years, applicable federal tax law allowed certain financial
    institutions the option of deducting as bad debt expense for tax
    purposes amounts in excess of actual losses. In accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles, such financial
    institutions were not required to provide deferred income taxes
    on such excess. Recapture of the excess tax bad debt reserve
    established under the previously allowed method will result in
    taxable income if M&T Bank fails to maintain bank status as
    defined in the Internal Revenue Code or charges are made to the
    reserve for other than bad debt losses. At December 31,
    2008, M&T Bank’s tax bad debt reserve for which no
    federal income taxes have been provided was $79,121,000. No
    actions are planned that would cause this reserve to become
    wholly or partially taxable.

Income taxes attributable to gains or losses on bank investment
    securities were benefits of $57,859,000 and $49,308,000 in 2008
    and 2007, respectively, and an expense of $976,000 in 2006. No
    alternative minimum tax expense was recognized in 2008, 2007 or
    2006.

Total income taxes differed from the amount computed by applying
    the statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income as

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and
    penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in
    income taxes in the consolidated statement of income. The
    balance of accrued interest at December 31, 2008 is
    included in the table above. The Company’s federal, state
    and local income tax returns are routinely subject to
    examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such
    examinations may result in challenges to the tax return
    treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions.
    Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to
    record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate.
    Should determinations rendered by tax authorities ultimately
    indicate that management’s assumptions were inappropriate,
    the result and adjustments required could have a material effect
    on the Company’s results of operations. Under statute, the
    Company’s federal income tax returns for the years

2005-2007

could be adjusted by the Internal Revenue Service
    (“IRS”), although examinations for those tax years
    have been concluded. The Company is appealing the sole issue
    raised by the IRS in its examination of 2007 and would
    anticipate that any settlement or resolution within the next
    twelve months would not impact the effective tax rate. The
    Company also files income tax returns in over forty state and
    local jurisdictions. Substantially all material state and local
    matters have been concluded for years through 2001. Some tax
    returns for years after 2001 are presently under examination. It
    is not reasonably possible to estimate when any of those
    examinations will be completed or if others will be commenced.

International

The Company engages in certain international activities
    consisting largely of collecting Eurodollar deposits, engaging
    in foreign currency trading, providing credit to support the
    international activities of domestic companies and holding
    certain loans to foreign borrowers. Net assets identified with
    international activities amounted to $98,767,000 and
    $119,930,000 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Such assets included $91,472,000 and $106,816,000, respectively,
    of loans to foreign borrowers. Deposits at M&T Bank’s
    offshore branch office were $4,047,986,000 and $5,856,427,000 at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company uses
    such deposits to facilitate customer demand and as an
    alternative to short-term borrowings when the costs of such
    deposits seem reasonable.

18.

Derivative
    financial instruments

As part of managing interest rate risk, the Company enters into
    interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing
    characteristics of certain portions of the Company’s
    portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
    Interest rate swap agreements are generally entered into with
    counterparties that meet established credit standards and most
    contain master netting and collateral provisions protecting the
    at-risk party. Based on adherence to the Company’s credit
    standards and the presence of the netting and collateral
    provisions, the Company believes that the credit risk inherent
    in these contracts is not significant as of December 31,
    2008.

The Company designates interest rate swap agreements utilized in
    the management of interest rate risk as either fair value hedges
    or cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS No. 133. Fair
    value hedges are intended to protect against exposure to changes
    in the fair value of designated assets or liabilities. Cash

    rate and pays at a variable rate.

(b)

Under the terms of these
    agreements, the Company receives settlement amounts at a
    variable rate and pays at a fixed rate.

The estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements
    represents the amount the Company would have expected to receive
    (pay) to terminate such contracts. The estimated fair value of
    such swap agreements included gross unrealized gains of
    $146,111,000 and $16,513,000 at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, and gross unrealized losses of $16,694,000 at
    December 31, 2007. There were no similar unrealized losses
    at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    the estimated fair values of interest rate swap agreements
    designated as fair value hedges were substantially offset by
    unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair
    values of the hedged items. At December 31, 2008 the
    Company’s credit exposure with respect to the $146,111,000
    estimated fair value of its interest rate swap agreements used
    for managing interest rate risk has been substantially mitigated
    through master netting arrangements with trading account
    interest rate contracts with the same counterparties as well as
    counterparty postings of $75 million of cash collateral
    with the Company. The Company does not offset fair value amounts
    for interest rate swap agreements subject to master netting
    arrangements or for posted cash collateral.

In response to changes in its interest rate risk profile, during
    2008 the Company terminated interest rate swap agreements with a
    notional amount of $1.5 billion that had originally been
    entered into as cash flow hedges of variable rate long-term
    borrowings. The Company recognized a $37 million loss as a
    result of the termination. At December 31, 2008 remaining
    unamortized losses of $11 million from the termination,
    offset by $2 million of unamortized gains related to
    terminated swap agreements that had been entered into as a cash
    flow hedge in anticipation of the Company issuing a long-term
    borrowing in 2007, were reflected in “accumulated other
    comprehensive income” in the consolidated balance sheet.
    The remaining net unrealized losses will be amortized over the
    original hedge periods as an adjustment to interest expense
    associated with the previously hedged long-term borrowings.

The net effect of interest rate swap agreements was to increase
    net interest income by $15,857,000 in 2008 and to decrease net
    interest income by $2,556,000 in 2007 and $4,281,000 in 2006.
    The average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements
    impacting net interest income that were entered into for
    interest rate risk management purposes were $1,269,017,000 in
    2008, $1,410,542,000 in 2007 and $774,268,000 in 2006. The
    amount of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in 2008, 2007 and
    2006 was not material to the Company’s results of
    operations.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell residential and
    commercial real estate loans to hedge the exposure to changes in
    the fair value of real estate loans held for sale. Such
    commitments have been designated as fair value hedges. The
    Company also utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to
    offset the exposure to changes in the fair value of certain
    commitments to originate real estate loans for sale. As a result
    of these activities, net unrealized pre-tax gains related to
    hedged loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for
    sale, and commitments to sell loans were approximately
    $9 million at December 31, 2008, compared with net
    unrealized pre-tax losses of $7 million at
    December 31, 2007. Changes in unrealized gains or losses
    are included in mortgage banking revenues and, in general, are
    realized in subsequent periods as the related loans are sold and
    commitments satisfied.

Derivative financial instruments used for trading purposes
    included interest rate contracts, foreign exchange and other
    option contracts, foreign exchange forward and spot contracts,
    and financial futures. Interest rate contracts entered into for
    trading purposes had notional values and estimated fair value
    net gains of $14.6 billion and $31,559,000, respectively,
    at December 31, 2008 and notional values and estimated fair
    value net gains of $11.7 billion and $24,606,000,
    respectively, at December 31, 2007. Foreign exchange and
    other option and futures contracts totaled approximately
    $713 million and $801 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. Such contracts were valued at a net
    loss of $523,000 and a net gain of $686,000 at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. Trading account assets and

Variable
    interest entities and asset securitizations

Variable
    interest entities

Variable interest entities in which the Company holds a
    significant variable interest are described below.

M&T has a variable interest in a trust that holds AIB ADSs
    for the purpose of satisfying options to purchase such shares
    for certain employees. The trust purchased the AIB ADSs with the
    proceeds of a loan from an entity subsequently acquired by
    M&T. Proceeds from option exercises and any dividends and
    other earnings on the trust assets are used to repay the loan
    plus interest. Option holders have no preferential right with
    respect to the trust assets and the trust assets are subject to
    the claims of M&T’s creditors. The trust has been
    included in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. As a result, included in investment securities
    available for sale were 591,813 AIB ADSs with a carrying value
    of approximately $3 million at December 31, 2008,
    compared with 602,088 AIB ADSs with a carrying value of
    approximately $14 million at December 31, 2007.
    Outstanding options granted to employees who have continued
    service with M&T totaled 304,210 and 329,810 at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. All outstanding
    options were fully vested and exercisable at both
    December 31, 2008 and 2007. The options expire at various
    dates through June 2012. The AIB ADSs are included in available
    for sale investment securities and have a fair value of
    $3 million and an amortized cost of $13 million at
    December 31, 2008.

As described in note 9, M&T has issued junior
    subordinated debentures payable to the Trusts and the Allfirst
    Asset Trust and owns the common securities of those entities.
    The Trusts and the Allfirst Asset Trust are not included in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements because the
    Company is not considered to be the primary beneficiary of those
    entities. Accordingly, at December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company included the Junior Subordinated Debentures payable to
    the Trusts and the Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures
    payable to the Allfirst Asset Trust as “long-term
    borrowings” in its consolidated balance sheet. The Company
    has recognized $31 million in other assets for its
    “investment” in the common securities of the Trusts
    and Allfirst Asset Trust that will be concomitantly repaid to
    M&T by the respective trust from the proceeds of
    M&T’s repayment of the junior subordinated debentures
    associated with preferred capital securities described in
    note 9.

The Company has invested as a limited partner in various real
    estate partnerships that collectively had total assets of
    approximately $593 million and $342 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Those
    partnerships generally construct or acquire properties for which
    the investing partners are eligible to receive certain federal
    income tax credits in accordance with government guidelines.
    Such investments may also provide tax deductible losses to the
    partners. The partnership investments also assist the Company in
    achieving its community reinvestment initiatives. As a limited
    partner, there is no recourse to the Company by creditors of the
    partnerships. However, the tax credits that result from the
    Company’s investments in such partnerships are generally
    subject to recapture should a partnership fail to comply with
    the respective government regulations. The Company’s
    maximum exposure to loss of its investments in such partnerships
    was $188 million, including $64 million of unfunded
    commitments, at December 31, 2008 and $146 million,
    including $34 million of unfunded commitments, at
    December 31, 2007. Management currently estimates that no
    material losses are probable as a result of the Company’s
    involvement with such entities. In accordance with the
    accounting provisions for variable interest entities, the
    partnership entities are not included in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC was a special purpose
    subsidiary of M&T Bank formed in 2002 for the purpose of
    borrowing $500 million in a revolving asset-backed
    structured borrowing with an unaffiliated conduit lender. In the
    fourth quarter of 2008, the borrowing was paid in full. The
    revolving asset-backed structured borrowing was secured by
    automobile loans and other assets transferred to the special
    purpose subsidiary by M&T Bank or other of its subsidiaries
    that totaled $557 million at December 31, 2007. The
    activities of M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC were
    generally restricted to purchasing and owning automobile loans
    for the purpose of securing this revolving borrowing
    arrangement. The assets and liabilities of M&T Auto
    Receivables I, LLC were included in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007.

Securitizations

In 2008 and 2007, the Company securitized approximately
    $875 million and $948 million, respectively, of

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans in guaranteed mortgage
    securitizations with Fannie Mae. The Company recognized no gain
    or loss on the transactions as it retained all of the resulting
    securities. Such securities were classified as investment
    securities available for sale. The Company expects no material
    credit-related losses on the retained securities as a result of
    the guarantees by Fannie Mae.

In prior years, the Company transferred approximately
    $1.9 billion of

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans to qualified special purpose
    trusts in non-recourse securitization transactions. In exchange
    for the loans, the Company received cash, no more than 88% of
    the resulting securities, and the servicing rights to the loans.
    All of the retained securities were classified as investment
    securities available for sale. The qualified special purpose
    trusts are not included in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements. Because the transactions were
    non-recourse, the Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a
    result of its association with the trusts is limited to
    realizing the carrying value of the retained securities and
    servicing rights. The combined outstanding principal amount of
    mortgage-backed securities issued by the qualified special
    purpose trusts was $540 million at December 31, 2008
    and $631 million at December 31, 2007. The principal
    amount of such securities held by the Company was
    $460 million and $539 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. At each of December 31, 2008
    and 2007, loans of the trusts that were 30 or more days
    delinquent totaled $15 million. Credit losses, net of
    recoveries, for the trusts in 2008 and 2007 were insignificant.
    There were no significant repurchases of delinquent or
    foreclosed loans from the trusts by the Company in 2008 or 2007.
    The Company has not provided financial or other support to the
    trusts during 2008 or 2007 that was not contractually required.
    Certain cash flows between the Company and the trusts were as
    follows:

A summary of the fair values of retained subordinated interests
    resulting from the Company’s residential mortgage loan
    securitization activities follows. Although the estimated fair
    values of the retained subordinated interests were obtained from
    independent pricing sources, the Company has modeled the
    sensitivity of such fair values to changes in certain
    assumptions as summarized in the table below. These calculated
    sensitivities are hypothetical and actual changes in the fair
    value may differ significantly from the amounts presented
    herein. The effect of a variation in a particular assumption on
    the fair values is calculated without changing any other
    assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in
    changes in another which may magnify or counteract the
    sensitivities. The changes in assumptions are presumed to be
    instantaneous. The hypothetical effect of adverse changes on the
    Company’s retained capitalized servicing assets at
    December 31, 2008 is included in note 7.

Fair
    value of financial instruments

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” for
    fair value measurements of certain of its financial instruments.
    The provisions of SFAS No. 157 that pertain to
    measurement of non-financial assets and liabilities have been
    deferred by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) until 2009.

The provisions of SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value
    Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,”
    which permit an entity to choose to measure eligible financial
    instruments and other items at fair value, also became effective
    January 1, 2008. The Company has not made any fair value
    elections under SFAS No. 159 as of December 31,
    2008.

The definition of fair value is clarified by
    SFAS No. 157 to be the price that would be received to
    sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
    SFAS No. 157 established a three-level hierarchy for
    fair value measurements based upon the inputs to the valuation
    of an asset or liability.

•

Level 1 — Valuation is based on quoted prices in
    active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

•

Level 2 — Valuation is determined from quoted
    prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,
    quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets
    that are not active or by model-based techniques in which all
    significant inputs are observable in the market.

•

Level 3 — Valuation is derived from model-based
    techniques in which at least one significant input is
    unobservable and based on the Company’s own estimates about
    the assumptions that market participants would use to value the
    asset or liability.

When available, the Company attempts to use quoted market prices
    in active markets to determine fair value and classifies such
    items as Level 1 or Level 2. If quoted market prices
    in active markets are not available, fair value is often
    determined using model-based techniques incorporating various
    assumptions including interest rates, prepayment speeds and
    credit losses. Assets and liabilities valued using model-based
    techniques are classified as either Level 2 or
    Level 3, depending on the lowest level classification of an
    input that is considered significant to the overall valuation.
    The following is a description of the valuation methodologies
    used for the Company’s assets and liabilities that are
    measured on a recurring basis at estimated fair value.

Trading
    account assets and liabilities

Trading account assets and liabilities consist primarily of
    interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts
    with customers who require such services with offsetting trading
    positions with third parties to minimize the Company’s risk
    with respect to such transactions. The Company generally
    determines the fair value of its derivative trading account
    assets and liabilities using externally developed pricing models
    based on market observable inputs and therefore classifies such
    valuations as Level 2. Prices for certain foreign exchange
    contracts are more observable and therefore have been classified
    as Level 1. Mutual funds held in connection with deferred
    compensation arrangements have also been classified as
    Level 1 valuations. Valuations of investments in municipal
    and other bonds can generally be obtained through reference to
    quoted prices in less active markets for the same or similar
    securities or through model-based techniques in which all
    significant inputs are observable and, therefore, such
    valuations have been classified as Level 2.

Investment
    securities available for sale

The majority of the Company’s

available-for-sale

investment securities have been valued by reference to prices
    for similar securities or through model-based techniques in
    which all significant inputs are observable and, therefore, such
    valuations have been classified as Level 2. Certain
    investments in mutual funds and equity securities are actively
    traded and therefore have been classified as Level 1
    valuations. Due to the severe disruption in the credit markets
    during the second half of 2008, trading activity in privately
    issued mortgage-backed securities was very limited. The markets
    for such securities were generally characterized by a sharp
    reduction to total cessation of non-agency mortgage-backed
    securities issuances, a significant reduction in trading volumes
    and extremely wide bid-ask spreads, all driven by



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

the lack of market participants. Although estimated prices were
    generally obtained for such securities, the Company was
    significantly restricted in the level of market observable
    assumptions used in the valuation of its privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Specifically, market
    assumptions regarding credit adjusted cash flows and liquidity
    influences on discount rates were difficult to observe at the
    individual bond level. Because of the inactivity in the markets
    and the lack of observable valuation inputs, the Company
    transferred $2.2 billion of its privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities portfolio from Level 2 to
    Level 3 valuations during the quarter ended
    September 30, 2008. Offsetting this transfer-in to
    Level 3, were certain privately issued mortgage-backed
    securities securitized by Bayview Financial with a fair value of
    $298 million that were transferred from the Company’s

available-for-sale

portfolio to its

held-to-maturity

portfolio during the quarter ended September 30, 2008, and
    thus are no longer measured at fair value. The aforementioned
    disruption in the credit markets persisted during the fourth
    quarter of 2008, causing the Company to again classify the
    valuation of its privately issued mortgage-backed securities
    portfolio as Level 3 at December 31, 2008. To
    supplement its determination of fair value for privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities the Company obtained pricing
    indications from two independent sources at December 31,
    2008. To assess the reasonableness of the valuations received
    from independent parties, the Company also performed internal
    modeling to estimate the cash flows and fair value of many of
    its privately issued mortgage-backed securities at
    December 31, 2008. The Company’s internal modeling
    techniques included discounting estimated bond-specific cash
    flows using assumptions of loan level cash flows, including
    estimates about the timing and amount of credit losses and
    prepayments. In valuing investment securities at
    December 31, 2008, the Company considered the results of
    its modeling and the values provided by the independent parties,
    but generally used an average of the estimated fair values
    obtained from the two independent parties for most of its
    privately issued mortgage-backed securities. Privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities constituted $2.4 billion of the
    $2.5 billion of available for sale investment securities
    classified as Level 3 valuations as of December 31,
    2008.

Real
    estate loans held for sale

The Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to
    hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of real estate loans
    held for sale. The carrying value of hedged real estate loans
    held for sale includes changes in estimated fair value during
    the hedge period, typically from the date of close through the
    sale date. Most of the Company’s real estate loans held for
    sale have generally been hedged since the origination date. The
    fair value of hedged real estate loans held for sale is
    generally calculated by reference to quoted prices in secondary
    markets for commitments to sell real estate loans with similar
    characteristics and, as such, have been classified as a
    Level 2 valuation.

Commitments
    to originate real estate loans for sale and commitments to sell
    real estate loans

The Company enters into various commitments to originate real
    estate loans for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans.
    Such commitments are considered to be derivative financial
    instruments and, therefore, are carried at estimated fair value
    on the consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair values of
    such commitments were generally calculated by reference to
    quoted prices in secondary markets for commitments to sell real
    estate loans to certain government-sponsored entities and other
    parties. The fair valuations of commitments to sell real estate
    loans generally result in a Level 2 classification. The
    estimated fair value of commitments to originate real estate
    loans for sale are oftentimes adjusted to reflect the
    Company’s anticipated commitment expirations. Estimated
    commitment expirations are considered a significant unobservable
    input, which results in a Level 3 classification.
    Additionally, during the first quarter of 2008 the Company
    adopted the provisions of SAB No. 109 for written loan
    commitments issued or modified after January 1, 2008.
    SAB No. 109 reversed previous conclusions expressed by
    the SEC staff regarding written loan commitments that are
    accounted for at fair value through earnings. Specifically, the
    SEC staff now believes that the expected net future cash flows
    related to the associated servicing of the loan should be
    included in the fair value measurement of the derivative loan
    commitment. In accordance with SAB No. 105, the
    Company had not included such amount in the value of commitments
    to originate real estate loans for sale at December 31,
    2007. The estimated value



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

ascribed to the expected net future servicing cash flows is also
    considered a significant unobservable input contributing to the
    Level 3 classification of commitments to originate real
    estate loans for sale.

Interest
    rate swap agreements used for interest rate risk
    management

The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of
    the management of interest rate risk to modify the repricing
    characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Company generally
    determines the fair value of its interest rate swap agreements
    using externally developed pricing models based on market
    observable inputs and therefore classifies such valuations as
    Level 2. The Company has considered counterparty credit
    risk in the valuation of its interest rate swap assets and has
    considered its own credit risk in the valuation of its interest
    rate swap liabilities.

A summary of assets and liabilities at December 31, 2008

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

The Company is required, on a nonrecurring basis, to adjust the
    carrying value of certain assets or provide valuation allowances
    related to certain assets using fair value measurements in
    accordance with GAAP.

Loans

Loans are generally not recorded at fair value on a recurring
    basis. Periodically, the Company records nonrecurring
    adjustments to the carrying value of loans based on fair value
    measurements for partial charge-offs of the uncollectible
    portions of those loans. Nonrecurring adjustments also include
    certain impairment amounts for collateral-dependent loans
    calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 114 when
    establishing the allowance for credit losses. Such amounts are
    generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral
    supporting the loan and, as a result, the carrying value of the
    loan less the calculated valuation amount does not necessarily
    represent the fair value of the loan. Real estate collateral is
    typically valued using appraisals or other indications of value
    based on recent comparable sales of similar properties or
    assumptions generally observable in the marketplace and the
    related nonrecurring fair value measurement adjustments have
    generally been classified as Level 2. Estimates of fair
    value used for other collateral supporting commercial loans
    generally are based on assumptions not observable in the
    marketplace and therefore such valuations have been classified
    as Level 3. Loans subject to nonrecurring fair value
    measurement were $420 million at December 31, 2008,
    $238 million and $182 million of which were classified
    as Level 2 and Level 3, respectively. Changes in fair
    value recognized for partial charge-offs of loans and loan
    impairment reserves on loans held by the Company on
    December 31, 2008 were decreases of $166 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008.

Capitalized
    servicing rights

Capitalized servicing rights are initially measured at fair
    value in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The
    Company utilizes the amortization method to subsequently measure
    its capitalized servicing assets. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of
    Financial Assets — an amendment to FASB Statement
    No. 140,” the Company must record impairment charges,
    on a nonrecurring basis, when the carrying value of certain
    strata exceed their estimated fair value. To estimate the fair
    value of servicing rights, the Company considers market prices
    for similar assets and the present value of expected future cash
    flows associated with the servicing rights calculated using
    assumptions that market participants would use in estimating
    future servicing income and expense. Such assumptions include
    estimates of the cost of servicing loans, loan default rates, an
    appropriate discount rate, and prepayment speeds. For purposes
    of evaluating and measuring impairment of capitalized servicing
    rights, the Company stratifies such assets based on the
    predominant risk characteristics of the underlying financial
    instruments that are expected to have the most impact on
    projected prepayments, cost of servicing and other factors
    affecting future cash flows associated with the servicing
    rights. Such factors may include financial asset or loan type,
    note rate and term. The amount of impairment recognized is the
    amount by which the carrying value of the capitalized servicing
    rights for a stratum exceed estimated fair value. Impairment is
    recognized through a valuation allowance. The determination of
    fair value of capitalized servicing rights is considered a
    Level 3 valuation. At December 31, 2008,
    $50 million of capitalized servicing rights had a carrying
    value equal to their fair value. Changes in fair value of
    capitalized servicing rights recognized for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 were a decrease of $16 million.

Disclosures
    of fair value of financial instruments

SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of
    Financial Instruments,” requires disclosure of the
    estimated fair value of financial instruments. With the
    exception of marketable securities, certain off-balance sheet
    financial instruments and

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans originated for sale, the
    Company’s financial instruments are not readily marketable
    and market prices do not exist. The Company, in attempting to
    comply with the provisions of SFAS No. 107, has not
    attempted to market its financial instruments to potential
    buyers, if any exist. Since negotiated prices in illiquid
    markets depend greatly upon the then present motivations of the
    buyer and seller, it is reasonable to assume that actual sales
    prices could vary widely from any estimate of fair value made
    without the benefit of negotiations. Additionally, changes in
    market interest rates can dramatically impact the value of
    financial instruments

The following assumptions and methods or calculations were used
    in determining the estimated fair value of financial instruments
    not measured at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet.

Cash
    and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits at banks,
    short-term borrowings, accrued interest receivable and accrued
    interest payable

Due to the nature of cash and cash equivalents and the near
    maturity of interest-bearing deposits at banks, short-term
    borrowings, accrued interest receivable and accrued interest
    payable, the Company estimated that the carrying amount of such
    instruments approximated estimated fair value.



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

Agreements
    to resell securities

The amounts assigned to agreements to resell securities were
    based on discounted calculations of projected cash flows.

Investment
    securities

Estimated fair values of investments in readily marketable
    securities were generally based on quoted market prices.
    Investment securities that were not readily marketable were
    assigned amounts based on estimates provided by outside parties
    or modeling techniques that relied upon discounted calculations
    of projected cash flows or, in the case of other investment
    securities, which include capital stock of the Federal Reserve
    Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, at
    an amount equal to the carrying amount.

Loans
    and leases

In general, discount rates used to calculate values for loan
    products were based on the Company’s pricing at the
    respective year end and included appropriate adjustments for
    expected credit losses. A higher discount rate was assumed with
    respect to estimated cash flows associated with nonaccrual
    loans. Projected loan cash flows were adjusted for estimated
    credit losses. However, such estimates made by the Company may
    not be indicative of assumptions and adjustments that a
    purchaser of the Company’s loans and leases would seek.

Deposits

SFAS No. 107 requires that the estimated fair value
    ascribed to noninterest-bearing deposits, savings deposits and
    NOW accounts be established at carrying value because of the
    customers’ ability to withdraw funds immediately. Time
    deposit accounts are required to be revalued based upon
    prevailing market interest rates for similar maturity
    instruments. As a result, amounts assigned to time deposits were
    based on discounted cash flow calculations using prevailing
    market interest rates based on the Company’s pricing at the
    respective year end for deposits with comparable remaining terms
    to maturity.

The Company believes that deposit accounts have a value greater
    than that prescribed by SFAS No. 107. The Company
    feels, however, that the value associated with these deposits is
    greatly influenced by characteristics of the buyer, such as the
    ability to reduce the costs of servicing the deposits and
    deposit attrition which often occurs following an acquisition.
    Accordingly, estimating the fair value of deposits with any
    degree of certainty is not practical.

Long-term
    borrowings

The amounts assigned to long-term borrowings were based on
    quoted market prices, when available, or were based on
    discounted cash flow calculations using prevailing market
    interest rates for borrowings of similar terms and credit risk.

Commitments
    to originate real estate loans for sale and commitments to sell
    real estate loans

The Company enters into various commitments to originate real
    estate loans for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans.
    Such commitments are considered to be derivative financial
    instruments and, therefore, are carried at estimated fair value
    on the consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair values of
    such commitments were generally calculated by reference to
    quoted market prices for commitments to sell real estate loans
    to certain government-sponsored entities and other parties.

Interest
    rate swap agreements used for interest rate risk
    management

The estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements used
    for interest rate risk management represents the amount the
    Company would have expected to receive or pay to terminate such
    agreements.

Other
    commitments and contingencies

As described in note 21, in the normal course of business,
    various commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding,
    such as loan commitments, credit guarantees and letters of
    credit. The Company’s



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

pricing of such financial instruments is based largely on credit
    quality and relationship, probability of funding and other
    requirements. Loan commitments often have fixed expiration dates
    and contain termination and other clauses which provide for
    relief from funding in the event of significant deterioration in
    the credit quality of the customer. The rates and terms of the
    Company’s loan commitments, credit guarantees and letters
    of credit are competitive with other financial institutions
    operating in markets served by the Company. The Company believes
    that the carrying amounts, which are included in other
    liabilities, are reasonable estimates of the fair value of these
    financial instruments.

The Company does not believe that the estimated information
    presented herein is representative of the earnings power or
    value of the Company. The preceding analysis, which is
    inherently limited in depicting fair value, also does not
    consider any value associated with existing customer
    relationships nor the ability of the Company to create value
    through loan origination, deposit gathering or fee generating
    activities.

Many of the estimates presented herein are based upon the use of
    highly subjective information and assumptions and, accordingly,
    the results may not be precise. Management believes that fair
    value estimates may not be comparable between financial
    institutions due to the wide range of permitted valuation
    techniques and numerous estimates which must be made.
    Furthermore, because the disclosed fair value amounts were
    estimated as of the balance sheet date, the amounts actually
    realized or paid upon maturity or settlement of the various
    financial instruments could be significantly different.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to
    customers, generally having fixed expiration dates or other
    termination clauses that may require payment of a fee. Standby
    and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments
    issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third
    party. Standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon
    the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of
    the underlying contract with the third party, whereas commercial
    letters of credit are issued to facilitate commerce and
    typically result in the commitment being funded when the
    underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and
    third party. The credit risk associated with commitments to
    extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit is
    essentially the same as that involved with extending loans to
    customers and is subject to normal credit policies. Collateral
    may be obtained based on management’s assessment of the
    customer’s creditworthiness.

Financial guarantees and indemnification contracts are
    oftentimes similar to standby letters of credit and include
    mandatory purchase agreements issued to ensure that customer
    obligations are fulfilled, recourse obligations associated with
    sold loans, and other guarantees of customer performance or
    compliance with designated rules and regulations. Included in
    financial guarantees and



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

indemnification contracts are loan principal amounts sold with
    recourse in conjunction with the Company’s involvement in
    the Fannie Mae DUS program. Under this program, the
    Company’s maximum credit risk associated with loans sold
    with recourse at December 31, 2008 and 2007 totaled
    $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.

Since many loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and
    guarantees and indemnification contracts expire without being
    funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not
    necessarily indicative of future cash flows.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to
    hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of real estate loans
    held for sale. Such commitments are considered derivatives in
    accordance with SFAS No. 133 and along with
    commitments to originate real estate loans to be held for sale
    are generally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at
    estimated fair market value. Until January 1, 2008, in
    estimating that fair value for commitments to originate loans
    for sale, value ascribable to cash flows to be realized in
    connection with loan servicing activities was not included.
    Value ascribable to that portion of cash flows was recognized at
    the time the underlying mortgage loans were sold. Effective
    January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of
    SAB No. 109 issued by the SEC, which reversed previous
    conclusions expressed by the SEC staff regarding written loan
    commitments that are accounted for at fair value through
    earnings. Specifically, the SEC staff now believes that the
    expected net future cash flows related to the associated
    servicing of the loan should be included in the fair value
    measurement of the derivative loan commitment. In accordance
    with SAB No. 105 the Company had not included such
    amount in the value of loan commitments accounted for as
    derivatives at December 31, 2007. As a result of the
    Company’s adoption of required changes in accounting
    pronouncements on January 1, 2008, there was an
    acceleration of the recognition of mortgage banking revenues of
    approximately $9 million in 2008. If not for the changes in
    accounting pronouncements, those revenues would have been
    recognized later in 2009 when the underlying loans were sold.
    Additional information about such derivative financial
    instruments is included in note 18.

The Company occupies certain banking offices and uses certain
    equipment under noncancellable operating lease agreements
    expiring at various dates over the next 30 years. Minimum
    lease payments under noncancellable operating leases are

The Company has an agreement with the Baltimore Ravens of the
    National Football League whereby the Company obtained the naming
    rights to a football stadium in Baltimore, Maryland through
    2017. Under the agreement, the Company is obligated to pay
    $5 million per year through 2013 and $6 million per
    year from 2014 through 2017.

The Company reinsures credit life and accident and health
    insurance purchased by consumer loan customers. The Company also
    enters into reinsurance contracts with third party insurance
    companies who insure against the risk of a mortgage
    borrower’s payment default in connection with certain
    mortgage loans originated by the Company. When providing
    reinsurance coverage, the Company receives a premium in exchange
    for accepting a portion of the insurer’s risk of loss. The
    outstanding loan principal balances reinsured by the Company
    were approximately $105 million at December 31, 2008.
    Assets of subsidiaries providing reinsurance that are available
    to satisfy claims totaled approximately $64 million at
    December 31, 2008. The amounts noted above are not
    necessarily indicative of losses which may ultimately be
    incurred. Such losses are expected to be substantially less
    because most loans are

repaid by borrowers in accordance with the original loan terms.
    The amount of the Company’s recorded liability for reported
    reinsurance losses as well as estimated losses incurred but not
    yet reported was not significant at either December 31,
    2008 or December 31, 2007.

In October 2007, Visa completed a reorganization in
    contemplation of its initial public offering (“IPO”)
    expected to occur in 2008. As part of that reorganization,
    M&T Bank and other member banks of Visa received shares of
    Class B common stock of Visa. Those banks are also
    obligated under various agreements with Visa to share in losses
    stemming from certain litigation involving Visa (“Covered
    Litigation”). As of December 31, 2007, although Visa
    was expected to set aside a portion of the proceeds from its IPO
    in an escrow account to fund any judgments or settlements that
    may arise out of the Covered Litigation, guidance from the SEC
    indicated that Visa member banks should record a liability for
    the fair value of the contingent obligation to Visa. The
    estimation of the Company’s proportionate share of any
    potential losses related to the Covered Litigation was extremely
    difficult and involved a great deal of judgment. Nevertheless,
    in the fourth quarter of 2007 the Company recorded a pre-tax
    charge of $23 million ($14 million after tax effect)
    related to the Covered Litigation. In accordance with GAAP and
    consistent with the SEC guidance, the Company did not recognize
    any value for its common stock ownership interest in Visa as of
    December 31, 2007. During the first quarter of 2008, Visa
    completed its IPO and, as part of the transaction, funded an
    escrow account for $3 billion from the proceeds of the IPO
    to cover potential settlements arising out of the Covered
    Litigation. As a result, during the first three months of 2008,
    the Company reversed approximately $15 million of the
    $23 million accrued during the fourth quarter of 2007 for
    the Covered Litigation. The initial accrual in 2007 and the
    partial reversal in 2008 were included in “other costs of
    operations” in the consolidated statement of income. In
    addition, M&T Bank was allocated 1,967,028 Class B
    common shares of Visa. Of those shares, 760,455 were mandatorily
    redeemed in March 2008 resulting in a pre-tax gain of
    $33 million ($20 million after tax) which has been
    included in “gain on bank investment securities” in
    the consolidated statement of income. During the fourth quarter
    of 2008, Visa announced that it had settled an additional
    portion of the Covered Litigation and that it would further fund
    the escrow account to provide for that settlement. As noted
    above, the Company had previously recorded a reserve for the
    estimated fair value of its obligation to indemnify Visa for the
    Covered Litigation. Management believes that the terms of the
    recent settlement and the funding of the escrow account did not
    result in a material impact to the Company’s consolidated
    financial position or results of operations.

M&T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course
    of business to various pending and threatened legal proceedings
    in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. Management,
    after consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that
    the aggregate ultimate liability arising out of litigation
    pending against M&T or its subsidiaries will be material to
    the Company’s consolidated financial position, but at the
    present time is not in a position to determine whether such
    litigation will have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s consolidated results of operations in any future
    reporting period.

Segment
    information

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131,
    “Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
    Information,” reportable segments have been determined
    based upon the Company’s internal profitability reporting
    system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain
    strategic business units have been combined for segment
    information reporting purposes where the nature of the products
    and services, the type of customer and the distribution of those
    products and services are similar. The reportable segments are
    Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate,
    Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail
    Banking.

The financial information of the Company’s segments has
    been compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in
    note 1 with certain exceptions. The more significant of
    these exceptions are described herein. The Company allocates
    interest income or interest expense using a methodology that
    charges users of funds (assets) interest expense and credits
    providers of funds (liabilities) with income based on the
    maturity, prepayment

and/or

repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities. The net
    effect of this allocation is recorded in the “All
    Other” category. A provision for credit losses is allocated
    to segments in an amount based largely on actual net charge-offs
    incurred by the segment during the

period plus or minus an amount necessary to adjust the
    segment’s allowance for credit losses due to changes in
    loan balances. In contrast, the level of the consolidated
    provision for credit losses is determined using the
    methodologies described in note 1 to assess the overall
    adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Indirect fixed and
    variable expenses incurred by certain centralized support areas
    are allocated to segments based on actual usage (for example,
    volume measurements) and other criteria. Certain types of
    administrative expenses and bankwide expense accruals (including
    amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets
    associated with acquisitions of financial institutions) are
    generally not allocated to segments. Income taxes are allocated
    to segments based on the Company’s marginal statutory tax
    rate adjusted for any tax-exempt income or non-deductible
    expenses. Equity is allocated to the segments based on
    regulatory capital requirements and in proportion to an
    assessment of the inherent risks associated with the business of
    the segment (including interest, credit and operating risk).

The management accounting policies and processes utilized in
    compiling segment financial information are highly subjective
    and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative
    guidance similar to generally accepted accounting principles. As
    a result, reported segment results are not necessarily
    comparable with similar information reported by other financial
    institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or
    allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in
    reported segment financial data. Information about the
    Company’s segments is presented in the accompanying table.
    Income statement amounts are in thousands of dollars. Balance
    sheet amounts are in millions of dollars.

(a)

Net interest income is the
    difference between actual taxable-equivalent interest earned on
    assets and interest paid on liabilities by a segment and a
    funding charge (credit) based on the Company’s internal
    funds transfer pricing methodology. Segments are charged a cost
    to fund any assets (e.g. loans) and are paid a funding credit
    for any funds provided (e.g. deposits). The taxable-equivalent
    adjustment aggregated $21,861,000 in 2008,



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

The Business Banking segment provides deposit, lending, cash
    management and other financial services to small businesses and
    professionals through the Company’s banking office network
    and several other delivery channels, including business banking
    centers, telephone banking, Internet banking and automated
    teller machines. The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide
    range of credit products and banking services to middle-market
    and large commercial customers, mainly within the markets the
    Company serves. Among the services provided by this segment are
    commercial lending and leasing, letters of credit, deposit
    products and cash management services. The Commercial Real
    Estate segment provides credit services which are secured by
    various types of multifamily residential and commercial real
    estate and deposit services to its customers. Activities of this
    segment include the origination, sales and servicing of
    commercial real estate loans. The Discretionary Portfolio
    segment includes securities, residential mortgage loans and
    other assets; short-term and long-term borrowed funds; brokered
    certificates of deposit and interest rate swap agreements
    related thereto; and offshore branch deposits. This segment also
    provides foreign exchange services to customers. The Residential
    Mortgage Banking segment originates and services residential
    mortgage loans for consumers and sells substantially all of
    those loans in the secondary market to investors or to the
    Discretionary Portfolio segment. The segment periodically
    purchases servicing rights to loans that have been originated by
    other entities. This segment also originates and services loans
    to developers of residential real estate properties. Residential
    mortgage loans held for sale are included in the Residential
    Mortgage Banking segment. The Retail Banking segment offers a
    variety of services to consumers through several delivery
    channels that include banking offices, automated teller
    machines, telephone banking and Internet banking. The “All
    Other” category includes other operating activities of the
    Company that are not directly attributable to the reported
    segments as determined in accordance with
    SFAS No. 131, the difference between the provision for
    credit losses and the calculated provision allocated to the
    reportable segments; goodwill and core deposit and other
    intangible assets resulting from acquisitions of financial
    institutions; merger-related expenses resulting from
    acquisitions; the net impact of the Company’s internal
    funds transfer pricing methodology; eliminations of transactions
    between reportable segments; certain nonrecurring transactions;
    the residual effects of unallocated support systems and general
    and administrative expenses; and the impact of interest rate
    risk management strategies. The amount of intersegment activity
    eliminated in arriving at consolidated totals was included in
    the “All Other” category as follows:

Regulatory
    matters

Payment of dividends by M&T’s banking subsidiaries is
    restricted by various legal and regulatory limitations.
    Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T are limited by
    the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current
    year and the preceding two years. For purposes of this test, at
    December 31, 2008, approximately $832,303,000 was available
    for payment of dividends to M&T from banking subsidiaries
    without prior regulatory approval.

Banking regulations prohibit extensions of credit by the
    subsidiary banks to M&T unless appropriately secured by
    assets. Securities of affiliates are not eligible as collateral
    for this purpose.

The bank subsidiaries are required to maintain
    noninterest-earning reserves against certain deposit
    liabilities. During the maintenance periods that included
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, cash and due from banks
    included a daily average of $183,088,000 and $228,290,000,
    respectively, for such purpose.

Federal regulators have adopted capital adequacy guidelines for
    bank holding companies and banks. Failure to meet minimum
    capital requirements can result in certain mandatory, and
    possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that,
    if undertaken, could have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial statements. Under the capital adequacy
    guidelines, the so-called “Tier 1 capital” and
    “Total capital” as a percentage of risk-weighted
    assets and certain off-balance sheet financial instruments must
    be at least 4% and 8%, respectively. In addition to these
    risk-based measures, regulators also require banking
    institutions that meet certain qualitative criteria to maintain
    a minimum “leverage” ratio of “Tier 1
    capital” to average total assets, adjusted for goodwill and
    certain other items, of at least 3% to be considered adequately
    capitalized. As of December 31, 2008, M&T and each of
    its banking subsidiaries exceeded all applicable capital
    adequacy requirements. To be considered “well
    capitalized,” under the regulatory framework for prompt
    corrective action, a banking institution must maintain
    Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and
    leverage ratios of at least 6%, 10% and 5%, respectively.

Relationship
    of M&T and AIB

AIB received 26,700,000 shares of M&T common stock on
    April 1, 2003 as a result of M&T’s acquisition of
    a subsidiary of AIB on that date. Those shares of common stock
    owned by AIB represented 24.2% of the issued and outstanding
    shares of M&T common stock on December 31, 2008. While
    AIB maintains a significant ownership in M&T, the Agreement
    and Plan of Reorganization between M&T and AIB
    (“Reorganization Agreement”) includes several
    provisions related to the corporate governance of M&T that
    provide AIB with representation on the M&T and M&T
    Bank boards of directors and key board committees and certain
    protections of its rights as a substantial M&T shareholder.
    In addition, AIB has rights that will facilitate its ability to
    maintain its proportionate ownership position in M&T.

With respect to AIB’s right to have representation on the
    M&T and M&T Bank boards of directors and key board
    committees, for as long as AIB holds at least 15% of
    M&T’s outstanding common stock, AIB is entitled to
    designate four individuals, reasonably acceptable to M&T,
    on both the M&T and M&T Bank boards of directors. In
    addition, one of the AIB designees to the M&T board of
    directors will serve



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

on each of the Executive; Nomination, Compensation and
    Governance; and Audit and Risk committees. Also, as long as AIB
    holds at least 15% of M&T’s outstanding common stock,
    neither the M&T nor the M&T Bank board of directors
    may consist of more than 28 directors without the consent
    of the M&T directors designated by AIB. AIB will continue
    to enjoy these rights if its holdings of M&T common stock
    drop below 15%, but not below 12%, so long as AIB restores its
    ownership percentage to 15% within one year. In the event that
    AIB holds at least 10%, but less than 15%, of M&T’s
    outstanding common stock, AIB will be entitled to designate at
    least two individuals on both the M&T and M&T Bank
    boards of directors and, in the event that AIB holds at least
    5%, but less than 10%, of M&T’s outstanding common
    stock, AIB will be entitled to designate one individual on both
    the M&T and M&T Bank boards of directors. M&T
    also has the right to appoint one representative to the AIB
    board while AIB remains a significant shareholder.

There are several other corporate governance provisions that
    serve to protect AIB’s rights as a substantial M&T
    shareholder and are embodied in M&T’s certificate of
    incorporation and bylaws. These protections include an effective
    consent right in connection with certain actions by M&T,
    such as amending M&T’s certificate of incorporation or
    bylaws in a manner inconsistent with AIB’s rights, engaging
    in activities not permissible for a bank holding company or
    adopting any shareholder rights plan or other measures intended
    to prevent or delay any transaction involving a change in
    control of M&T. AIB has the right to limit, with the
    agreement of at least one non-AIB designee on the M&T board
    of directors, other actions by M&T, such as reducing
    M&T’s cash dividend policy such that the ratio of cash
    dividends to net income is less than 15%, acquisitions and
    dispositions of significant amounts of assets, and the
    appointment or election of the chairman of the board of
    directors or the chief executive officer of M&T. The
    protective provisions described above will cease to be
    applicable when AIB no longer owns at least 15% of
    M&T’s outstanding common stock, calculated as
    described in the Reorganization Agreement.

25.  Relationship
    with Bayview Lending Group LLC and Bayview Financial Holdings,
    L.P.

On February 5, 2007 M&T invested $300 million to
    acquire a minority interest in Bayview Lending Group LLC
    (“BLG”), a privately-held commercial mortgage lender
    that specializes in originating, securitizing and servicing
    small balance commercial real estate loans. M&T recognizes
    income from BLG using the equity method of accounting.

Bayview Financial Holdings, L.P. (together with its affiliates,
    “Bayview Financial”), a privately-held specialty
    mortgage finance company, is BLG’s majority investor. In
    addition to their common investment in BLG, the Company and
    Bayview Financial conduct other business activities with each
    other. The Company has purchased loan servicing rights for small
    balance commercial mortgage loans from BLG and Bayview Financial
    having outstanding principal balances of $5.9 billion and
    $4.9 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Amounts recorded as capitalized servicing assets
    for such loans totaled $58 million at December 31,
    2008 and $57 million at December 31, 2007. In
    addition, capitalized servicing rights at December 31, 2008
    and 2007 also included $28 million and $40 million,
    respectively, for servicing rights that were purchased from
    Bayview Financial related to residential mortgage loans with
    outstanding principal balances of $4.6 billion at each of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007. Revenues from servicing
    residential and small balance commercial mortgage loans
    purchased from BLG and Bayview Financial were $54 million,
    $48 million and $38 million during 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. M&T Bank provided $71 million of
    credit facilities to Bayview Financial at December 31, 2008
    of which $57 million was outstanding. There were no
    outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2007. Finally, at
    December 31, 2008 the Company held $412 million and
    $32 million of collateralized mortgage obligations in its

held-to-maturity

and

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolios, respectively, that were
    securitized by Bayview Financial. During the third quarter of
