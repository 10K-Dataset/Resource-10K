PART I

Item 1.

Business.

M&T Bank Corporation (“Registrant” or “M&T”) is a New York business corporation which is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”) and under Article 
III-A of the New York Banking Law (“Banking Law”). The
principal executive offices of the Registrant are located at One M&T Plaza, Buffalo, New York 14203. The Registrant was incorporated in November 1969. The Registrant and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as
the “Company.” As of
December 31, 2000 the Company had consolidated total assets of $28.9 billion, deposits of $20.2 billion and stockholders’ equity of
$2.7 billion. The Company had 7,616 full-time and 1,120 part-time employees as of December 31, 2000.

At December 31, 2000, the Registrant had two wholly owned bank subsidiaries: Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T Bank”) and M&T Bank, National Association (“M&T Bank, N.A.”). The banks collectively offer
a wide range of commercial banking, trust and investment
services to their customers. At December 31, 2000, M&T Bank represented 97% of consolidated assets of the Company.

On February 9, 2001, M&T completed the merger of Premier National Bancorp, Inc. (“Premier”), a bank holding company headquartered in Lagrangeville, New York, with and into Olympia Financial Corp. (“Olympia”), a wholly
owned subsidiary of M&T. Following the merger,
Premier National Bank, Premier’s bank subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank. Premier National Bank operated
34 banking offices in the mid-Hudson Valley region of New York State. At December 31, 2000, Premier had approximately $1.6 billion of assets, including $1.0 billion of loans, and approximately $1.4 billion of liabilities, including
$1.3 billion of deposits. The
transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operations acquired from Premier will be included in M&T’s financial results subsequent to the acquisition date. Premier’s stockholders received
approximately $171 million in cash
and 2,441,000 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for the Premier shares outstanding at the time of the acquisition.

On October 6, 2000, M&T completed the merger of Keystone Financial, Inc. (“Keystone”), a bank holding company headquartered in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Keystone Financial Bank, N.A., Keystone’s bank subsidiary, was merged into
M&T Bank. Keystone Financial Bank, N.A.
operated banking offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia. The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operations acquired from Keystone have been included in M&T’s financial
results since the
acquisition date. Keystone’s stockholders received
$375 million in cash and 15,900,292 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for the Keystone shares outstanding at the time of acquisition. Assets acquired totaled approximately $7.4 billion and included loans and leases of $4.8 billion
and investment securities of $1.2
billion. Liabilities assumed on October 6 were approximately $6.4 billion and included $5.2 billion of deposits. In connection with the Keystone transaction, the Company recorded approximately $615 million of goodwill and core deposit
intangible.

On March 1, 2000, M&T Bank completed the acquisition of Matthews, Bartlett & Dedecker, Inc. (“MBD”), an insurance agency located in Buffalo, New York. MBD provides insurance services principally to the commercial market and
operates as a subsidiary of M&T Bank. The
acquisition of MBD has not had a material impact on the Company’s financial position or its results of operations.

On March 31, 2000, The Chase Manhattan Bank (“Chase”) transferred trust and fiduciary accounts with assets of approximately $147 million to M&T Bank,

-5-


completing a transaction that began in September 1999 with M&T Bank’s acquisition from Chase of 29 branch offices in upstate New York and the investment management and custody accounts associated with those offices.
At the time of closing in September 1999, the branches had approximately
$634 million of deposits and approximately $44 million of retail installment and commercial loans, and the investment management and custody accounts had assets of approximately $286 million.

The Company from time to time considers acquiring banks, thrift institutions, branch offices or other businesses within markets currently served or in other nearby markets. The Company has pursued acquisition opportunities in the past, continues to
review different
opportunities, including the possibility of major acquisitions, and intends to continue this practice.

Segment Information, Principal Products/Services

and Foreign Operations

Information about the Registrant’s business segments is included in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and is further discussed in Part II,
Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. The Company’s international activities are discussed in note 15 of Notes to Financial Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

The Registrant’s reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting
purposes where the
nature of the products and services, the type of customer and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Commercial Banking,
Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking
and Retail Banking.

The only activities that, as a class, contributed 10% or more of the sum of consolidated interest income and other income in each of the last three years were lending and investment securities transactions. The amount of income from such sources
during those years is set
forth on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Supervision and Regulation of the Company

The banking industry is subject to extensive state and federal regulation and continues to undergo significant change. The following discussion summarizes certain aspects of the banking laws and regulations that affect the Company. Proposals to change
the laws and
regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised in Congress, in state legislatures, and before the various bank regulatory agencies. The likelihood and timing of any changes and the impact such changes might have on the Company are
impossible to
determine with any certainty. A change in applicable laws or regulations, or a change in the way such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material impact on the business, operations and earnings of the
Company. To the extent
that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified entirely by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provision.

Financial Services Modernization

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“Gramm-Leach”) enables combinations among banks, securities firms and insurance companies. Under Gramm-Leach, bank holding companies are permitted to offer their customers virtually any type of financial
service that is financial in
nature or incidental thereto,
including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both underwriting and

-9-


agency), and merchant banking.

In order to engage in these new financial activities, a bank holding company must qualify and register with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve Board”) as a “financial holding company” by
demonstrating that each of its bank subsidiaries
is “well capitalized,” “well managed,” and has at least a “satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”).

The financial activities authorized by Gramm-Leach may also be engaged in by a “financial subsidiary” of a national or state bank, except for insurance or annuity underwriting, insurance company portfolio investments, real estate investment
and development, and merchant
banking, which must be conducted in a financial holding company. In order for these financial activities to be engaged in by a financial subsidiary of a national or state bank, Gramm-Leach requires each of the parent bank (and its sister-bank affiliates)
to be well
capitalized and well managed; the aggregate consolidated assets of all of that bank’s financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of its consolidated total assets or $50 billion; the bank must have at least a satisfactory CRA rating;
 and, if that bank is one
of the 100 largest national banks, it must meet certain financial rating or other comparable requirements.

Gramm-Leach also establishes a system of functional regulation, under which the federal banking agencies will regulate the banking activities of financial holding companies and banks’ financial subsidiaries, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission will regulate their
securities activities, and state insurance regulators will regulate their insurance activities. Gramm-Leach also provides new protections against the transfer and use by financial institutions of consumers’ nonpublic, personal information.

The foregoing discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
statutory provisions of Gramm-Leach and the implementing regulations which have been or will be adopted by various government agencies pursuant to Gramm-Leach.

Bank Holding Company Regulation

As a registered bank holding company, the Registrant and its nonbank subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation under the BHCA by the Federal Reserve Board and the New York State Banking Superintendent (“Banking Superintendent”).
The Federal Reserve Board
requires regular reports from the Registrant and is authorized by the BHCA to make regular examinations of the Registrant and its subsidiaries.

Although it meets the qualifications for electing to become a financial holding company, the Registrant has elected to retain its pre-Gramm-Leach status for the present time under the BHCA. The Registrant may not acquire direct or indirect ownership
or control of more
than 5% of the voting shares of any company, including a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, except as specifically authorized under the BHCA. The Registrant is also subject to regulation under the Banking Law with respect to
certain
acquisitions of domestic banks. Under the BHCA, the Registrant, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, may acquire shares of non-banking corporations the activities of which are deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related
to banking or
managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.

The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries, among other things, to interdict activities that represent unsafe or unsound practices or constitute violations of law, rule, regulation,
administrative orders
or written

-10-


agreements with a federal bank regulator. These powers may be exercised
through the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, civil money penalties or other actions.

Under the Federal Reserve Board’s statement of policy with respect to bank holding company operations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit all
available resources to support
such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy. Although this “source of strength” policy has been challenged in litigation, the Federal Reserve Board continues to take the position that it has authority to
enforce it. For a discussion of
circumstances under which a bank holding company may be required to guarantee the capital levels or performance of its subsidiary banks,

see Capital Adequacy

, below. The Federal Reserve also has the authority to terminate any activity of a bank
holding company that
constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or stability of any
subsidiary depository institution or to terminate its control of any bank or nonbank subsidiaries.

The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended (the “Interstate Banking Act”) generally permits bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, and preempts all state laws restricting the ownership
by a bank holding company of
banks in more than one state. The Interstate Banking Act also permits a bank to merge with an out-of-state bank and convert any offices into branches of the resulting bank if both states have not opted out of interstate branching; permits a bank to
acquire branches from
an out-of-state bank if the law of the state where the branches are located permits the interstate branch acquisition; and permits banks to establish and operate

de novo

interstate branches whenever the host state opts-in to

de novo

branching. Bank holding companies and
banks seeking to engage in transactions authorized by the Interstate Banking Act must be adequately capitalized and managed.

The Banking Law authorizes interstate branching by merger or acquisition on a reciprocal basis, and permits the acquisition of a single branch without restriction, but does not provide for

de novo

interstate branching.

Bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks are also subject to the provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of the CRA, the Federal Reserve Board (or other appropriate bank regulatory agency) is required, in connection with its examination of a
bank, to assess such
bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Furthermore, such assessment is also required of any bank that has applied, among other things, to merge or
consolidate with or acquire the
assets or assume the liabilities of a federally-regulated financial institution, or to open or relocate a branch office. In the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or bank holding company, the Federal Reserve Board will
assess the
record of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding company in considering the application. The Banking Law contains provisions similar to the CRA which are applicable to New York-chartered banks.

Supervision and Regulation of Bank Subsidiaries

The Registrant’s banking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation, and are examined regularly, by various bank regulatory agencies: M&T Bank by the Federal Reserve Board and the Banking Superintendent; and M&T Bank, N.A. by
the Comptroller of the Currency
(“OCC”). The Registrant and its direct non-banking subsidiaries are affiliates, within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, of the Registrant’s subsidiary banks and their subsidiaries. As a result, the Registrant’s subsidiary banks
and their subsidiaries are subject
to restrictions on loans or extensions of credit to,

-11-


purchases of assets from, investments in, and transactions with the Registrant and its direct non-banking subsidiaries and on certain other transactions with them or involving their securities. Gramm-Leach places
similar restrictions on the Registrant’s subsidiary banks making loans or extending credit to, purchasing assets from, investing in, or entering into transactions with, their financial subsidiaries, although the Registrant’s subsidiary banks
have not yet commenced any
activities through financial subsidiaries.

Under the “cross-guarantee” provisions of the FDI Act, insured depository institutions under common control are required to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered by either the BIF or SAIF of the FDIC as a result of the default of a
commonly controlled insured
depository institution or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default. Thus, any insured depository institution subsidiary of M&T could incur liability to the FDIC in the event
of a default of
another insured depository institution owned or controlled by M&T. The FDIC’s claim under the cross-guarantee provisions is superior to claims of stockholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company and to most claims
arising out of obligations or
liabilities owed to affiliates of the institution, but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured depository institution. The FDIC may decline
to enforce the cross-guarantee provisions if it determines that a waiver is in the best interest of the BIF or SAIF or both.

Dividends from Bank Subsidiaries

M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. are subject, under one or more of the banking laws, to restrictions on the amount and frequency (no more often than quarterly) of dividend declarations. Future dividend payments to the Registrant by its subsidiary
banks will be dependent on a
number of factors, including the earnings and financial condition of each such bank, and are subject to the limitations referred to in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data,” and to other statutory powers of bank regulatory agencies.

An insured depository institution is prohibited from making any capital distribution to its owner, including any dividend, if, after making such distribution, the depository institution fails to meet the required minimum
level for any relevant capital measure, including the risk-based capital adequacy and leverage standards discussed below.

Capital Adequacy

The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC have adopted risk-based capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies and banks under their supervision. Under these guidelines, the so-called “Tier 1 capital” and “Total
capital” as a percentage of risk-weighted
assets and certain off-balance sheet instruments must be at least 4% and 8%, respectively.

The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC have also imposed a leverage standard to supplement their risk-based ratios. This leverage standard focuses on a banking institution’s ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets, adjusted for
goodwill and certain other
items. Under these guidelines, banking institutions that meet certain criteria, including excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low interest rate exposure and good earnings, and that have received the highest regulatory rating must maintain a ratio of
Tier 1 capital
to total adjusted average assets of at least 3%. Institutions not meeting these criteria, as well as institutions with supervisory, financial or operational weaknesses, along with those

-12-


experiencing or anticipating significant growth are expected to maintain a
Tier 1 capital to total adjusted average assets ratio equal to at least 4%
to 5%.

As reflected in the following table, the risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios of the Registrant, M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. as of December 31, 2000 exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as “well
capitalized,” the highest classification under the regulatory capital guidelines.

Capital Components and Ratios at December 31, 2000

(dollars in millions)

The federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC, maintain risk-based capital standards in order to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk and the risk of
nontraditional
activities, as well as reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on certain multifamily housing loans. Bank regulators periodically propose amendments to the risk-based capital guidelines and related regulatory framework. While the
Company’s management
studies such proposals, the timing of adoption, ultimate form and effect of any such proposed amendments on the Company’s capital requirements and operations cannot be predicted.

The federal banking agencies are required to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions and their bank holding companies that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA established five capital tiers: “
well capitalized”, “adequately
capitalized”, “undercapitalized”,
“significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized”. A depository institution’s capital tier, or that of its bank holding company, depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital
measures, including a risk-based capital
measure and a leverage ratio capital measure, and certain other factors.

Under the implementing regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies, a bank holding company or bank is considered “well capitalized” if it has (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based
capital ratio of 6% or greater, (iii) a
leverage ratio of 5% or greater and (iv) is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An “adequately capitalized” bank holding company or bank is defined as one
that has (i) a total risk-based
capital ratio of 8% or greater, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4% or greater and (iii) a leverage ratio of 4% or greater (or 3% or greater in the case of a bank with a composite CAMELS rating of 1). A bank holding company or bank is
considered (A)
“undercapitalized” if it has (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based

-13-


capital ratio of less than 4% or (iii) a leverage ratio of less than 4% (or 3% in the case of a bank with a composite CAMELS rating of 1);
(B) “significantly undercapitalized” if the bank has (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, or (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3% or (iii) a leverage ratio of less than 3% and (C)“
critically undercapitalized” if the bank has a ratio of
tangible equity to total assets equal to or less than 2%. The Federal Reserve Board may reclassify a “well capitalized” bank holding company or bank as “adequately capitalized” or subject an “adequately capitalized” or “
undercapitalized” institution to the supervisory
actions applicable to the next lower capital category if it determines that the bank holding company or bank is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the bank holding company or bank to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice and not to have
corrected the
deficiency. M&T, Olympia, M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. currently meet the definition of “well capitalized” institutions.

“Undercapitalized” depository institutions, among other things, are subject to growth limitations, are prohibited, with certain exceptions, from making capital distributions, are limited in their ability to obtain funding from a Federal
Reserve Bank and are required to
submit a capital restoration plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s
capital. In
addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan and provide appropriate assurances of performance. If a
depository
institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, including if the holding company refuses or is unable to make the guarantee described in the previous sentence, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized”. Failure to submit or
implement an acceptable
capital plan also is grounds for the appointment of a conservator or a receiver. “Significantly undercapitalized” depository institutions may be subject to a number of additional requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell
sufficient voting stock to become
adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Moreover, the parent holding company of a significantly undercapitalized depository institution may be ordered to divest itself of
the institution
or of nonbank subsidiaries of the holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions, among other things, are prohibited from making any payments of principal and interest on subordinated debt, and are subject to the appointment of a
receiver or conservator.

Each federal banking agency prescribes standards for depository institutions and depository institution holding companies relating to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest
rate exposure, asset
growth, compensation, a maximum ratio of classified assets to capital, minimum earnings sufficient to absorb losses, a minimum ratio of market value to book value for publicly traded shares and other standards as they deem appropriate. The Federal
Reserve Board and OCC
have adopted such standards.

Depository institutions that are not “well capitalized” or “adequately capitalized” and have not received a waiver from the FDIC are prohibited from accepting or renewing brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2000, M&T
Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. had approximately $528
million and $3 million of brokered deposits, respectively.

Although M&T has issued shares of common stock in connection with acquisitions or at other times, the Company has generally maintained capital ratios in excess of minimum regulatory guidelines largely through internal capital generation (i.e. net
income less dividends
paid). Historically, M&T’s dividend payout ratio and dividend yield, when compared with other bank

-14-


holding companies, has been relatively low, thereby allowing for capital retention to support growth or to facilitate purchases of M&T’s common stock to be held as treasury
stock. Management’s policy of reinvestment of earnings and repurchase of shares of common stock is intended to enhance M&T’s earnings per share prospects and thereby reward stockholders over time with capital gains in the form of increased
stock price rather than high
dividend income.

FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments

As institutions with deposits insured by the BIF and the SAIF, M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. Under current law the regular insurance assessments to be paid by BIF-insured and SAIF-insured
institutions are specified in
schedules issued by the FDIC that specify, at semiannual intervals, target reserve ratios designed to maintain the reserve ratios of each of those insurance funds at 1.25% of their estimated insured deposits. The FDIC is also authorized to impose one or
more special
assessments.

The FDIC has implemented a risk-based deposit premium assessment system under which each depository institution is placed in one of nine assessment categories based on the institution’s capital classification under the prompt corrective action
provisions described above,
and whether such institution is considered by its supervisory agency to be financially sound or to have supervisory concerns. The adjusted assessment rates for both BIF-insured and SAIF-insured institutions under the current system range from .00% to
 .27% depending upon
the assessment category into which the insured institution is placed. Neither of the Company’s banking subsidiaries paid regular insurance assessments to the FDIC in 2000. However, the FDIC retains the ability to increase regular BIF and SAIF
assessments and to levy
special additional assessments.

In addition to deposit insurance fund assessments, beginning in 1997 the FDIC assessed BIF-assessable and SAIF-assessable deposits to fund the repayment of debt obligations of the Financing Corporation (“FICO”). FICO is a government
agency-sponsored entity that was
formed to borrow the money necessary to carry out the closing and ultimate disposition of failed thrift institutions by the Resolution Trust Corporation. The current annualized rates established by the FDIC for both BIF-assessable and SAIF-assessable
deposits are 1.96
basis points (hundredths of one percent).

Any significant increases in assessment rates or additional special assessments by the FDIC could have an adverse impact on the results of operations and capital of M&T Bank or M&T Bank, N.A.

Governmental Policies

The earnings of the Company are significantly affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these
objectives are
open-market operations in U.S. Government securities and Federal funds, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These instruments of monetary policy are used in varying
combinations to
influence the overall level of bank loans, investments and deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits. The Federal Reserve Board frequently uses these instruments of monetary policy, especially its open-market operations and
the discount
rate, to influence the level of interest rates and to affect the strength of the economy, the level of inflation or the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on
the operating
results of banking institutions in the past and are expected

-15-


to continue to do so in the future. It is not possible to predict the nature of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies, or the effect which they may have on the Company’s business and earnings.

Competition

The Company competes in offering commercial and personal financial services with other banking institutions and with firms in a number of other industries, such as thrift institutions, credit unions, personal loan companies, sales finance companies,
leasing companies,
securities firms and insurance companies. Furthermore, diversified financial services companies are able to offer a combination of these services to their customers on a nationwide basis. The Company’s operations are significantly impacted by state
and federal
regulations applicable to the banking industry. Moreover, the provisions of Gramm-Leach may increase competition among diversified financial services providers, and the Interstate Banking Act and the Banking Law may further ease entry into New York State
by out-of-state
banking institutions. As a result, the number of financial services providers and banking institutions with which the Company competes may grow in the future.

Other Legislative Initiatives

Proposals may be introduced in the United States Congress and in the New York State Legislature and before various bank regulatory authorities which would alter the powers of, and restrictions on, different types of banking organizations and which
would restructure part
or all of the existing regulatory framework for banks, bank holding companies and other providers of financial services. Moreover, other bills may be introduced in Congress which would further regulate, deregulate or restructure the financial services
industry. It is
not possible to predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted into law or, even if enacted, the effect which they may have on the Company’s business and earnings.

PART II

Corporate Profile and Significant Developments

M&T Bank Corporation (“M&T”) is a bank holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York with consolidated assets of $28.9 billion at December 31, 2000. M&T and its consolidated subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to
collectively as “the Company.” M&T’s wholly owned
banking subsidiaries are Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T Bank”) and M&T Bank, National Association (“M&T Bank, N.A.”).

M&T Bank, with total assets of $28.0 billion at December 31, 2000, is
a New York-chartered commercial bank with banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia, and an office in Nassau, The Bahamas. M&T Bank and its subsidiaries offer a broad range of financial services to a diverse base of
consumers,
businesses, professional clients, governmental entities and financial institutions located in its markets. Lending is largely focused on consumers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, and on small and medium size businesses based in those areas.
Certain lending
activities are also conducted in other states through various subsidiaries. M&T Bank’s subsidiaries include: Highland Lease Corporation, a consumer leasing company; M&T Credit Corporation, a consumer lending and commercial leasing and
lending company; M&T Financial
Corporation, a commercial leasing company; M&T Mortgage Corporation, a residential mortgage banking company; M&T Real Estate, Inc., a commercial mortgage lender; M&T Securities, Inc., a broker/dealer; and Matthews, Bartlett & Dedecker,
Inc., an insurance agency.

M&T Bank, N.A., with total assets of $903 million at December 31, 2000, is a national bank with an office in Oakfield, New York. M&T Bank, N.A. offers selected deposit and loan products on a
nationwide basis, largely through telephone and direct mail marketing
techniques. Insurance products are offered by M&T Bank, N.A. through banking offices of M&T Bank.

On February 9, 2001, M&T acquired Premier National Bancorp, Inc. (“Premier”), a bank holding company headquartered in Lagrangeville, New York. Premier National Bank, Premier’s bank
subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank on that date. Premier National Bank operated
34 banking offices in the mid-Hudson Valley region of New York State. At December 31, 2000, Premier had approximately $1.6 billion of assets, including $1.0 billion of loans, and
$1.4 billion of liabilities, including $1.3 billion of deposits. The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operations acquired from Premier will be included in M&T’s financial
results subsequent to the
acquisition date. Premier’s stockholders received $171 million in cash and 2,441,000 shares of M&T common

-24-


stock in exchange for the Premier shares outstanding at the time of the acquisition.

On October 6, 2000, M&T completed the acquisition of Keystone Financial, Inc. (“Keystone”), a bank holding company headquartered in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Keystone Financial Bank, N.A.,
Keystone’s bank subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank. Keystone Financial
Bank, N.A. operated banking offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia. The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operations acquired from Keystone have been included in M&T’s
financial results since the
acquisition date. Keystone’s stockholders received $375 million in cash and 15,900,292 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for the Keystone shares outstanding at the time of the acquisition. The accompanying table provides a summary of
assets acquired and
liabilities assumed by the Company on October 6, 2000 in connection with the Keystone transaction:

The Company recorded approximately $615 million of goodwill and core deposit intangible as a result of the Keystone acquisition, and incurred nonrecurring expenses related to systems conversions and other costs
of integrating and conforming the acquired operations
with and into the operations of M&T Bank. Nonrecurring expenses associated with the Keystone merger, and to a significantly lesser extent with the Premier merger, totaled approximately $26.0 million ($16.4 million after-tax) during the year
ended December 31, 2000. Such
expenses consisted largely of expenses for professional services and other temporary help fees associated with the conversion of systems and/or integration of operations; recruiting and other incentive compensation; initial marketing and promotion
expenses designed to
introduce M&T Bank to Keystone’s customers; travel; and printing, supplies and other costs of commencing operations in new markets. Although the systems conversions and integration of operations of Keystone are largely complete, the Company
expects that it will incur
some additional Keystone integration costs. However, the amount of such additional costs is not expected to be significant. Furthermore, the Company also expects to incur costs of a nature similar to those described above in connection with the
February 2001 merger with
Premier. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, included in the determination of goodwill associated with the Keystone merger were charges totaling $29.7 million, net of applicable income taxes, for severance of former Keystone
employees; investment
banking, legal and other professional fees; and termination of Keystone contracts for data processing and other services. As of December 31, 2000, the remaining unpaid portion of merger-related expenses and charges included in the determination of
goodwill were $1.5
million and $7.3 million,

-25-


respectively. The resolution of any preacquisition contingencies is not expected to have a material impact on the allocation of the purchase price or the amount of goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition.

In anticipation of the Keystone and Premier acquisitions, M&T Bank issued $500 million of 8% fixed rate subordinated capital notes on October 5, 2000. The subordinated notes are included in total
regulatory capital of M&T and M&T Bank. The notes pay interest
semi-annually on April 1 and October 1, and will mature on October 1, 2010. In addition to providing regulatory capital, the proceeds were used to fund the cash portions of the Keystone and Premier merger consideration.

On September 19, 2000, M&T’s Board of Directors authorized a ten-for-one split of M&T’s common stock in connection with the Keystone transaction. The additional shares were payable to
stockholders of record as of September 29 and were distributed on October 5,
2000. The par value of each share of M&T’s common stock was reduced from $5.00 to $.50 in conjunction with the stock split. All per share data presented herein, including earnings, dividends and the number of common shares authorized, issued,
issuable or held in
treasury, have been adjusted to reflect the ten-for-one stock split. Also in connection with the Keystone transaction, in the fourth quarter of 2000 M&T doubled the quarterly cash dividend payable on its common stock to $.25 on each post-split share.

On March 1, 2000, M&T Bank completed the acquisition of Matthews, Bartlett & Dedecker, Inc. (“MBD”), an insurance agency located in Buffalo, New York. MBD provides insurance services
principally to the commercial market and operates as a subsidiary of M&T Bank.
The acquisition has not had a material impact on the Company’s financial position or its results of operations.

On March 31, 2000, The Chase Manhattan Bank (“Chase”) transferred trust and fiduciary accounts with assets of approximately $147 million to M&T Bank, completing a transaction that began in
September 1999 with M&T Bank’s acquisition from Chase of 29 banking offices
in upstate New York and the investment management and custody accounts associated with those offices. At the September 1999 closing, the banking offices had approximately $634 million of deposits and approximately $44 million of retail
installment and commercial loans,
and the investment management and custody accounts had assets of approximately $286 million.

On June 1, 1999, M&T completed the acquisition of FNB Rochester Corp. (“FNB”), a bank holding company headquartered in Rochester, New York. Immediately after the acquisition, FNB’s banking
subsidiary, First National Bank of Rochester, which had 17 banking offices
in western and central New York State, was merged into M&T Bank. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the results of operations obtained from FNB have been included in the financial results of
the Company since the
acquisition date. FNB’s stockholders received $76 million in cash and 1,225,160 shares (stated to reflect the ten-for-one stock split) of M&T common stock in exchange for FNB shares outstanding at the time of the acquisition. Assets
acquired totaled approximately $676
million on June 1, 1999 and included loans and leases of $393 million and investment securities of $148 million. Liabilities assumed on June 1, 1999 were approximately $541 million and included $511 million of deposits.

The Company recorded approximately $153 million of goodwill and core deposit intangible in connection with the Chase branch and FNB acquisitions. Nonrecurring expenses related to systems conversions and other
costs of integrating and conforming the acquired
operations with and into M&T Bank totaled $4.7 million ($3.0 million after-tax) during the year ended December 31, 1999 and consisted largely of expenses similar in nature to those

-26-


previously described as having been incurred in connection with the Keystone merger. In
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, included in the determination of goodwill were charges totaling $4.1 million, net of applicable income taxes, for severance of former Chase and FNB employees; legal and other professional
fees; and termination of
contracts for data processing and other services. As of December 31, 1999, the remaining unpaid portion of merger-related expenses and charges included in the determination of goodwill were $130 thousand and $960 thousand, respectively.
Substantially all of these
amounts were paid during 2000.

Overview

The Company’s net income in 2000 totaled $286.2 million or $3.44 of diluted earnings per common share, increases of 8% and 5%, respectively, from $265.6 million or $3.28 per diluted share in 1999. Basic earnings per common share rose to
$3.55 in 2000, an increase of 4%
from $3.41 in 1999. Net income in 1998 was $208.0 million, while diluted and basic earnings per share were $2.62 and $2.73, respectively. The after-tax impact of nonrecurring expenses associated with the previously described acquisitions was
$16.4 million ($26.0 million
pre-tax) or $.20 of diluted and basic earnings per share in 2000, compared with $3.0 million ($4.7 million pre-tax) or $.03 of diluted earnings per share and $.04 of basic earnings per share in 1999. Nonrecurring merger-related expenses were
incurred in 1998 in
connection with the acquisition of ONBANCorp, Inc. (“ONBANCorp”) on April 1, 1998. The after-tax impact of such expenses was $14.0 million ($21.3 million pre-tax) or $.18 of diluted and basic earnings per share in 1998.

Net income expressed as a rate of return on average assets in 2000 was 1.21%, compared with 1.26% in 1999 and 1.14% in 1998. The return on average common stockholders’ equity was 14.07% in 2000, 15.30% in 1999
and 13.86% in 1998. Excluding the impact of
merger-related expenses, the rates of return on average assets and average common equity in 2000 were 1.28% and 14.88%, respectively; compared with 1.28% and 15.47%, respectively, in 1999; and 1.21% and 14.79%, respectively, in 1998.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 13% to $865 million in 2000 from $767 million in 1999 largely due to a $2.4 billion or 13% rise in average earning assets to $21.5 billion in 2000
from $19.1 billion in 1999. The increase in average earning assets
resulted primarily from growth in average loans and leases. Despite the impact of the securitization of approximately $1.0 billion of residential mortgage loans during the second quarter of 2000, average loans and leases rose to $18.5 billion
in 2000, an increase of $2.1
billion or 13% from $16.4 billion in 1999. Excluding the impact of the securitization, average loans and leases grew approximately $2.7 billion in 2000, approximately half of which was due to new originations, net of repayments. The remaining
increase was largely the
result of the $4.8 billion of loans and leases obtained in the acquisition of Keystone on October 6, 2000. A 15% increase in average loans outstanding in 1999 was the most significant factor contributing to the rise in that year’s net
interest income from $679 million in
1998. Average loans and leases and average earning assets in 1998 were $14.3 billion and $16.9 billion, respectively. Net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets, has
remained stable throughout the
past three years, measuring 4.02% in 2000 and 1999, and 4.01% in 1998.

Reflecting favorable credit loss experience, the provision for credit losses decreased to $38.0 million in 2000, compared with $44.5 million in 1999 and $43.2 million in 1998. Net charge-offs totaled
$29.0 million in 2000, significantly lower than $40.3 million
in 1999 and $39.4 million in 1998. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases

-27-


outstanding declined to .16% in 2000 from .25% in 1999 and .28% in 1998.

Noninterest income grew by 15% to $325 million in 2000 from $282 million in 1999. Contributing to the higher noninterest income were increases in service charges on deposit accounts, income from leasing
activities, and brokerage services income, partially offset
by lower mortgage banking revenues and losses from sales of bank investment securities. Approximately 40% of the increase in noninterest income from 1999 to 2000 was attributable to revenues related to operations and/or market areas associated with the
Keystone
acquisition.

In January 1998, M&T contributed appreciated investment securities with a fair value of $24.6 million to an affiliated, tax-exempt private charitable foundation. As a result of the contribution, in
1998 the Company recognized charitable contributions expense of
$24.6 million and recognized tax-exempt other income of $15.3 million. The contribution provided an income tax benefit of approximately $10.0 million and, accordingly, resulted in an after-tax increase in 1998’s net income of $700
thousand, or $.01 per diluted share.
Excluding the effect of this contribution, noninterest income in 1999 increased 14% from $248 million in 1998. Growth in mortgage banking revenues and fees earned from deposit services, as well as a full year of revenues associated with operations
obtained in the
ONBANCorp acquisition, were factors that contributed to the increase from 1998 to 1999.

Noninterest expenses associated with operations, which exclude amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible and certain nonrecurring expenses, were $599 million in 2000, an increase of 14% from
$525 million in 1999. The excluded items consist of
nonrecurring merger-related expenses of
$26.0 million and $4.7 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively, and amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible of $69.6 million in 2000 and $49.7 million in 1999. Higher salaries and employee benefits expenses, including
merit salary increases, incentive-based
compensation arrangements, and increased staffing levels as a result of acquisitions in 2000 and 1999, contributed to the increase in noninterest operating expenses. After excluding $21.3 million of nonrecurring merger-related expenses, $34.5 
million of amortization of
goodwill and core deposit intangible, and $24.6 million of expense related to the contribution to the affiliated charitable foundation, noninterest expenses associated with operations totaled $486 million in 1998. Higher expenses related to
salaries, employee benefits
and occupancy contributed to the higher expense level in 1999 compared with 1998.

The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income, measures how much of a company’s revenue is consumed by operating
expenses. Reflecting the smooth integration of the
acquisitions into M&T, the efficiency ratio, calculated using the adjusted income and expense totals noted above and excluding gains or losses from sales of bank investment securities from noninterest income, was 50.2% in 2000, compared with 50.1% in
1999 and 52.5% in
1998.

Cash Operating Results

Unlike many other banking companies, M&T has accounted for substantially all of its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. As a result, the Company had recorded intangible assets consisting predominately of goodwill and
core deposit intangible
totaling $1.2 billion, $648 million and $546 million at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Included in such intangible assets at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was goodwill of $1.0 billion, $572 million
and $493 million, respectively. Since the
amortization of these acquired intangible assets does not result in a cash expense, M&T believes that supplemental reporting of its operating results on

-28-


a “cash,” or “tangible” basis (which excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of goodwill and core deposit
intangible and the related asset balances) represents a relevant measure of financial performance. The supplemental cash basis data presented herein do not exclude the effect of other non-cash operating expenses such as depreciation, provision for credit
losses, or
deferred income taxes associated with the results of operations. Unless noted otherwise, cash basis data does, however, exclude the after-tax impact of nonrecurring merger-related expenses associated with acquisitions.

Cash net income grew to $358.6 million in 2000, an improvement of 15% from $311.0 million in 1999. Diluted and basic cash earnings per share in 2000 both increased by 12% to $4.31 and $4.45, respectively,
from $3.84 and $3.99 in 1999. In 1998, cash net income
was $251.9 million, while diluted and basic cash earnings per share were $3.17 and $3.31, respectively.

Cash return on average tangible assets was 1.56% in 2000, compared with 1.52% in 1999 and 1.41% in 1998. Cash return on average tangible common equity was 27.65% in 2000, compared with 26.71% and 23.08% in 1999 and
1998, respectively. Including the effect of
merger-related expenses, the cash return on average tangible assets for 2000, 1999 and 1998 was 1.49%, 1.50% and 1.33%, respectively, and the cash return on average tangible common equity was 26.38%, 26.45% and 21.80%, respectively.

Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities

Net interest income expressed on a taxable-equivalent basis rose 13% to $865 million in 2000 from $767 million in 1999, largely the result of growth in average earning assets, which increased $2.4 billion or 13% to $21.5 billion in
2000 from $19.1 billion in 1999.
Taxable-equivalent net interest income and average earning assets in 1998 were $679 million and $16.9 billion, respectively. The growth in average earning assets in 2000 and 1999 was largely attributable to higher average loans and leases
outstanding, which totaled $18.5
billion in 2000, up 13% from $16.4 billion in 1999 and 30% higher than $14.3 billion in 1998. Growth in average loans and leases resulting from origination and acquisition activities was partially offset in 2000 by the impact of the
securitization of approximately $1.0
billion of residential mortgage loans during the second quarter. The resulting mortgage-backed securities, which are fully guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association, are included in the Company’s portfolio of available-for-sale
investment securities.
Excluding the impact of the securitization, average loans and leases grew by approximately $2.7 billion, or 17%, from 1999 to 2000. Approximately half of such growth was attributable to new originations, net of the impact of repayments. The
remaining increase was
largely the result of the $4.8 billion of loans obtained in the October 6, 2000 acquisition of Keystone. Those acquired loans included approximately $1.2 billion of commercial loans, $1.3 billion of commercial real estate loans,
$1.1 billion of residential mortgage loans
and $1.2 billion of consumer loans and leases. In addition to net origination activities, the impact of the $393 million of loans obtained in June 1999 from the FNB transaction and the full-year impact of the $3.0 billion of loans
acquired in the April 1998 ONBANCorp
transaction contributed to the higher average loan balances in 1999 compared with 1998. The accompanying table 4 summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in 2000 and percentage changes in the major components of the portfolio over the past two
years.

Loans secured by real estate, including home equity loans and outstanding home equity lines of credit which the Company classifies as consumer loans, represented approximately 65% of the loan and lease portfolio
during 2000, compared with 66% in 1999 and 1998. At
December 31, 2000, the Company held approximately $8.7 billion of commercial real estate loans,

-29-


$4.8 billion of consumer real estate mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties and $1.1 billion of outstanding home equity loans and lines of credit,
compared with $6.5 billion, $4.1 billion and $885 million, respectively, at December 31, 1999.

Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company are largely secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area, including areas in neighboring states generally considered to be within commuting
distance of New York City, and other areas of New
York State where the Company operates, including the Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany, Hudson Valley and Southern Tier regions. Commercial real estate loans are also originated through the Company’s offices in central Pennsylvania, Maryland,
Oregon and West Virginia.
Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company include fixed-rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity, in many cases five years after origination. For borrowers in good standing,
the terms of such
loans may be extended by the customer for an additional five years at the then-current market rate of interest. In response to customer needs, in recent years the Company has also originated fixed-rate commercial real estate loans with maturities of
greater than five
years. In general, these loans have original maturity terms of approximately ten years. The Company also originates adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans. As of December 31, 2000, approximately 32% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio
consisted of
adjustable-rate loans. The accompanying table 6 presents commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding at December 31, 2000. Of the $3.5 billion of commercial real estate loans in the New
York City metropolitan
area, approximately 47% were secured by multi-family residential properties, 21% by retail space and 14% by office space. The Company’s experience has been that office space and retail properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in
value through economic
cycles and changing economic conditions than do multi-family residential properties. Approximately 52% of the aggregate dollar amount of New York City area loans were for $5 million or less, while loans of more than $10 million made up
approximately 30% of the total.
Commercial real estate loans secured by properties elsewhere in New York State and in Pennsylvania tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade
or business.
Approximately 76% of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial real estate loans in New York State secured by properties located outside of the metropolitan New York City area were for $5 million or less. Approximately 86% of the outstanding balance
of commercial real
estate loans in Pennsylvania were for $5 million or less.

Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of New York State and Pennsylvania, and outside of areas of neighboring states considered to be part of the New York City metropolitan area,
comprised 10% of total commercial real estate loans as
of December 31, 2000.

Of the $534 million of commercial construction loans presented in the accompanying table, $289 million represent loans for which the Company has also committed to provide permanent financing. At
December 31, 2000, commercial construction loans represented 2% of
total loans and leases.

Real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties totaled $4.8 billion at December 31, 2000, including approximately 46% secured by properties located in New York State and 31% secured
by properties located in Pennsylvania. At December 31,
2000, $525 million of residential real estate loans were held for sale by M&T Mortgage Corporation, the Company’s residential mortgage banking subsidiary. Loans to finance the construction of one-to-four family residential properties
totaled $364 million at December 31,
2000, or approximately 2% of total loans and leases.

-30-


Consumer loans and leases represented approximately 18% of the average loan portfolio during 2000 and 1999, down slightly from 19% in 1998. Automobile loans and leases and home equity loans and lines of credit
represent the largest components of the consumer loan
portfolio. Approximately 85% of home equity loans and lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2000 were secured by properties in New York State and 12% were secured by properties in Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2000, 31% and 51% of the
automobile loan and lease
portfolio were to customers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, respectively. Automobile loans and leases are generally originated through dealers, however, all applications submitted through dealers are subject to the Company’s normal
underwriting and loan
approval procedures. Automobile loans and leases represented approximately 8% of the Company’s average loan portfolio during 2000, while no other consumer loan product represented more than 6%. The average outstanding balance of automobile leases
was approximately $375
million in both 2000 and 1999, and $315 million in 1998. Automobile leases acquired in the Keystone transaction totaled $231 million on October 6, 2000. Due to poorer than expected results, during 1998 and 1997 the Company terminated all
of its co-branded credit
card programs and sold its retail credit card business on July 31, 1998, including outstanding balances of approximately $186 million.

The Company’s investment securities portfolio averaged $2.8 billion in 2000, $2.1 billion in 1999 and $2.4 billion in 1998. Investment securities obtained in the acquisition of Keystone added
approximately $185 million to the average balance in 2000. The
remaining increase in 2000 from 1999 was generally the result of the previously described securitization of approximately $1.0 billion of residential mortgage loans during the second quarter of 2000. The investment securities portfolio is largely
comprised of residential
mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, commercial real estate mortgage-backed securities, and shorter-term U.S. Treasury notes. The Company has also invested in debt securities issued by municipalities and debt and preferred
equity securities
issued by government-sponsored agencies and certain financial institutions. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its overall interest-rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to prepayment and other
risks assumed. In
managing its investment securities portfolio, the Company occasionally sells investment securities following completion of a business combination, such as the recent acquisition of Keystone, and as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads,
actual or anticipated
prepayments, or credit risk associated with a particular security. Investment securities obtained in the Keystone transaction totaled approximately $1.2 billion on October 6, 2000. Through December 31, 2000, approximately $628 million
of such securities were sold. The
size of the investment securities portfolio is influenced by such factors as demand for loans, which generally yield more than investment securities, ongoing repayments, the level of deposits, and management of balance sheet size and resulting capital
ratios.

Money-market assets, which are comprised of interest-earning deposits at banks, interest-earning trading account assets, Federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities, averaged $239 million in 2000,
compared with $517 million in 1999 and $230 million in
1998.

Core deposits represent the most significant source of funding to the Company and consist of noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic time
deposits under $100,000. Core deposits generally carry
lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. The Company’s branch network is its principal source of core deposits. Certificates of deposit under $100,000 generated on a nationwide basis by M&T Bank, N.A. are also included
in core deposits.
Average core deposits were $13.6 billion in 2000, up from $11.9 billion in 1999 and $10.7 billion in 1998. The increase in average

-31-


core deposits in 2000 was due to the $4.7 billion of core deposits obtained on October 6, 2000 in connection with the Keystone transaction.
The increase in average core deposits in 1999 from 1998 reflected the 1999 Chase branch and FNB acquisitions and the full-year impact of the 1998 ONBANCorp acquisition. Core deposits obtained in the Chase branch acquisition as of September 24, 1999
and in the FNB
acquisition as of June 1, 1999 were $618 million and $419 million, respectively. Core deposits obtained in the acquisition of ONBANCorp totaled approximately $2.8 billion on April 1, 1998. Average core deposits of M&T Bank,
N.A. were $643 million in 2000, $429 million
in 1999 and $401 million in 1998. Funding provided by core deposits totaled 63% of average earning assets in 2000, compared with 62% in 1999 and 63% in 1998. The accompanying table 7 summarizes average core deposits in 2000 and percentage changes in
the components of
such deposits over the past two years.

The Company also obtains funding through domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more, deposits originated through the Company’s offshore branch office, and brokered certificates of deposit. Domestic time
deposits over $100,000, excluding brokered certificates of
deposit, averaged $1.8 billion in 2000, compared with $1.6 billion in 1999 and $1.3 billion in 1998. Offshore branch deposits, comprised primarily of accounts with balances of $100,000 or more, averaged $250 million in 2000, compared
with $254 million and $288 million in
1999 and 1998, respectively. Brokered deposits averaged $696 million in 2000, compared with $1.1 billion in 1999 and $1.4 billion in 1998, and totaled $531 million at December 31, 2000. Brokered deposits have been used as an
alternative to short-term borrowings to
lengthen the average maturity of interest-bearing liabilities. The weighted-average remaining term to maturity of brokered deposits at December 31, 2000 was 1.2 years. Certain of the brokered deposits have provisions that allow early
redemption. In connection with the
Company’s management of interest rate risk, interest rate swaps have been entered into under which the Company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable rate and that have notional amounts and terms similar to the amounts and terms of
many of the brokered
deposits. Additional amounts of brokered deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time.

The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers, the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (together, the “FHLB”), and others as sources of
funding. Short-term borrowings averaged $2.7 billion in 2000,
$2.1 billion in 1999 and $1.9 billion in 1998. The average balance of long-term borrowings was $2.1 billion in 2000, $1.7 billion in 1999 and $835 million in 1998. Included in average long-term borrowings were amounts borrowed
from the FHLB of $1.4 billion in 2000, $1.2
billion in 1999 and $343 million in 1998 and subordinated capital notes issued by M&T Bank of $295 million in 2000 and $175 million in 1999 and 1998. Trust preferred securities with a carrying value of $318 million that were
issued by special-purpose entities in 1997 are
also included in average long-term borrowings. Further information regarding the trust preferred securities, as well as information regarding contractual maturities of long-term borrowings, is provided in note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements. As
previously noted, M&T
Bank issued $500 million of 8% subordinated capital notes on October 5, 2000 in anticipation of the Keystone and Premier acquisitions.

Changes in the composition of the Company’s earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as described herein, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads, can impact net interest income. Net interest
spread, or the difference between the yield on earning
assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.39% in 2000, compared with 3.48% in 1999. As a result of generally rising interest rates during much of 2000, the yield on earning assets increased 51 basis points (hundredths of one

-32-


percent) to 8.30% from
7.79% in 1999. However, the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased even further, rising 60 basis points to 4.91% from 4.31% in 1999. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve in 1999 and 2000 contributed to the rising level of interest rates in
2000. In 1998,
the net interest spread was 3.44%, the yield on earning assets was 8.08% and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 4.64%.

Net interest-free funds consist largely of noninterest-bearing demand deposits and stockholders’ equity, partially offset by goodwill and core deposit intangible, bank owned life insurance and other non-earning
assets. Net interest-free funds contributed .63% to
net interest margin in 2000, compared with .54% in 1999 and .57% in 1998. Average net interest-free funds totaled $2.8 billion in 2000, $2.4 billion in 1999 and $2.1 billion in 1998. The increase in the contribution to net interest margin
ascribed to net interest-free
funds in 2000 as compared with 1999 resulted from the impact of higher interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities used to value such contribution and a $390 million increase in the average balance of net interest-free funds, largely comprised of
higher average
balances in noninterest-bearing deposits and retained earnings. The decline from 1998 to 1999 in the contribution to net interest margin of net interest-free funds was due, in part, to the goodwill and core deposit intangible assets recorded in
conjunction with the FNB,
Chase branch and ONBANCorp acquisitions and the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance. Goodwill and core deposit intangible assets averaged $766 million in 2000, $594 million in 1999 and $427 million in 1998, while the cash
surrender value of bank owned life
insurance averaged $458 million in 2000, $379 million in 1999 and $314 million in 1998. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income, but rather are recorded in “other revenues
from operations.”

Future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition of the Company’s portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads
could adversely impact the Company’s net interest margin
and net interest income. Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under a number of different interest rate scenarios. As part of the management of interest rate risk, the
Company utilizes
interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Revenue and expense arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields earned on
assets or, as
appropriate, the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes as of December 31, 2000 was approximately $534 million. In general, under the terms
of these swaps, the
Company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the swaps at fixed rates and makes payments at variable rates. In anticipation of the previously noted issuance of $500 million of fixed-rate subordinated notes in October 
2000, the Company terminated
certain interest rate swap agreements during September, including forward-starting swaps, with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $421 million. Under the terms of the terminated swaps, the Company would have made fixed-rate payments and
received variable-rate
payments. The termination of these swaps, which had been entered into to hedge interest rate risk associated with fixed-rate commercial real estate loans, resulted in a net deferred gain of approximately $15.5 million which will be recognized in
income over the
designated hedge period of the swaps. The impact of the termination of the swaps on the Company’s results of operations in 2000 was not significant. The average notional amounts of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management
purposes, the related
effect on net interest income and margin, and the weighted-average rate paid or received on those swaps are presented in the accompanying table 8.

-33-


The Company estimates that as of December 31, 2000 it would have received approximately $1 million if all interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes had been
terminated, compared with $25 million and $23 million at
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The estimated fair value of the interest rate swap portfolio results from the effects of changing interest rates. Additional information about interest rate swaps is included in note 16 of Notes to Financial
Statements. Through
December 31, 2000, changes in the estimated fair value of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes were not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. A discussion of the impact of changes in accounting for
interest rate swaps
and other derivative financial instruments that became effective January 1, 2001 is presented herein under the heading “Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted.”

Provision For Credit Losses

A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the Company’s allowance for credit losses to a level that is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The provision for credit losses was $38.0 million in 2000,
down from $44.5 million in 1999
and $43.2 million in 1998. Net loan charge-offs in 2000 were $29.0 million, significantly lower than $40.3 million in 1999 and $39.4 million in 1998. Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding decreased to .16%
in 2000 from .25% in 1999 and .28%
in 1998. Nonperforming loans, consisting of nonaccrual and restructured loans, totaled $110.6 million or .49% of loans and leases outstanding at December 31, 2000, compared with $72.2 million or .41% a year earlier and $79.3 million
or .50% at December 31, 1998. The
increase at December 31, 2000 as compared with 1999 and 1998 reflects the inclusion of approximately $43 million of nonperforming loans acquired in the merger with Keystone on October 6, 2000. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more
totaled $141.8 million or .62% of
total loans and leases at December 31, 2000, compared with $31.0 million or .18% at December 31, 1999 and $37.8 million or .24% at December 31, 1998. The increase resulted largely from the inclusion at December 31, 2000 of
$87 million of one-to-four family residential
mortgage loans serviced by the Company and repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2000 from the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”). The outstanding principal balances of such loans are fully guaranteed by government agencies.
The loans were repurchased
to reduce servicing costs associated with the loans, including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments to GNMA that had not been received from individual mortgagors. Expenses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2000 associated with the
repurchased
loans were approximately $3 million and have been included in “Other costs of operations” in the consolidated statement of income.

The allowance for credit losses was $374.7 million or 1.65% of net loans and leases at the end of 2000, compared with $316.2 million or 1.82% at December 31, 1999 and $306.3 million or 1.94% at
December 31, 1998. The ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans
at year-end 2000, 1999 and 1998 was 339%, 438% and 387%, respectively. The decline in the allowance as a percentage of total loans at December 31, 2000 as compared with prior years reflects management’s evaluation of the loan and lease
portfolio as of each date, the
relatively favorable and/or stable economic environment for many commercial borrowers during much of the recent year, the July 1998 sale of the Company’s retail credit card business, and other factors. Management regularly assesses the adequacy
of the allowance by
performing an ongoing evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which
borrowers operate, the
level of delinquent loans and the value of any

-34-


collateral. Significant loans are individually analyzed, while other smaller balance loans are evaluated by loan category. Management cautiously evaluated the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic
conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment obligations when assessing the adequacy of the Company’s allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2000. In addition to the impact of acquisitions, factors considered by management
when performing such
assessment included, but were not limited to: (i) the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the Company’s loan portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in New York State, in general, and in the
New York City metropolitan
area, in particular; (ii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area that have not experienced the same degree of economic growth experienced by the vast
majority of other regions
of the country in recent years; and (iii) significant growth in loans to individual consumers. Based upon the results of such review, management believes that the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2000 was adequate to absorb credit
losses inherent in the
portfolio as of that date.

The accompanying table 10 presents a comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year-ends. Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based upon management’s
classification of loans under the Company’s internal
loan grading system and assessment of near-term charge-offs and losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by the Company’s internal loan review department and pools of other loans that are not individually
analyzed. The unallocated
portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable resulting from (i) comparatively poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in many market regions served by the Company that
have not experienced
the same degree of economic growth evident in much of the rest of the country in recent years; (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding loan type, collateral type and geographic location, in particular the large concentration of commercial real
estate loans secured by
properties in the New York City metropolitan area and other areas of New York State; (iii) the effect of expansion into new markets, including market areas entered through acquisitions; (iv) the introduction of new loan product types, including
expansion of automobile
loan and leasing activities in recent years; and, (v) the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance. Led by growth in New York City, the economy in New York State expanded during 2000 at a rate similar
to that of the
national average. However, although improved when compared to prior years, economic growth in areas of New York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area continued to lag behind the rest of the country. Furthermore, consistent with other
regions of the
country, the rate of employment growth in New York State slowed during the second half of 2000. Slower job growth, coupled with a declining population base, has left the upstate New York region susceptible to potential credit problems, particularly
related to commercial
customers. After contracting throughout 1998 and 1999, the economy in central Pennsylvania stabilized in 2000. Nevertheless, the rate of employment growth in central Pennsylvania in 2000 was approximately one-half the rate experienced in the rest of the
country. Given
the Company’s high concentration of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in New York State, including the upstate New York region, and central Pennsylvania, and considering the other factors already discussed, the level of the
unallocated portion of the
allowance for credit losses was deemed prudent and reasonable by management. Nevertheless, the allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category. Accordingly, the amounts presented in the table are not
necessarily
indicative of future losses within the individual loan categories.

Several factors influence the Company’s credit loss experience,

-35-


including overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and, due to the size of the Company’s commercial real estate loan portfolio, real estate valuations, in
particular. Commercial real estate valuations include many assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective. Commercial real estate values can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic
conditions and
interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property.

Nonperforming commercial real estate loans totaled $37.0 million, $13.4 million and $18.9 million at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Commercial real estate loans acquired in the
Keystone merger that were classified at December 31, 2000 as
nonperforming were $23.0 million. During 2000 and 1999, the Company realized net recoveries of previously charged-off commercial real estate loans of $383 thousand and $2.2 million. During 1998, net charge-offs of commercial real estate loans
were $3.6 million.

Net charge-offs of consumer loans and leases were $18.9 million in 2000, or .56% of average consumer loans and leases outstanding during the year, compared with $21.7 million or .72% in 1999 and $31.5 
million or 1.13% in 1998. Charge-offs of indirect automobile
loans and leases represented the most significant type of consumer loans charged off during the past three years. Net indirect automobile loan and lease charge-offs during 2000 were $7.2 million, compared with $8.3 million in 1999 and
$10.5 million in 1998. Net
charge-offs of credit card balances in 1998 totaled $14.4 million. There were no significant charge-offs of credit card balances in 2000 and 1999 since the Company’s retail credit card business was sold in July 1998. Nonperforming consumer
loans and leases totaled $12.1
million or .29% of outstanding consumer loans at December 31, 2000, compared with $11.5 million or .37% at December 31, 1999 and $10.3 million or .36% at December 31, 1998. Accruing consumer loans and leases past due ninety days
or more at December 31, 2000 were $21.3
million, compared with $15.8 million and $18.0 million at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Consumer loans and leases acquired in the Keystone merger that were past due ninety days or more and accruing interest at December 31,
2000 were $5.6 million. Despite the
existence of loan collateral in many cases, management conservatively evaluated the collectability of these delinquent consumer loans and leases when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.

During 2000, net charge-offs of commercial loans and leases totaled $5.7 million, compared with $17.0 million in 1999 and $2.7 million in 1998. The higher level of charge-offs in 1999 compared with
2000 and 1998 was largely the result of two commercial loans with
partial charge-offs aggregating $15.0 million. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases totaled $25.5 million, $21.1 million and $20.0 million at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Commercial loans acquired in the
Keystone merger that were classified as
nonperforming at December 31, 2000 were $12.7 million.

Net charge-offs of residential real estate loans were $4.7 million in 2000, compared with $3.9 million and $1.6 million in 1999 and 1998, respectively. Residential real estate loans classified as
nonperforming at December 31, 2000 totaled $36.0 million, compared
with $26.2 million and $30.1 million at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Residential real estate loans past due ninety days or more and accruing interest totaled $115.3 million, $13.9 million and $18.8 million at
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
The higher level of such loans in 2000 as compared with 1999 and 1998 resulted largely from the inclusion at December 31, 2000 of the previously discussed $87 million of loans repurchased from GNMA. The repurchased loans are fully guaranteed by
government agencies.
Residential real estate loans acquired in the Keystone merger that were classified at December 31, 2000 as nonperforming and accruing loans past due ninety days or more were $6.9 million and $8.0 million, respectively.

-36-


Commercial real estate loans secured by multi-family properties in the New York City metropolitan area represented 7% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2000. The Company had no concentrations of credit
extended to any specific industry that exceeded 10% of
total loans at December 31, 2000. Furthermore, the Company had no exposure to less developed countries and less than $1 million of outstanding foreign loans at December 31, 2000.

Assets acquired in settlement of defaulted loans totaled $13.6 million
at December 31, 2000, compared with $10.0 million a year earlier and $11.1 million at the end of 1998.

Other Income

Other income grew 15% to $325 million in 2000 from $282 million in 1999. Increases in service charges on deposit accounts, income from leasing activities, and brokerage services income were partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenues
and losses from sales of bank
investment securities. Approximately 40% of the increase in other income from 1999 to 2000 was attributable to revenues related to operations and/or market areas associated with the Keystone acquisition. Other income was $248 million in 1998, after
excluding $15.3
million of tax-exempt income resulting from the previously noted transfer of appreciated investment securities to an affiliated, tax-exempt charitable foundation. Growth in mortgage banking revenues, fees earned from deposit services, and a full year of
revenues
associated with operations obtained in the ONBANCorp acquisition contributed to the increase from 1998 to 1999.

Mortgage banking revenues, which consist of residential mortgage loan servicing fees, gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights, and other residential mortgage loan-related fees,
decreased 12% to $63.2 million in 2000 from $71.8
million in 1999. The Company maintains residential mortgage loan origination offices in New York State and Pennsylvania, as well as in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Massachusetts, Ohio, Oregon, Utah and Washington. Generally higher interest rates during the
fourth quarter
of 1999 and throughout most of 2000 negatively impacted mortgage origination volume. The lower volume and tighter pricing margins, due to competitive pressures, contributed to a decrease in gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan
servicing rights to $24.8
million in 2000, compared with $39.7 million in 1999 and $32.4 million in 1998. Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others were $32.3 million in 2000, compared with $26.8 million in 1999 and $29.3 million in
1998. Residential mortgage loans serviced
for others totaled $9.7 billion (including approximately $1 billion of loans that had been serviced by Keystone), $7.2 billion and $7.3 billion at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Capitalized servicing assets were
$101 million at December 31, 2000, $61
million at December 31, 1999, and $62 million at December 31, 1998. Capitalized servicing assets recorded during 2000 as a result of the Keystone transaction, other purchased servicing rights and the previously noted securitization of
$1.0 billion of residential mortgage
loans were approximately $15 million, $21 million and $14 million, respectively.

Service charges on deposit accounts rose 26% to $92.5 million in 2000 from $73.6 million in 1999, and 61% from $57.4 million in 1998. The full-year effect in 2000 of a third quarter 1999 increase in
fees and the impact of acquisitions were significant factors
contributing to the increases. Fees for services provided to customers in the areas formerly served by Keystone contributed approximately 30% of the increase from 1999 to 2000. Trust income increased 11% to $45.2 million in 2000 from $40.8 
million in 1999 and 18% from
$38.2 million in 1998. The increase in 2000 from 1999 was attributable to the acquisition of Keystone. Higher revenues from investment management services contributed to the increase in 1999 from 1998. Brokerage

-37-


services income, which is comprised of revenues from the
sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees, totaled $32.8 million in 2000, up 21% from $27.1 million in 1999 and 67% higher than $19.6 million in 1998. Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains
of $2.4 million in 2000, $315
thousand in 1999 and $4.0 million in 1998. The decline in 1999 income was largely the result of an approximate $3 million loss incurred as a result of a counterparty defaulting on the settlement of outstanding foreign exchange contracts. Losses
from sales of bank
investment securities in 2000 reflect $3.1 million of net losses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2000 from sales of investment securities following the acquisition of Keystone and the combination of the investment portfolios of Keystone and
M&T. During 1999 and
1998, the Company sold bank investment securities resulting in gains of $1.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively. All sold securities had been previously classified as available for sale for financial reporting purposes.

Other revenues from operations increased to $91.7 million in 2000, compared with $67.2 million in 1999 and $61.1 million in 1998 (excluding the effect of the contribution of securities to the
affiliated foundation). Approximately one-sixth of the increase from
1999 to 2000 resulted from operations related to Keystone. Other revenues from operations included $25.5 million, $22.5 million and $17.6 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, of tax-exempt income earned from bank owned life
insurance, which includes increases in
cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits received. Also included were revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees of $9.3 million, $7.5 million and $12.4 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Other
items that contributed to the
increase in other revenues from operations in 2000 from 1999 include income from leasing activities and higher insurance-related revenues. Income from leasing activities reflects a net gain of $9 million realized during the fourth quarter of 2000
resulting from a $13.5
million gain from the sale of equipment previously leased to a commercial customer and an accrual of $4.5 million for losses associated with selling automobiles and other vehicles presently leased to retail customers. Insurance-related revenues
totaled $6.6 million in
2000, compared with $879 thousand and $635 thousand in 1999 and 1998, respectively. The previously noted acquisition of MBD in March 2000 was the leading factor contributing to higher insurance-related revenues. A $7.0 million increase in
revenues from letter of credit
and other credit-related fees also contributed to the rise in other revenues from operations in 1999 from 1998.

Other Expense

Operating expenses, which exclude amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible as well as merger-related and other nonrecurring expenses, were $599 million in 2000, 14% higher than $525 million in 1999 and 23% higher than $486 
million in 1998. Expenses related to
acquired operations significantly contributed to the higher expense levels in 2000 and 1999. However, since the operating systems and support operations related to Keystone, ONBANCorp, FNB and the former Chase branches have been combined with those of
the Company, the
Company’s operating expenses cannot be precisely divided between or attributed directly to the acquired operations or to the Company as it existed prior to each transaction. Components of other expense considered to be non-operating in nature and
therefore excluded from
the operating expense totals noted above were amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible of $69.6 million in 2000, $49.7 million in 1999 and $34.5 million in 1998; merger-related expenses of $26.0 million, $4.7 million
and $21.3 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively; and $24.6 million of expense recognized in 1998 related to the previously discussed transfer of securities to an affiliated charitable foundation.

-38-


Salaries and employee benefits expense was $329 million in 2000, 16% higher than the $285 million in 1999 and 27% higher than the $259 million in 1998. Salaries and benefits related to acquired
operations, merit salary increases, and higher expenses for incentive
compensation arrangements were factors contributing to the increases in 2000 and 1999. Higher medical benefit costs in 1999 also contributed to the increase in 1999 from 1998. The number of full-time equivalent employees was 8,219 at December 31,
2000, compared with
6,171 at December 31, 1999 and 6,044 at December 31, 1998.

Excluding the non-operating expense items previously noted, nonpersonnel expense totaled $272 million in 2000, 13% higher than $240 million in 1999 and 19% higher than $228 million in 1998. Higher
equipment and net occupancy expenses, largely attributable to the
impact of acquisitions, higher amortization of capitalized servicing rights and increased foreclosure-related expenses were significant factors contributing to the rise in nonpersonnel expenses from 1999 to 2000. Higher equipment and
net occupancy expenses, largely related to acquired operations, also contributed to the increase in expense from 1998 to 1999.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $160 million in 2000, up from $153 million
in 1999 and $118 million in 1998. The effective tax rates were 35.9% in 2000, 36.5% in 1999 and 36.1% in 1998. A reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income is
provided in note 11 of
Notes to Financial Statements.

International Activities

The Company’s net investment in international assets was $7 million and $27 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Total offshore deposits
were $245 million at December 31, 2000 and $243 million at December 31, 1999.

Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity

As a financial intermediary, the Company is exposed to various risks including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Company’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy demands for loans
and deposit withdrawals,
to fund operating costs, and to be used for other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.

Core deposits have historically been the most significant funding source for the Company. Core deposits are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers, which over the past several
years has become more geographically diverse as
a result of acquisitions and expansion of the Company’s businesses. Nevertheless, in recent years the Company has faced increased competition in offering services and products from a large array of financial market participants, including banks,
thrifts, mutual funds,
securities dealers and others. Core deposits financed 65% of the Company’s earning assets at December 31, 2000, compared with 63% and 62% at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase,
brokered certificates of deposit, and borrowings from
the FHLB and others. M&T Bank

-39-


had short-term and long-term credit facilities with the FHLB aggregating $3.3 billion at December 31, 2000. Outstanding borrowings under the FHLB credit facilities totaled $2.8 billion at December 31, 2000 and $1.8 billion at
December 31,
1999. Such borrowings are secured by loans and investment securities. M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. had available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at December 31, 2000 totaling approximately $1.4 billion. The
amounts of these lines are dependent
upon the balance of loans and securities pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at either December 31, 2000 or 1999. As previously noted, M&T Bank issued $500 million of 8% fixed rate subordinated
capital notes in October 2000 that
provided liquidity and facilitated the acquisitions of Keystone and Premier. Although informal and sometimes reciprocal, sources of funding are available to the Company through various arrangements for unsecured short-term borrowings from a wide group of
banks and other
financial institutions. In addition to deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include maturities of money-market assets and investment securities, repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash generated from operations, such as
fees collected for
services.

M&T’s primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, stockholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries, which are
subject to various regulatory limitations. These historic
sources of cash flow were augmented in 1997 by the proceeds from issuance of $250 million of trust preferred securities, which provided a substantial portion of M&T’s funding needs during 1998 and 1997. Additional information regarding the
trust preferred securities is
included in note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements. M&T also maintains a $30 million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank, of which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2000. Outstanding borrowings under a
similar $30 million line of
credit that expired during 2000 totaled $29 million at December 31, 1999.

Management closely monitors the Company’s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the normal
course of business. Management does not anticipate
engaging in any activities, either currently or in the long-term, which would cause a significant strain on liquidity at either M&T or its subsidiary banks.

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and/or interest rates of the Company’s financial instruments. The primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. The
core banking activities of lending and deposit-taking
expose the Company to interest rate risk, which occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The
Company measures
interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future years under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments.
Management’s philosophy
toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. The balances of both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities,
anticipated
prepayments of mortgage-related assets and expected maturities of investment securities, loans and deposits. Management supplements the modeling technique described above with analyses of market values of the Company’s financial instruments. The
Company has entered into
interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2000, the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was approximately
$534 million. Information about interest rate swaps entered into for

-40-


interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under “Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities” and in note 16 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company’s Asset-Liability Committee, which includes members of senior management, monitors interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a computer model that considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit
gathering activities, as well as statistically
derived interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, management has taken action, and intends to do
so in the future,
to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on- or off-balance sheet financial instruments. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning
assets and
interest-bearing liabilities, and modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or entering into additional interest rate swap agreements.

The accompanying table 14 as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 displays the estimated impact on net interest income from non-trading financial instruments resulting from changes in interest rates during the first
modeling year.

Many assumptions were utilized by the Company to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on the Company’s net interest income. The more significant assumptions related to the rate of
prepayments of mortgage-related assets, cash flows from
derivative and other financial instruments held for non-trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. The Company also assumed gradual changes in rates of 100 and 200 basis points up and down during a twelve-month
period. These
assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to timing, magnitude and
frequency of interest
rate changes and changes in market conditions, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes.

In accordance with industry practice, the accompanying table 15 presents cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames, as adjusted for the
impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for
interest rate risk management purposes. Management believes this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities equally
nor, as assumed
in the table, on the contractual maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected changes in balance sheet composition or
any subsequent
interest rate risk management activities the Company is likely to implement.

The Company engages in trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to profit from perceived market opportunities. Trading activities are conducted utilizing financial instruments that include
forward and futures contracts related to foreign
currencies and mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasury and other government securities, mortgage-backed securities and interest rate contracts, such as swaps. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with
trading activities
by entering into offsetting trading positions. The amounts of gross and net trading positions as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the Company are subject to a well-defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by the
Asset-Liability
Committee.

-41-


The notional amounts of interest rate and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading account purposes totaled $769 million and $293 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2000 and $799 million and $573 million, respectively,
at December 31, 1999. The notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. However, the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the consolidated balance
sheet. The fair values
of all trading account assets and liabilities were $37 million and $22 million, respectively, at December 31, 2000 and $641 million and $633 million, respectively, at December 31, 1999. Included in trading account assets at
December 31, 1999 were mortgage-backed
securities that served as collateral securing certain money market assets. The obligations to return such collateral were recorded as noninterest-bearing trading account liabilities and were included in accrued interest and other liabilities in the
Company’s consolidated
balance sheet. The fair value of such collateral (and the related obligation to return collateral) was $600 million at December 31, 1999.

Given the Company’s policies, limits and positions, management believes that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk associated with trading activities was not material as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999. Additional information related
to trading derivative contracts is included in note 16 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Capital

Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2000 was $2.7 billion or 9.33% of total assets, compared with $1.8 billion or 8.02% at December 31, 1999 and $1.6 billion or 7.78% at December 31, 1998. On a per share basis,
stockholders’ equity increased 24% to $28.93 at December
31, 2000 from $23.24 at December 31, 1999, and was up 39% from $20.79 at December 31, 1998. Tangible equity per share, which excludes goodwill and core deposit intangible and applicable deferred tax balances, was $16.74 at December 31,
2000, compared with $15.14 at
December 31, 1999 and $13.99 at December 31, 1998. The ratio of average total stockholders’ equity to average total assets was 8.59%, 8.24% and 8.20% in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

M&T issued shares of common stock in 2000, 1999 and 1998 to complete the acquisitions of Keystone, FNB and ONBANCorp, respectively. To complete the acquisition of Keystone on October 6, 2000, M&T issued
15,900,292 shares of common stock to former holders of
Keystone common stock and assumed employee stock options to purchase 1,259,493 shares of M&T common stock, resulting in an addition to stockholders’ equity of $663.7 million. On June 1, 1999, M&T issued 1,225,160 shares (stated to
give effect to the ten-for-one stock
split in 2000) of common stock to former holders of FNB common stock resulting in an addition to stockholders’ equity of $58.7 million. On April 1, 1998, M&T issued 14,299,980 shares (stated to give effect to the ten-for-one stock
split in 2000) of common stock to former
holders of ONBANCorp common stock and assumed employee stock options to purchase 617,720 shares (also stated to give effect to the stock split) of M&T common stock, resulting in an addition to stockholders’ equity of $607.2 million.

Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2000 reflected a loss of $432 thousand, or less than $.01 per share, for the net after-tax impact of unrealized losses on investment securities classified as available
for sale, compared with unrealized losses of $26.0 million,
or $.34 per common share, at December 31, 1999 and unrealized gains of $2.9 million, or $.04 per common share, at December 31, 1998. Such unrealized gains or losses are generally due to changes in interest rates and represent the
difference, net of applicable income tax
effect, between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as available for sale.

Cash dividends on M&T’s common stock of $52.0 million were paid in

-42-


2000, compared with $35.1 million and $29.0 million in 1999 and 1998, respectively. As previously discussed, in conjunction with the Keystone acquisition, M&T increased its quarterly dividend on
common stock in the fourth quarter of 2000 to $.25 per share from $.125 per share. In the third quarter of 1999 M&T’s quarterly common stock dividend rate was increased to $.125 per share from $.10 per share. In total, dividends per common share
increased to $.625 in
2000 from $.45 in 1999 and $.38 in 1998.

During 2000, 1999 and 1998, M&T repurchased an aggregate of 7,787,410 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $366.5 million; 1,313,760 shares in 2000, 1,678,330 shares in 1999 and 4,795,320
shares in 1998, at a cost of $54.9 million, $79.8 million and
$231.8 million, respectively. In November 1999, M&T announced its intention to repurchase and hold as treasury stock up to 1,904,650 shares of common stock for reissuance upon the possible future exercise of outstanding stock options. As of
December 31, 2000, M&T had
repurchased 1,632,860 shares of common stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of $42.74 per share. Following the public announcement of the Keystone acquisition in May 2000, M&T has not been repurchasing its common stock, instead using
the Company’s internal
generation of capital to support the Keystone and Premier acquisitions.

Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain “core capital” and “total capital” ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk-adjusted total assets. In addition to
the risk-based measures, Federal bank regulators have also
implemented a minimum “leverage” ratio guideline of 3% of the quarterly average of total assets. Core capital includes the $318 million carrying value of trust preferred securities. As of December 31, 2000, total capital further
included $594 million of subordinated
notes issued by M&T Bank. The capital ratios of the Company and its banking subsidiaries, M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A., as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 are presented in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company generates significant amounts of regulatory capital. The rate of regulatory core capital generation, or cash net income (reduced by the impact of nonrecurring merger-related expenses) less dividends paid
expressed as a percentage of regulatory “core
capital” at the beginning of each year, was 19.48% in 2000, 19.89% in 1999 and 16.71% in 1998.

Fourth Quarter Results

As previously noted, M&T completed its acquisition of Keystone on October 6, 2000. The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the results of operations obtained from Keystone have been
included in M&T’s financial
results since the acquisition date. M&T reported net income in the fourth quarter of 2000 of $72.0 million, an increase of 9% from $66.1 million in the final quarter of 1999. Diluted and basic earnings per share in the recent quarter were
$.76 and $.78, respectively,
compared with $.82 and $.85, respectively, in the year-earlier quarter. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2000 expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets was 1.01%, compared with 1.18% in the comparable 1999 quarter. The annualized
rate of return on
average common stockholders’ equity in the recent quarter was 11.03%, compared with 14.58% in 1999’s fourth quarter. Cash net income in the fourth quarter of 2000 rose to $108.1 million, up 38% from $78.4 million earned in the
year-earlier quarter. Diluted cash earnings
per share increased 18% to $1.14 in 2000’s final quarter from $.97 in the comparable 1999 period. Cash return on average tangible assets was an annualized 1.57% in the recent quarter, compared with 1.45% in the corresponding 1999 quarter. Cash
return on average tangible
common equity rose to an annualized 28.93% in the fourth quarter of 2000 from 26.67% in the year-earlier quarter.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose to $262 million in the

-43-


fourth quarter of 2000, an increase of $63 million or 32% from $199 million in the comparable 1999 quarter. A 30% increase in average earning assets, largely the result of the Keystone acquisition
on October 6, 2000, was the most significant factor contributing to the improvement in net interest income. Average earning assets were $25.7 billion and $19.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2000 and 1999, respectively. Average loans and
leases for the fourth quarter
of 2000 totaled $22.1 billion, up from $17.1 billion during the year-earlier quarter. Net interest margin was 4.05% in the fourth quarter of 2000, up from 3.99% in 1999’s final quarter. The yield on earning assets was 8.47% in the recent
quarter, up 62 basis points from
7.85% in the year-earlier period. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 5.12% in 2000’s final quarter, compared with 4.43% in the fourth quarter of 1999. The resulting net interest spread was 3.35% in the recent quarter, compared with
3.42% in 1999’s final
quarter.

The provision for credit losses was $14.0 million in the fourth quarter of both 2000 and 1999. Net charge-offs totaled $12.1 million in 2000’s fourth quarter, compared with $12.8 million in the
year-earlier period. Net charge-offs as an annualized percentage of
average loans and leases were .22% in the final 2000 quarter, compared with .30% in the corresponding 1999 quarter.

Other income increased 46% to $102.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2000 from $70.4 million in the fourth quarter of 1999. Approximately one-half of the increase was attributable to revenues related to
operations and/or market areas associated with the Keystone
acquisition. Income from leasing activities and increases in service charges on deposit accounts of $8.6 million and trust income of $5.7 million, largely attributable to acquired Keystone operations, were partially offset by $3.1 million
of losses from sales of bank
investment securities. Income from leasing activities reflects a net gain of $9 million during the fourth quarter of 2000 resulting from a $13.5 million gain from the sale of equipment previously leased to a commercial customer and an accrual
of $4.5 million for losses
associated with selling automobiles and other vehicles presently leased to retail customers.

Reflecting the impact of expenses resulting from the acquisition of Keystone, including expenses for salaries and benefits, equipment and net occupancy, and amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible,
other expense increased 57% to $234.2 million in
2000’s final quarter from $149.0 million in the corresponding 1999 period. Nonrecurring merger-related expenses totaled $22.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2000. There were no similar expenses in the fourth quarter of 1999.

Segment information

In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 131, “Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” the Company’s reportable segments have been
determined based upon its internal profitability reporting
system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those
products and services
are similar. The reportable segments are Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking.

The financial information of the Company’s segments was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management accounting policies and processes
utilized in compiling segment financial information are
highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to

-44-


generally accepted accounting principles. As a result, reported segments and the financial results of such segments are not necessarily comparable with similar
information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial information about the Company’s
segments is presented in
note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products and banking services for middle-market and large commercial customers, largely within the markets the Company serves. Among the services
provided by this segment are commercial lending and
leasing, deposit products, and cash management services. The Commercial Banking segment’s earnings increased 27% to $98.4 million in 2000 from $77.6 million in 1999. The higher net income in 2000 when compared with 1999 resulted largely
from an increase of $34.9
million, or 22%, in net interest income. Net interest income from loans and leases increased $24.0 million, as a result of a 23% increase in average balances outstanding, while the contribution to net interest income from deposits increased
$8.2 million, due to a higher
net interest spread and a 9% increase in average balances outstanding. Growth in most markets already served by the Company, as well as the impact of balances obtained in acquisitions, contributed to the higher loan and deposit levels. Net income in 1998
was $67.4
million. Higher net interest income of $17.8 million, or 13%, the result of a 17% increase in average loans outstanding, and increases in letter of credit and other credit related fee income of $6.1 million were factors contributing to the rise
in net income from 1998 to
1999. Growth in most markets served by the Company, as well as the full year impact in 1999 of loans acquired from ONBANCorp, contributed to the higher loan balances. Reflecting higher net charge-offs, including charge-offs of $11.2 million related
to one commercial
customer, the segment’s provision for credit losses increased to $11.3 million in 1999 from $3.0 million in 1998. The segment’s provision for credit losses was $7.3 million in 2000.

The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit services to its customers. Loans are largely secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in western New York, upstate New York,
Pennsylvania and, to a lesser extent, in Maryland,
West Virginia and the northwestern portion of the United States. Commercial real estate loans may be secured by apartment/ multifamily buildings, office space, retail space, industrial space or other types of collateral. Net income earned by the
Commercial Real Estate
segment in 2000 was $72.1 million, up 12% from $64.2 million realized in 1999. The major factor for the rise in net income was a 17% increase in average loan balances outstanding which contributed to a $12.3 million, or 10%, increase in
net interest income. Loan growth
in all markets served by the Company and the impact of commercial real estate loans obtained in the Keystone acquisition contributed to the increase in outstanding balances. Net income for the Commercial Real Estate segment was $57.3 million in
1998. Higher net interest
income of $12.8 million, the result of a 15% increase in average loan balances outstanding, was the major factor for the higher 1999 net income. Higher loan balances were due to loan growth in substantially all markets served by the Company and the
full-year impact in
1999 of commercial real estate loans obtained in the acquisition of ONBANCorp.

The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes securities, residential mortgage loans and other assets; short-term and long-term borrowed funds; brokered certificates of deposit and interest rate swaps related thereto;
 and offshore branch deposits. This segment
also provides services to commercial
customers and consumers that include foreign exchange, securities trading and municipal bond underwriting and sales. The Discretionary Portfolio segment earned net income of $33.9 million in 2000, compared with $38.2 million in 1999 and
$31.7 million in 1998. Factors
contributing to the decline in net

-45-


income for 2000 include an $11.0 million, or 23%, decrease in net interest income and losses from sales of bank investment securities of $3.1 million, offset, in part, by a $3.0 million increase in tax-exempt income earned from bank
owned life insurance. The decline in net interest income largely reflects a narrowing of the segment’s net interest margin. The higher net income in 1999 as compared with 1998 was due, in part, to a $4.9 million increase in income from bank
owned life insurance and
higher net interest income from holdings of residential mortgage loans. Partially offsetting these increases was the previously mentioned $3 million settlement loss on foreign exchange contracts in 1999.

The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services residential mortgage loans for consumers and sells substantially all of those loans in the secondary market to investors or to banking subsidiaries of
M&T. The Company maintains mortgage loan
origination offices in New York State and Pennsylvania, as well as in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Maryland, Massachusetts, Ohio, Oregon, Utah, Washington and West Virginia. The Company also periodically purchases the rights to service residential mortgage
loans.
Residential mortgage loans held for sale are included in this segment. This segment’s net income was $6.5 million in 2000, compared with $20.8 million a year earlier and $19.5 million in 1998. The significant decrease from 1999 was
largely due to lower gains from sales
of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights, which decreased $14.9 million, and higher noninterest expenses of $5.8 million resulting from increases in foreclosure expenses and amortization of capitalized servicing rights. The
decline in revenue resulted from
the impact that generally higher interest rates in 2000 had on loan origination volume and from tighter pricing margins resulting from competitive pressures. A $6.2 million decrease in noninterest expenses associated with origination and servicing
activities, partially
offset by a $4.1 million decline in revenue, led to the improved net income in this segment in 1999 as compared with 1998. The lower 1999 expense level included a $1.7 million decrease in the valuation allowance for capitalized servicing
assets, compared with a $1.0
million addition to such allowance in 1998. The decline in revenue was the result of a lower volume of loans originated for sale during 1999 as compared with 1998, including loans originated for transfer to M&T’s bank subsidiaries.

The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of consumer and small business services through several delivery channels which include traditional and “in-store” banking offices, automated teller machines,
telephone banking and internet banking. The Company has
banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia. The Retail Banking segment also offers certain deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis through M&T Bank, N.A. Credit services offered by this segment include
consumer installment loans,
student loans, automobile loans and leases (both directly and indirectly through dealers), home equity loans and lines of credit, and loans and leases to small businesses. The segment also offers to its customers deposit products, including demand,
savings and time
accounts; investment products, including mutual funds and annuities; and other services. The Retail Banking segment contributed net income of $163.7 million in 2000, up 47% from $111.5 million in 1999. The increase was due, in part, to the
impact of the 2000 and 1999
acquisitions of Keystone, FNB and the Chase branches that resulted in higher net interest income and service charges on deposit accounts, partially offset by increases in operating expenses. The full-year impact in 2000 of a third quarter 1999 increase
in fees charged
for deposit account services also contributed to the improvement. In 1998, Retail Banking had net income of $100.1 million. The impact of the acquisitions of FNB on June 1, 1999 and ONBANCorp on April 1, 1998 and increased service charges
on deposit accounts, reflecting
the third quarter 1999 rate increases, were the leading factors contributing to the increase from 1998 to 1999. The financial results of Retail Banking for 1998 also include a $3.2 million gain that resulted from the sale of the retail

-46-


credit card business in July 1998
and the results of providing retail credit card services to customers.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 133 established accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a
derivative may be
specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or
(c) a hedge of the foreign
currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, an available for sale security, or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction.

Pursuant to SFAS No. 133, the accounting for changes in the fair value
of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. An entity that elects to apply hedge accounting will be required to establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use for assessing the
effectiveness of the hedging
derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge. Those methods must be consistent with the entity’s approach to managing risk.

SFAS No. 133 was to be effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. In June 1999, the FASB amended SFAS No. 133, deferring the effective date by one year. In
1998, the FASB organized the Derivatives Implementation Group
(“DIG”) to assist with the interpretation of SFAS No. 133 and to address implementation issues. In June 2000, the FASB again amended SFAS No. 133 through the issuance of SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 133.” SFAS No. 138 was issued to address some of the implementation issues and to reflect certain decisions arising from the DIG process.

Initial application of SFAS No. 133, as amended, must be as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal quarter; on that date, hedging relationships must be designated anew and documented pursuant to the
provisions of the statement. SFAS No. 133, as amended, may not
be applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 133, as amended, as of January 1, 2001. The Company anticipates that adoption of SFAS No. 133 could increase the volatility of reported earnings and stockholders’
equity in future periods. Nevertheless, the initial impact of adopting
SFAS No. 133 as of January 1, 2001 was not considered material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In September 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.” SFAS No. 140 replaces SFAS No. 125,
which was issued in 1996 and had the same title. SFAS No. 140 revises standards
for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures.

SFAS No. 140 is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after March 31, 2001.

-47-


The statement is effective for recognition and reclassification of collateral and for disclosures relating to
securitization transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2000. Disclosures about securitization and collateral accepted need not be reported for periods ending on or before December 15, 2000, for which financial
statements are presented for
comparative purposes. In general, SFAS No. 140 is to be applied prospectively. Earlier or retroactive application of its accounting provisions is generally not permitted. The adoption of SFAS No. 140 is not expected to have a material impact on
the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

M&T Bank Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of M&T Bank Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in
stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of M&T Bank Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

M&T BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant accounting policies

M&T Bank Corporation (“M&T”) is a bank holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York. Through
subsidiaries, M&T provides individuals, corporations and other businesses, and institutions with commercial and
retail banking services, including loans and deposits, trust, mortgage banking, asset management and other
financial services. Banking activities are largely focused on consumers residing in New York State and
Pennsylvania, and on small and medium-size businesses based in those areas. Banking services are also provided
in Maryland and West Virginia, while certain subsidiaries also conduct activities in other states.

On September 19, 2000, M&T’s Board of Directors authorized a ten-for-one split of M&T’s common stock.
The additional shares were payable to stockholders of record on September 29 and were distributed on October 5,
2000. In connection with the stock split, the par value of each share of M&T’s common stock was reduced from
$5.00 to $.50. All per share data presented in the consolidated financial statements, including the number of
common shares authorized, issued, issuable or held in treasury, have been stated to give effect to the
ten-for-one stock split.

The accounting and reporting policies of M&T and subsidiaries (“the Company”) conform to generally
accepted accounting principles and to general practices within the banking industry. Certain reclassifications
have been made to prior period financial statements to conform with 2000 financial statement presentation. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
more significant accounting policies are as follows:

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include M&T and all of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The financial statements of M&T included in
note 21 report investments in subsidiaries under the equity method.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

For purposes of this statement, cash and due from banks, Federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities
are considered cash and cash equivalents.

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated
as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at amounts equal to the cash or other consideration
exchanged. It is generally the Company’s policy to take possession of collateral pledged to secure agreements
to resell.

Trading account

Financial instruments used for trading purposes are stated at fair value. Realized gains and losses and
unrealized changes in fair value of financial instruments utilized in trading activities are included in trading
account and foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income.

-72-


M&T BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

1. Significant accounting policies, continued

Investment securities

Investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and stated at amortized cost when management
has the positive intent and ability to hold such securities to maturity. Investments in other debt securities
and equity securities having readily determinable fair values are classified as
available for sale and stated at estimated fair value. Unrealized gains or losses related to investment
securities available for sale are reflected in
accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes.

Other securities are stated at cost and include stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the
Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.

Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts for investment
securities available for sale and held to maturity are included in interest
income. The cost basis of individual securities is written down to estimated
fair value through a charge to earnings when declines in value below
amortized cost are considered to be other than temporary. Realized gains and losses on the sales of investment
securities are determined using the specific identification method.

Loans

Interest income on loans is accrued on a level yield method. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status and
previously accrued interest thereon is charged against income when principal or interest is delinquent 90 days,
unless management determines that the loan status clearly warrants other treatment. Loan balances are charged
off when it becomes evident that such balances are not fully collectible. Loan fees and certain direct loan
origination costs are deferred and recognized as an interest yield adjustment over the life of the loan. Net
deferred fees have been included in unearned discount as a reduction of loans outstanding. Loans held for sale
are
carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair market value. Valuation adjustments made on these loans are
included in mortgage banking revenues.

Except for consumer and residential mortgage loans that are considered smaller balance homogenous loans
and are evaluated collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information
and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual
terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days. Impaired loans are classified as either
nonaccrual or as
loans renegotiated at below market rates. Loans less than 90 days delinquent are deemed to have a minimum delay
in payment and are generally not considered impaired. Impairment of a loan is measured based on the present
value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s observable
market price, or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Interest received on
impaired loans placed on nonaccrual status is applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan or, if principal
is considered fully collectible, recognized as interest income.

Allowance for credit losses

The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in management’s judgment, will be adequate to
absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The adequacy of the
allowance is determined by management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the
differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific
borrowers, the

-73-


M&T BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements, continued

Allowance for credit losses, continued

economic environment in which borrowers operate, any delinquency in payments, and the value of any collateral.

Premises and equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is computed
principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Capitalized servicing rights

Servicing rights retained in a sale or securitization of financial assets are measured at the date of transfer
by allocating the previous carrying amount between the assets transferred and the servicing rights based on
their relative fair values. Servicing assets purchased or servicing liabilities assumed are initially measured
at fair value. Capitalized servicing assets are included in other assets and amortized in proportion to and
over the period of estimated net servicing income.

To estimate the fair value of servicing rights, the Company considers market prices for similar assets
and the present value of expected future
cash flows associated with the servicing rights calculated using assumptions that market participants would use
in estimating future servicing income and expense. Such assumptions include estimates of the cost of servicing
loans, loan default rates, an appropriate discount rate, and prepayment speeds. For purposes of evaluating and
measuring impairment of capitalized servicing rights, the Company stratifies such assets based on predominant
risk characteristics of underlying financial instruments that are expected to have
the most impact on projected prepayments, cost of servicing and other factors affecting future cash flows
associated with the servicing rights. Such factors may include financial asset or loan type, note rate and
term. The amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the capitalized servicing
rights for a stratum exceeds estimated fair value. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance.

Goodwill and core deposit intangible

The excess of the cost of acquired entities or operations over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired
less liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Substantially all of the Company’s goodwill is being
amortized
using the straight-line method over twenty years. Core deposit intangibles are amortized using an accelerated
method over estimated useful lives of seven to ten years. The Company periodically assesses whether events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill and core deposit intangible may be
impaired. Impairment is measured using estimates of future cash flows or earnings potential of the operations
acquired.

Stock-based compensation

Compensation expense is not recognized for stock option awards to employees under the Company’s stock option
plan since the exercise price of options is equal to the market price of the underlying stock at the date of
grant. Compensation expense for stock appreciation rights issued separately from
stock options is recognized based upon changes in the quoted market value of M&T’s common stock. The pro forma
effects of stock-based compensation arrangements are based on the estimated grant date fair value of

Stock-based compensation, continued

stock options that are expected to vest calculated pursuant to the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” Pro forma compensation
expense, net of applicable income tax effect, is recognized over the vesting period.

Income taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects
attributable to differences between the financial statement value of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates and
laws. Investment tax credits related to leveraged leasing property are amortized into income tax expense over
the life of the lease agreement.

Financial futures

Outstanding financial futures contracts represent future commitments and are not included in the consolidated
balance sheet. Futures contracts used in trading activities are marked to market and the resulting gains or
losses are recognized in trading account and foreign exchange gains.

Interest rate swap agreements

For interest rate swap agreements used to manage interest rate risk arising
from financial assets and liabilities, amounts receivable or payable are
recognized as accrued under the terms of the agreement and the net differential, including any amortization of
premiums paid or accretion of discounts received, is recorded as an adjustment to interest income or
expense of the related asset or liability. To qualify for such accounting treatment, an interest rate swap must
(i) be designated as having been entered into for interest rate risk management purposes and linked to a
specific financial instrument or pool of similar financial instruments in the Company’s consolidated balance
sheet and (ii) have interest rate and repricing characteristics that have a sufficient degree of correlation
with the corresponding characteristics of the designated on-balance sheet financial instrument. Gains or losses
resulting from early termination of interest rate swap agreements used to manage interest rate risk are
amortized over the shorter of the remaining term or estimated life of the agreement or the on-balance sheet
financial instrument to which the swap had been linked. Agreements that do not satisfy the requirements noted
above, including those entered into for trading purposes, are marked to market with resulting gains or losses
recorded in trading account and foreign exchange gains.

Earnings per common share

Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders
by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding and common shares issuable under deferred compensation arrangements during the
period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of
common stock that then shared in earnings. Proceeds assumed to have been received on such exercise or
conversion are assumed to be used to purchase shares of M&T common stock at the average

Treasury stock

Repurchases of shares of M&T common stock are recorded at cost as a reduction of stockholders’ equity.
Reissuances of shares of treasury stock are recorded at average cost.

2. Acquisitions

On October 6, 2000, M&T completed the merger of Keystone Financial, Inc. (“Keystone”), a bank holding company
headquartered in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, with and into Olympia Financial Corp. (“Olympia”), a wholly owned
subsidiary of M&T. Following the merger, Keystone Financial Bank, N.A., Keystone’s bank subsidiary, was merged
into Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T Bank”), M&T’s principal banking subsidiary. Keystone
Financial Bank, N.A. operated banking offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia. After application of
the election, allocation and proration procedures contained in the merger agreement with Keystone, M&T paid $375
million in cash and issued 15,900,292 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for the Keystone shares outstanding
at the time of acquisition. In addition, based on the merger agreement and the exchange ratio provided therein,
M&T converted outstanding and unexercised stock options granted by Keystone into options to purchase 1,259,493
shares of M&T common stock. The purchase price of the transaction was approximately $1.0 billion based on the
cash paid to Keystone shareholders, the market price of M&T common shares on May 16, 2000 before the terms of
the merger were agreed to and announced by M&T and Keystone, and the estimated fair value of Keystone stock
options converted into M&T stock options.

Acquired assets, loans and deposits of Keystone on October 6, 2000 totaled approximately $7.4 billion,
$4.8 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively. The transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, operations acquired from Keystone have been included in the Company’s financial
results since the acquisition date. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $494
million of goodwill and $121 million of core deposit intangible. The goodwill is being amortized over twenty
years using the straight-line method and the core deposit intangible is being amortized over seven years using
an accelerated method.

On March 1, 2000, M&T Bank completed the acquisition of Matthews, Bartlett & Dedecker, Inc. (“MBD”), an
insurance agency located in Buffalo, New York for $4.5 million in cash. MBD provides insurance services
principally to the commercial market and operates as a subsidiary of M&T
Bank. The acquisition has not had a material impact on the Company’s financial position or its results of
operations.

On March 31, 2000, The Chase Manhattan Bank (“Chase”) transferred trust and fiduciary accounts with
assets of approximately $147 million to M&T Bank,
completing a transaction that began in September 1999 with M&T Bank’s acquisition from Chase of 29 branch
offices in upstate New York and the investment management and custody accounts associated with those offices.
At the time of closing in September 1999, the branches had approximately $634 million of deposits and
approximately $44 million of retail installment and commercial loans, and the investment management and custody
accounts had assets of approximately $286 million. In connection with the transaction,

-76-


M&T BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements, continued

2. Acquisitions, continued

the Company recorded approximately $55 million of intangible assets that are being amortized over periods
ranging from five to seven years.

On June 1, 1999, M&T
completed the merger of FNB Rochester Corp. (“FNB”), a bank holding company
headquartered in Rochester, New York,
with and into Olympia. Following the merger with FNB, First National Bank of Rochester, a wholly owned
subsidiary of FNB, was merged into M&T Bank. In accordance with the terms of the merger agreements with FNB,
M&T paid $76 million in cash and issued 1,225,160 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for FNB shares
outstanding at the time of the acquisition. The purchase price of the transaction was approximately $135
million based on the cash paid to FNB stockholders and the market price of M&T common shares on December 8, 1998
before the terms of the merger were agreed to and announced
by M&T and FNB. Acquired assets, loans and deposits of FNB on June 1, 1999 totaled approximately $676 million,
$393 million and $511 million, respectively. The transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, operations acquired from FNB have been included in the Company’s financial results
since the acquisition date. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $86 million
of goodwill and $12 million of core deposit intangible. The goodwill is being amortized over twenty years using
the straight-line method and the core deposit intangible is being amortized over eight years using an
accelerated method.

On April 1, 1998, M&T completed the merger of ONBANCorp, Inc. (“ONBANCorp”) with and into Olympia.
Following the merger, OnBank & Trust Co., Syracuse, New York, and Franklin First Savings Bank, Wilkes-Barre,
Pennsylvania, both wholly owned subsidiaries of ONBANCorp, were merged into M&T Bank. After application of the
election, allocation and proration procedures contained in the merger agreement with ONBANCorp, M&T paid $266
million in cash and issued 14,299,980 shares of common stock in exchange for the ONBANCorp common shares
outstanding at the time of acquisition. In addition, based on the merger agreement and the exchange ratio
provided for therein, M&T converted outstanding and unexercised stock options granted by ONBANCorp into options
to purchase 617,720 shares of M&T common stock. The purchase price of the transaction was approximately $873
million based on the cash paid to ONBANCorp stockholders, the market price of M&T common shares on October 28,
1997 before the terms of the merger were agreed to and announced by M&T and ONBANCorp, and the estimated fair
value of ONBANCorp stock options converted into M&T stock options.

Acquired assets, loans and deposits of ONBANCorp on April 1, 1998 totaled approximately $5.5 billion,
$3.0 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. The transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, operations acquired from ONBANCorp have been included in the Company’s financial
results since the acquisition date. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $501
million of goodwill and $61 million of core deposit intangible. The goodwill is being amortized over twenty
years using the straight-line method and the core deposit intangible is being amortized over ten years using an
accelerated method.

In connection with the transactions described herein and in note 22, the Company incurred expenses
related to systems conversions and other costs of integrating and conforming the acquired operations with and
into the Company of approximately $26.0 million ($16.4 million net of applicable income taxes) during 2000,
approximately $4.7 million ($3.0 million net of applicable income taxes) during 1999, and approximately $21.3
million ($14.0 million net of applicable income taxes) during 1998. Expenses related to

systems conversions and other costs of integration are included in the consolidated statement of income for the

The expenses noted above consisted largely of professional services and other temporary help fees
associated with the conversion of systems and/or
integration of operations; recruiting and other incentive compensation; initial marketing and promotion expenses
to introduce the Company to customers of the acquired operations; travel; and printing, supplies and other
costs. Although the systems conversions and integration of operations of Keystone are largely complete, the
Company expects that it will incur some additional Keystone integration costs. However, the amount of additional costs is not expected to be significant. Furthermore, the Company also expects to incur costs of a
nature similar to those described above in connection with the February 2001 merger with Premier National
Bancorp, Inc. described in note 22.

Presented herein is certain unaudited pro forma information for 2000 as if Keystone had been acquired on
January 1, 2000 and for 1999 as if Keystone and FNB had been acquired on January 1, 1999. These results combine
the historical results of Keystone and FNB into the Company’s consolidated
statement of income and, while certain adjustments were made for the estimated impact of purchase accounting
adjustments and other acquisition-related activity, they are not necessarily indicative of what would have
occurred had the acquisitions taken place at that time. In particular, expenses related to systems conversions
and other costs of integration
associated with the acquisition of Keystone are included in the 2000 periods in which such costs were incurred
and, additionally, the Company expects to achieve further operating cost savings as a result of the mergers
which are not reflected in the pro forma amounts presented. Proforma information related to the acquisition of
MBD is not presented since MBD’s financial position and results of operations were not material to the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

4. Loans and leases

Total gross loans and leases outstanding were comprised of the following:

One-to-four family residential mortgage loans held for sale were $525.1 million at December 31, 2000 and
$238.7 million at December 31, 1999. One-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled
approximately $9.7 billion and $7.2 billion at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. As of December 31,
2000, approximately $19 million of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced for others have been
sold with recourse. The total credit loss exposure resulting from residential mortgage loans sold with recourse
was considered negligible. Commercial mortgage loans serviced for others totaled approximately $458 million and
$289 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Included in the preceding table are nonperforming loans (loans on which interest was not being accrued
or had been renegotiated at below-market interest rates) of $110,639,000 at December 31, 2000 and $72,169,000 at
December 31, 1999. If nonaccrual and renegotiated loans had been accruing interest at their originally
contracted terms, interest income on these loans would have amounted to $9,289,000 in 2000 and $8,998,000 in
1999. The actual amount included in interest income during 2000 and 1999 on these loans was $2,108,000 and
$1,589,000, respectively.

The recorded investment in loans considered impaired was $80,773,000 and $45,124,000 at December 31,
2000 and 1999, respectively. The recorded investment in loans for which there was a related valuation allowance
for impairment included in the allowance for credit losses and the amount of such impairment allowance were
$36,602,000 and $11,542,000, respectively, at December 31, 2000 and $24,536,000 and $6,005,000, respectively, at
December 31, 1999. The recorded investment in loans considered impaired for which
there was no related valuation allowance for impairment was $44,171,000 and $20,588,000 at December 31, 2000 and
1999, respectively. The average recorded investment in impaired loans during 2000, 1999 and 1998 was
$47,475,000, $43,858,000 and $42,485,000, respectively. Interest income recognized on impaired loans totaled
$2,947,000, $3,324,000 and $2,351,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Borrowings by directors and certain officers of M&T and its banking subsidiaries, and by associates of
such persons, exclusive of loans aggregating less than $60,000, amounted to $132,356,000 and $124,185,000 at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. During 2000, new borrowings by

-81-

such persons amounted to $51,718,000 (including borrowings of new directors or officers that were outstanding at
the time of their election) and repayments and other reductions were $43,547,000.

At December 31, 2000, approximately $3.1 billion of commercial mortgage loans and one-to-four family
residential mortgage loans were pledged to secure outstanding borrowings.

5. Allowance for credit losses

Changes in the allowance for credit losses were as follows:

6. Premises and equipment

The detail of premises and equipment was as follows:

Net lease expense for all operating leases totaled $27,849,000 in 2000, $24,168,000 in 1999 and
$20,607,000 in 1998. The Company occupies certain banking offices and uses certain equipment under
noncancellable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates over the next 20 years. Minimum

lease payments under noncancellable operating leases are summarized as follows:

Payments required under capital leases are not material.

7. Capitalized servicing assets

Changes in capitalized servicing assets were as follows:

During 2000 the Company securitized approximately $1.0 billion of one-to-four family residential
mortgage loans previously held in the Company’s loan portfolio. In connection with the securitization
transaction, the Company allocated $14.3 million of the carrying value of the loans to capitalized servicing
assets. Such amount is included above in capitalized servicing assets from originations.

As a result of impairment of certain strata of capitalized servicing assets additions to the valuation
allowance totaling $1,000,000 were recorded during 1998. During 1999, the valuation allowance was reduced by
$1,748,000 since for most strata the estimated fair value of capitalized servicing assets exceeded carrying
value. The estimated fair value of capitalized servicing assets was approximately $147 million at December 31,
2000 and $107 million at December 31, 1999. Such amounts were estimated using discounted cash flows that
reflect current prepayment and discount rate assumptions as of each year-end.

$30,000,000 at its discretion through December 14, 2001. At December 31, 2000, M&T Bank had borrowing
facilities available with the Federal Home Loan Banks whereby M&T Bank could borrow up to $3,327,048,000.
Additionally, M&T Bank and M&T Bank, National Association (“M&T Bank, N.A.”), a wholly owned subsidiary of M&T,
had available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York totaling approximately $1.4 billion,
under which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2000 or 1999. M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. are
required to pledge loans or investment securities as collateral for these borrowing facilities.

Long-term borrowings were as follows:

The subordinated notes of M&T Bank are unsecured and are subordinate to the claims of depositors and
other creditors of M&T Bank. The senior medium term notes were issued in 1997 and 1998 by Keystone Financial
Mid-Atlantic Funding Corp., previously a wholly owned subsidiary of Keystone, but now a wholly owned subsidiary
of Olympia. The notes provide for semi-annual interest payments at fixed rates of interest and are guaranteed
by Olympia.

Long-term variable rate advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks had contractual interest rates that
ranged from 6.56% to 6.83% at December 31, 2000 and from 6.00% to 6.25% at December 31, 1999. The
weighted-average contractual interest rates were 6.74% and 6.13% at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Long-term fixed-rate advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks had contractual interest rates ranging from 4.05%
to 8.29% at December 31, 2000 and from 4.05% to 8.45% at December 31,1999. The weighted-average

contractual interest rates payable were 5.67% and 5.93% at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Advances
from the Federal Home Loan Banks mature at various dates through 2029 and are secured by residential and
commercial real estate loans.

In January 1997, M&T Capital Trust I (“Trust I”) issued $150 million of 8.234% preferred capital
securities. In June 1997, M&T Capital Trust II (“Trust II”) issued $100 million of 8.277% preferred capital
securities. In February 1997, M&T Capital Trust III (“Trust III” and, together with Trust I and Trust II, the
“Trusts”), a business trust organized by ONBANCorp prior to its acquisition by M&T, issued $60 million of 9.25%
preferred capital securities. The financial statement carrying value of the preferred capital securities of
Trust III include the unamortized portion of a purchase accounting adjustment to reflect estimated fair value at
the April 1, 1998 acquisition of ONBANCorp.

Other than the following payment terms (and the redemption terms described below), the preferred capital
securities issued by the Trusts (“Capital Securities”) are identical in all material respects:

The common securities of Trust I and II are wholly owned by M&T and the common securities of Trust III
are wholly owned by Olympia. The common securities of each trust (“Common Securities”) are the only class of
each
trust’s securities possessing general voting powers. The Capital Securities represent preferred undivided
interests in the assets of the corresponding
trust and are classified in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as long-term borrowings with accumulated
distributions on such securities included in
interest expense. Under the Federal Reserve Board’s current risk-based capital guidelines, the Capital
Securities are includable in M&T’s Tier 1 capital.

The proceeds from the issuances of the Capital Securities and Common Securities were used by the Trusts
to purchase the following amounts of

Holders of the Capital Securities receive preferential cumulative cash distributions semi-annually on
each distribution date at the stated distribution rate unless M&T, in the case of Trust I or Trust II, or
Olympia, in the case of Trust III, exercise the right to extend the payment of interest on the Junior
Subordinated Debentures for up to ten semi-annual periods, in which case payment of distributions on the Capital
Securities will be deferred for a comparable period. During an extended interest period, M&T and/or Olympia may
not pay dividends or distributions on, or repurchase, redeem or acquire any shares of the respective company’s
capital
stock. The agreements governing the Capital Securities, in the aggregate, provide a full, irrevocable and
unconditional guarantee by M&T in the case of Trust I or Trust II, or Olympia, in the case of Trust III, of the
payment of
distributions on, the redemption of, and any liquidation distribution with respect to the Capital Securities.
The obligations under such guarantee and
the Capital Securities are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all senior indebtedness of M&T and
Olympia.

The Capital Securities are mandatorily redeemable in whole, but not in part, upon repayment at the stated
maturity dates of the Junior Subordinated Debentures or the earlier redemption of the Junior Subordinated
Debentures in
whole upon the occurrence of one or more events (“Events”) set forth in the indentures relating to the Capital
Securities, and in whole or in part at any time after the stated optional redemption dates (February 1, 2007 in
the case of Trust I and Trust III, and June 1, 2007 in the case of Trust II) contemporaneously with the
Company’s optional redemption of the related Junior Subordinated Debentures in whole or in part. The Junior
Subordinated
Debentures are redeemable prior to their stated maturity dates at M&T’s option in the case of Trust I and Trust
II and Olympia’s option in the case of Trust III (i) on or after the stated optional redemption dates, in whole

regulatory approval. The redemption price of the Capital Securities upon
early redemption will be expressed as a percentage of the liquidation amount plus accumulated but unpaid
distributions. In the case of Trust I, such percentage adjusts annually and ranges from 104.117% at February 1,
2007 to 100.412% for the annual period ending January 31, 2017, after which the percentage is 100%, subject to a
make-whole amount if the early redemption occurs prior to February 1, 2007. In the case of Trust II, such
percentage adjusts annually and ranges from 104.139% at June 1, 2007 to 100.414% for the annual period ending
May 31, 2017, after which the percentage is 100%, subject to a make-whole amount if the early redemption occurs

Long-term borrowings at December 31, 2000 mature as follows:

9. Stock-based compensation plans

Stock option plan

The stock option plan allows the grant of stock options and stock appreciation rights (either in tandem with
options or independently) at
prices which may not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Except as
described below, awards granted under the stock option plan generally vest over four years and are exercisable
over terms not exceeding ten years and one day from the date of grant. When exercisable, the stock appreciation
rights issued in tandem with stock
options entitle grantees to receive cash, stock or a combination equal to the amount of stock appreciation
between the dates of grant and exercise. Stock appreciation rights that had been issued independently of stock
options contained similar terms as the stock options, although upon exercise the holder was only entitled to
receive cash instead of purchasing shares of M&T’s common stock.

In 1999, the Company granted options to substantially all employees who had not previously received
awards under the stock option plan. The options granted under this award vest three years after the grant date
and are exercisable for a period of seven years thereafter.

The Company used a binomial option pricing model to estimate the grant date present value of stock
options granted in 2000, 1999 and 1998. The weighted-average estimated value per option was $13.37 in 2000,
$11.58 in 1999 and $11.46 in 1998. The values were calculated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
an option term of 6.5 years (representing the estimated period between grant date and exercise date based on
historical data since inception of the plan); a risk-free interest rate of 6.80% in

2000, 4.97% in 1999 and 5.53% in 1998 (representing the yield on a U.S. Treasury security with a remaining term
equal to the expected option term);
expected volatility of 22% in 2000, 19% in 1999 and 14% in 1998; and estimated dividend yields of 1.19% in 2000,
 .85% in 1999 and .72% in 1998 (representing the approximate annualized cash dividend rate paid with respect to a
share of common stock at or near the grant date). The Company reduced the estimated value per option to reflect
an estimate of the probability of forfeiture prior to vesting. Based on historical data since inception of the
plan and projected employee turnover rates, the weighted-average estimated forfeiture rate was 10% in 2000 and
1998, and 21% in 1999.

The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations in accounting for the stock option
plan. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized in 2000, 1999 and 1998 for stock option awards since
the exercise price of stock options granted under the stock option plan was not less than the fair market value
of the common stock at date of grant.
Compensation expense (benefit) recognized for cash-only stock appreciation rights was $976,000 in 2000,
$(2,199,000) in 1999, and $2,238,000 in 1998. Had compensation expense for stock option awards been determined
consistent
with SFAS No. 123, net income and earnings per share would be reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated as
follows:

The pro forma effects are presented in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 123, however, such
effects are not representative of the effects to be reported in future years due to the fact that options vest
over several years and additional awards generally are made each year.

Deferred bonus plan

The Company provides a deferred bonus plan to eligible employees pursuant to which employees may elect to defer
all or a portion of their current annual incentive compensation awards and allocate such awards to several
investment options, including M&T common stock. Participants may elect the timing of distributions from the
plan. Such distributions are payable in cash with the exception of balances allocated to M&T common stock which
are distributable in the form of M&T common stock. Shares of M&T common stock distributable pursuant to the
terms of the deferred bonus plan were 88,543 and 83,970 at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In
connection with the deferred bonus plan, 150,000 shares of M&T common stock were authorized for issuance, of
which 23,399 shares have been issued.

Directors’ stock plan

Effective January 1, 1998, the Company initiated a compensation plan for non-employee directors that provides
for annual compensation payable to such directors to be paid fifty percent in cash and fifty percent in shares
of M&T common stock. During 2000, the plan was amended to also allow the directors to elect, at their option, to
receive all of their compensation in shares of M&T common stock. In connection with the directors’ stock plan,
50,000 shares of M&T common stock were authorized for issuance, of which 18,000 shares have been issued.

Management stock ownership program

Keystone had a management stock ownership program which established stock ownership goals for senior management
of Keystone. In order to assist senior management in attaining their goals, a related plan provided for
nonrecourse, noninterest-bearing loans to be used to purchase Keystone common stock at fair market value. The
Company acquired these loans as a result of the Keystone transaction. The loans are secured by collateral
having an initial value of 120% of the loan amount and consisting of M&T common stock (Keystone stock purchased
with the loan) plus additional shares of stock or other acceptable collateral owned by the executive. At
December 31, 2000, the amount owed M&T for the financed stock purchased totaled $4,713,000 and is classified as
a reduction of additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet. The amounts are due to M&T no
later than October 5, 2010.

The Company has a retirement savings plan (“Savings Plan”) that is a defined contribution plan in which
eligible employees of the Company may defer up to 15% of qualified compensation via contributions to the plan.
The Company makes an employer matching contribution in an amount equal to 75% of an employee’s contribution, up
to 4.5% of the employee’s qualified compensation. Employees’ accounts, including employee contributions,
employer matching contributions and accumulated earnings thereon, are at all times fully vested and
nonforfeitable. The Company’s contributions to the Savings Plan totaled $7,699,000, $6,935,000 and $6,085,000
in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

M&T BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements, continued

11. Income taxes, continued

The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return reflecting taxable income earned by all
subsidiaries. In prior years, applicable federal tax law allowed certain financial institutions the option of
deducting as bad debt expense for tax purposes amounts in excess of actual losses. In accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, such financial institutions were not required to provide deferred income taxes
on such excess. Recapture of the excess tax bad debt reserve established under the previously allowed method
will result in taxable income if M&T Bank fails to maintain bank status as defined in the Internal Revenue Code
or charges are made to the reserve for other than bad debt losses. At December 31, 2000 M&T Bank’s tax bad debt
reserve for which no federal income taxes have been provided was $74,021,000. No actions are planned that would
cause this reserve to become wholly or partially taxable.

The portion of income taxes attributable to gains or losses on sales of bank investment securities was a
benefit of $1,216,000 in 2000, and an expense of $639,000 and $718,000 in 1999 and 1998, respectively. No
alternative minimum tax expense was recognized in 2000, 1999 or 1998.

Total income taxes differed from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to
pre-tax income as follows:

In January 1998, M&T contributed appreciated investment securities with a fair value of $24.6 million to
an affiliated, tax-exempt private charitable foundation. As a result of this transfer, the Company
recognized tax-exempt other income of $15.3 million and incurred charitable contributions expense of $24.6
million. These amounts are included in the consolidated statement of income in “Other revenues from
operations” and “Other costs of operations,” respectively. The transfer provided an income tax benefit of
approximately $10.0 million and, accordingly, resulted in an after-tax increase in net income of $.7
million.

15. International activities

The Company engages in certain international activities consisting largely of collecting Eurodollar deposits,
engaging in foreign currency trading and providing credit to support the international activities of domestic
companies. Net assets identified with international activities amounted to
$7,209,000 and $27,203,000 at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Deposits at M&T Bank’s offshore branch
office were $244,511,000 and $242,691,000 at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

16. Derivative financial instruments

As part of managing interest rate risk, the Company has entered into several interest rate swap agreements. The
swaps modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of the Company’s portfolios of earning assets and
interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate swap agreements are generally entered into with counterparties that
meet established credit standards and most contain collateral provisions protecting the at-risk party. The
Company considers the credit risk inherent in these contracts to be negligible.

Information about interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management
purposes summarized by type of financial instrument the swaps were intended to modify follows:

Under the terms of these swaps, the Company receives settlement amounts at a variable rate and pays at a

The notional amounts of amortizing swaps may vary over the term of a swap agreement. The notional amount
of a non-amortizing swap does not change during the term of an agreement. The estimated fair value of interest
rate swap agreements represents the amount the Company would have expected to receive (pay) to terminate such
contracts. The estimated fair value of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management
purposes have not been recognized in the consolidated financial statements, except for swaps that modify the
repricing characteristics of investment securities classified as available for sale. Changes in the fair value
of such swaps and investment securities are included in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income
taxes.

At December 31, 2000 the notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding mature as follows:

The net effect of interest rate swaps was to increase net interest income by $13,000 in 2000,
$26,100,000 in 1999 and $16,156,000 in 1998. Excluding forward-starting swaps, the average notional amount of
interest rate swaps impacting net interest income which were entered into for interest rate risk management
purposes were $875,933,000 in 2000, $1,944,813,000 in 1999 and $2,521,426,000 in 1998.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as
amended, as of January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 requires that the fair value of all derivative financial
instruments be recognized in an entity’s balance sheet. If specific conditions are met, a derivative may be
designated as a hedge of certain transactions. The Company anticipates that adoption of SFAS No. 133 could
increase the volatility of reported earnings and stockholders’ equity in future periods. Nevertheless, the
initial impact of adopting SFAS No. 133 as of January 1, 2001 was not considered material to the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

In anticipation of M&T Bank’s issuance of $500 million of fixed rate subordinated capital notes in
October 2000, the Company terminated certain interest rate swap agreements, including forward-starting swaps,
with an aggregate notional amount of $421 million. Under the terms of the terminated swaps, the Company was
required to make fixed-rate payments and receive variable-rate payments. The termination of the swaps, which
had been entered
into to hedge interest rate risk associated with fixed-rate commercial real
estate loans, resulted in a net deferred gain of $15,460,000 which will be recognized in income over the
designated hedge period of the swaps. Income recognized in 2000 related to the swap terminations totaled
$311,000. The net increase in interest income in future years from amortization of the
deferred gain relating to the interest rate swap terminations is as follows:

Derivative financial instruments used for trading purposes included foreign exchange and other option
contracts, foreign exchange forward and spot contracts, interest rate swap contracts and financial futures. The

following table includes information about the estimated fair value of
derivative financial instruments used for trading purposes:

Net gains realized from derivative financial instruments used for trading purposes were $1,597,000 and
$2,648,000 in 2000 and 1998, respectively. Net losses of $1,699,000 were incurred in 1999.

17. Disclosures about fair value of financial instruments

SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,” requires disclosure of the estimated
“fair value” of financial instruments. “Fair value” is generally defined as the price a willing buyer and a
willing seller would exchange for a financial instrument in other than a distressed sale situation. Disclosures
related to fair value presented herein are as of December 31, 2000 and 1999.

With the exception of marketable securities, certain off-balance sheet
financial instruments and one-to-four family residential mortgage loans
originated for sale, the Company’s financial instruments are not readily marketable and market prices do not
exist. The Company, in attempting to comply with the provisions of SFAS No. 107, has not attempted to market
its
financial instruments to potential buyers, if any exist. Since negotiated prices in illiquid markets depend
greatly upon the then present motivations of the buyer and seller, it is reasonable to assume that actual sales
prices
could vary widely from any estimate of fair value made without the benefit of negotiations. Additionally,
changes in market interest rates can dramatically impact the value of financial instruments in a short period of time.

The estimated fair values of investments in readily marketable debt and equity securities were based on
quoted market prices at the respective year-end. In arriving at estimated fair value of other financial
instruments, the
Company generally used calculations based upon discounted cash flows of the related financial instruments. In
general, discount rates used for loan
products were based on the Company’s pricing at the respective year-end. A
higher discount rate was assumed with respect to estimated cash flows
associated with nonaccrual loans.

As more fully described in note 3, the carrying value and estimated fair value of investment securities
were as follows:

The following table presents the carrying value and calculated estimates of fair value of loans and
commitments related to loans originated for sale:

The allowance for credit losses represented the Company’s assessment of the overall level of credit risk
inherent in the portfolio and totaled $374,703,000 and $316,165,000 at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

As described in note 18, in the normal course of business, various
commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding, such as loan
commitments, credit guarantees and letters of credit. The Company’s pricing
of such financial instruments is based largely on credit quality and relationship, probability of funding and
other requirements. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and contain termination and other clauses
which provide for relief from funding in the event of significant deterioration in the credit quality of the
customer. The rates and terms of the Company’s loan commitments, credit guarantees and letters of credit are
competitive with other financial institutions operating in markets served by the Company. The Company believes
that the carrying amounts are reasonable estimates of the fair value of these financial instruments. Such
carrying amounts, comprised principally of unamortized fee income, are included in
other liabilities and totaled $8,624,000 and $5,434,000 at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

SFAS No. 107 requires that the estimated fair value ascribed to noninterest-bearing deposits, savings
deposits and NOW accounts be established at carrying value because of the customers’ ability to withdraw
funds immediately. Additionally, time deposit accounts are required to be

revalued based upon prevailing market interest rates for similar maturity instruments.

The following summarizes the results of these calculations:

The Company believes that deposit accounts have a value greater than that prescribed by SFAS No. 107.
The Company feels, however, that the value associated with these deposits is greatly influenced by
characteristics of the buyer, such as the ability to reduce the costs of servicing the deposits and deposit
attrition which often occurs following an acquisition. Accordingly, estimating the fair value of deposits with
any degree of certainty is not practical.

As more fully described in note 16, the Company had entered into
interest rate swap agreements for purposes of managing the Company’s exposure to changing interest rates. The
estimated fair value of interest rate swap
agreements represents the amount the Company would have expected to receive or pay to terminate such swaps. The
following table includes information about the estimated fair value of interest rate swaps entered into for
interest rate risk management purposes:

As described in note 16, the Company also uses certain derivative financial instruments as part of its
trading activities. Interest rate contracts entered into for trading purposes had notional values and estimated
fair value losses of $769 million and $81,000, respectively, at December 31, 2000 and notional values and
estimated fair value losses of $799 million and $515,000, respectively, at December 31, 1999. The Company also
entered into
foreign exchange and other option and futures contracts totaling approximately $293 million and $573 million at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Such contracts were valued at losses of $444,000 and $2,700,000 at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. All trading account assets and liabilities are recorded in the
consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair value. The fair values of all trading account assets and
liabilities were $37 million and $22 million, respectively, at December 31, 2000 and $641 million and $633
million, respectively, at December 31, 1999. Included in trading account assets at December 31, 1999 were
mortgage-backed

securities which M&T held as collateral securing certain agreements to resell securities. The obligations to
return such collateral were recorded as
noninterest-bearing trading account liabilities and were included in accrued interest and other liabilities in
the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of such collateral (and the related obligation to
return collateral) was $600 million at December 31, 1999.

Due to the near maturity of other money-market assets and short-term
borrowings, the Company estimates that the carrying value of such instruments approximates estimated fair
value. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term borrowings were $3,414,516,000 and
$3,392,049,000, respectively, at December 31, 2000 and $1,775,133,000 and $1,753,612,000, respectively, at
December 31, 1999.

The Company does not believe that the estimated fair value information
presented herein is representative of the earnings power or value of the Company. The preceding analysis, which
is inherently limited in depicting fair value, also does not consider any value associated with existing
customer relationships nor the ability of the Company to create value through
loan origination, deposit gathering or fee generating activities.

Many of the fair value estimates presented herein are based upon the use of highly subjective information
and assumptions and, accordingly, the results may not be precise. Management believes that fair value estimates
may not be comparable between financial institutions due to the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and
numerous estimates which must be made.

Furthermore, since the disclosed fair value amounts were estimated as of the balance sheet date, the
amounts actually realized or paid upon maturity
or settlement of the various financial instruments could be significantly different.

18. Commitments and contingencies

In the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding, such as
commitments to extend credit guarantees and “standby” letters of credit (approximately $894,170,000 and
$522,356,000 at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively) which are not reflected in the consolidated financial
statements. No material losses are expected as a result of these transactions. Additionally, the Company had
outstanding commitments to originate loans of approximately $5.0 billion and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2000
and 1999, respectively. Since many loan commitments, credit guarantees and “standby” letters of credit expire
without being funded in whole or part, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash
flows. Commitments to sell one-to-four family residential mortgage loans totaled $555,411,000 at December 31,
2000 and $376,874,000 at December 31, 1999.

M&T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course of business to various pending and threatened
legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. Management, after consultation with legal
counsel, does not anticipate that the aggregate ultimate liability, if any, arising out of litigation pending
against M&T or its subsidiaries will be material to the Company’s consolidated financial position, but at the
present time is not in a position to determine whether such litigation will have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s consolidated results of operations in any future reporting period.

19. Segment information

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information,” reportable segments have been determined based upon the Company’s internal profitability reporting
system, which is organized by strategic business units. Certain strategic
business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products
and services, the type of customer and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The
reportable
segments are Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking
and Retail Banking.

The financial information of the Company’s segments has been compiled utilizing the accounting policies
described in note 1 with certain exceptions. The more significant of these exceptions are described herein.
The Company allocates interest income or interest expense using a methodology
that charges users of funds (assets) interest expense and credits providers of funds (liabilities) with income
based on the maturity, prepayment and/or
repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities. The net effect of this allocation is recorded in the
“All Other” category. A provision for
credit losses is allocated to segments in an amount based largely on actual net charge-offs incurred by the
segment during the period plus or minus an amount necessary to adjust the segment’s allowance for credit losses
due to changes in loan balances. In contrast, the level of the consolidated
provision for credit losses is determined using the methodologies described in note 1 to assess the overall
adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Indirect fixed and variable expenses incurred by certain
centralized support areas are allocated to segments based on actual usage (for example, volume measurements) and
other criteria. Certain types of administrative expenses and bankwide expense accruals (including amortization
of goodwill and core deposit intangible) are generally not allocated to segments. Income taxes are allocated to
segments based on the Company’s marginal statutory tax rate adjusted for any tax-exempt income or non-deductible
expenses. Equity is allocated to the segments based on regulatory capital requirements and in proportion to an
assessment of the inherent risks associated with the business of the segment (including interest, credit and
operating risk).

The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are
highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to generally
accepted accounting principles. As a result, reported segment results are not necessarily comparable with
similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or
allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. Information
about the Company’s segments is presented in the accompanying table.

The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products and banking services for
middle-market and large commercial customers, largely within the markets the Company serves. Among the services
provided by this segment are commercial lending and leasing, deposit products and cash management services. The
Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit services which are secured by various types of multifamily
residential and commercial real estate and deposit services to its customers. The
Discretionary Portfolio segment includes securities, residential mortgage loans and other assets; short-term and
long-term borrowed funds; brokered
certificates of deposit and interest rate swaps related thereto; and offshore
branch deposits. This segment also provides services to commercial customers and consumers which include
foreign exchange, securities trading and municipal bond underwriting and sales. The Residential Mortgage
Banking

segment originates and services residential mortgage loans for consumers and sells substantially all of those
loans in the secondary market to investors
or to banking subsidiaries of M&T. Residential mortgage loans held for sale
are included in the Residential Mortgage Banking segment. The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of
consumer and small business services through
several delivery channels which include traditional and “in-store” banking offices, automated teller machines,
telephone banking and internet banking. The “All Other” category includes other operating activities of the
Company that are not directly attributable to the reported segments as determined in accordance with SFAS No.
131, the difference between the provision for credit losses and the calculated provision allocated to the
reportable segments, goodwill and core deposit intangible resulting from acquisitions of financial institutions,
the net impact of the Company’s internal funds transfer pricing methodology, eliminations of transactions
between reportable segments, certain nonrecurring transactions, the residual effects of unallocated support
systems and general and administrative expenses, and the impact of interest rate risk management strategies.
The amount of intersegment activity eliminated in arriving at consolidated totals was included in the “All
Other” category as follows:

Net interest income is the difference between actual taxable-equivalent interest earned on assets and interest
paid on liabilities owned by a segment and a funding charge (credit) based on the Company’s internal funds
transfer pricing methodology. Segments are charged a cost to fund any assets (e.g. loans) and are paid a
funding credit for any funds provided (e.g. deposits). The taxable-equivalent adjustment aggregated
$10,547,000 in 2000, $7,710,000 in 1999 and $7,186,000 in 1998 and is eliminated in “All Other” net interest
income and income tax expense (benefit).

20. Regulatory matters

Payment of dividends by M&T’s banking subsidiaries is restricted by various legal and regulatory limitations.
Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in
the current year and the preceding two years. For purposes of this test, at December 31, 2000, approximately
$496,319,000 was available for payment of dividends to M&T from banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory
approval.

Banking regulations prohibit extensions of credit by the subsidiary banks to M&T unless appropriately
secured by assets. Securities of
affiliates are not eligible as collateral for this purpose.

The banking subsidiaries are required to maintain noninterest-earning reserves against certain deposit
liabilities. During the maintenance periods that included December 31, 2000 and 1999, cash and due from banks
included a daily average of $242,028,000 and $180,666,000, respectively, for such purpose.

Federal regulators have adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies and banks.
Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional
discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on the Company’s
financial statements. Under the capital adequacy guidelines, the so-called “Tier 1 capital” and “Total capital”
as a percentage of risk-weighted assets and certain off-balance sheet financial instruments must be at least 4% and 8%, respectively.
In addition to these risk-based measures, regulators also require banking institutions that meet certain
qualitative criteria to maintain a minimum “leverage” ratio of “Tier 1 capital” to average total assets,
adjusted for goodwill and certain other items, of at least 3% to be considered adequately capitalized. As of
December 31, 2000, M&T and each of its banking subsidiaries exceeded all applicable capital
adequacy requirements.

As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the most recent notifications from
federal regulators categorized each of M&T’s banking subsidiaries as well capitalized under the regulatory
framework for prompt corrective action.
To be considered well capitalized, a banking institution must maintain Tier 1 risk-based capital, total
risk-based capital and leverage ratios of at least 6%, 10% and 5%, respectively. Management is unaware of any
conditions or events since the latest notifications from federal regulators that have changed the capital
adequacy category of M&T’s banking subsidiaries.

On February 9, 2001, M&T completed the merger of Premier National Bancorp, Inc. (“Premier”), a bank holding
company headquartered in Lagrangeville, New York, with and into Olympia. Following the merger, Premier National
Bank, Premier’s bank subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank. Premier National Bank operated 34 banking offices in
the mid-Hudson Valley region of New York State. At December 31, 2000, Premier had approximately $1.6 billion of
assets, including $1.0 billion of loans, and approximately $1.4 billion of liabilities, including $1.3 billion
of deposits. The transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the
operations acquired from Premier will be included in M&T’s financial results subsequent to the acquisition
date. Premier’s stockholders received approximately $171 million in cash and 2,441,000 shares of M&T common
stock
in exchange for the Premier shares outstanding at the time of the acquisition. In addition, M&T converted
outstanding and unexercised stock options granted by Premier into options to purchase 225,000 shares of M&T
common stock.
