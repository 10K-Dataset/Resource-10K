Item 1.

Business.

M

&

T Bank Corporation
    (“Registrant” or
    “M

&

T”) is a
    New York business corporation which is registered as a bank
    holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
    amended (“BHCA”) and under

Article III-A

of the New York Banking Law (“Banking Law”). The
    principal executive offices of the Registrant are located at One
    M

&

T Plaza, Buffalo, New
    York 14203. The Registrant was incorporated in November 1969.
    The Registrant and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are
    collectively referred to herein as the “Company.” As
    of December 31, 2006 the Company had consolidated total
    assets of $57.1 billion, deposits of $39.9 billion and
    stockholders’ equity of $6.3 billion. The Company had
    11,904 full-time and 1,448 part-time employees as of
    December 31, 2006.

At December 31, 2006, the Registrant had two wholly owned
    bank subsidiaries: M

&

T
    Bank and M

&

T Bank,
    National Association
    (“M

&

T Bank,
    N.A.”). The banks collectively offer a wide range of
    commercial banking, trust and investment services to their
    customers. At December 31, 2006,
    M

&

T Bank represented
    99% of consolidated assets of the Company.
    M

&

T Bank operates
    branch offices in New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia,
    West Virginia, Delaware and the District of Columbia.

The Company from time to time considers acquiring banks, thrift
    institutions, branch offices of banks or thrift institutions, or
    other businesses within markets currently served by the Company
    or in other locations that would complement the Company’s
    business or its geographic reach. The Company has pursued
    acquisition opportunities in the past, continues to review
    different opportunities, including the possibility of major
    acquisitions, and intends to continue this practice.

Relationship
    With Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c.

On April 1, 2003,
    M

&

T completed the
    acquisition of Allfirst Financial Inc. (“Allfirst”), a
    bank holding company headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland from
    Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c. (“AIB”). Under the terms of
    the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated
    September 26, 2002 by and among AIB, Allfirst and
    M

&

T (the
    “Reorganization Agreement”),
    M

&

T combined with
    Allfirst through the acquisition of all of the issued and
    outstanding Allfirst stock in exchange for
    26,700,000 shares of
    M

&

T common stock and
    $886,107,000 in cash paid to AIB. In addition, there were
    several M

&

T corporate
    governance changes that resulted from the transaction. While it
    maintains a significant ownership in
    M

&

T, AIB will have
    representation on the
    M

&

T board, the
    M

&

T Bank board and key
    M

&

T board committees
    and will have certain protections of its rights as a substantial
    M

&

T shareholder. In
    addition, AIB will have rights that will facilitate its ability
    to maintain its proportionate ownership position in
    M

&

T.
    M

&

T will also have
    representation on the AIB board while AIB remains a significant
    shareholder. The following is a description of the ongoing
    relationship between
    M

&

T and AIB. The
    following description is qualified in its entirety by the terms
    of the Reorganization Agreement. The Reorganization Agreement
    was filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on
    October 3, 2002 as Exhibit 2 to the Current Report on

Form 8-K

of M

&

T dated
    September 26, 2002.

Board of
    Directors; Management

At December 31, 2006, AIB held approximately 24.2% of the
    issued and outstanding shares of
    M

&

T common stock. In
    defining their relationship after the acquisition,
    M

&

T and AIB negotiated
    certain agreements regarding share ownership and corporate
    governance issues such as board representation, with the number
    of AIB’s representatives on the
    M

&

T and
    M

&

T Bank boards of
    directors being dependent upon the amount of
    M

&

T common stock held
    by AIB. M

&

T has the
    right to one seat on the AIB board of directors until AIB no
    longer holds at least 15% of the outstanding shares of
    M

&

T common stock.
    Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, AIB has the right to
    name four members to serve on the Boards of Directors of
    M

&

T and
    M

&

T Bank, each of whom
    must be reasonably acceptable to
    M

&

T (collectively, the
    “AIB Designees”). Further, one of the AIB Designees
    will serve on each of the Executive Committee, Nomination,
    Compensation and Governance Committee, and Audit and Risk
    Committee (or any committee or committees performing comparable
    functions) of the M

&

T
    board of directors. In order to serve, the AIB Designees must
    meet the requisite independence and expertise requirements
    prescribed under applicable law or stock exchange rules. In
    addition, the Reorganization Agreement provides that the board
    of directors of M

&

T
    Bank will include four members designated by AIB, each of whom
    must be reasonably acceptable to
    M

&

T.



As long as AIB remains a significant shareholder of
    M

&

T, AIB will have
    representation on the boards of directors of both
    M

&

T and
    M

&

T Bank as follows:

•

As long as AIB holds at least 15% of the outstanding shares of
    M

&

T common stock, AIB
    will be entitled to designate four persons on both the
    M

&

T and
    M

&

T Bank boards of
    directors and representation on the committees of the
    M

&

T board described
    above.

•

If AIB holds at least 10%, but less than 15%, of the outstanding
    shares of M

&

T common
    stock, AIB will be entitled to designate at least two people on
    both the M

&

T and
    M

&

T Bank boards of
    directors.

•

If AIB’s ownership interest in
    M

&

T is at least 5%, but
    less than 10%, of the outstanding shares of
    M

&

T common stock, AIB
    will be entitled to designate at least one person on both the
    M

&

T and
    M

&

T Bank boards of
    directors.

•

As long as AIB holds at least 15% of the outstanding shares of
    M

&

T common stock,
    neither M

&

T’s
    board of directors nor
    M

&

T Bank’s board
    of directors will consist of more than twenty-eight directors
    without the consent of the AIB Designees.

•

If AIB’s holdings of
    M

&

T common stock fall
    below 15%, but not lower than 12% of the outstanding shares of
    M

&

T common stock, AIB
    will continue to have the same rights that it would have had if
    it owned 15% of the outstanding shares of
    M

&

T common stock, as
    long as AIB restores its ownership percentage to 15% within one
    year. Additionally, as described in more detail below,
    M

&

T has agreed to
    repurchase shares of
    M

&

T common stock in
    order to offset dilution to AIB’s ownership interests that
    may otherwise be caused by issuances of
    M

&

T common stock under
    M

&

T employee and
    director benefit or stock purchase plans. Dilution of AIB’s
    ownership position caused by such issuances will not be counted
    in determining whether the “Sunset Date” has occurred
    or whether any of AIB’s other rights under the
    Reorganization Agreement have terminated. The “Sunset
    Date” is the date on which AIB no longer holds at least 15%
    of the M

&

T common
    stock, calculated as described in this paragraph.

The AIB Designees at December 31, 2006 were Michael D.
    Buckley, Colm E. Doherty, Richard G. King and Eugene J. Sheehy.
    Mr. Buckley serves as a member of the Executive Committee
    and the Nomination, Compensation and Governance Committee, and
    Mr. King serves as a member of the Audit and Risk
    Committee. Robert G. Wilmers, Chairman of the Board and Chief
    Executive Officer of
    M

&

T, is a member of the
    AIB board of directors.

    to
    M

&

T amended and

    M

&

T board of directors
    or the approval of the holders of not less than 80% of the
    outstanding shares of
    M

&

T common stock. The
    provisions of the bylaws described above will automatically
    terminate when AIB holds less than 5% of the outstanding shares
    of M

&

T common stock.

Investment
    Parameters

The Reorganization Agreement provides that through the second
    anniversary of the Sunset Date, without prior written consent of
    the M

&

T board of
    directors, AIB will not, directly or indirectly, acquire or
    offer to acquire (except by way of stock dividends, offerings
    made available to M

&

T
    shareholders generally, or pursuant to compensation plans) more
    than 25% of the then outstanding shares of
    M

&

T common stock.
    Further, during this period, AIB and AIB’s subsidiaries
    have agreed not to participate in any proxy solicitation or to
    otherwise seek to influence any
    M

&

T shareholder with
    respect to the voting of any shares of
    M

&

T common stock for
    the approval of any shareholder proposals.

The Reorganization Agreement also provides that, during this
    period, AIB will not make any public announcement with respect
    to any proposal or offer by AIB or any AIB subsidiary with
    respect to certain transactions (such as mergers, business
    combinations, tender or exchange offers, the sale or purchase of
    securities or similar transactions) involving
    M

&

T or any of the
    M

&

T subsidiaries. The
    Reorganization Agreement also provides that, during this period,
    AIB may not subject any shares of
    M

&

T common stock to any
    voting trust or voting arrangement or agreement and will not
    execute any written consent as a shareholder with respect to the
    M

&

T common stock.

The Reorganization Agreement also provides that, during this
    period, AIB will not seek to control or influence the
    management, the board of directors or policies of
    M

&

T, including through
    communications with shareholders of
    M

&

T or otherwise,
    except through non-public communications with the directors of
    M

&

T, including the AIB
    Designees.

These restrictions on AIB will no longer apply if a third party
    commences or announces its intention to commence a tender offer
    or an exchange offer and, within a reasonable time, the
    M

&

T board of directors
    either does not recommend that shareholders not accept the offer
    or fails to adopt a shareholders rights plan, or if
    M

&

T or
    M

&

T Bank becomes
    subject to any regulatory capital directive or becomes an
    institution in “troubled” condition under applicable
    banking regulations. However, in the event the tender offer or
    exchange offer is not commenced or consummated in accordance
    with its terms, the restrictions on AIB described above will
    thereafter continue to apply.

Anti-Dilution
    Protections

M

&

T has agreed that
    until the Sunset Date, in the event
    M

&

T issues shares of
    M

&

T stock (other than
    certain issuances to employees pursuant to option and benefit
    plans), subject to applicable law and



regulatory requirements, AIB will have the right to purchase at
    fair market value up to the number of shares of
    M

&

T common stock
    required to increase or maintain its equity interest in
    M

&

T to 22.5% of the
    then outstanding M

&

T
    common stock.

M

&

T has also agreed
    that until the Sunset Date, in connection with any issuance of
    M

&

T stock pursuant to
    employee option or benefit plans,
    M

&

T will as soon as
    reasonably practicable, taking into account applicable law,
    regulatory capital requirements, capital planning and risk
    management, take such necessary actions so that AIB’s
    proportionate ownership of
    M

&

T common stock is not
    reduced as a result of such issuances, including by funding such
    issuances through purchases of
    M

&

T common stock in the
    open market or by undertaking share repurchase programs.

Sale of
    M

&

T
    Common Stock; Right of First Refusal in Certain
    Circumstances

The M

&

T common stock
    issued to AIB was not registered under the Securities Act of
    1933 (the “Securities Act”) and may only be
    disposed of by AIB pursuant to an effective registration
    statement or pursuant to an exemption from registration under
    the Securities Act and subject to the provisions of the
    Reorganization Agreement.

M

&

T and AIB have
    entered into a registration rights agreement that provides that
    upon AIB’s request,
    M

&

T will file a
    registration statement relating to all or a portion of
    AIB’s shares of
    M

&

T common stock
    providing for the sale of such shares by AIB from time to time
    on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the
    Securities Act, provided that
    M

&

T need only effect
    one such “shelf registration” in any

12-month

period. In addition, the registration rights agreement provides
    that AIB is entitled to demand registration under the Securities
    Act of all or part of its shares of
    M

&

T stock, provided
    that M

&

T is not
    obligated to effect two such “demand registrations” in
    any

12-month

period. Any demand or shelf registration must cover no less than
    one million shares.

The registration rights agreement further provides that in the
    event M

&

T proposes to
    file a registration statement other than pursuant to a shelf
    registration or demand registration or

Forms S-8

or

S-4,

for
    an offering and sale of shares by
    M

&

T in an underwritten
    offering or an offering and sale of shares on behalf of one or
    more selling shareholders,
    M

&

T must give AIB
    notice at least 15 days prior to the anticipated filing
    date, and AIB may request that all or a portion of its
    M

&

T common shares be
    included in the registration statement.
    M

&

T will honor the
    request, unless the managing underwriter advises
    M

&

T in writing that in
    its opinion the inclusion of all shares requested to be included
    by M

&

T, the other
    selling shareholders, if any, and AIB would materially and
    adversely affect the offering, in which case
    M

&

T may limit the
    number of shares included in the offering to a number that would
    not reasonably be expected to have such an effect. In such
    event, the number of shares to be included in the registration
    statement shall first include the number of shares requested to
    be included by M

&

T and
    then the shares requested by other selling shareholders,
    including AIB, on a pro rata basis according to the number of
    shares requested to be included in the registration statement by
    each shareholder.

As long as AIB holds 5% or more of the outstanding shares of
    M

&

T common stock, AIB
    will not dispose of any of its shares of
    M

&

T common stock
    except, subject to the terms and conditions of the
    Reorganization Agreement and applicable law, in a widely
    dispersed public distribution; a private placement in which no
    one party acquires the right to purchase more than 2% of the
    outstanding shares of
    M

&

T common stock; an
    assignment to a single party (such as a broker or investment
    banker) for the purpose of conducting a widely dispersed public
    distribution on AIB’s behalf; pursuant to Rule 144
    under the Securities Act; pursuant to a tender or exchange offer
    to M

&

T’s
    shareholders not opposed by
    M

&

T’s board of
    directors, or open market purchase programs made by
    M

&

T; with the consent
    of M

&

T, which consent
    will not be unreasonably withheld, to a controlled subsidiary of
    AIB; or pursuant to
    M

&

T’s right of
    first refusal as described below.

The Reorganization Agreement provides that until AIB no longer
    holds at least 5% of the outstanding shares of
    M

&

T common stock, if
    AIB wishes to sell or otherwise transfer any of its shares of
    M

&

T common stock other
    than as described in the preceding paragraph, AIB must first
    submit an offer notice to
    M

&

T identifying the
    proposed transferee and setting forth the proposed terms of the
    transaction, which shall be limited to sales for cash, cash
    equivalents or marketable securities.
    M

&

T will have the
    right, for 20 days following receipt of an offer notice
    from AIB, to purchase all (but not less than all) of the shares
    of M

&

T common stock
    that AIB wishes to sell, on the proposed terms specified in



the offer notice. If
    M

&

T declines or fails
    to respond to the offer notice within 20 days, AIB may sell
    all or a portion of the
    M

&

T shares specified in
    the offer notice to the proposed transferee at a purchase price
    equal to or greater than the price specified in the offer
    notice, at any time during the three months following the date
    of the offer notice, or, if prior notification to or approval of
    the sale by the Federal Reserve Board or another regulatory
    agency is required, AIB shall pursue regulatory approval
    expeditiously and the sale may occur on the first date permitted
    under applicable law.

Certain
    Post-Closing Bank Regulatory Matters

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
    (“Federal Reserve Board”) deems AIB to be
    M

&

T’s bank holding
    company for purposes of the BHCA. In addition, the New York
    Banking Superintendent (“Banking Superintendent”)
    deems AIB to be
    M

&

T’s bank holding
    company for purposes of

Article III-A

of the Banking Law. Among other things, this means that, should
    M

&

T propose to make an
    acquisition or engage in a new type of activity that requires
    the submission of an application or notice to the Federal
    Reserve Board or the Banking Superintendent, AIB, as well as
    M

&

T, may also be
    required to file an application or notice. The Reorganization
    Agreement generally provides that AIB will make any
    applications, notices or filings that
    M

&

T determines to be
    necessary or desirable. The Reorganization Agreement also
    requires AIB not to take any action that would have a material
    adverse effect on M

&

T
    and to advise M

&

T prior
    to entering into any material transaction or activity. These
    provisions of the Reorganization Agreement would no longer apply
    if AIB ceased to be
    M

&

T’s bank holding
    company and also was not otherwise considered to control
    M

&

T for purposes of the
    BHCA.

Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, if, as a result of any
    administrative enforcement action under Section 8 of the
    Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDI Act”),
    memorandum of understanding, written agreement, supervisory
    letter or any other action or determination of any regulatory
    agency relating to the status of AIB (but not relating to the
    conduct of M

&

T or any
    subsidiary of M

&

T),
    M

&

T or
    M

&

T Bank also becomes
    subject to such an action, memorandum, agreement or letter that
    relates to M

&

T or any
    M

&

T subsidiary, or
    experiences any fact, event or circumstance that affects
    M

&

T’s regulatory
    status or compliance, and that in either case would be
    reasonably likely to create a material burden on
    M

&

T or to cause any
    material adverse economic or operating consequences to
    M

&

T or an
    M

&

T subsidiary (a
    “Material Regulatory Event”), then
    M

&

T will notify AIB
    thereof in writing as promptly as practicable. Should AIB fail
    to cure the Material Regulatory Event within 90 days
    following the receipt of such notice, AIB will, as promptly as
    practicable but in no event later than 30 days from the end
    of the cure period, take any and all such actions (with the
    reasonable cooperation of
    M

&

T as requested by
    AIB) as may be necessary or advisable in order that it no longer
    has “control” of
    M

&

T for purposes of the
    BHCA, including, if necessary, by selling some or all of its
    shares of M

&

T common
    stock (subject to the right of first refusal provisions of the
    Reorganization Agreement) and divesting itself as required of
    its board and committee representation and governance rights as
    set forth in the Reorganization Agreement. If, at the end of
    such

30-day

period, the Material Regulatory Event is continuing and AIB has
    not terminated its control of
    M

&

T, then
    M

&

T will have the right
    to repurchase, at fair market value, such amount of the
    M

&

T common stock owned
    by AIB as would result in AIB holding no less than 4.9% of the
    outstanding shares of
    M

&

T common stock,
    pursuant to the procedures detailed in the Reorganization
    Agreement.

As long as AIB is considered to “control”
    M

&

T for purposes of the
    BHCA or the federal Change in Bank Control Act, if AIB acquires
    any insured depository institution with total assets greater
    than 25% of the assets of
    M

&

T’s largest
    insured depository institution subsidiary, then within two years
    AIB must terminate its affiliation with the insured depository
    institution or take such steps as may be necessary so that none
    of M

&

T’s bank
    subsidiaries would be subject to “cross guarantee”
    liability for losses incurred if the institution AIB acquired
    potentially were to fail. This liability applies under the FDI
    Act to insured depository institutions that are commonly
    controlled. The actions AIB would take could include disposing
    of shares of M

&

T common
    stock

and/or

surrendering its representation or governance rights. Also, if
    such an insured depository institution that is controlled by AIB
    and of the size described in the first sentence of this
    paragraph that would be considered to be commonly controlled
    with M

&

T’s insured
    depository institution subsidiaries fails to meet applicable
    requirements to be “adequately capitalized” under
    applicable U.S. banking laws, then AIB will have to take
    the actions described in the previous



sentence no later than
    180 days after the date that the institution failed to meet
    those requirements, unless the institution is sooner returned to
    “adequately capitalized” status.

Segment
    Information, Principal Products/Services and Foreign
    Operations

Information about the Registrant’s business segments is
    included in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements filed

    Statements and Supplementary Data” and is further discussed
    in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.” The Registrant’s reportable segments have
    been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting
    system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain
    strategic business units have been combined for segment
    information reporting purposes where the nature of the products
    and services, the type of customer and the distribution of those
    products and services are similar. The reportable segments are
    Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary
    Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking. The
    Company’s international activities are discussed in
    note 16 of Notes to Financial Statements filed herewith in
    Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data.”

The only activities that, as a class, contributed 10% or more of
    the sum of consolidated interest income and other income in any
    of the last three years were lending transactions and service
    charges on deposit accounts. The amount of income from such
    sources during those years is set forth on the Company’s
    Consolidated Statement of Income filed herewith in Part II,
    Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data.”

Supervision
    and Regulation of the Company

The banking industry is subject to extensive state and federal
    regulation and continues to undergo significant change. The
    following discussion summarizes certain aspects of the banking
    laws and



regulations that affect the Company. Proposals to change the
    laws and regulations governing the banking industry are
    frequently raised in Congress, in state legislatures, and before
    the various bank regulatory agencies. The likelihood and timing
    of any changes and the impact such changes might have on the
    Company are impossible to determine with any certainty. A change
    in applicable laws or regulations, or a change in the way such
    laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or
    courts, may have a material impact on the business, operations
    and earnings of the Company. To the extent that the following
    information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is
    qualified entirely by reference to the particular statutory or
    regulatory provision.

    Services Modernization

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“Gramm-Leach”)
    enables combinations among banks, securities firms and insurance
    companies. Under Gramm-Leach, bank holding companies are
    permitted to offer their customers virtually any type of
    financial service that is financial in nature or incidental
    thereto, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance
    (both underwriting and agency), and merchant banking.

In order to engage in these financial activities, a bank holding
    company must qualify and register with the Federal Reserve Board
    as a “financial holding company” by demonstrating that
    each of its bank subsidiaries is “well capitalized,”
    “well managed,” and has at least a
    “satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment
    Act of 1977 (“CRA”).
    M

&

T currently satisfies
    the qualifications for registering as a financial holding
    company, but has not elected to do so to date. For as long as
    AIB owns at least 15% of
    M

&

T’s outstanding
    common stock, M

&

T may
    not become a financial holding company without the approval of
    the Executive Committee of the
    M

&

T board of directors,
    which must also include the affirmative approval of the AIB
    Designee on such committee, as described above under the caption
    “Amendments to
    M

&

T’s Bylaws.”

The financial activities authorized by Gramm-Leach may also be
    engaged in by a “financial subsidiary” of a national
    or state bank, except for insurance or annuity underwriting,
    insurance company portfolio investments, real estate investment
    and development, and merchant banking, which must be conducted
    in a financial holding company. In order for these financial
    activities to be engaged in by a financial subsidiary of a
    national or state bank, Gramm-Leach requires each of the parent
    bank (and its sister-bank affiliates) to be well capitalized and
    well managed; the aggregate consolidated assets of all of that
    bank’s financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of
    45% of its consolidated total assets or $50 billion; the
    bank must have at least a satisfactory CRA rating; and, if that
    bank is one of the 100 largest national banks, it must meet
    certain financial rating or other comparable requirements.
    M

&

T Bank and
    M

&

T Bank, N.A.
    currently satisfy the qualifications for engaging in financial
    activities through financial subsidiaries, but neither has
    elected to do so to date. Gramm-Leach also establishes a system
    of functional regulation under which the federal banking
    agencies will regulate the banking activities of financial
    holding companies and banks’ financial subsidiaries, the
    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will regulate their
    securities activities, and state insurance regulators will
    regulate their insurance activities. Rules developed by the
    federal financial institutions regulators under Gramm-Leach
    require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some
    circumstances, allow consumers to prevent the disclosure of
    certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The
    foregoing discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference
    to the statutory provisions of Gramm-Leach and the implementing
    regulations which have been adopted by various government
    agencies pursuant to

Gramm-Leach.

Bank
    Holding Company Regulation

As a registered bank holding company, the Registrant and its
    nonbank subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation
    under the BHCA by the Federal Reserve Board and under the
    Banking Law by the Banking Superintendent. The Federal Reserve
    Board requires regular reports from the Registrant and is
    authorized by the BHCA to make regular examinations of the
    Registrant and its subsidiaries.

The Registrant may not acquire direct or indirect ownership or
    control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company,
    including a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal
    Reserve Board, except as specifically authorized under the BHCA.
    The Registrant is also subject to regulation under the



Banking Law with respect to certain acquisitions of domestic
    banks. Under the BHCA, the Registrant, subject to the approval
    of the Federal Reserve Board, may acquire shares of non-banking
    corporations the activities of which are deemed by the Federal
    Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or
    controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.

The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement powers over bank
    holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries, among
    other things, to interdict activities that represent unsafe or
    unsound practices or constitute violations of law, rule,
    regulation, administrative orders or written agreements with a
    federal bank regulator. These powers may be exercised through
    the issuance of

cease-and-desist

orders, civil money penalties or other actions.

Under the Federal Reserve Board’s statement of policy with
    respect to bank holding company operations, a bank holding
    company is required to serve as a source of financial strength
    to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit all
    available resources to support such institutions in
    circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy.
    Although this “source of strength” policy has been
    challenged in litigation, the Federal Reserve Board continues to
    take the position that it has authority to enforce it. For a
    discussion of circumstances under which a bank holding company
    may be required to guarantee the capital levels or performance
    of its subsidiary banks, see “Capital Adequacy,”
    below. Consistent with this “source of strength”
    policy, the Federal Reserve Board takes the position that a bank
    holding company generally should not maintain a rate of cash
    dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders
    has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the
    prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent
    with the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall
    financial condition. The Federal Reserve also has the authority
    to terminate any activity of a bank holding company that
    constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or
    stability of any subsidiary depository institution or to
    terminate its control of any bank or nonbank subsidiaries.

The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act
    of 1994, as amended (the “Interstate Banking
    Act”) generally permits bank holding companies to acquire
    banks in any state, and preempts all state laws restricting the
    ownership by a bank holding company of banks in more than one
    state. The Interstate Banking Act also permits a bank to merge
    with an

out-of-state

bank and convert any offices into branches of the resulting bank
    if both states have not opted out of interstate branching;
    permits a bank to acquire branches from an

out-of-state

bank if the law of the state where the branches are located
    permits the interstate branch acquisition; and permits banks to
    establish and operate de novo interstate branches whenever the
    host state opts-in to de novo branching. Bank holding companies
    and banks seeking to engage in transactions authorized by the
    Interstate Banking Act must be adequately capitalized and
    managed.

The Banking Law authorizes interstate branching by merger or
    acquisition on a reciprocal basis, and permits the acquisition
    of a single branch without restriction, but does not provide for
    de novo interstate branching.

Bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks are also
    subject to the provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of the
    CRA, the Federal Reserve Board (or other appropriate bank
    regulatory agency) is required, in connection with its
    examination of a bank, to assess such bank’s record in
    meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that bank,
    including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. During these
    examinations, the Federal Reserve Board (or other appropriate
    bank regulatory agency) rates such bank’s compliance with
    the CRA as “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,”
    “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial
    Noncompliance.” The failure of a bank to receive at least a
    “Satisfactory” rating could inhibit such bank or its
    bank holding company from undertaking certain activities,
    including acquisitions of other financial institutions or
    opening or relocating a branch office, as further discussed
    below. M

&

T Bank
    has a CRA rating of “Outstanding” and
    M

&

T Bank, N.A. has
    a CRA rating of “Satisfactory.” Furthermore, such
    assessment is also required of any bank that has applied, among
    other things, to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets
    or assume the liabilities of a federally-regulated financial
    institution, or to open or relocate a branch office. In the case
    of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a
    bank or bank holding company, the Federal Reserve Board will
    assess the record of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank
    holding company in considering the application. The Banking Law
    contains provisions similar to the CRA which are applicable to
    New York-chartered banks.
    M

&

T Bank has a CRA
    rating of “Outstanding” as determined by the New York
    State Banking Department.



Supervision
    and Regulation of Bank Subsidiaries

The Registrant’s bank subsidiaries are subject to
    supervision and regulation, and are examined regularly, by
    various bank regulatory agencies:
    M

&

T Bank by the
    Federal Reserve Board and the Banking Superintendent; and
    M

&

T Bank, N.A. by
    the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). The
    Registrant and its direct non-banking subsidiaries are
    affiliates, within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, of
    the Registrant’s subsidiary banks and their subsidiaries.
    As a result, the Registrant’s subsidiary banks and their
    subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on loans or extensions
    of credit to, purchases of assets from, investments in, and
    transactions with the Registrant and its direct non-banking
    subsidiaries and on certain other transactions with them or
    involving their securities. Gramm-Leach places similar
    restrictions on the Registrant’s subsidiary banks making
    loans or extending credit to, purchasing assets from, investing
    in, or entering into transactions with, their financial
    subsidiaries.

Under the “cross-guarantee” provisions of the FDI Act,
    insured depository institutions under common control are
    required to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered by the DIF
    of the FDIC as a result of the default of a commonly controlled
    insured depository institution or for any assistance provided by
    the FDIC to a commonly controlled insured depository institution
    in danger of default. Thus, any insured depository institution
    subsidiary of M

&

T could
    incur liability to the FDIC in the event of a default of another
    insured depository institution owned or controlled by
    M

&

T. The FDIC’s
    claim under the cross-guarantee provisions is superior to claims
    of stockholders of the insured depository institution or its
    holding company and to most claims arising out of obligations or
    liabilities owed to affiliates of the institution, but is
    subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and
    holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the
    commonly controlled insured depository institution. The FDIC may
    decline to enforce the cross-guarantee provisions if it
    determines that a waiver is in the best interest of the DIF.

Dividends
    from Bank Subsidiaries

The Registrant is a legal entity separate and distinct from its
    banking and other subsidiaries. The majority of the
    Registrant’s revenue is from dividends paid to the
    Registrant by its subsidiary banks.
    M

&

T Bank and
    M

&

T Bank, N.A. are
    subject, under one or more of the banking laws, to restrictions
    on the amount and frequency (no more often than quarterly) of
    dividend declarations. Future dividend payments to the
    Registrant by its subsidiary banks will be dependent on a number
    of factors, including the earnings and financial condition of
    each such bank, and are subject to the limitations referred to
    in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements filed herewith
    in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data,” and to other statutory powers of bank
    regulatory agencies.

An insured depository institution is prohibited from making any
    capital distribution to its owner, including any dividend, if,
    after making such distribution, the depository institution fails
    to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital
    measure, including the risk-based capital adequacy and leverage
    standards discussed herein.

Supervision
    and Regulation of
    M

&

T Bank’s
    Subsidiaries

M

&

T Bank has a
    number of subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are subject to the
    laws and regulations of both the federal government and the
    various states in which they conduct business. For example,
    M

&

T Securities is
    regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
    National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and state
    securities regulators.

Capital
    Adequacy

The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC have adopted
    risk-based capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding
    companies and banks under their supervision. Under these
    guidelines, the so-called “Tier 1 capital” and
    “Total capital” as a percentage of risk-weighted
    assets and certain off-balance sheet instruments must be at
    least 4% and 8%, respectively.

The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC have also
    imposed a leverage standard to supplement their risk-based
    ratios. This leverage standard focuses on a banking
    institution’s ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total
    assets, adjusted for goodwill and certain other items. Under
    these guidelines, banking institutions that meet certain
    criteria, including excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low
    interest



rate exposure and good earnings, and that have received the
    highest regulatory rating must maintain a ratio of Tier 1
    capital to total adjusted average assets of at least 3%.
    Institutions not meeting these criteria, as well as institutions
    with supervisory, financial or operational weaknesses, along
    with those experiencing or anticipating significant growth are
    expected to maintain a Tier 1 capital to total adjusted
    average assets ratio equal to at least 4% to 5%. As reflected in
    the table in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements filed
    herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data,” the risk-based capital
    ratios and leverage ratios of the Registrant,
    M

&

T Bank and
    M

&

T Bank, N.A. as
    of December 31, 2006 exceeded the required capital ratios
    for classification as “well capitalized,” the highest
    classification under the regulatory capital guidelines.

The federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve
    Board and the OCC, maintain risk-based capital standards in
    order to ensure that those standards take adequate account of
    interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk, the risk of
    nontraditional activities and equity investments in nonfinancial
    companies, as well as reflect the actual performance and
    expected risk of loss on certain multifamily housing loans. Bank
    regulators periodically propose amendments to the risk-based
    capital guidelines and related regulatory framework, and
    consider changes to the risk-based capital standards that could
    significantly increase the amount of capital needed to meet the
    requirements for the capital tiers described below. While the
    Company’s management studies such proposals, the timing of
    adoption, ultimate form and effect of any such proposed
    amendments on
    M

&

T’s capital
    requirements and operations cannot be predicted.

The federal banking agencies are required to take “prompt
    corrective action” in respect of depository institutions
    and their bank holding companies that do not meet minimum
    capital requirements. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
    Improvement Act established five capital tiers: “well
    capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,”
    “undercapitalized,” “significantly
    undercapitalized” and “critically
    undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital
    tier, or that of its bank holding company, depends upon where
    its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital
    measures, including a risk-based capital measure and a leverage
    ratio capital measure, and certain other factors.

Under the implementing regulations adopted by the federal
    banking agencies, a bank holding company or bank is considered
    “well capitalized” if it has (i) a total
    risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, (ii) a
    Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater,
    (iii) a leverage ratio of 5% or greater and (iv) is
    not subject to any order or written directive to meet and
    maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An
    “adequately capitalized” bank holding company or bank
    is defined as one that has (i) a total risk-based capital
    ratio of 8% or greater, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based
    capital ratio of 4% or greater and (iii) a leverage ratio
    of 4% or greater (or 3% or greater in the case of a bank with a
    composite CAMELS rating of 1). A bank holding company or bank is
    considered (A) “undercapitalized” if it has
    (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%,
    (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%
    or (iii) a leverage ratio of less than 4% (or 3% in the
    case of a bank with a composite CAMELS rating of 1);
    (B) “significantly undercapitalized” if the bank
    has (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%,
    or (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than
    3% or (iii) a leverage ratio of less than 3% and
    (C) “critically undercapitalized” if the bank has
    a ratio of tangible equity to total assets equal to or less than
    2%. The Federal Reserve Board may reclassify a “well
    capitalized” bank holding company or bank as
    “adequately capitalized” or subject an
    “adequately capitalized” or
    “undercapitalized” institution to the supervisory
    actions applicable to the next lower capital category if it
    determines that the bank holding company or bank is in an unsafe
    or unsound condition or deems the bank holding company or bank
    to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice and not to have
    corrected the deficiency.
    M

&

T,
    M

&

T Bank and
    M

&

T Bank, N.A.
    currently meet the definition of “well capitalized”
    institutions.

“Undercapitalized” depository institutions, among
    other things, are subject to growth limitations, are prohibited,
    with certain exceptions, from making capital distributions, are
    limited in their ability to obtain funding from a Federal
    Reserve Bank and are required to submit a capital restoration
    plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan
    without determining, among other things, that the plan is based
    on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring
    the depository institution’s capital. In addition, for a
    capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository
    institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that
    the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan
    and provide appropriate assurances of performance. If a
    depository institution fails to submit an acceptable



plan, including if the holding company refuses or is unable to
    make the guarantee described in the previous sentence, it is
    treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.”
    Failure to submit or implement an acceptable capital plan also
    is grounds for the appointment of a conservator or a receiver.
    “Significantly undercapitalized” depository
    institutions may be subject to a number of additional
    requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell
    sufficient voting stock to become “adequately
    capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets and
    cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.
    Moreover, the parent holding company of a “significantly
    undercapitalized” depository institution may be ordered to
    divest itself of the institution or of nonbank subsidiaries of
    the holding company. “Critically undercapitalized”
    institutions, among other things, are prohibited from making any
    payments of principal and interest on subordinated debt, and are
    subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.

Each federal banking agency prescribes standards for depository
    institutions and depository institution holding companies
    relating to internal controls, information systems, internal
    audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest
    rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, a maximum ratio of
    classified assets to capital, minimum earnings sufficient to
    absorb losses, a minimum ratio of market value to book value for
    publicly traded shares and other standards as they deem
    appropriate. The Federal Reserve Board and OCC have adopted such
    standards.

Depository institutions that are not “well
    capitalized” or “adequately capitalized” and have
    not received a waiver from the FDIC are prohibited from
    accepting or renewing brokered deposits. As of December 31,
    2006, M

&

T Bank had
    approximately $2.8 billion of brokered deposits, while
    M

&

T Bank, N.A. did
    not have any brokered deposits at that date.

Although M

&

T has issued
    shares of common stock in connection with acquisitions or at
    other times, the Company has generally maintained capital ratios
    in excess of minimum regulatory guidelines largely through
    internal capital generation (i.e. net income less dividends
    paid). Historically,
    M

&

T’s dividend
    payout ratio and dividend yield, when compared with other bank
    holding companies, has been relatively low, thereby allowing for
    capital retention to support growth or to facilitate purchases
    of M

&

T’s common
    stock to be held as treasury stock. Management’s policy of
    reinvestment of earnings and repurchase of shares of common
    stock is intended to enhance
    M

&

T’s earnings per
    share prospects and thereby reward stockholders over time with
    capital gains in the form of increased stock price rather than
    high dividend income.

FDIC
    Deposit Insurance Assessments

In February 2006, The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of
    2005 and The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Conforming
    Amendments Act of 2005 (collectively the “Reform Act”)
    were signed into law. The Reform Act provided for the merging of
    the Bank Insurance Fund and Savings Association Insurance Fund
    into the new DIF, effective March 31, 2006.

As institutions with deposits insured by the DIF,
    M

&

T Bank and
    M

&

T Bank, N.A. are
    subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. Under the
    provisions of the Reform Act, the regular insurance assessments
    to be paid by insured institutions are specified in schedules
    issued by the FDIC that specify a target reserve ratio designed
    to maintain the reserve ratio of between 1.15% and 1.50% of
    estimated insured deposits.

Under the Reform Act, the FDIC has modified its risk-based
    deposit premium assessment system under which each depository
    institution is placed in one of four assessment categories based
    on the institution’s capital classification under the
    prompt corrective action provisions described above, and an
    institution’s long-term debt issuer ratings. Effective
    January 1, 2007, the adjusted assessment rates for insured
    institutions under the modified system range from .05% to .43%
    depending upon the assessment category into which the insured
    institution is placed. Under the previous assessment system, the
    adjusted assessment rates ranged from .00% to .27%. Neither of
    the Company’s bank subsidiaries paid regular insurance
    assessments to the FDIC in 2006.

The Reform Act provides for a one-time assessment credit for
    eligible insured depository institutions (those institutions
    that were in existence on December 31, 1996 and paid a
    deposit insurance assessment prior to that date, or are a
    successor to any such institution). The credit is determined
    based on the assessment base of the institution as of
    December 31, 1996 as compared with the combined



aggregate assessment base of all
    eligible institutions as of that date. The credit may be used to
    offset up to 100% of the 2007 DIF assessment, and if not
    completely used in 2007, may be applied to not more than 90% of
    each of the aggregate 2008, 2009 and 2010 DIF assessments.

In addition to insurance fund assessments, beginning in 1997 the
    FDIC assessed deposits to fund the repayment of debt obligations
    of the Financing Corporation (“FICO”). FICO is a
    government agency-sponsored entity that was formed to borrow the
    money necessary to carry out the closing and ultimate
    disposition of failed thrift institutions by the Resolution
    Trust Corporation. The current annualized rate established by
    the FDIC is 1.22 basis points (hundredths of one percent).

The insurance assessments under the Reform Act are not expected
    to have a significant adverse impact on the results of
    operations and capital of
    M

&

T Bank or
    M

&

T Bank, N.A. in
    2007 or 2008. However, any significant increases in assessment
    rates or additional special assessments by the FDIC could have
    an adverse impact on the results of operations and capital of
    M

&

T Bank or
    M

&

T Bank, N.A.

Consumer
    Protection Laws

In connection with their respective lending and leasing
    activities,
    M

&

T Bank, certain
    of its subsidiaries, and
    M

&

T Bank, N.A. are
    each subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to
    protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the
    economy population. These laws include the Equal Credit
    Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair and
    Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the
    Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Real Estate Settlement
    Procedures Act, and various state law counterparts.

In addition, federal law currently contains extensive customer
    privacy protection provisions. Under these provisions, a
    financial institution must provide to its customers, at the
    inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter,
    the institution’s policies and procedures regarding the
    handling of customers’ nonpublic personal financial
    information. These provisions also provide that, except for
    certain limited exceptions, a financial institution may not
    provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties
    unless the institution discloses to the customer that such
    information may be so provided and the customer is given the
    opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. Federal law makes it
    a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain
    or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature
    by fraudulent or deceptive means.

Sarbanes-Oxley
    Act of 2002

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 implemented a broad range of
    corporate governance, accounting and reporting measures for
    companies that have securities registered under the Exchange
    Act, including publicly-held bank holding companies such as
    M

&

T. Specifically, the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the various regulations
    promulgated thereunder, established, among other things:
    (i) new requirements for audit committees, including
    independence, expertise, and responsibilities;
    (ii) additional responsibilities regarding financial
    statements for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer of the reporting company; (iii) the forfeiture of
    bonuses or other incentive-based compensation and profits from
    the sale of the reporting company’s securities by the Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in the
    twelve-month period following the initial publication of any
    financial statements that later require restatement;
    (iv) the creation of an independent accounting oversight
    board; (v) new standards for auditors and regulation of
    audits, including independence provisions that restrict
    non-audit services that accountants may provide to their audit
    clients; (vi) increased disclosure and reporting
    obligations for the reporting company and their directors and
    executive officers, including accelerated reporting of stock
    transactions and a prohibition on trading during pension
    blackout periods; (vii) a prohibition on personal loans to
    directors and officers, except certain loans made by insured
    financial institutions on nonpreferential terms and in
    compliance with other bank regulatory requirements; and
    (viii) a range of new and increased civil and criminal
    penalties for fraud and other violations of the securities laws.

    (the “USA Patriot Act”) imposes additional obligations
    on U.S. financial institutions, including banks and broker
    dealer subsidiaries, to implement policies, procedures and



controls which are reasonably designed to detect and report
    instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. In
    addition, provisions of the USA Patriot Act require the federal
    financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the
    effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money
    laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank
    holding company acquisitions. The Registrant and its impacted
    subsidiaries have approved policies and procedures that are
    believed to be compliant with the USA Patriot Act.

Regulatory
    Impact of
    M

&

T’s
    Relationship With AIB

As described above under the caption “Relationship With
    Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c.,” AIB owns approximately 24.2%
    of the issued and outstanding shares of
    M

&

T common stock and
    has representation on the
    M

&

T and
    M

&

T Bank boards of
    directors. As a result, AIB has become
    M

&

T’s bank holding
    company under the BHCA and the Banking Law and AIB’s
    relationship with M

&

T
    is subject to the statutes and regulations governing bank
    holding companies described above. Among other things, AIB will
    have to join M

&

T in
    applications by M

&

T for
    acquisitions and new activities. The Reorganization Agreement
    requires AIB to join in such applications at
    M

&

T’s request,
    subject to certain limitations. In addition, because AIB is
    regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (the “CBI”),
    the CBI may assert jurisdiction over
    M

&

T as a company
    controlled by AIB. Additional discussion of the regulatory
    implications of the Allfirst acquisition for
    M

&

T is set forth above
    under the caption “Certain Post-Closing Bank Regulatory
    Matters.”

Governmental
    Policies

The earnings of the Company are significantly affected by the
    monetary and fiscal policies of governmental authorities,
    including the Federal Reserve Board. Among the instruments of
    monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement
    these objectives are open-market operations in
    U.S. Government securities and federal funds, changes in
    the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in
    reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These
    instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations
    to influence the overall level of bank loans, investments and
    deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans and paid for
    deposits. The Federal Reserve Board frequently uses these
    instruments of monetary policy, especially its open-market
    operations and the discount rate, to influence the level of
    interest rates and to affect the strength of the economy, the
    level of inflation or the price of the dollar in foreign
    exchange markets. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve
    Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of
    banking institutions in the past and are expected to continue to
    do so in the future. It is not possible to predict the nature of
    future changes in monetary and fiscal policies, or the effect
    which they may have on the Company’s business and earnings.

Competition

The Company competes in offering commercial and personal
    financial services with other banking institutions and with
    firms in a number of other industries, such as thrift
    institutions, credit unions, personal loan companies, sales
    finance companies, leasing companies, securities firms and
    insurance companies. Furthermore, diversified financial services
    companies are able to offer a combination of these services to
    their customers on a nationwide basis. The Company’s
    operations are significantly impacted by state and federal
    regulations applicable to the banking industry. Moreover, the
    provisions of Gramm-Leach have allowed for increased competition
    among diversified financial services providers, and the
    Interstate Banking Act and the Banking Law may be considered to
    have eased entry into New York State by

out-of-state

banking institutions. As a result, the number of financial
    services providers and banking institutions with which the
    Company competes may grow in the future.

Other
    Legislative Initiatives

Proposals may be introduced in the United States Congress and in
    the New York State Legislature and before various bank
    regulatory authorities which would alter the powers of, and
    restrictions on, different types of banking organizations and
    which would restructure part or all of the existing regulatory
    framework for banks, bank holding companies and other providers
    of financial services. Moreover, other bills may be introduced
    in Congress which would further regulate, deregulate or
    restructure the financial



services industry. It is not possible to predict whether these
    or any other proposals will be enacted into law or, even if
    enacted, the effect which they may have on the Company’s
    business and earnings.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

M

&

T and its
    subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and
    uncertainties which are difficult to predict. As a financial
    institution, the Company has significant exposure to market
    risk, including interest-rate risk, liquidity risk and credit
    risk, among others. Adverse experience with these or other risks
    could have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    condition and results of operations, as well as on the value of
    the Company’s financial instruments in general, and
    M

&

T’s common
    stock, in particular.



Interest Rate Risk — The Company is exposed to
    interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and
    deposit-taking since assets and liabilities reprice at different
    times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a
    result, net interest income, which represents the largest
    revenue source for the Company, is subject to the effects of
    changing interest rates. The Company closely monitors the
    sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates
    and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as
    interest rates change. The Company makes use of both on- and
    off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to
    interest rate risk. Possible actions to mitigate such risk
    include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan
    and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to,
    modifying or terminating interest rate swap agreements or other
    financial instruments used for interest rate risk management
    purposes.

Liquidity Risk — Liquidity refers to the
    Company’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and
    liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future
    financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit
    withdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporate
    purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of
    financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.
    The Company obtains funding through deposits and various
    short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal
    funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to
    repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, offshore branch
    deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of
    New York and others. Should the Company experience a substantial
    deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or
    should the availability of funding become restricted due to
    disruption in the financial markets, the Company’s ability
    to obtain funding from these or other sources could be
    negatively impacted. The Company attempts to quantify such
    credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the
    liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade
    over various grading levels. The Company estimates such impact
    by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines
    of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and
    securitizable assets. To mitigate such risk, the Company
    maintains available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve
    Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York
    that are secured by loans and investment securities. On an
    ongoing basis, management closely monitors the Company’s
    liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and
    believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to
    meet funding needs in the normal course of business.

Credit Risk — Factors that influence the
    Company’s credit loss experience include overall economic
    conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and,
    due to the size of the Company’s commercial real estate
    loan portfolio, real estate valuations, in particular. Other
    factors that can influence the Company’s credit loss
    experience, in addition to general economic conditions and
    borrowers’ specific abilities to repay loans, include:
    (i) the concentration of commercial real estate loans in
    the Company’s loan portfolio, particularly the large
    concentration of loans secured by properties in New York State,
    in general, and in the New York City metropolitan area, in
    particular; (ii) the amount of commercial and industrial
    loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the
    New York City metropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that
    have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality
    than the vast majority of other regions of the country; and
    (iii) the size of the Company’s portfolio of loans to
    individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher
    net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than other
    loan types. Although the national economy experienced moderate
    growth in 2006 with inflation being reasonably well contained,
    concerns exist about the level and volatility of energy prices;
    a weakening housing market, particularly concerns about
    over-valued real estate; Federal Reserve positioning of monetary
    policy; the underlying impact on businesses’ operations and
    abilities to repay loans resulting from a higher level of
    interest rates; sluggish job creation, which could cause
    consumer spending to slow; continued stagnant population growth
    in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions;
    continued slowing of domestic automobile sales; and modest loan
    demand in many market areas served by the Company. All of these
    factors can affect the Company’s credit loss experience. To
    help manage credit risk, the Company maintains a detailed credit
    policy and utilizes various committees that include members of
    senior management to approve significant extensions of credit.
    The Company also maintains a credit review department that
    regularly reviews the Company’s loan and lease portfolios
    to ensure compliance with established credit policy. The Company
    maintains an allowance for



credit losses that in management’s judgment is adequate to
    absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio.

Supervision and Regulation — The Company is subject to
    extensive state and federal laws and regulations governing the
    banking industry, in particular, and public companies, in
    general. Many of those laws and regulations are described in
    Part I, Item 1 “Business.” Changes in those
    laws and regulations, or the degree of the Company’s
    compliance with those laws and regulations as judged by any of
    several regulators that oversee the Company, could have a
    significant effect on the Company’s operations and its
    financial results.

Detailed discussions of the specific risks outlined above and
    other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

in Part  I, Item 1 “Business,” and
    Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
    Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading
    “Forward-Looking Statements” is included a description
    of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by
    management that are difficult to predict and that could
    materially affect the Company’s financial condition and
    results of operations, as well as the value of the
    Company’s financial instruments in general, and
    M

&

T common stock, in
    particular.

In addition, the market price of
    M

&

T common stock may
    fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other
    factors, including changes in securities analysts’
    estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market
    prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in
    market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting
    policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory agencies.

Legal
    Proceedings.

M

&

T and its
    subsidiaries are subject in the normal course of business to
    various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims
    for monetary damages are asserted. Management, after
    consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that the
    aggregate ultimate liability, if any, arising out of litigation
    pending against M

&

T or
    its subsidiaries will be material to
    M

&

T’s consolidated
    financial position, but at the present time is not in a position

    with total assets of $511 million at December 31,
    2006, is a national bank with an office in Oakfield, New York.
    M

&

T Bank, N.A.
    offers selected deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis,
    largely through telephone and direct mail marketing techniques.



On June 30, 2006,
    M

&

T Bank completed the
    acquisition of 21 branch offices in Buffalo and Rochester, New
    York from Citibank, N.A., including approximately
    $269 million in loans, mostly to consumers, small
    businesses and middle market customers, and approximately
    $1.0 billion of deposits.
    M

&

T’s financial
    results for 2006 reflect the impact of that transaction from the
    acquisition date through December 31, 2006. Expenses
    associated with integrating the acquired branches into
    M

&

T Bank and
    introducing the customers associated with those branches to
    M

&

T Bank’s
    products and services aggregated $3 million, after
    applicable tax effect, or $.03 of diluted earnings per share
    during the year ended December 31, 2006. The Company does
    not expect that any significant additional acquisition and
    integration-related expenses will be incurred. Including the
    impact of acquisition-related expenses and the amortization of
    core deposit intangible resulting from the transaction, net
    income and diluted earnings per share of the Company in 2006
    were reduced by approximately $10 million and $.09,
    respectively, as a result of the transaction. As of
    December 31, 2006, there were no significant amounts of
    unpaid acquisition-related expenses.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

The Company’s significant accounting policies conform with
    generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and
    are described in note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements.
    In applying those accounting policies, management of the Company
    is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the
    methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized. Certain
    of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such
    judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the
    Company’s reported financial performance should the
    assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes
    in circumstances. Some of the more significant areas in which
    management of the Company applies critical assumptions and
    estimates include the following:

•

Allowance for credit losses — The allowance for credit
    losses represents the amount which, in management’s
    judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in
    the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. A
    provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of
    the allowance as deemed necessary by management. In estimating
    losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, assumptions and
    judgment are applied to measure amounts and timing of expected
    future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to
    determine the borrowers’ abilities to repay obligations.
    Historical loss trends are also considered, as are economic
    conditions, industry trends, portfolio trends and
    borrower-specific financial data. Changes in the circumstances
    considered when determining management’s estimates and
    assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and
    assumptions, which may result in adjustment of the allowance. A
    detailed discussion of facts and circumstances considered by
    management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit
    losses is included herein under the heading “Provision for
    Credit Losses.”

•

Valuation methodologies — Management of the Company
    applies various valuation methodologies to assets and
    liabilities which often involve a significant degree of
    judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the
    particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred
    to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as
    trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real
    estate loans held for sale and related commitments. However, for
    those items for which an observable liquid market does not
    exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions
    to value such items. Examples of these items include capitalized
    servicing assets, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible
    assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations,
    value ascribed to stock-based compensation, estimated residual
    values of property associated with commercial and consumer
    leases, and certain derivative and other financial instruments.
    These valuations require the use of various assumptions,
    including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on
    assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of
    servicing and liquidation values. The use of different
    assumptions could produce significantly different results, which
    could have material positive or negative effects on the
    Company’s results of operations. Specific assumptions and
    estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail herein
    in management’s discussion and analysis of financial
    condition and results of operations and in notes 1, 3,
    4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 17, 18 and 19 of Notes to
    Financial Statements.



•

Commitments, contingencies and off-balance sheet
    arrangements — Information regarding the
    Company’s commitments and contingencies, including
    guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation,
    and their potential effects on the Company’s results of
    operations is included in note 20 of Notes to Financial
    Statements. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to
    examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such
    examinations may result in challenges to the tax return
    treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions.
    Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to
    record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate.
    Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that
    management’s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and
    adjustments required could have a material effect on the
    Company’s results of operations. Information regarding
    permanent and temporary income tax differences is presented in
    note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. The recognition
    or

de-recognition

in the Company’s consolidated financial statements of
    assets and liabilities held by so-called variable interest
    entities is subject to the interpretation and application of
    complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that
    require management to estimate and assess the probability of
    financial outcomes in future periods. Information relating to
    the Company’s involvement in such entities and the
    accounting treatment afforded each such involvement is included
    in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Overview

Net income for the Company in 2006 was $839 million or
    $7.37 of diluted earnings per common share, up 7% and 10%,
    respectively, from $782 million or $6.73 of diluted
    earnings per share in 2005. Basic earnings per common share rose
    10% to $7.55 in 2006 from $6.88 in 2005. Net income in 2004
    totaled $723 million, while diluted and basic earnings per
    share were $6.00 and $6.14, respectively. The after-tax impact
    of acquisition and integration-related expenses (included herein
    as merger-related expenses) associated with the June 30
    branch acquisition already discussed was $3 million
    ($5 million pre-tax) or $.03 of basic and diluted earnings
    per share in 2006. There were no similar expenses in either 2005
    or 2004. Net income expressed as a rate of return on average
    assets in 2006 was 1.50%, compared with 1.44% in 2005 and 1.40%
    in 2004. The return on average common stockholders’ equity
    was 13.89% in 2006, 13.49% in 2005 and 12.67% in 2004.

Net interest income recorded on a taxable-equivalent basis
    increased 1% to $1.84 billion in 2006 from
    $1.81 billion in 2005. The impact of a higher level of
    average earning assets was largely offset by a decline in the
    Company’s net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net
    interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning
    assets. Average earning assets rose 3% to $49.7 billion in
    2006 from $48.1 billion in 2005, the result of increased
    balances of loans and leases, offset, in part, by a decline in
    average outstanding balances of investment securities. Average
    loans and leases of $41.4 billion in 2006 were
    $1.9 billion or 5% higher than $39.5 billion in 2005,
    due to growth in commercial loans and leases of
    $863 million, or 8%, commercial real estate loans of
    $755 million, or 5%, and consumer real estate loans of
    $1.1 billion, or 28%, partially offset by an
    $804 million, or 7% decline in consumer loans and leases.
    Average balances of investment securities decreased 5% to
    $8.0 billion in 2006 from $8.5 billion in 2005. The
    net interest margin declined 7 basis points (hundredths of one
    percent) to 3.70% in 2006 from 3.77% in 2005, largely due to
    higher short-term interest rates resulting from the Federal
    Reserve raising its benchmark overnight federal funds target
    rate 100 basis points during the first six months of 2006,
    continuing a trend of rate increases that began in June 2004.
    Such interest rate increases had the effect of increasing rates
    paid on interest-bearing liabilities more rapidly than yields on
    earning assets during 2005 and the first half of 2006. During
    the last six months of 2006, the Company’s net interest
    margin stabilized as compared to the first half of the year. As
    a result of higher average earning assets, taxable-equivalent
    net interest income in 2005 was 3% higher than
    $1.75 billion in 2004. Average earning assets in 2005 rose
    6% from $45.2 billion in 2004. Average loans and leases
    outstanding in 2005 were up $2.4 billion, or 6%, from
    $37.1 billion in 2004, largely due to growth in commercial
    loans and leases, commercial real estate loans and consumer real
    estate loans, partially offset by a decline in consumer loans
    and leases. Net interest margin in 2005 declined 11 basis
    points from 3.88% in 2004, largely due to the rising interest
    rate environment which resulted in the rates paid on
    interest-bearing liabilities rising more rapidly than yields on
    earning assets.



The provision for credit losses declined to $80 million in
    2006 from $88 million in 2005 and $95 million in 2004.
    The reduced levels of the provision during the past two years as
    compared with 2004 were reflective of generally favorable credit
    quality. Net charge-offs were $68 million in 2006, down
    from $77 million in 2005 and $82 million in 2004. Net
    charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases
    outstanding decreased to .16% in 2006 from .19% in 2005 and .22%
    in 2004. The provision in each year represents the result of
    management’s analysis of the composition of the loan and
    lease portfolio and other factors, including concern regarding
    uncertainty about economic conditions, both nationally and in
    many of the markets served by the Company, and the impact of
    such conditions and prospects on the abilities of borrowers to
    repay loans. While most credit quality measures improved from
    2004 to 2005, the Company did experience an increase in
    nonperforming loans during the second half of 2006, due largely
    to the addition of four relationships with automobile dealers.

Noninterest income rose 10% to $1.05 billion in 2006 from
    $950 million in 2005. Higher mortgage banking revenues,
    service charges on deposit accounts, trust income, brokerage
    services income, and other revenues contributed to that
    improvement. Included in noninterest income in 2006 was a
    $13 million gain resulting from the accelerated recognition
    of a purchase accounting premium related to the call of a
    $200 million Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”)
    of Atlanta borrowing assumed in a previous acquisition. Losses
    from bank investment securities in 2005 included a
    $29 million non-cash,

other-than-temporary

impairment charge in the third quarter related to preferred
    stock issuances of the Federal National Mortgage Association
    (“FNMA”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
    Corporation (“FHLMC”). Excluding the impact of
    securities gains and losses in both years and the
    $13 million gain on the called borrowing in 2006,
    noninterest income rose 5% from 2005 to 2006. Noninterest income
    totaled $943 million in 2004. Comparing 2005 with 2004,
    higher mortgage banking revenues, corporate financing advisory
    fees, gains on sales of commercial lease equipment and other
    property, and other revenues were largely offset by the
    $29 million impairment charge in 2005. Excluding gains and
    losses from investment securities, noninterest income in 2005
    rose $38 million or 4% from 2004.

Noninterest expense in 2006 aggregated $1.55 billion, up 4%
    from $1.49 billion in 2005. Noninterest expense in 2004 was
    $1.52 billion. Included in such amounts are expenses
    considered by M

&

T to be
    “nonoperating” in nature, consisting of amortization
    of core deposit and other intangible assets of $63 million,
    $57 million and $75 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively, and merger-related expenses of $5 million in
    2006. As already noted, there were no merger-related expenses in
    2005 or 2004. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses,
    noninterest operating expenses aggregated $1.48 billion in
    2006, $1.43 billion in 2005 and $1.44 billion in 2004.
    Included in operating expenses in 2006 and 2004 were
    tax-deductible contributions made to The
    M

&

T Charitable
    Foundation, a tax-exempt private charitable foundation, of
    $18 million and $25 million, respectively. There was
    no similar contribution made in 2005. Excluding the impact of
    the charitable contribution, operating expenses in 2006
    increased $37 million, or 3%, from 2005. The most
    significant contributor to that increase was a higher level of
    salaries expense, reflecting the impact of merit pay increases
    and higher stock-based compensation costs and other incentive
    pay. Excluding the impact of the $25 million charitable
    contribution in 2004, noninterest operating expenses in 2005
    increased $13 million, or less than 1%, from 2004. That
    slight increase reflects higher costs of providing health care
    and retirement benefits to employees and higher professional
    services expenses offset, in part, by a reversal of a portion of
    the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized
    residential mortgage servicing rights, due to higher residential
    mortgage loan interest rates.

The efficiency ratio expresses the relationship of operating
    expenses to revenues. The Company’s efficiency ratio, or
    noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of
    taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income
    (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities),
    was 51.5% in 2006, compared with 51.2% in 2005 and 53.5% in 2004.

Interest income data are on a

    represents additional income taxes that would be due if all
    interest income were subject to income taxes. This adjustment,
    which is related to interest received on qualified municipal
    securities, industrial revenue financings and preferred equity
    securities, is based on a composite income tax rate of
    approximately 39% for 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2002, and 36% for
    2003.

Supplemental
    Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations

As a result of business combinations and other acquisitions, the
    Company had intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core
    deposit and other intangible assets totaling $3.2 billion
    at December 31, 2006, $3.0 billion at
    December 31, 2005 and $3.1 billion at
    December 31, 2004. Included in such intangible assets was
    goodwill of $2.9 billion at December 31, 2006, 2005
    and 2004. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible
    assets, after tax effect, totaled $38 million,
    $35 million and $46 million during 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively.

Since 1998, M

&

T has
    consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a
    “net operating” or “tangible” basis, in
    which M

&

T excludes the
    after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other
    intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit
    intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of
    applicable deferred tax amounts, when calculating certain
    performance ratios) and expenses associated with integrating
    acquired operations into the Company, since such expenses are
    considered by management to be “nonoperating” in
    nature. Although “net operating income” as defined by
    M

&

T is not a GAAP
    measure, M

&

T’s
    management believes that this information helps investors
    understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported
    results.

Net operating income increased 8% to $881 million in 2006
    from $817 million in 2005. Diluted net operating earnings
    per share in 2006 rose 10% to $7.73 from $7.03 in 2005. Net
    operating income and diluted net operating earnings per share
    were $769 million and $6.38, respectively, during 2004.

Reconciliations of net income and diluted earnings per share
    with net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per
    share are presented in table 2.

Net operating income expressed as a rate of return on average
    tangible assets was 1.67% in 2006, compared with 1.60% in 2005
    and 1.59% in 2004. Net operating return on average tangible
    common equity was 29.55% in 2006, improved from 29.06% and
    28.76% in 2005 and 2004, respectively.



Reconciliations of average assets and equity with average

Net
    Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities

Reflecting growth in average earning assets that was largely
    offset by a narrowing of the net interest margin,
    taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 1% to
    $1.84 billion in 2006 from $1.81 billion in 2005.
    Average earning assets increased 3% to $49.7 billion in
    2006 from $48.1 billion in 2005. That growth resulted from
    a 5% increase in average outstanding balances of loans and
    leases of $1.9 billion, offset in part by a 5% decline in
    average outstanding balances of investment securities of $441
    million. The positive impact of higher average earning assets on
    taxable-equivalent net interest income was largely offset by a
    narrowing of the Company’s net interest margin, which
    declined to 3.70% in 2006 from 3.77% in 2005.

Average loans and leases outstanding aggregated
    $41.4 billion in 2006, up 5% from $39.5 billion in
    2005. The higher average outstanding loan balances were the
    result of growth in commercial loans and leases, commercial real
    estate loans and residential real estate loans. Average
    commercial loans and leases rose 8% to $11.3 billion in
    2006 from $10.5 billion in 2005. Commercial real estate
    loans averaged $15.1 billion during 2006, 5% higher than
    $14.3 billion in 2005, reflecting a $336 million rise
    in construction loans to developers of residential real estate
    properties. The Company’s residential real estate loan
    portfolio averaged $5.0 billion in 2006, up 28% from
    $3.9 billion in 2005. Included in that portfolio were loans
    held for sale, which averaged $1.5 billion in 2006, 19%
    above the $1.2 billion averaged in 2005. Excluding such
    loans, average residential real estate loans increased
    $861 million from 2005 to 2006. That increase was largely
    the result of the Company’s decision to retain higher
    levels of residential real estate loans having certain
    characteristics, due to narrowing margins available in the
    marketplace when selling such loans and the lack of availability
    of investment securities to acquire that met the Company’s
    desired characteristics and provided suitable returns. Consumer
    loans and leases averaged $10.0 billion in 2006, down 7%
    from $10.8 billion in 2005. That decline was the result of
    lower average balances of automobile loans and leases, which
    decreased 22% to $2.9 billion in 2006 from
    $3.7 billion in 2005, reflecting the Company’s
    decision to allow such balances to decline rather than matching
    interest rates offered by competitors. During late 2006, the
    interest rate environment relating to the Company’s
    automobile lending business improved and from September 30
    to December 31, outstanding balances of such loans
    increased slightly.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose 3% to
    $1.81 billion in 2005 from $1.75 billion in 2004. That
    improvement reflected a 6% increase in average earning assets to
    $48.1 billion in 2005 from $45.2 billion in 2004,
    partially offset by a narrowing of the Company’s net
    interest margin, which declined to 3.77% in 2005 from 3.88% in
    2004. The growth in average earning assets reflects higher
    average loans and leases outstanding, which rose 6% to
    $39.5 billion in 2005 from 2004’s average of
    $37.1 billion, and higher average investment securities
    balances, which also increased 6% to $8.5 billion in 2005
    from $8.0 billion in 2004. The Company experienced growth
    in most major loan categories during 2005 as compared with 2004.
    Average commercial loans and leases rose 10% to
    $10.5 billion in 2005 from $9.5 billion in 2004,
    reflecting, in part, a $212 million rise in average
    automobile floor plan loans outstanding. Commercial real estate
    loans averaged $14.3 billion during 2005, 8% higher than
    $13.3 billion in 2004. Contributing to that increase were
    $467 million of higher average balances of construction
    loans to developers of residential real estate properties.
    Average residential real estate loan balances rose 26% to
    $3.9 billion in 2005 from $3.1 billion in 2004. A
    higher level of loans held for sale was the most significant
    contributor to that increase. Consumer loans and leases averaged
    $10.8 billion during 2005, down 4% from $11.2 billion
    in 2004. Average balances of automobile loans and leases
    decreased 16% to $3.7 billion in 2005 from
    $4.4 billion in 2004, largely due to unfavorable rates
    being offered by competitors. Partially offsetting the drop in
    automobile loan and lease balances was a 13% rise in average
    outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit to
    $4.0 billion in 2005 from $3.5 billion in 2004.

Table 4 summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in 2006

Commercial loans and leases, excluding loans secured by real
    estate, were $11.7 billion at December 31, 2006,
    representing 27% of total loans and leases. Table 5 presents
    information on such commercial loans and leases as of
    December 31, 2006 relating to geographic area, size, and
    whether the loans are secured by collateral or unsecured. Of the
    $11.7 billion of commercial loans and leases outstanding at
    the end of 2006, approximately $9.7 billion, or 83%, were
    secured, while 49%, 26% and 13% were granted to businesses in
    New York State, Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively. The
    Company provides financing for leases to commercial customers,
    primarily for equipment. Commercial leases included in total
    commercial loans and leases at December 31, 2006 aggregated
    $1.2 billion, of which 41% were secured by collateral
    located in New York State, 13% were secured by collateral in
    Maryland and another 13% were secured by collateral in
    Pennsylvania.



International loans included in commercial loans and leases
    totaled $176 million and $217 million at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company
    participates in the insurance and guarantee programs of the
    Export-Import Bank of the United States. These programs provide
    U.S. government repayment coverage of 90% to 100% on loans
    supporting foreign borrowers’ purchases of U.S. goods
    and services. The loans generally range from $500 thousand to
    $10 million. The outstanding balances of loans under these
    programs at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were
    $143 million and $200 million, respectively.

Loans secured by real estate, including outstanding balances of
    home equity loans and lines of credit which the Company
    classifies as consumer loans, represented approximately 62% of
    the loan and lease portfolio during 2006, compared with 60% in
    2005 and 58% in 2004. At December 31, 2006, the Company
    held approximately $15.4 billion of commercial real estate
    loans, $6.0 billion of consumer real estate loans secured
    by

one-to-four

family residential properties (including $1.9 billion of
    loans held for sale) and $5.4 billion of outstanding
    balances of home equity loans and lines of credit, compared with
    $14.5 billion, $4.4 billion and $5.3 billion,
    respectively, at December 31, 2005.

A significant portion of commercial real estate loans originated
    by the Company are secured by properties in the New York City
    metropolitan area, including areas in neighboring states
    generally



considered to be within commuting distance of New York City, and
    other areas of New York State where the Company operates.
    Commercial real estate loans are also originated through the
    Company’s offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia,
    Washington, D.C., Oregon and West Virginia. Commercial real
    estate loans originated by the Company include fixed-rate
    instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the
    remaining unpaid principal at maturity, in many cases five years
    after origination. For borrowers in good standing, the terms of
    such loans may be extended by the customer for an additional
    five years at the then current market rate of interest. The
    Company also originates fixed-rate commercial real estate loans
    with maturities of greater than five years, generally having
    original maturity terms of approximately ten years, and
    adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans. Excluding
    construction loans, adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans
    represented approximately 41% of the commercial real estate loan
    portfolio as of December 31, 2006. Table 6 presents
    commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of
    collateral and size of the loans outstanding at
    December 31, 2006. Of the $5.1 billion of commercial
    real estate loans in the New York City metropolitan area,
    approximately 31% were secured by multifamily residential
    properties, 40% by retail space and 8% by office space. The
    Company’s experience has been that office space and retail
    properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in
    value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions
    than do multifamily residential properties. Approximately 45% of
    the aggregate dollar amount of New York City-area loans were for
    loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less,
    while loans of more than $15 million made up approximately
    24% of the total.

Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located in
    other parts of New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and other
    areas tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and
    include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the
    mortgaged property in their trade or business. Approximately 69%
    of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial real estate loans
    in New York State secured by properties located outside of the
    metropolitan New York City area were for loans with outstanding
    balances of $5 million or less. Of the outstanding balances
    of commercial real estate loans in Pennsylvania and Maryland,
    approximately 76% and 57%, respectively, were for loans with
    outstanding balances of $5 million or less.

Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located
    outside of Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York State and areas of
    states neighboring New York considered to be part of the New
    York City metropolitan area, comprised 14% of total commercial
    real estate loans as of December 31, 2006.

Commercial real estate construction loans presented in table 6
    totaled $2.8 billion at December 31, 2006, or 6% of
    total loans and leases. Approximately 97% of those construction
    loans had adjustable interest rates. Included in such loans at
    December 31, 2006 were $1.1 billion of loans to
    developers of residential real estate properties. The remainder
    of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio was
    comprised of loans made for various purposes, including the
    construction of office buildings, multi-family residential
    housing, retail space and other commercial development.

M

&

T Realty Capital
    Corporation, one of the Company’s commercial real estate
    lending subsidiaries, participates in the FNMA Delegated
    Underwriting and Servicing (“DUS”) program, pursuant
    to which commercial real estate loans are originated in
    accordance with terms and conditions specified by FNMA and sold.
    Under this program, loans are sold with partial credit recourse
    to M

&

T Realty Capital
    Corporation. The amount of recourse is generally limited to
    one-third of any credit loss incurred by the purchaser on an
    individual loan, although in some cases the recourse amount is
    less than one-third of the outstanding principal balance. At
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, approximately $939 million
    and $941 million, respectively, of commercial real estate
    loan balances serviced for others had been sold with recourse.
    There have been no material losses incurred as a result of those
    recourse arrangements. Commercial real estate loans held for
    sale at December 31, 2006 and 2005 aggregated
    $49 million and $199 million, respectively. At
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, commercial real estate loans
    serviced for other investors by the Company were
    $4.9 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. Those
    serviced loans are not included in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet.

Real estate loans secured by

one-to-four

family residential properties were $6.0 billion at
    December 31, 2006, including approximately 31% secured by
    properties located in New York State, 13% secured by properties
    located in Pennsylvania and 9% secured by properties located in
    Maryland. At December 31, 2006, $1.9 billion of
    residential real estate loans were held for sale, compared with
    $1.2 billion at December 31, 2005. Loans to finance
    the construction of

one-to-four

family residential properties totaled $693 million at
    December 31, 2006, or approximately 2% of total loans and
    leases, compared with $583 million or 1% at
    December 31, 2005.

Consumer loans and leases comprised approximately 24% of the
    average loan portfolio during 2006, down from 27% in 2005 and
    30% in 2004. The two largest components of the consumer loan
    portfolio are outstanding balances of home equity lines of
    credit and automobile loans and leases. Average balances of home
    equity lines of credit outstanding represented approximately 10%
    of average loans outstanding in 2006 and 2005. Automobile loans
    and leases represented approximately 7% of the Company’s
    average loan portfolio during 2006, down from 9% in 2005. No
    other consumer loan product represented more than 4% of average
    loans outstanding in 2006. Approximately 54% of home equity
    lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2006 were
    secured by properties in New York State, and 18% and 22% were
    secured by properties in Pennsylvania and Maryland,
    respectively. Average outstanding balances on home equity lines
    of credit were $4.2 billion in 2006, up 5% from
    $4.0 billion in 2005. The Company continues to pursue
    growing the home equity portfolio, which has historically
    experienced a lower level of credit losses than other types of
    consumer loans. However, the rate of growth from 2005 to 2006
    slowed, reflecting the impact of rising interest rates on this
    portfolio of predominantly variable interest rate loans. At
    December 31, 2006, 30% and 32% of the automobile loan and
    lease portfolio were to customers residing in New York State and
    Pennsylvania, respectively. Although automobile loans and leases
    have generally been originated through dealers, all applications
    submitted through dealers are



subject to the Company’s normal underwriting and loan
    approval procedures. Since mid-2004, the Company has experienced
    a general slowdown in its automobile loan origination business,
    resulting from increased competition from other lenders,
    including financing incentives offered by automobile
    manufacturers. Throughout that period, the Company chose not to
    match the pricing being offered by many competitors. During late
    2006 the interest rate environment as it relates to these loans
    improved such that the outstanding balances in this portfolio
    increased by $42 million to $2.7 billion at
    December 31, 2006 from September 30, 2006.

Automobile leases outstanding averaged approximately
    $53 million in 2006, compared with $137 million in
    2005 and $308 million in 2004. The Company ceased
    origination of automobile leases during 2003. That decision did
    not have a significant impact on the Company’s results of
    operations. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, outstanding
    automobile leases totaled $29 million and $85 million,
    respectively.

Table 7 presents the composition of the Company’s loan and
    lease portfolio at the end of 2006, including outstanding
    balances to businesses and consumers in New York State,
    Pennsylvania, Maryland and other states. Approximately 48% of
    total loans and leases at December 31, 2006 were to New
    York State customers, while 21% and 12% were to Pennsylvania and
    Maryland customers, respectively.

Balances of investment securities averaged $8.0 billion in
    2006 and 2004, compared with $8.5 billion in 2005. The
    decline in such securities from 2005 to 2006 reflects net
    paydowns of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized
    mortgage obligations. The Company has allowed the investment
    securities portfolio to decline as the opportunity to purchase
    securities at favorable spreads, that is, the difference



between the yield earned on a security and the rate paid on
    funds used to purchase it, has been limited. The increase in
    average balances of investment securities from 2004 to 2005 was
    the result of net purchases in late 2004 and in 2005 consisting
    largely of collateralized residential mortgage obligations. The
    investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of
    residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and
    collateralized mortgage obligations, debt securities issued by
    municipalities, debt and preferred equity securities issued by
    government-sponsored agencies and certain financial
    institutions, and shorter-term U.S. Treasury notes. When
    purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its
    overall interest-rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of
    expected returns relative to risks assumed, including
    prepayments. In managing its investment securities portfolio,
    the Company occasionally sells investment securities as a result
    of changes in interest rates and spreads, actual or anticipated
    prepayments, or credit risk associated with a particular
    security, or as a result of restructuring its investment
    securities portfolio following completion of a business
    combination. The Company regularly reviews its investment
    securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might
    be characterized as “other than temporary.” As of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company concluded that such
    declines were temporary in nature. Events occurring during
    2005’s third quarter resulted in the Company recognizing an

other-than-temporary

impairment charge of $29 million related to preferred
    securities of FNMA and FHLMC. Additional information about the
    investment securities portfolio is included in note 3 of
    Notes to Financial Statements.

Other earning assets include deposits at banks, trading account
    assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities.
    Those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged
    $183 million in 2006, $113 million in 2005 and
    $74 million in 2004. The amounts of investment securities
    and other earning assets held by the Company are influenced by
    such factors as demand for loans, which generally yield more
    than investment securities and other earning assets, ongoing
    repayments, the level of deposits, and management of balance
    sheet size and resulting capital ratios.

The most significant source of funding for the Company is core
    deposits, which are comprised of noninterest-bearing deposits,
    interest-bearing transaction accounts, nonbrokered savings
    deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under $100,000.
    The Company’s branch network is its principal source of
    core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than
    wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Also included in core
    deposits are certificates of deposit under $100,000 generated on
    a nationwide basis by
    M

&

T Bank, N.A. Core
    deposits averaged $28.3 billion in 2006, $27.9 billion
    in 2005 and $28.1 billion in 2004. The previously discussed
    June 30, 2006 branch acquisition added approximately
    $880 million to average core deposits during the second
    half of 2006, or approximately $443 million for the full year.
    The rise in average balances of time deposits less than $100,000
    in 2006 compared with 2005 and in 2005 as compared with 2004 was
    partially due to customer response to higher interest rates
    offered on those products, resulting in a shift of funds from
    savings and non-interest bearing deposit accounts to time
    deposits. Average core deposits of
    M

&

T Bank, N.A. were
    $387 million in 2006, $216 million in 2005 and
    $223 million in 2004. Funding provided by core deposits
    represented 57% of average earning assets in 2006, compared with
    58% in 2005 and 62% in 2004. Table 8 summarizes average core
    deposits in 2006 and percentage changes in the components of
    such deposits over the past two years.

Additional sources of funding for the Company include domestic
    time deposits of $100,000 or more, deposits originated through
    the Company’s offshore branch office, and brokered
    deposits. Domestic time deposits over $100,000, excluding
    brokered certificates of deposit, averaged $2.9 billion in
    2006, $1.8 billion in 2005 and $1.2 billion in 2004.
    Offshore branch deposits, primarily comprised of accounts with
    balances of $100,000 or more, averaged $3.6 billion in
    2006, $3.8 billion in 2005 and $3.1 billion in 2004.
    Average brokered time deposits totaled $3.5 billion in
    2006, compared with $2.7 billion in 2005 and
    $1.4 billion in 2004, and at December 31, 2006 and
    2005 totaled $2.7 billion and $3.7 billion,
    respectively. At December 31, 2006, the weighted-average
    remaining term to maturity of brokered time deposits was
    11 months. Certain of these brokered deposits have
    provisions that allow for early redemption. In connection with
    the Company’s management of interest rate risk, interest
    rate swap agreements have been entered into under which the
    Company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable
    rate and that have notional amounts and terms substantially
    similar to the amounts and terms of $390 million of
    brokered time deposits. The Company also had brokered
    money-market deposit accounts, which averaged $69 million,
    $62 million and $57 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. Offshore branch deposits and brokered deposits
    have been used by the Company as an alternative to short-term
    borrowings. Additional amounts of offshore branch deposits or
    brokered deposits may be solicited in the future depending on
    market conditions, including demand by customers and other
    investors for such deposits, and the cost of funds available
    from alternative sources at the time.

The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers,
    various Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”), and
    others as sources of funding. Short-term borrowings averaged
    $4.5 billion in 2006, $4.9 billion in 2005 and
    $5.1 billion in 2004. Included in short-term borrowings
    were unsecured federal funds borrowings, which generally mature
    daily, and averaged $3.7 billion, $4.1 billion and
    $4.3 billion in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
    Overnight federal funds borrowings represent the largest
    component of short-term borrowings and are obtained daily from a
    wide variety of banks and other financial institutions. Also
    included in short-term borrowings is a $500 million
    revolving asset-backed structured borrowing secured by
    automobile loans that were transferred to
    M

&

T Auto
    Receivables I, LLC, a special purpose subsidiary of
    M

&

T Bank. The
    subsidiary, the loans and the borrowings are included in the
    consolidated financial statements of the Company. Additional
    information about M

&

T
    Auto Receivables I, LLC and the revolving borrowing
    agreement is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial
    Statements.

The average balance of long-term borrowings was
    $6.0 billion in 2006, $6.4 billion in 2005 and
    $5.8 billion in 2004. Included in average long-term
    borrowings were amounts borrowed from the FHLBs of
    $3.8 billion in each of 2006 and 2005, and
    $3.3 billion in 2004, and subordinated capital notes of
    $1.2 billion in 2006 and $1.3 billion in 2005 and
    2004. M

&

T Bank issued
    $500 million of subordinated notes in December 2006, in
    part to maintain appropriate regulatory capital ratios. The
    notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.629% until December
    2016 and a floating rate thereafter until maturity in December
    2021, at a rate equal to the three-month London Interbank
    Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus .64%. Beginning December
    2016, M

&

T Bank may, at
    its option and subject to prior regulatory approval, redeem some
    or all of the notes on any interest payment date. In December
    2005, M

&

T Bank
    exchanged $363 million of 8.0% subordinated notes due
    2010 for $409 million of subordinated notes bearing a fixed
    coupon rate of interest of 5.585% through December 2015 and a
    variable rate of interest equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.215%
    from December 2015 to the maturity date in December 2020.
    Beginning December 2015,
    M

&

T Bank may, at its
    option and subject to prior regulatory approval, redeem some or
    all of the new notes on any interest payment date. In accordance
    with GAAP, the Company accounted for the exchange as a
    modification of debt terms and not as an extinguishment of debt
    because, among other factors, the present value of the cash
    flows under the terms of the new subordinated notes was not at
    least ten percent different from the present value of the
    remaining cash flows under the original terms of the exchanged
    subordinated notes. Coincident with the exchange,
    M

&

T Bank terminated
    $363 million out of a total notional amount of
    $500 million of interest rate swap agreements that were
    used to hedge the 8.0% subordinated notes. Under the terms of
    the swap agreements, the Company pays a variable rate of
    interest and receives a fixed rate. The Company paid
    $15 million to terminate the $363 million notional
    amount of the interest rate swap agreements. A hedge valuation
    adjustment of $15 million related to the $363 million
    of exchanged subordinated notes became part of the carrying
    value of the new subordinated



notes. The remaining portion of that valuation adjustment, which
    is being amortized to interest expense over the period to
    expected maturity of the new notes, was $14 million at
    December 31, 2006. Including the impact of such
    amortization, the new subordinated notes have an effective rate
    of 7.76%. The $137 million notional amount of the interest
    rate swap agreement that was not terminated continues to hedge
    the remaining $137 million of 8.0% subordinated notes.
    Further information on interest rate swap agreements is provided
    in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. Junior
    subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred
    securities that were included in average long-term borrowings
    were $712 million, $711 million and $710 million
    in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Additional information
    regarding junior subordinated debentures, as well as information
    regarding contractual maturities of long-term borrowings, is
    provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Changes in the composition of the Company’s earning assets
    and interest-bearing liabilities as described herein, as well as
    changes in interest rates and spreads, can impact net interest
    income. From June 30, 2004 to June 30, 2006, the
    Federal Reserve raised its benchmark overnight federal funds
    target rate seventeen times, each increase representing a
    25 basis point increment over the previously effective
    target rate. Specifically, during the first half of 2006, four
    increases were initiated; during 2005, eight increases occurred;
    and in the second half of 2004, the target federal funds rate
    was raised five times. In such a rising interest rate
    environment, rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, most
    notably short-term borrowings, have risen more rapidly than have
    the yields on earning assets. The result of these conditions was
    a contraction of the net interest spread, or the difference
    between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on
    interest-bearing liabilities, which declined 22 basis
    points from 3.32% in 2005 to 3.10% in 2006. The yield on earning
    assets during 2006 was 6.71%, 88 basis points higher than
    5.83% in 2005, while the rate paid on interest-bearing
    liabilities increased 110 basis points to 3.61% from 2.51%
    in 2005. The yield on the Company’s earning assets rose
    70 basis points in 2005 from 5.13% in 2004, while the rate
    paid on interest-bearing liabilities in 2005 was up
    98 basis points from 1.53% in 2004. As a result, the
    Company’s net interest spread decreased from 3.60% in 2004
    to 3.32% in 2005.

Net interest-free funds consist largely of noninterest-bearing
    demand deposits and stockholders’ equity, partially offset
    by bank owned life insurance and non-earning assets, including
    goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets. Net
    interest-free funds averaged $8.2 billion in 2006, compared
    with $8.6 billion in 2005 and $8.3 billion in 2004.
    Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged
    $3.1 billion in 2006 and 2004, and $3.0 billion in
    2005. The cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance
    averaged $1.1 billion in 2006, $1.0 billion in 2005
    and $974 million in 2004. Increases in the cash surrender
    value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest
    income, but rather are recorded in “other revenues from
    operations.” The contribution of net interest-free funds to
    net interest margin was .60% in 2006, .45% in 2005 and .28% in
    2004. The rise in the contribution to net interest margin
    ascribed to net interest-free funds in 2006 and 2005 as compared
    with the immediately preceding years resulted largely from the
    impact of higher interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities
    used to value such contribution.

Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the
    contribution of interest-free funds as described herein, the
    Company’s net interest margin was 3.70% in 2006, compared
    with 3.77% in 2005 and 3.88% in 2004. Future changes in market
    interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition
    of the Company’s portfolios of earning assets and
    interest-bearing liabilities that result in reductions in
    spreads, could adversely impact the Company’s net interest
    income and net interest margin. Through the second quarter of
    2006, the Company’s net interest margin had been declining
    since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in June
    2004. During the last half of 2006, the Federal Reserve held
    interest rates steady and the Company’s net interest margin
    stabilized.

Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in
    interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income
    under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate
    risk, the Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to
    modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its
    portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
    Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are
    generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or the
    rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The notional amount
    of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate
    risk management purposes at December 31, 2006 was
    $1.0 billion. Under the terms of these swap



agreements, the Company receives payments based on the
    outstanding notional amount of the swaps at fixed rates and
    makes payments at variable rates.

As of December 31, 2006, all of the Company’s interest
    rate swap agreements entered into for risk management purposes
    had been designated as fair value hedges. Additional information
    about those swap agreements and the items being hedged is
    included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. In a
    fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the interest
    rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of the hedged
    item are recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current
    earnings. The difference between changes in the fair value of
    the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items
    represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in “other
    revenues from operations” in the Company’s
    consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, unlike
    in a fair value hedge, the effective portion of the
    derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a
    component of other comprehensive income and subsequently
    reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction
    affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is
    reported in “other revenues from operations”
    immediately. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in
    2006, 2005 and 2004 were not material to the Company’s
    results of operations. The estimated aggregate fair value of
    interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges
    represented a loss of approximately $15 million and
    $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The fair values of such swap agreements were
    substantially offset by changes in the fair values of the hedged
    items. The changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap
    agreements and the hedged items result from the effects of
    changing interest rates. The average notional amounts of
    interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate
    risk management purposes, the related effect on net interest
    income and margin, and the weighted-average interest rates paid
    or received on those swap agreements are presented in table 9.

Provision
    For Credit Losses

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in
    management’s judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent
    in the loan and lease portfolio. A provision for credit losses
    is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed
    necessary by management. The provision for credit losses was
    $80 million in 2006, down from $88 million in 2005 and
    $95 million in 2004. Net loan charge-offs declined to
    $68 million in 2006 from $77 million and
    $82 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net loan
    charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were
    .16% in 2006, compared with .19% in 2005 and .22% in 2004. A
    summary of the Company’s loan charge-offs, provision and
    allowance for credit losses is presented in table 10.

Nonperforming loans, consisting of nonaccrual and restructured
    loans, aggregated $224 million or .52% of outstanding loans
    and leases at December 31, 2006, compared with
    $156 million or .39% at December 31, 2005 and
    $172 million or .45% at December 31, 2004. The
    increase in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2006 from a
    year earlier was largely due to the addition of four
    relationships with automobile dealers totaling approximately
    $41 million. The lower level of nonperforming loans at the



2005 year-end as compared with a year earlier reflects an
    overall improvement in borrower repayment performance.

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were
    $111 million or .26% of total loans and leases at
    December 31, 2006, compared with $129 million or .32%
    at December 31, 2005 and $155 million or .40% at
    December 31, 2004. Those loans included loans guaranteed by
    government-related entities of $77 million,
    $106 million and $121 million at December 31,
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Such guaranteed loans
    included

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company that
    were repurchased to reduce associated servicing costs, including
    a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that
    had not been received from individual mortgagors. The
    outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans are
    fully guaranteed by government-related entities and totaled
    $65 million at December 31, 2006, $79 million at
    December 31, 2005 and $104 million at
    December 31, 2004. Loans past due 90 days or more and
    accruing interest that were guaranteed by government-related
    entities also included foreign commercial and industrial loans
    supported by the Export-Import Bank of the United States that
    totaled $11 million at December 31, 2006, compared
    with $26 million and $17 million at December 31,
    2005 and 2004, respectively. A summary of nonperforming assets
    and certain past due loan data and credit quality ratios is

Factors that influence the Company’s credit loss experience
    include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and
    consumers, in general, and, due to the size of the
    Company’s commercial real estate loan portfolio, real
    estate valuations, in particular. Commercial real estate
    valuations can be highly subjective, as they are based upon many
    assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over
    relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate,
    economic conditions, interest rates, and, in many cases, the
    results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the
    real property.

Net charge-offs of commercial loans and leases totaled
    $20 million in each of 2006 and 2004, compared with
    $26 million in 2005. Nonperforming commercial loans and
    leases were $79 million at December 31, 2006,
    $39 million a year earlier and $45 million at
    December 31, 2004. As noted earlier,



the increase in such loans from the 2005 year-end to
    December 31, 2006 largely reflects the addition of four
    relationships with automobile dealers aggregating
    $41 million. Continued slowing of domestic automobile sales
    in 2006 has resulted in a difficult operating environment for
    certain automobile dealers, leading to deteriorating financial
    results.

Net charge-offs of commercial real estate loans during 2006 were
    $1 million, compared with net recoveries of $1 million
    in 2005 and net charge-offs of $3 million in 2004.
    Commercial real estate loans classified as nonperforming totaled
    $57 million at December 31, 2006, compared with
    $44 million at December 31, 2005 and $45 million
    at December 31, 2004. The increase from the end of 2005 to
    the 2006 year-end was largely due to the addition of a
    $10 million loan to an assisted living facility.

Residential real estate loans charged off, net of recoveries,
    were $4 million in each of 2006 and 2004, compared with
    $2 million in 2005. Nonperforming residential real estate
    loans at the 2006 year-end totaled $42 million,
    compared with $29 million and $44 million at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Residential real
    estate loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest
    totaled $92 million, $96 million and $127 million
    at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A
    substantial portion of such amounts related to guaranteed loans
    repurchased from government-related entities.

Net charge-offs of consumer loans and leases during 2006 totaled
    $43 million, representing .43% of average consumer loans
    and leases outstanding, compared with $50 million or .47%
    in 2005 and $55 million or .49% in 2004. Indirect
    automobile loans and leases represented the most significant
    category of consumer loan charge-offs in each of the past three
    years. Net charge-offs of indirect automobile loans and leases
    were $24 million during 2006, and $37 million during
    each of 2005 and 2004. Nonperforming consumer loans and leases
    were $46 million at December 31, 2006, representing
    .46% of outstanding consumer loans and leases, compared with
    $44 million or .42% at December 31, 2005 and
    $38 million or .35% at December 31, 2004. Consumer
    loans and leases past due 90 days or more and accruing
    interest totaled $3 million at December 31, 2006,
    $1 million at December 31, 2005 and $2 million at
    December 31, 2004.

Management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for
    credit losses by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and
    lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing
    economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial
    condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in
    which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the
    value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of
    any guarantees or indemnifications. Management evaluated the
    impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic
    conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment
    obligations when quantifying the Company’s exposure to
    credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the Company’s
    allowance for such losses as of each reporting date. Factors
    also considered by management when performing its assessment, in
    addition to general economic conditions and the other factors
    described above, included, but were not limited to: (i) the
    concentration of commercial real estate loans in the
    Company’s loan portfolio, particularly the large
    concentration of loans secured by properties in New York State,
    in general, and in the New York City metropolitan area, in
    particular; (ii) the amount of commercial and industrial
    loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the
    New York City metropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that
    have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality
    than the vast majority of other regions of the country; and
    (iii) the size of the Company’s portfolio of loans to
    individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher
    net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than other
    loan types. The level of the allowance is adjusted based on the
    results of management’s analysis.

Management cautiously and conservatively evaluated the allowance
    for credit losses as of December 31, 2006 in light of
    (i) the sluggish pace of economic growth in many of the
    markets served by the Company; (ii) continuing weakness in
    industrial employment in upstate New York and central
    Pennsylvania; and (iii) the significant subjectivity
    involved in commercial real estate valuations for properties
    located in areas with stagnant or low growth economies. Although
    the national economy experienced moderate growth in 2006 with
    inflation being reasonably well contained, concerns exist about
    the level and volatility of energy prices; a weakening housing
    market, particularly concerns about possible over-valued real
    estate; Federal Reserve positioning of monetary policy; the
    underlying impact on businesses’ operations and abilities
    to repay loans resulting from a higher level of interest rates;



sluggish job creation, which could cause consumer spending to
    slow; continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New
    York and central Pennsylvania regions; continued slowing of
    domestic automobile sales; and modest loan demand in many market
    areas served by the Company.

In ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses,
    the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled
    credits and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and
    leases. The total allowance for credit losses, therefore,
    includes both specific and inherent base level loss components,
    as well as inherent unallocated loss components. The following
    paragraphs describe these components.

For purposes of determining the level of the allowance for
    credit losses, the Company segments its loan and lease portfolio
    by loan type. The amount of specific loss components in the
    Company’s loan and lease portfolios is determined through a
    loan by loan analysis of commercial and commercial real estate
    loans greater than $350,000 which are in nonaccrual status.
    Measurement of the specific loss components is typically based
    on expected future cash flows, collateral values and other
    factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay.
    Impaired loans, as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 114, “Accounting by
    Creditors for Impairment of a Loan,” as amended, are
    evaluated for specific loss components. Except for consumer
    loans and leases and residential real estate loans that are
    considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated
    collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired for
    purposes of applying SFAS No. 114 when, based on
    current information and events, it is probable that the Company
    will be unable to collect all amounts according to the
    contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is
    delinquent 90 days or more. Loans less than 90 days
    delinquent are deemed to have a minimal delay in payment and are
    generally not considered to be impaired for purposes of applying
    SFAS No. 114.

The inherent base level loss components are generally determined
    by applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan
    type and management’s classification of such loans under
    the Company’s loan grading system. The Company utilizes an
    extensive loan grading system which is applied to all commercial
    and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers are
    responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans
    based on standards outlined in the Company’s Credit Policy.
    Internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the
    Company’s loan review department to ensure consistency and
    strict adherence to the prescribed standards.

Loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component
    computations exclude loans and leases for which specific
    allocations are maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss
    component factors that reflect the Company’s loss estimate
    for each group of loans and leases. Factors considered in
    assigning loan grades and loss component factors include
    borrower-specific information related to expected future cash
    flows and operating results, collateral value, financial
    condition, payment status, and other information; levels of and
    trends in portfolio charge-offs and recoveries; levels of and
    trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans; changes in
    the risk profile of specific portfolios; trends in volume and
    terms of loans; effects of changes in credit concentrations; and
    observed trends and practices in the banking industry.

To better classify inherent losses by specific loan categories,
    beginning in 2006 amounts previously included in the inherent
    unallocated portion of the allowance for such things as
    customer, industry and geographic concentrations as well as for
    certain national and local economic conditions have been
    included in the inherent base level loss component. As a result,
    probable losses resulting from (i) comparatively poorer
    economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in many
    market regions served by the Company, specifically upstate New
    York and central Pennsylvania, that resulted in such regions
    experiencing significantly poorer economic growth and vitality
    as compared with much of the rest of the country;
    (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding loan type,
    collateral type and geographic location, in particular the large
    concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by
    properties in the New York City metropolitan area and other
    areas of New York State; and (iii) additional risk
    associated with the Company’s portfolio of consumer loans,
    in particular automobile loans and leases, which generally have
    higher rates of loss than other types of collateralized loans,
    have been included in the inherent base level loss components at
    December 31, 2006.

In evaluating collateral value, the Company relies extensively
    on internally and externally prepared valuations. Such
    valuations, in particular commercial real estate valuations,
    utilize many assumptions and, as a result, can be highly
    subjective. Specifically, commercial real estate values in the
    New York City



metropolitan area can be significantly affected over relatively
    short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic
    conditions and interest rates, and, in many cases, the results
    of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real
    property. Additionally, management is aware that there is
    oftentimes a delay in the recognition of credit quality changes
    in assigned loan grades due to the elapse of time between the
    manifestation and reporting of underlying events that impact
    credit quality and, accordingly, loss estimates derived from the
    inherent base level loss component computation are adjusted for
    current national and local economic conditions and trends.
    Economic indicators in the most significant market regions
    served by the Company were mixed during 2006. Private sector job
    growth in the upstate New York market was 0.2%, or well below
    the 1.5% national average. The manufacturing-oriented
    metropolitan areas of Buffalo, Rochester and Binghamton
    continued to experience weakness, including continued industrial
    downsizing. Job growth in areas of Pennsylvania served by the
    Company and in Maryland matched the national average. The
    results for the Pennsylvania markets are particularly noteworthy
    since job growth in that region had significantly lagged
    national averages for several years prior to 2006. Job growth in
    New York City (1.8%) and the Greater Washington D.C. region
    (3.0%), particularly northern Virginia (3.6%), was higher than
    the national average in 2006. These mixed signals on private
    sector job growth, combined with concerns about inflation,
    higher interest rates, high levels of consumer indebtedness,
    high and volatile energy prices, weak population growth in the
    upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions that lagged
    national population growth trends and other factors, continue to
    indicate to management an environment of economic uncertainty,
    particularly in the markets served by the Company in New York
    and Pennsylvania where more than two-thirds of its lending
    business is conducted.

The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss
    components together comprise the total base level or
    “allocated” allowance for credit losses. Such
    allocated portion of the allowance represents management’s
    assessment of losses existing in specific larger balance loans
    that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other
    loans that are not individually analyzed. The inherent
    unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for
    probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable. The
    inherent unallocated allowance includes management’s
    subjective determination of amounts necessary for such things
    as; (i) the effect of expansion into new markets, including
    market areas entered through acquisitions, for which the Company
    does not have the same degree of familiarity and experience
    regarding portfolio performance in changing market conditions;
    (ii) the introduction of new loan and lease product types,
    including loans and leases to foreign and domestic borrowers
    obtained through acquisitions; and (iii) the possible use
    of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of
    the allowance.

A comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for
    each of the past five year-ends is presented in table 12.
    Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on
    information available to management at the time of each year-end
    assessment and using the methodology described herein.
    Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category
    as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in
    management’s estimate of specific loss components and
    inherent base level loss components, including in 2006, the
    allocation of losses that were previously unallocated for such
    things as customer, industry and geographic concentrations,
    certain national and local economic conditions, and other
    factors. As described in note 4 of Notes to Financial
    Statements, loans considered impaired pursuant to the
    requirements of SFAS No. 114 were $153 million at
    December 31, 2006 and $93 million at December 31,
    2005. The allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses
    related to impaired loans totaled $23 million at
    December 31, 2006 and $15 million at December 31,
    2005. The unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses
    was equal to .21% and .51% of gross loans outstanding at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in
    the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses from
    year-end 2005 to December 31, 2006 was largely attributable
    to the factors described herein. Given the inherent imprecision
    in the many estimates used in the determination of the allocated
    portion of the allowance, management deliberately remained
    cautious and conservative in establishing the unallocated
    portion of the allowance for credit losses. Given the
    Company’s high concentration of commercial loans and
    commercial real estate loans in New York State, including the
    upstate New York region, and central Pennsylvania, and
    considering the other factors already discussed herein,
    management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of
    the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and



reasonable. Nevertheless, the Company’s allowance is
    general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any
    loan or lease category.

Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at
    December 31, 2006 was adequate to absorb credit losses
    inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for
    credit losses was $650 million or 1.51% of total loans and
    leases at December 31, 2006, compared with
    $638 million or 1.58% at December 31, 2005 and
    $627 million or 1.63% at December 31, 2004. The
    decline in the level of the allowance as a percentage of
    outstanding loans and leases from the 2005 year end to
    December 31, 2006 reflects management’s evaluation of
    the loan portfolio as described herein, including a change in
    portfolio mix resulting from higher balances of residential real
    estate loans and lower balances of consumer loans. In general,
    the Company experiences significantly lower charge-off rates on
    residential real estate loans than on consumer loans. The
    decline in the level of the allowance as a percentage of
    outstanding loans and leases from December 31, 2004 to
    December 31, 2005 also reflects improvement in certain
    credit factors, including decreases in net charge-offs and
    nonperforming loans. Should the various credit factors
    considered by management in establishing the allowance for
    credit losses change and should management’s assessment of
    losses inherent in the loan portfolios also change, the level of
    the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or
    decrease in future periods. The ratio of the allowance to
    nonperforming loans at the end of 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 290%,
    408% and 364%, respectively. The level of the allowance reflects
    management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as
    of each respective date.

In establishing the allowance for credit losses, management
    follows the methodology described herein, including taking a
    conservative view of borrowers’ abilities to repay loans.
    The establishment of the allowance is extremely subjective and
    requires management to make many judgments about borrower,
    industry, regional and national economic health and performance.
    In order to present examples of the possible impact on the
    allowance from certain changes in credit quality factors, the
    Company assumed the following scenarios for possible
    deterioration of credit quality:

•

For consumer loans and leases considered smaller balance
    homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 20 basis
    point increase in loss factors;

•

For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and
    lines of credit, also considered smaller balance homogenous
    loans and evaluated collectively, a 10 basis point increase
    in loss factors; and

•

For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, which are
    not similar in nature, a migration of loans to lower-ranked risk
    grades resulting in a 30% increase in the balance of classified
    credits in each risk grade.



For possible improvement in credit quality factors, the
    scenarios assumed were:

•

For consumer loans and leases, a 10 basis point decrease in
    loss factors;

•

For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and
    lines of credit, a 5 basis point decrease in loss
    factors; and

•

For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, a
    migration of loans to higher-ranked risk grades resulting in a
    5% decrease in the balance of classified credits in each risk
    grade.

The scenario analyses resulted in an additional $48 million
    in losses that could be identifiable under the assumptions for
    credit deterioration, whereas under the assumptions for credit
    improvement an $18 million reduction in such losses could
    occur. These examples are only a few of numerous reasonably
    possible scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the
    sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses based on changes
    in assumptions and other factors.

Commercial real estate loans secured by multifamily properties
    and properties used in providing retail goods and services in
    the New York City metropolitan area represented 4% and 5%,
    respectively, of loans outstanding at December 31, 2006.
    The Company had no concentrations of credit extended to any
    specific industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at
    December 31, 2006. Outstanding loans to foreign borrowers
    were $176 million at December 31, 2006, or .4% of
    total loans and leases.

Assets acquired in settlement of defaulted loans totaled
    $12 million at December 31, 2006, compared with
    $9 million and $13 million at December 31, 2005
    and 2004, respectively.

Other
    Income

Other income rose 10% to $1.05 billion in 2006 from
    $950 million in 2005. Higher levels of mortgage banking
    revenues, service charges on deposit accounts, trust income,
    brokerage services income, and other revenues contributed to
    that improvement. As discussed previously, included in other
    income for 2006 was a $13 million gain from the accelerated
    recognition of a purchase accounting premium related to the call
    of a $200 million borrowing from the FHLB of Atlanta. In
    addition, other income in 2005 reflects the already discussed
    $29 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related
    to the Company’s investment in certain preferred stock
    issuances of FNMA and FHLMC. Excluding gains and losses from
    investment securities from both years and the $13 million
    gain on the called borrowing in 2006, other income increased 5%
    from 2005 to 2006. Other income in 2005 was 1% above the
    $943 million earned in 2004. Higher mortgage banking
    revenues, corporate financing advisory fees, gains on sales of
    commercial lease equipment and other property, and other
    revenues were offset by losses from investment securities, which
    reflect the $29 million impairment charge. Excluding gains
    and losses from investment securities, other income in 2005 rose
    $38 million or 4% from 2004.

Mortgage banking revenues were $143 million in 2006,
    compared with $136 million in 2005 and $124 million in
    2004. Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both
    residential and commercial mortgage banking activities. The
    Company’s involvement in commercial mortgage banking
    activities is largely comprised of the origination, sales and
    servicing of loans in conjunction with the FNMA DUS program.

Residential mortgage banking revenues, which consist of gains
    from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing
    rights, residential mortgage loan servicing fees, and other
    residential mortgage loan-related fees and income, increased 7%
    to $114 million in 2006 from $107 million in 2005.
    Higher revenue from servicing residential mortgage loans for
    others was the leading factor in the improvement. Residential
    mortgage banking revenues in 2005 were 7% higher than the
    $100 million earned in 2004. Higher origination activity
    was the most significant factor contributing to that increase.

Residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other
    investors totaled approximately $6.4 billion in 2006,
    compared with $6.5 billion in 2005 and $4.8 billion in
    2004. Realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans
    and loan servicing rights and recognized net unrealized gains or
    losses attributable to residential mortgage loans held for sale,
    commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell
    loans totaled $41 million in 2006, compared with
    $42 million in 2005, and $32 million in 2004. On
    May 1, 2005, the Company assumed the operations of Regions
    Financial Corporation’s wholesale residential mortgage
    business. Those operations added 13 locations and



approximately 140 employees to the
    Company’s residential mortgage banking business.
    Approximately $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion of
    residential mortgage loans originated in 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, for sale to other investors were related to the
    assumed operations.

Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others
    rose to $66 million in 2006 from $58 million in 2005
    and $57 million in 2004. Included in such servicing
    revenues were amounts related to purchased servicing rights
    associated with small balance commercial mortgage loans totaling
    $14 million, $10 million and $6 million in 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively. Residential mortgage loans serviced
    for others totaled $16.7 billion at December 31, 2006,
    $15.6 billion a year earlier and $14.9 billion at
    December 31, 2004, including the small balance commercial
    mortgage loans noted above of approximately $3.3 billion,
    $2.4 billion and $1.6 billion at December 31,
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capitalized residential
    mortgage loan servicing assets, net of a valuation allowance for
    possible impairment, totaled $153 million at
    December 31, 2006, compared with $140 million and
    $133 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. Included in capitalized residential mortgage
    servicing assets were purchased servicing rights associated with
    the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above of
    $36 million, $23 million and $13 million at
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Additional
    information about the Company’s capitalized residential
    mortgage loan servicing assets, including information about the
    calculation of estimated fair value, is presented herein under
    the heading “Other Expense” and in note 7 of
    Notes to Financial Statements. Commitments to sell residential
    mortgage loans and commitments to originate residential mortgage
    loans for sale at pre-determined rates were $1.8 billion
    and $680 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006,
    $923 million and $352 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2005 and $764 million and
    $422 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004. Net
    unrealized gains on hedged residential mortgage loans held for
    sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate
    loans for sale were $4 million and $3 million at
    December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively, compared with net
    unrealized losses of $5 million at December 31, 2005.
    Changes in such net unrealized gains and losses are recorded in
    mortgage banking revenues and resulted in a net increase in
    revenue of $2 million in 2006, and net decreases in revenue
    of $8 million in 2005 and $4 million in 2004.

Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $29 million in
    each of 2006 and 2005, compared with $25 million in 2004.
    Revenues from loan origination and sales activities were
    $15 million in 2006, compared with $14 million during
    2005 and $13 million in 2004. Loan servicing revenues
    totaled $14 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and
    $12 million in 2004. Capitalized commercial mortgage loan
    servicing assets totaled $21 million at each of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and $22 million at
    December 31, 2004. Commercial mortgage loans serviced for
    other investors totaled $4.9 billion, $4.3 billion and
    $4.1 billion at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively, and included $939 million, $941 million
    and $926 million, respectively, of loan balances for which
    investors had recourse to the Company if such balances are
    ultimately uncollectible. Commitments to sell commercial
    mortgage loans and commitments to originate commercial mortgage
    loans for sale were $115 million and $66 million,
    respectively, at December 31, 2006, $241 million and
    $42 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005 and
    $167 million and $106 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2004. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale
    totaled $49 million, $199 million and $61 million
    at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Service charges on deposit accounts increased 3% to
    $381 million in 2006 from $370 million in 2005.
    Deposit account service charges in 2004 were $366 million.
    The higher levels of such revenues in 2006 and 2005 as compared
    with the immediately preceding years resulted from increased
    consumer service charges, largely resulting from higher debit
    card transaction volumes and overdraft fees, partially offset by
    lower commercial service charges.

Trust income includes fees for trust and custody services
    provided to personal, corporate and institutional customers, and
    investment management and advisory fees that are often based on
    a percentage of the market value of assets under management.
    Trust income rose 5% to $141 million in 2006 from
    $135 million in 2005, due in part to higher personal trust
    revenues. Trust income totaled $136 million in 2004. The
    impact of lower balances in proprietary mutual funds caused the
    decline in revenues from 2004 to 2005. Total trust assets, which
    include assets under management and assets under administration,
    aggregated $142.4 billion at December 31, 2006,
    compared with $134.0 billion at December 31, 2005.
    Trust assets under management were $14.8 billion and
    $13.2 billion at December 31,



2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company’s proprietary
    mutual funds, the MTB Group of Funds, had assets of
    $8.9 billion and $8.4 billion at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Brokerage services income, which
    includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities
    and securities brokerage fees, aggregated $60 million in
    2006, up 8% from $56 million in 2005, primarily the result
    of increased revenues from the sale of annuities. Brokerage
    services income was $54 million in 2004. The increase from
    2004 to 2005 was due largely to increased revenues earned from
    the sale of mutual funds.

Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains
    of $25 million in 2006, $23 million in 2005 and
    $19 million in 2004. The higher gains in 2006 as compared
    with 2005 resulted largely from net increases in the market
    values of trading assets held in connection with deferred
    compensation plans. The increased gains in 2005 as compared with
    2004 were due in part to higher volumes of trading assets and
    liabilities and reflected fees and market value changes related
    to interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts
    executed. The Company enters into interest rate and foreign
    exchange contracts with customers who need such services and
    concomitantly enters into offsetting trading positions with
    third parties to minimize the risks involved with these types of
    transactions. Information about the notional amount of interest
    rate, foreign exchange and other contracts entered into by the
    Company for trading account purposes is included in note 17
    of Notes to Financial Statements and herein under the heading
    “Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate
    Sensitivity.” Trading account revenues related to interest
    rate and foreign exchange contracts totaled $15 million in
    each of 2006 and 2005, and were $11 million in 2004.
    Trading account assets held in connection with deferred
    compensation plans were $45 million and $41 million at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Trading account
    revenues resulting from net increases in the market values of
    such assets were $5 million in 2006, $3 million in
    2005 and $4 million in 2004. A largely offsetting expense
    resulting from corresponding increases in liabilities related to
    deferred compensation is included in other costs of operations.
    Gains on investment securities were $3 million in each of
    2006 and 2004, while as a result of the previously described
    charge for the

other-than-temporary

impairment in value of the FNMA and FHLMC preferred stock,
    losses on investment securities aggregated $28 million
    during 2005.

Other revenues from operations were $293 million in 2006,
    up from $259 million in 2005 and $240 million in 2004.
    Significant contributors to the 13% rise in such revenues from
    2005 to 2006 were the previously noted $13 million gain
    from the call of an FHLB borrowing and an increase of
    $9 million in insurance-related revenues, largely the
    result of the February 1, 2006 acquisition by
    M

&

T Bank of a
    commercial insurance and surety brokerage agency based in
    Maryland. Also contributing to the increase from 2005 to 2006
    were higher income from educational lending services of
    $8 million and income from bank owned life insurance of
    $6 million. An increase of $5 million in revenues from
    providing corporate financing advisory services and a
    $7 million increase in gains on sales of commercial lease
    equipment and other property contributed to the higher revenues
    in 2005 as compared with 2004.

Included in other revenues from operations were the following
    significant components. Letter of credit and other
    credit-related fees totaled $77 million, $75 million
    and $74 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
    Tax-exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance
    aggregated $53 million, $47 million and
    $48 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Such
    income includes increases in cash surrender value of life
    insurance policies and benefits received. Revenues from merchant
    discount and credit card fees were $32 million in 2006,
    $30 million in 2005 and $28 million in 2004.
    Insurance-related sales commissions and other revenues totaled
    $32 million in 2006, compared with $22 million in each
    of 2005 and 2004. The higher revenues in 2006 as compared with
    the preceding two years was primarily the result of the already
    noted insurance agency acquisition in February 2006. Automated
    teller machine (“ATM”) usage fees aggregated
    $15 million in 2006, compared with $22 million in 2005
    and in 2004. The decrease in such fees in 2006 was largely the
    result of the reduction or elimination of fees charged for use
    of ATMs at certain non-branch locations.

Other
    Expense

Other expense totaled $1.55 billion in 2006, compared with
    $1.49 billion in 2005 and $1.52 billion in 2004.
    Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be
    “nonoperating” in nature consisting of amortization of
    core deposit and other intangible assets of $63 million,
    $57 million and $75 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively, and merger-related integration expenses of
    $5 million in 2006. There



were no merger-related expenses in either 2005 or 2004.
    Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating
    expenses were $1.48 billion in 2006, up 4% from
    $1.43 billion in 2005. Included in 2006’s operating
    expenses was the $18 million charitable contribution
    already discussed. Excluding the impact of the charitable
    contribution, operating expenses in 2006 increased
    $37 million, or less than 3% from 2005, due primarily to
    higher salaries costs, including merit pay increases and
    incentive compensation. Noninterest operating expenses were
    $1.44 billion in 2004. As previously noted, such expenses
    reflect a $25 million charitable contribution. Excluding
    that contribution, operating expenses in 2005 increased
    $13 million, or less than 1%, from 2004. That increase from
    2004 resulted from higher costs of providing health care and
    retirement benefits to employees and increased professional
    services expenses, partially offset by a higher reversal of a
    portion of the valuation allowance for the impairment of
    capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, due to higher
    residential mortgage loan interest rates. Table 2 provides a
    reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense.

Salaries and employee benefits expense totaled $873 million
    in 2006, up 6% from $822 million in 2005. The most
    significant contributor to the increase was a higher level of
    salaries expense in 2006, reflecting the impact of merit pay
    increases and higher stock-based compensation costs and other
    incentive pay. Salaries and employee benefits expense was
    $807 million in 2004. Expenses related to providing
    employee health care and retirement benefits were the most
    significant contributors to the rise in salaries and benefits
    from 2004 to 2005. The Company recognizes expense for
    stock-based compensation using the fair value method of
    accounting for all stock-based compensation granted to employees
    after January 1, 1995. As a result, salaries and employee
    benefits expense in 2006, 2005 and 2004 included
    $51 million, $45 million and $48 million,
    respectively, of stock-based compensation. The higher level of
    stock-based compensation in 2006 was largely due to the adoption
    of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
    Payment,” (“SFAS No. 123R”), effective
    January 1, 2006. As required, coincident with the adoption
    of SFAS No. 123R, the Company began accelerating the
    recognition of compensation costs for stock-based awards granted
    to retirement-eligible employees and employees who will become
    retirement-eligible prior to full vesting of the award. As a
    result, stock-based compensation expense during 2006 included
    $4 million that would otherwise have been recognized over
    the normal four year vesting period if not for the required
    adoption of SFAS No. 123R. That acceleration had no
    effect on the value of stock-based compensation awarded to
    employees. The number of full-time equivalent employees was
    12,721 at December 31, 2006, compared with 12,780 and
    12,678 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Pension benefit expense is a significant cost to the Company and
    totaled $28 million in 2006, $38 million in 2005 and
    $30 million in 2004. The Company sponsors both defined
    benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The expense for
    2006 includes $7 million related to a new qualified defined
    contribution plan introduced on January 1, 2006. The
    determination of pension expense and the recognition of net
    pension assets and liabilities for defined benefit pension plans
    requires management to make various assumptions that can
    significantly impact the actuarial calculations related thereto.
    Those assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return
    on plan assets, the rate of increase in future compensation
    levels and the discount rate. Changes in any of those
    assumptions will impact the Company’s pension expense. The
    expected long-term rate of return assumption is determined by
    taking into consideration asset allocations, historical returns
    on the types of assets held and current economic factors.
    Returns on invested assets are periodically compared with target
    market indices for each asset type to aid management in
    evaluating such returns. The discount rate used by the Company
    to determine the present value of the Company’s future
    benefit obligations reflects specific market yields for a
    hypothetical portfolio of highly rated corporate bonds that
    would produce cash flows similar to the Company’s benefit
    plan obligations and the level of market interest rates in
    general. Other factors used to estimate the projected benefit
    obligations include actuarial assumptions for mortality rate,
    turnover rate, retirement rate and disability rate. Those other
    factors do not tend to change significantly over time. The
    Company reviews its pension plan assumptions annually to ensure
    that such assumptions are reasonable and adjusts those
    assumptions, as necessary, to reflect changes in future
    expectations. The Company utilizes actuaries and others to aid
    in that assessment.

The Company’s 2006 pension expense for its defined benefit
    plans was determined using the following assumptions: a
    long-term rate of return on assets of 8.50%; a rate of future
    compensation increase of 4.90%; and a discount rate of 5.50%. To
    demonstrate the sensitivity of pension expense to



changes in the Company’s
    pension plan assumptions, 25 basis point increases in: the
    rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in a decrease
    in pension expense of $1 million; the rate of increase in
    compensation would have resulted in an increase in pension
    expense of $.5 million; and the discount rate would have
    resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $3 million.
    Decreases of 25 basis points in those assumptions would have
    resulted in similar changes in amount, but in the opposite
    direction from the changes presented in the preceding sentence.
    The accounting guidance for defined benefit pension plans
    reflects the long-term nature of benefit obligations and the
    investment horizon of plan assets, and has the effect of
    reducing earnings volatility related to short-term changes in
    interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains and losses
    include the impact of plan amendments and various unrecognized
    gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions and
    investment returns which are different from that which is
    assumed. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had
    cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of approximately
    $101 million that could result in an increase in the
    Company’s future pension expense depending on several
    factors, including whether such losses at each measurement date
    exceed ten percent of the greater of the projected benefit
    obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. In
    accordance with GAAP, net unrecognized gains or losses that
    exceed that threshold are required to be amortized over the
    expected service period of active employees, and are included as
    a component of net pension cost. Amortization of these net
    unrealized losses had the effect of increasing the
    Company’s pension expense by approximately $8 million
    in 2006, $5 million in 2005 and $2 million in 2004.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans,” which requires an employer to
    recognize in its balance sheet as an asset or liability the
    overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit
    postretirement plan, measured as the difference between the fair
    value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. For a pension
    plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit
    obligation; for any other postretirement benefit plan, such as a
    retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the
    accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.
    SFAS No. 158 requires that gains or losses and prior
    service costs or credits that arise during the period, but are
    not included as components of net periodic benefit cost pursuant
    to SFAS No. 87 or SFAS No. 106, be
    recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. An
    employer with publicly-traded equity securities is required to
    initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit
    postretirement plan as of the end of the fiscal year ending
    after December 15, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the
    combined benefit obligations (as defined under
    SFAS No. 158) of the Company’s defined
    benefit postretirement plans exceeded the fair value of the
    assets of such plans by approximately $205 million. Of that
    amount, $96 million was related to qualified defined
    benefit plans that are periodically funded by the Company and
    $109 million related to non-qualified pension and other
    postretirement plans that are generally not funded until
    benefits are paid. As a result of the adoption of
    SFAS No. 158, the Company was required to have a net
    pension and postretirement benefit liability for those plans
    that was at least equal to $205 million at
    December 31, 2006. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2006 the
    Company recorded an additional postretirement benefit liability
    of $46 million. After applicable tax effect, that liability
    reduced accumulated other comprehensive income (and thereby
    stockholders’ equity) by $28 million. Because the
    recognition requirements of SFAS No. 158 were required
    to be applied at the end of the year of adoption, the Company
    had to first recognize the additional minimum liability amounts
    required under the provisions of SFAS No. 87. As a
    result, as of December 31, 2006 the Company decreased its
    previously recorded minimum pension liability by
    $51 million with a corresponding increase to other
    comprehensive income that, net of applicable deferred taxes, was
    approximately $31 million. A combination of better than
    expected investment returns on plan assets during 2006 and a 25
    basis point increase in the discount rate assumption to 5.75% at
    December 31, 2006 from 5.50% at December 31, 2005 were
    the significant factors contributing to the increase to other
    comprehensive income recorded in 2006 under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 87. In order to recognize the funded status
    of the Company’s other combined defined benefit
    postretirement plans under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 158, the Company then recorded an incremental
    minimum liability of approximately $16 million with a
    corresponding reduction of stockholders’ equity that, net
    of applicable deferred taxes, was approximately
    $10 million. As a result, including the effects of adopting
    SFAS No. 158, the Company decreased its minimum
    liability from that which was recorded at December 31, 2005
    by approximately $35 million with a corresponding increase
    to



stockholders’ equity that, net of applicable deferred
    taxes, was approximately $21 million. Under the provisions
    of SFAS No. 158, a 25 basis point decrease in the
    assumed discount rate as of December 31, 2006 to 5.50%
    would have resulted in increases in the combined benefit
    obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans
    (including pension and other plans) of $25 million. Under
    that scenario, the minimum postretirement liability adjustment
    at December 31, 2006 would have been $71 million,
    rather than the $46 million that was actually recorded, and
    the corresponding after tax-effect charge to accumulated other
    comprehensive income at December 31, 2006 would have been
    $44 million, rather than the $28 million that was
    actually recorded. A 25 basis point increase in the assumed
    discount rate to 6.00% would have decreased the combined benefit
    obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans by
    $24 million. Under this latter scenario, the aggregate
    liability adjustment at December 31, 2006 would have been
    $22 million rather than the $46 million actually
    recorded and the corresponding after tax-effect charge to
    accumulated other comprehensive income would have been
    $14 million rather than $28 million. The Company made
    contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in
    2006 totaling approximately $36 million. Information about
    the Company’s pension plans, including significant
    assumptions utilized in completing actuarial calculations for
    the plans, is included in note 11 of Notes to
    Financial Statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company amended certain
    provisions of its defined benefit pension plans. Such amendments
    had the effect of reducing future benefits earned under the
    plans. The formula was changed to reduce the future accrual of
    benefits by lowering the accrual percentage and through use of a
    career-average-pay formula as opposed to the previous
    final-average-pay formula. The amendments affected benefits
    earned for service periods beginning after December 31,
    2005. Active participants at that time had the choice of
    electing to remain in the defined benefit plan under the reduced
    benefit formula or electing to participate in a new qualified
    defined contribution pension plan. Under the new defined
    contribution pension plan, the Company makes contributions to
    the plan each year in an amount that is based on an individual
    participant’s total compensation (generally defined as
    total wages, incentive compensation, commissions and bonuses)
    and years of service. Participants do not contribute to the
    defined contribution pension plan. New employees are not
    eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan, but do
    participate in the defined contribution pension plan. The
    amendment caused the projected benefit obligation associated
    with the defined benefit plans to decrease by approximately
    $98 million as of December 31, 2005. Certain gains
    associated with the $98 million in pension benefit
    obligation reduction attributable to employees who remained in
    the plan are not subject to the ten percent corridor previously
    noted. Guidance contained in SFAS No. 87 requires that
    these gains be amortized and recognized as a component of net
    periodic benefit cost over the remaining expected service period
    for active employees. Amortization of these gains had the effect
    of reducing the Company’s pension expense for 2006 by
    approximately $7 million.

In addition to the changes described above, the Company also
    amended its retirement savings plan (“RSP”), effective
    January 1, 2006, to allow for greater amounts of employee
    compensation to be eligible for contribution to the RSP. The RSP
    is a defined contribution plan in which eligible employees of
    the Company may defer up to 50% of qualified compensation via
    contributions to the plan. The Company makes an employer
    matching contribution in an amount equal to 75% of an
    employee’s contribution, up to 4.5% of the employee’s
    qualified compensation. RSP expense totaled $21 million in
    2006, $17 million in 2005 and $16 million in 2004.

As a result of the amendments to the defined benefit pension
    plans and the RSP and the introduction of the defined
    contribution pension plan, the Company hoped to limit increases
    in future period expenses associated with these plans.
    Reflecting the impact of these changes, expenses associated with
    the defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans and
    the RSP totaled $49 million in 2006, compared with
    $55 million in 2005 and $46 million in 2004.

Excluding the nonoperating expense items already noted,
    nonpersonnel operating expenses aggregated $611 million in
    2006, up 1% from $606 million in 2005. That increase
    reflects the $18 million charitable contribution made in
    2006. Exclusive of the contribution, nonpersonnel operating
    expenses decreased $13 million or 2% from 2005, due largely
    to lower costs for professional services, furniture and
    equipment. Nonpersonnel operating expenses were
    $634 million in 2004 and included a $25 million
    charitable contribution. Excluding the impact of that
    contribution, other nonpersonnel operating



expenses in 2005 decreased $3 million from 2004. As
    compared with 2004, a $7 million higher reversal in 2005 of
    a portion of the valuation allowance for the impairment of
    capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, and lower
    equipment, net occupancy and other operating expenses were
    partially offset by higher professional services costs. The
    higher expenses incurred for professional services in 2005 were
    due in part to several initiatives of the Company, including
    projects focused on procurement practices, consolidation of loan
    application systems, revenue enhancement opportunities and
    operational efficiencies, as well as costs related to the
    already discussed subordinated note exchange.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $392 million in 2006,
    compared with $389 million in 2005 and $344 million in
    2004. The effective tax rates were 31.9%, 33.2% and 32.3% in
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decline in the
    Company’s effective tax rate from 2005 to 2006 reflects
    higher levels of income that were exempt from tax in certain
    jurisdictions and a $3 million favorable impact from
    settlement of refund claims originally filed by Allfirst
    Financial Inc. prior to its April 1, 2003 acquisition by
    M

&

T. The refunds
    received, consisting of income taxes and taxable interest,
    exceeded the amounts previously accrued for such items by
    $5 million (pre-tax). The increase in the effective tax
    rate from 2004 to 2005 was largely due to the impact of the
    third quarter 2004 reorganization of two of the Company’s
    subsidiaries that altered the taxable status of such
    subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions thereby decreasing the
    Company’s effective state income tax rate for 2004. As a
    result of the reorganizations, both income tax expense and
    deferred tax liabilities at September 30, 2004 were reduced
    by $12 million.

The effective tax rate in future periods will be affected by the
    results of operations attributable to the various tax
    jurisdictions within which the Company operates, any changes in
    income tax regulations or interpretations of such regulations
    that differ from the Company’s interpretations by tax
    authorities within those jurisdictions, and the impact of
    changes in the accounting for income taxes resulting from the
    required adoption on January 1, 2007 of FASB Interpretation
    (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes.” The projected impact of that adoption is
    included herein under the heading “Recent Accounting
    Developments.” A reconciliation of income tax expense to
    the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax
    rate to pre-tax income is provided in note 12 of Notes to
    Financial Statements.

International
    Activities

The Company’s net investment in international assets
    totaled $185 million at December 31, 2006 and
    $230 million at December 31, 2005. Such assets
    included $176 million and $217 million, respectively,
    of loans to foreign borrowers. Offshore deposits totaled
    $5.4 billion at December 31, 2006 and
    $2.8 billion at December 31, 2005. The Company uses
    such deposits to facilitate customer demand and as an
    alternative to short-term borrowings when the costs of such
    deposits seem reasonable.

Liquidity,
    Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity

As a financial intermediary, the Company is exposed to various
    risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to
    the Company’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow
    and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future
    financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit
    withdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporate
    purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of
    financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.

Core deposits have historically been the most significant
    funding source for the Company, and are generated from a large
    base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. That
    customer base has, over the past several years, become more
    geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion
    of the Company’s businesses. Nevertheless, in recent years
    the Company has faced increased competition in offering products
    and services from a large array of financial market
    participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities
    dealers and others. Core deposits financed 57% of the
    Company’s earning assets at each of December 31, 2006
    and December 31, 2005, compared with 59% at
    December 31, 2004.

The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits
    with various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings,
    including federal funds purchased and securities sold under
    agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit,
    offshore branch deposits and borrowings from the FHLBs



and others. At December 31, 2006,
    M

&

T Bank had short-term
    and long-term credit facilities with the FHLBs aggregating
    $6.8 billion. Outstanding borrowings under these credit
    facilities totaled $3.4 billion and $3.9 billion at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Such borrowings
    are secured by loans and investment securities.
    M

&

T Bank and
    M

&

T Bank, N.A. had
    available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of
    New York of approximately $4.3 billion at December 31,
    2006. The amounts of these lines are dependent upon the balances
    of loans and securities pledged as collateral. There were no
    borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit at either
    December 31, 2006 or 2005.

The Company has issued subordinated capital notes from time to
    time to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios.
    Such notes qualify for inclusion in the Company’s total
    capital as defined by federal regulators.
    M

&

T Bank issued
    $500 million of subordinated notes in December 2006. The
    notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.629% for ten years and
    a floating rate thereafter, at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR
    plus .64%. The notes are redeemable at the Company’s option
    after the fixed-rate period ends, subject to prior regulatory
    approval. In December 2005,
    M

&

T Bank exchanged
    $363 million of its 8.0% subordinated notes due 2010
    for new fixed rate/floating rate subordinated notes with a par
    value of $409 million due 2020. The notes bear interest at
    a fixed rate of 5.585% for ten years, while thereafter such
    notes will bear interest at a floating rate that resets monthly
    at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.215%. The notes are
    redeemable after the fixed-rate period ends at the
    Company’s option, subject to regulatory approval. No new
    funding was received as a result of the exchange. A more
    detailed description of the 2006 and 2005 subordinated note
    transactions is included herein under the heading “Net
    Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities” and in
    note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. As an additional
    source of funding, in November 2002, the Company entered into a
    $500 million revolving asset-backed structured borrowing
    which is collateralized by approximately $565 million of
    automobile loans and related assets. The automobile loans and
    related assets have been transferred to a special purpose
    consolidated subsidiary of
    M

&

T Bank. As existing
    automobile loans of the subsidiary pay down, monthly proceeds,
    after payment of certain fees and debt service costs, are used
    by the subsidiary to obtain additional automobile loans from
    M

&

T Bank or another of
    its subsidiaries to replenish the collateral and maintain the
    existing borrowing base. Additional information about this
    borrowing is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial
    Statements.

The Company has informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of
    funding available through various arrangements for unsecured
    short-term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other
    financial institutions. Short-term federal funds borrowings were
    $2.3 billion and $4.0 billion at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. In general, those borrowings were
    unsecured and matured on the next business day. As already
    noted, offshore branch deposits and brokered certificates of
    deposit have been used by the Company as an alternative to
    short-term borrowings. Offshore branch deposits also generally
    mature on the next business day and totaled $5.4 billion
    and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Brokered certificates of deposit have longer
    maturity terms. Information regarding such deposits is included
    under the heading “Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding
    Activities.”

The Company’s ability to obtain funding from these or other
    sources could be negatively impacted should the Company
    experience a substantial deterioration in its financial
    condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of
    short-term funding become restricted due to a disruption in the
    financial markets. The Company attempts to quantify such
    credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the
    liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade
    over various grading levels. Such impact is estimated by
    attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of
    credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and
    securitizable assets. Information about the credit ratings of
    M

&

T and
    M

&

T Bank is presented
    in table 13. Additional information regarding the terms and
    maturities of all of the Company’s short-term and long-term
    borrowings is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial
    Statements. In addition to deposits and borrowings, other
    sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities
    and other earning assets, repayments of loans and investment
    securities, and cash generated from operations, such as fees
    collected for services.

    VRDBs are generally enhanced by direct-pay letters of credit
    provided by
    M

T Bank oftentimes
    acts as remarketing agent for the VRDBs and, at its discretion,

    When this occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading assets in
    the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Nevertheless,
    M

T Bank is not
    contractually obligated to purchase the VRDBs. The value of
    VRDBs in the Company’s trading account totaled
    $6 million and $58 million at December 31, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. At both December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    the VRDBs outstanding backed by
    M

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into
    contractual obligations which require future cash payments. The
    contractual amounts and timing of those payments as of
    December 31, 2006 are summarized in table 15. Off-balance
    sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity, including
    commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit,
    commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and
    indemnification contracts, and commitments to sell real estate
    loans. Because many of these commitments or contracts expire
    without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts
    are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further
    discussion of these commitments is provided in note 20 of
    Notes to Financial Statements. Table 15 summarizes the
    Company’s other commitments as of December 31, 2006
    and the timing of the expiration of such commitments.

T’s primary
    source of funds to pay for operating expenses, shareholder
    dividends and common stock repurchases has historically been the
    receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries, which are
    subject to various regulatory limitations. Dividends from any
    banking subsidiary to
    M

&

T are limited by the
    amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current year
    and the two preceding years. For purposes of the test,
    approximately $108 million at December 31, 2006 was
    available for payment of dividends to
    M

&

T from banking
    subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval. These historic
    sources of cash flow have been augmented in the past by the
    issuance of trust preferred securities. Information regarding
    trust preferred securities and the related junior subordinated
    debentures is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial
    Statements. M

&

T also
    maintains a $30 million line of credit with an unaffiliated
    commercial bank, of which there were no borrowings outstanding
    at December 31, 2006. A similar $30 million line of
    credit was entirely available for borrowing at December 31,
    2005.

Management closely monitors the Company’s liquidity
    position for compliance with internal policies and believes that
    available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding
    needs in the normal course of business. Management does not
    anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or in
    the long-term, for which adequate funding would not be available
    and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity
    at either M

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the
    market prices

and/or

interest rates of the Company’s financial instruments.
    Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which the
    Company is exposed. Interest rate risk arises from the
    Company’s core banking activities of lending and
    deposit-taking, because assets and liabilities reprice at
    different times and by different amounts as interest rates
    change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Company
    is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The
    Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the
    variability of net interest income in future periods under
    various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for
    earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and derivatives
    used to hedge interest rate risk. Management’s philosophy
    toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability
    of net interest income. The balances of financial instruments
    used in the projections are based on expected growth from
    forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of
    loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of
    investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a
    “value of equity” model to supplement the modeling
    technique described above. Those supplemental analyses are based
    on discounted cash flows associated with on- and off-balance
    sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to
    reflect changes in interest rates and non-parallel shifts in the
    maturity curve of interest rates and provide management with a
    long-term interest rate risk metric. The Company has entered
    into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to
    interest rate risk. At December 31, 2006, the aggregate
    notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into
    for interest rate risk management purposes was
    $1.0 billion. Information about interest rate swap
    agreements entered into for interest rate risk management
    purposes is included herein under “Net Interest
    Income/Lending and Funding Activities” and in note 17
    of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company’s Risk Management Committee, which includes
    members of senior management, monitors the sensitivity of the
    Company’s net interest income to changes in interest rates
    with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest
    income under different interest rate scenarios. In modeling
    changing interest rates, the Company considers different yield
    curve shapes that consider both parallel (that is, simultaneous
    changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve) and
    non-parallel (that is, allowing interest rates at points on the
    yield curve to vary by different amounts) shifts in the yield
    curve. In utilizing the model, market implied forward interest
    rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to
    determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest
    income simulation. That calculated base net interest income is
    then compared to the income calculated under the varying
    interest rate scenarios. The model considers the impact of
    ongoing lending and deposit-gathering activities, as well as
    interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing
    of financial instruments, including the effect of changing
    interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When
    deemed prudent, management has taken actions to mitigate
    exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on-or
    off-balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in
    the future. Possible actions include, but are not limited to,
    changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying
    the composition of earning assets and interest-bearing
    liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating existing
    interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments
    used for interest rate risk management purposes.



Table 18 displays as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 the
    estimated impact on net interest income from non-trading
    financial instruments in the base scenario described above
    resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across
    repricing categories during the first modeling year.

The Company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact
    that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income.
    The more significant of those assumptions included the rate of
    prepayments of mortgage-related assets, cash flows from
    derivative and other financial instruments held for non-trading
    purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit
    maturities. In the scenarios presented, the Company also assumed
    gradual changes in rates during a twelve-month period of 100 and
    200 basis points, as compared with the assumed base
    scenario. In the event that a 100 or 200 basis point rate
    change cannot be achieved, the applicable rate changes are
    limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates cannot be
    less than zero. The assumptions used in interest rate
    sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and, as a result,
    the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in
    interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ
    significantly due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of
    interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and
    interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/repricing
    categories, as well as any actions, such as those previously
    described, which management may take to counter such changes. In
    light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the
    process, the amounts presented in the table and changes in such
    amounts are not considered significant to the Company’s
    past or projected net interest income.

In accordance with industry practice, table 19 presents
    cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a
    contractual basis within the specified time frames, as adjusted
    for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for
    interest rate risk management purposes. Management believes that
    this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk
    since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all
    categories of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities
    equally nor, as assumed in the table, on the contractual
    maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this static
    presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect
    of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected
    changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest
    rate risk management activities the Company is likely to
    implement.

The Company engages in trading activities to meet the financial
    needs of customers, to fund the Company’s obligations under
    certain deferred compensation plans and, to a limited extent, to
    profit from perceived market opportunities. Financial
    instruments utilized in trading activities have included forward
    and futures contracts related to foreign currencies and
    mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasury and other
    government securities, mortgage-backed securities, mutual funds
    and interest rate contracts, such as swap agreements. The
    Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest
    rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into
    offsetting trading positions. The amounts of gross and net
    trading positions, as well as the type of trading activities
    conducted by the Company, are subject to a well-defined series
    of potential loss exposure limits established by management and
    approved by M

&

T’s
    Board of Directors. However, as with any non-government
    guaranteed financial instrument, the Company is exposed to
    credit risk associated with counterparties to the Company’s
    trading activities.

The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for
    trading purposes aggregated $7.6 billion at
    December 31, 2006 and $6.7 billion at
    December 31, 2005. The notional amounts of foreign currency
    and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading
    purposes totaled $613 million and $679 million at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Although the
    notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in
    the consolidated balance sheet, the fair values of all financial
    instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the
    consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of trading account
    assets and liabilities were $137 million and
    $65 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006 and
    $192 million and $77 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2005. Included in trading account assets at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $45 million and
    $41 million, respectively, of assets related to deferred
    compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of such assets are
    recorded as trading account and foreign exchange gains in the
    consolidated statement of income. Included in other liabilities
    in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006 and
    2005 were $49 million and $48 million, respectively,
    of liabilities related to deferred compensation plans. Changes
    in the balances of



such liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment
    options to which the liabilities are indexed are recorded in
    “other costs of operations” in the consolidated
    statement of income.

Given the Company’s policies, limits and positions,
    management believes that the potential loss exposure to the
    Company resulting from market risk associated with trading
    activities was not material, however, as previously noted, the
    Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties
    to transactions associated with the Company’s trading
    activities. Additional information related to trading derivative
    contracts is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial
    Statements.

Capital

Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2006 totaled
    $6.3 billion and represented 11.01% of total assets,
    compared with $5.9 billion or 10.66% at December 31,
    2005 and $5.7 billion or 10.82% at December 31, 2004.
    On a per share basis, stockholders’ equity was $56.94 at
    December 31, 2006, up 9% from $52.39 at the
    2005 year-end and 15% higher than $49.68 at
    December 31, 2004. Tangible equity per share was $28.57 at
    December 31, 2006, compared with $25.91 and $23.62 at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In the
    calculation of tangible equity per common share,
    stockholders’ equity is reduced by the carrying values of
    goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of
    applicable deferred tax balances. A reconciliation of total
    stockholders’ equity and tangible equity as of
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is presented in table 2.
    The ratio of average total stockholders’ equity to average
    total assets was 10.82%, 10.71% and 11.07% in 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively.

Stockholders’ equity reflects accumulated other
    comprehensive income or loss, which includes the net after-tax
    impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities
    classified as available for sale; unrealized fair value gains or
    losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated
    as cash flow hedges; minimum pension liability adjustments; and
    the impact of applying SFAS No. 158. Net unrealized
    losses on

available-for-sale

investment securities were $25 million, or $.23 per
    common share, at December 31, 2006, compared with losses of
    $49 million, or $.43 per common share, at
    December 31, 2005 and $5 million, or $.04 per
    common share, at December 31, 2004. Such unrealized losses
    are generally due to changes in interest rates and represent the
    difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the
    estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities
    classified as available for sale. There were no outstanding
    interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges at
    December 31, 2006, 2005 or 2004. Adjustments to reflect the
    funded status of defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement plans, net of applicable tax effect, included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income reduced
    stockholders’ equity by $28 million at
    December 31, 2006, or $.26 per share. Similar
    adjustments to recognize minimum pension liabilities as then
    required by SFAS No. 87, net of applicable tax effect,
    reduced stockholders’ equity by $49 million or
    $.44 per share at December 31, 2005 and
    $12 million or $.11 per share at December 31,
    2004. Information about the funded status of the Company’s
    pension and other postretirement benefit plans is included in
    note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements.

    at a cost of $374 million, $510 million and
    $610 million, respectively. In December 2004,
    M

T had announced a
    plan to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common
    stock. That repurchase plan was completed in December 2005. In
    November 2005, M

T
    announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors
    to purchase up to an additional 5,000,000 shares of its
    common stock. Through December 31, 2006,
    M

T had repurchased a
    total of 3,303,700 shares of common stock pursuant to such
    plan at an average cost of $114.66 per share.

Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to
    maintain “core capital” and “total capital”
    ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk-adjusted
    total assets. In addition to the risk-based measures, Federal
    bank regulators have also implemented a minimum
    “leverage” ratio guideline of



3% of the quarterly average of total assets. As of
    December 31, 2006, core capital included $689 million
    of the trust preferred securities described in note 9 of
    Notes to Financial Statements and total capital further included
    $1.4 billion of subordinated capital notes. As previously
    noted, in December 2006,
    M

&

T Bank issued
    $500 million of fixed rate/floating rate subordinated notes
    due 2021. The new notes bear interest at a fixed coupon rate of
    5.629% for ten years, while thereafter such notes will bear
    interest at a floating rate that resets monthly at a rate equal
    to three-month LIBOR plus .64%. The notes are redeemable after
    the fixed-rate period ends at
    M

&

T’s option,
    subject to regulatory approval.

The capital ratios of the Company and its banking subsidiaries
    as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 are presented in
    note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company generates significant amounts of regulatory capital.
    The rate of regulatory core capital generation, or net operating
    income (as previously defined) less the sum of dividends paid
    and the after-tax effect of merger-related expenses expressed as
    a percentage of regulatory “core capital” at the
    beginning of each year, was 17.52% in 2006, 18.50% in 2005 and
    18.12% in 2004.

Fourth
    Quarter Results

Net income increased 4% to $213 million during the fourth
    quarter of 2006 from $205 million in the year-earlier
    quarter. Diluted and basic earnings per share were $1.88 and
    $1.93, respectively, in the final quarter of 2006, compared with
    $1.78 and $1.82, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2005.
    The annualized rates of return on average assets and average
    common stockholders’ equity for the fourth quarter of 2006
    were 1.50% and 13.55%, respectively, compared with 1.48% and
    13.85%, respectively, in the year-earlier period.

Net operating income rose 6% to $225 million in the fourth
    quarter of 2006 from $213 million in 2005’s final
    quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per share increased 7%
    to $1.98 in the recently completed quarter from $1.85 in the
    fourth quarter of 2005. The annualized net operating returns on
    average tangible assets and average tangible common equity were
    1.67% and 28.71%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2006,
    compared with 1.63% and 29.12%, respectively, in the
    corresponding 2005 quarter. Core deposit and other intangible
    asset amortization, after tax effect, totaled $11 million
    ($.10 per diluted share) and $8 million ($.07 per
    diluted share) in the fourth quarters of 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Reconciliations of GAAP results with non-GAAP
    results for the quarterly periods of 2006 and 2005 are provided
    in table 21.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose 4% to
    $472 million in the final quarter of 2006 from
    $454 million in the year-earlier quarter. That growth was
    the result of a 3% increase in average earning assets and a
    widening of the Company’s net interest margin. Average
    earning assets totaled $50.2 billion in the last quarter of
    2006, compared with $48.8 billion in the year-earlier
    period. Average loans and leases for the recently completed
    quarter totaled $42.5 billion, up 5% from
    $40.4 billion during the final quarter of 2005. A
    $1.1 billion increase in commercial real estate loans, an
    $863 million rise in residential real estate loans, and a
    $786 million increase in commercial loans were the leading
    contributors to the growth in average loans outstanding. The
    yield on earning assets was 6.92% in the fourth quarter of 2006,
    up 76 basis points from 6.16% in the fourth quarter of
    2005. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 3.83% in
    the last quarter of 2006, 85 basis points higher than 2.98% in
    the corresponding period in 2005. The resulting net interest
    spread was 3.09% in the recent quarter, down 9 basis points from
    3.18% in the fourth quarter of 2005. That decline reflects the
    impact of higher interest rates in 2006 that resulted in
    short-term interest rates associated with borrowings and many
    deposits rising more than longer-term interest rates associated
    with many loan products. However, the contribution of net
    interest free funds to the Company’s net interest margin
    rose to .64% in the final 2006 quarter from .51% in the
    year-earlier quarter. That rise reflects the impact of higher
    interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities used to value
    such contribution. As a result, the Company’s net interest
    margin improved to 3.73% in the recent quarter from 3.69% in the
    final quarter of 2005.

The provision for credit losses was $28 million during the
    three-month period ended December 31, 2006, compared with
    $23 million in the year-earlier period. Net charge-offs of
    loans were $24 million in 2006’s fourth quarter,
    representing an annualized .23% of average loans and leases
    outstanding, compared with $23 million or .22% during the
    final three months of 2005.



Other income totaled $256 million in the final quarter of
    2006, up 3% from $249 million in the year-earlier quarter,
    due in part to higher revenues from trust and brokerage services
    activities, service charges on deposit accounts and income from
    bank owned life insurance, partially offset by a decline in
    mortgage banking revenues.

Other expense in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased 4% to
    $384 million from $369 million in the fourth quarter
    of 2005. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be
    “nonoperating” in nature consisting of amortization of
    core deposit and other intangible assets of $19 million and
    $13 million in the final quarter of 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses,
    noninterest operating expenses were $365 million in the
    recently completed quarter, up 2% from $356 million in the
    last three months of 2005. Higher costs for salaries and a
    $1 million increase to the valuation allowance for the
    impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights
    in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with a reversal of a
    portion of such valuation allowance of $6 million in the
    year-earlier quarter, were the leading contributors to that rise
    in operating expense. The Company’s efficiency ratio during
    the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2005 was 50.2% and 50.7%,
    respectively. Table 21 includes a reconciliation of other
    expense to noninterest operating expense for each of the
    quarters of 2006 and 2005.

Segment
    Information

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131,
    “Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
    Information,” the Company’s reportable segments have
    been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting
    system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain
    strategic business units have been combined for segment
    information reporting purposes where the nature of the products
    and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of
    those products and services are similar. The reportable segments
    are Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary
    Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking.

The financial information of the Company’s segments was
    compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in
    note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management
    accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment
    financial information are highly subjective and, unlike
    financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance
    similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the
    financial information of the reported segments are not
    necessarily comparable with similar information reported by
    other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management
    structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result
    in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial
    information about the Company’s segments is presented in
    note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit
    products and banking services for middle-market and large
    commercial customers, largely within the markets served by the
    Company. Services provided by this segment include commercial
    lending and leasing, deposit products, and cash management
    services. Net income earned by the Commercial Banking segment
    rose 3% to $226 million in 2006 from $219 million in
    2005. That improvement was primarily the result of a
    $25 million rise in net interest income, partially offset
    by increased noninterest expenses, most significantly higher
    personnel costs of $7 million. The higher net interest
    income was predominantly due to a widening of the net interest
    margin and an 8% increase in average loan balances outstanding,
    offset, in part, by a 17% decrease in average demand deposit
    balances. In 2004, this segment’s net income aggregated
    $213 million. The favorable performance in 2005 as compared
    to 2004 was due largely to an increase in net interest income of
    $21 million, mainly the result of a 7% increase in loan
    balances outstanding, partially offset by a $9 million
    increase in noninterest expenses, due predominantly to higher
    personnel costs.

The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit
    services to its customers. Real estate securing loans in this
    segment is generally located in the New York City metropolitan
    area, upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of
    Columbia, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the northwestern
    portion of the United States. Commercial real estate loans may
    be secured by

apartment/multifamily

buildings; office, retail and industrial space; or other types
    of collateral. Activities of this segment also include the
    origination, sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans
    through the FNMA DUS program and other programs. This segment
    contributed net income of $135 million in 2006, down 6%
    from the $143 million earned in 2005. The decline was the
    result of an $8 million



decrease in net interest income, predominantly due to a
    narrowing of net interest margin on loans outstanding, higher
    noninterest expenses of $6 million and lower commercial
    mortgage credit-related fees and other revenues of
    $4 million. Net income in 2005 for the Commercial Real
    Estate segment was 13% above the $126 million earned in
    2004. That improvement was due to an increase in net interest
    income of $19 million that resulted from higher average
    loan balances and a wider margin associated with deposits, a
    $4 million rise in commercial mortgage banking revenues and
    a lower provision for credit losses of $5 million.

The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and
    trading securities, residential mortgage loans and other assets;
    short-term and long-term borrowed funds; brokered certificates
    of deposit and interest rate swap agreements related thereto;
    and offshore branch deposits. This segment also provides foreign
    exchange services to customers. Included in the assets of the
    Discretionary Portfolio segment are the preferred stock
    issuances of FNMA and FHLMC owned by the Company. The
    Discretionary Portfolio segment recorded net income of
    $96 million in 2006, 3% higher than $93 million in
    2005. Contributing to that increase were the $29 million

other-than-temporary

impairment charge related to preferred stock issuances of FNMA
    and FHLMC reflected in 2005’s results and the
    $13 million gain in 2006 resulting from the accelerated
    recognition of a purchase accounting premium related to the call
    of an FHLB borrowing assumed in a previous acquisition.
    Partially offsetting these favorable factors was a
    $39 million decrease in net interest income resulting from
    a 58 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on
    investment securities and a $470 million decline in the
    average balance of the segment’s portfolio of investment
    securities. Net income contributed by the Discretionary
    Portfolio segment was $112 million in 2004. The 17% decline
    in 2005 as compared with 2004 was predominantly the result of
    the previously mentioned other-than temporary impairment charge
    reflected in 2005’s results.

The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services
    residential mortgage loans for consumers and sells substantially
    all of those loans in the secondary market to investors or to
    bank subsidiaries of
    M

&

T. This segment also
    originates and services loans to developers of residential real
    estate properties. In addition to the geographic regions served
    by or contiguous with the Company’s branch network, the
    Company maintains mortgage loan origination offices in several
    states throughout the southern and western United States. The
    Company also periodically purchases the rights to service
    mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are
    included in this segment. The Residential Mortgage Banking
    segment’s net income rose 21% to $52 million in 2006
    from $43 million in 2005. The improved performance was
    predominantly due to an 11% increase in noninterest revenues
    resulting from higher income from servicing mortgage loans of
    $10 million and increased gains from the sales of loans to
    the Discretionary Portfolio segment of $9 million. Also
    contributing to the improvement was an $8 million increase
    in net interest income, mainly due to a 30% increase in balances
    of loans held for sale, net of a 52 basis point decline in
    net interest margin associated with such loan balances.
    Partially offsetting these favorable factors were higher
    salaries and benefits expenses of $8 million and other
    noninterest expenses of $4 million. Included in noninterest
    expenses were partial reversals of the capitalized mortgage
    servicing rights valuation allowance of $10 million and
    $8 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net income for
    the Residential Mortgage Banking segment totaled
    $29 million in 2004. The 50% increase in net income from
    2004 to 2005 was due predominantly to higher noninterest
    revenues of $20 million, resulting from loan origination,
    sales and servicing activities, and higher net interest income
    of $10 million, attributable primarily to an increase in
    average loan balances outstanding. Also contributing to the
    segment’s improved performance from 2004 to 2005 was the
    effect of an $8 million partial reversal of the capitalized
    mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance recognized during
    2005, compared with a $2 million partial reversal of such
    allowance recognized during 2004. Partially offsetting revenue
    growth was a $14 million increase in salaries and benefits
    expenses. Gains from the sales of loans to the Company’s
    Discretionary Portfolio segment were $19 million,
    $10 million and $9 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively.

The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of services to
    consumers and small businesses through several delivery channels
    which include banking offices, automated teller machines,
    telephone banking and Internet banking. The Company has banking
    offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the
    District of Columbia, West Virginia and Delaware. Effective
    January 2, 2007,
    M

&

T Bank



opened its first banking office in New Jersey. The Retail
    Banking segment also offers certain deposit and loan products on
    a nationwide basis through
    M

&

T Bank, N.A. Credit
    services offered by this segment include consumer installment
    loans, student loans, automobile loans (originated both directly
    and indirectly through dealers), home equity loans and lines of
    credit, and loans and leases to small businesses. The segment
    also offers to its customers deposit products, including demand,
    savings and time accounts; investment products, including mutual
    funds and annuities; and other services. Net income for the
    Retail Banking segment aggregated $410 million in 2006, up
    26% from $325 million in 2005. The favorable performance
    was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of
    $119 million, largely resulting from a widening net
    interest margin on deposit products. Also contributing to the
    improvement were higher service charges on deposit accounts of
    $16 million. The Retail Banking segment recorded net income
    of $251 million in 2004. The 30% increase from 2004 to 2005
    was due predominantly to increases in net interest income of
    $81 million, largely attributable to an increase in net
    interest margin on deposit products. Higher service charges on
    deposit accounts and other fee income of $21 million, lower
    noninterest expenses of $13 million, and a $10 million
    decline in the provision for credit losses also contributed to
    the rise in net income from 2004 to 2005.

The “All Other” category reflects other activities of
    the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported
    segments as determined in accordance with
    SFAS No. 131, such as the
    M

&

T Investment Group,
    which includes the Company’s trust, brokerage and insurance
    businesses. Also reflected in this category are the amortization
    of core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from
    acquisitions of financial institutions, the net impact of the
    Company’s allocation methodologies for internal funds
    transfer pricing and the provision for credit losses, and, in
    2006, acquisition and integration-related expenses resulting
    from the branch acquisition completed by
    M

&

T Bank on
    June 30, 2006. The various components of the “All
    Other” category resulted in net losses of $80 million,
    $41 million and $9 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. The Company’s allocation methodologies for
    internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated
    with earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the
    Company’s reportable segments was the main factor for the
    increased net loss in 2006. Also contributing to the net loss
    were the previously mentioned $18 million charitable
    contribution made to The
    M

&

T Charitable
    Foundation and higher charges for amortization of core deposit
    and other intangible assets and merger-related expenses incurred
    as a result of the branch acquisition of $17 million and
    $5 million, respectively. The higher net loss incurred
    during 2005 as compared with 2004 resulted largely from the
    Company’s allocation methodologies for internal transfers
    for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets
    and interest-bearing liabilities of the Company’s
    reportable segments and the provision for credit losses.
    Noninterest expenses in 2004 were $44 million higher than
    in 2005, reflecting 2004’s $25 million contribution to
    The M

&

T Charitable
    Foundation and a $19 million higher charge for amortization
    of core deposit and other intangible assets. The 2004 net
    loss also reflected the $12 million reduction in income tax
    expense resulting from the reorganization of certain of
    M

&

T’s subsidiaries.

Recent
    Accounting Developments

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,
    “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
    Instruments — an amendment to FASB Statements
    No. 133 and 140.” SFAS No. 155 permits fair
    value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that
    contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require
    bifurcation. As a result, such instruments would be accounted
    for in one of two ways. Under the first allowable method, an
    entity would bifurcate the embedded derivative feature and
    record the bifurcated derivative at fair value. Subsequent
    changes in fair value of the bifurcated derivative would be
    reported in earnings. As an alternative, an entity could elect
    not to bifurcate the embedded derivative but instead record the
    entire financial instrument at fair value with subsequent
    changes in fair value of the security being reported in
    earnings. SFAS No. 155 also clarifies which
    interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject
    to the requirements of SFAS No. 133 and establishes a
    requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial
    assets to identify interests that contain an embedded derivative
    requiring bifurcation. SFAS No. 155 is effective for
    all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning
    of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after
    September 15, 2006. Earlier adoption is permitted as of the
    beginning of an entity’s fiscal year, provided the entity
    has not yet issued financial statements, including financial
    statements for any interim period for that fiscal year. The
    Company



adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 155 as of
    January 1, 2007 and does not anticipate that the impact of
    such adoption will be material to its financial position or
    results of operations.

In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156,
    “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets —
    an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140.”
    SFAS No. 156 defines the situations in which an entity
    should recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability when
    it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by
    entering into a servicing contract. SFAS No. 156
    requires all separately recognized servicing assets and
    servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value and
    permits an entity to choose its subsequent measurement method
    for each class of separately recognized servicing assets and
    servicing liabilities as either the amortization method or fair
    value measurement method. The amortization method requires that
    servicing assets and servicing liabilities be amortized in
    proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing
    income or net servicing loss and assessed for impairment or
    increased obligation based on fair value at each reporting date.
    The fair value measurement method requires servicing assets and
    servicing liabilities to be measured at fair value at each
    reporting date and requires entities to report changes in fair
    value of servicing assets and liabilities in earnings in the
    period in which the changes occur. SFAS No. 156
    requires prospective adoption as of the beginning of an
    entity’s first fiscal year that begins after
    September 15, 2006. Earlier adoption is permitted as of the
    beginning of an entity’s fiscal year, provided the entity
    has not yet issued financial statements, including interim
    financial statements, for any period of that fiscal year. An
    entity may elect to subsequently measure a class of separately
    recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair
    value as of the beginning of any fiscal year, beginning with the
    fiscal year in which the entity adopts this statement. Upon such
    election, which is irrevocable, the effect of remeasuring an
    existing class of separately recognized servicing assets and
    servicing liabilities at fair value should be reported as a
    cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the
    beginning of the fiscal year. Currently, the Company initially
    measures servicing assets retained in sales and securitization
    transactions for which it is the transferor under the relative
    fair value method prescribed in SFAS No. 140,
    “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities,” and subsequently
    measures its servicing assets under the amortization method. The
    Company has not early-adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 156 and currently does not intend to adopt
    the fair value measurement method for any classes of separately
    recognized servicing assets in 2007. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 156 on January 1, 2007, therefore, is
    not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s
    financial position or results of operations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to fair value
    measurements required or permitted under other accounting
    pronouncements, but does not require any new fair value
    measurements. The definition of fair value is clarified by
    SFAS No. 157 to be the price that would be received to
    sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
    SFAS No. 157 expands disclosures about the use of fair
    value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual
    periods subsequent to initial recognition. The disclosures focus
    on the inputs used to measure fair value and the effect of the
    measurements on earnings for the period. SFAS No. 157
    is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. The provisions generally should be
    applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in
    which SFAS No. 157 is applied, with certain provisions
    required to be applied retrospectively. Many of the
    Company’s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet
    positions are required to either be accounted for or disclosed
    using fair value as their relevant measurement attribute. Given
    the pervasiveness of fair value measurements throughout the
    Company’s financial statements, the Company has not yet
    determined the impact that the adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 will have on its financial statements.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, “Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.” FIN No. 48
    prescribes the accounting method to be applied to measure
    uncertainty in income taxes recognized under
    SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”
    FIN No. 48 establishes a recognition threshold and
    measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
    and measurement of an uncertain tax position taken or expected
    to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of an uncertain tax
    position in accordance with FIN No. 48 is a two-step
    process. The first step is recognition, which requires



a determination whether it is more likely than not that a tax
    position will be sustained upon examination, including
    resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based
    on the technical merits of the position. The second step is
    measurement. Under the measurement step, a tax position that
    meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured
    at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty
    percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax
    positions that previously failed to meet the
    more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized
    in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that
    threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no
    longer meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold
    should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial
    reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. FIN
    No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006. The cumulative effect of applying the
    provisions of FIN No. 48 shall be reported as an adjustment
    to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other
    appropriate components of equity or net assets) for that fiscal
    year. The adoption of FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007
    will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    position, but will likely increase the Company’s effective
    income tax rate by approximately .75% to 1.0% from what it
    otherwise would have been.

In July 2006, the FASB adopted FASB Staff Position

No. 13-2,

“Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing
    of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged
    Lease Transaction” (“FSP

13-2”).

FSP

13-2

requires that a change or projected change in the timing of cash
    flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease
    shall be accounted for in accordance with the guidance in
    paragraph 46 of SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for
    Leases.” That is, the projected timing of income tax cash
    flows generated by a leveraged lease transaction shall be
    reviewed annually or more frequently if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that a change in timing has occurred or
    is projected to occur. If, during the lease term, the projected
    timing of income tax cash flows generated by a leveraged lease
    is revised, the rate of return and the allocation of income to
    positive investment years shall be recalculated from inception
    of the lease following the method described in paragraph 44
    of SFAS No. 13. The guidance in FSP

13-2

shall
    be applied to fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2006. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FSP

13-2

shall
    be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained
    earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The
    Company does not expect that the adoption of FSP

13-2

on
    January 1, 2007 will have a material effect on its
    financial position or results of operations.

At its September 2006 meeting, the Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”) reached a final consensus on Issue

06-04,

“Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement
    Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance
    Arrangements.” The consensus stipulates that an agreement
    by an employer to share a portion of the proceeds of a life
    insurance policy with an employee during the postretirement
    period is a postretirement benefit arrangement required to be
    accounted for under SFAS No. 106 or Accounting
    Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 12,
    “Omnibus Opinion — 1967.” The consensus
    concludes that the purchase of a split-dollar life insurance
    policy does not constitute a settlement under
    SFAS No. 106 and, therefore, a liability for the
    postretirement obligation must be recognized under
    SFAS No. 106 if the benefit is offered under an
    arrangement that constitutes a plan or under APB No. 12 if
    it is not part of a plan. Issue

06-04

is
    effective for annual or interim reporting periods beginning
    after December 15, 2007. The provisions of Issue

06-04

should
    be applied through either a cumulative-effect adjustment to
    retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption or
    retrospective application. The Company has endorsement
    split-dollar life insurance policies that it inherited through
    certain acquisitions that are associated with employees who are
    no longer active. The Company does not anticipate that the
    adoption of the provisions of Issue

06-04

will
    have a material effect on the Company’s financial position
    or results of operations.

Also at its September 2006 meeting, the EITF reached a final
    consensus on Issue

06-05,

“Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance —
    Determining the Amount That Could be Realized in Accordance with
    FASB Technical

Bulletin No. 85-4.”

The consensus concludes that in determining the amount that
    could be realized under an insurance contract accounted for
    under FASB Technical

Bulletin No. 85-4,

“Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance,” the
    policyholder should (1) consider any additional amounts
    included in the contractual terms of the policy; (2) assume
    the surrender value on a individual-life by individual-life
    policy basis; and (3) not discount the cash surrender value
    component



of the amount that could be realized when contractual
    restrictions on the ability to surrender a policy exist. Issue

06-05

is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2006. The consensus in Issue

06-05

should
    be adopted through either (1) a change in accounting
    principle through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained
    earning as of the beginning of the year of adoption or
    (2) a change in accounting principle through retrospective
    application to all prior periods. At December 31, 2006, the
    Company had bank owned life insurance policies with a carrying
    value of $1.1 billion. The Company does not anticipate that
    the adoption of the provisions of Issue

06-05

on
    January 1, 2007 will have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Forward-Looking
    Statements

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations and other sections of the
    Company’s Annual Report contain forward-looking statements
    that are based on current expectations, estimates and
    projections about the Company’s business, management’s
    beliefs and assumptions made by management. These statements are
    not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks,
    uncertainties and assumptions (“Future Factors”) which
    are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results
    may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in
    such forward-looking statements.

Future Factors include changes in interest rates, spreads on
    earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and interest
    rate sensitivity; prepayment speeds, loan originations and
    credit losses; sources of liquidity; common shares outstanding;
    common stock price volatility; fair value of and number of
    stock-based compensation awards to be issued in future periods;
    legislation affecting the financial services industry as a
    whole,

and/or

M

&

T and its
    subsidiaries individually or collectively; regulatory
    supervision and oversight, including required capital levels;
    increasing price and product/service competition by competitors,
    including new entrants; rapid technological developments and
    changes; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new
    products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis; the mix
    of products/services; containing costs and expenses;
    governmental and public policy changes; protection and validity
    of intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers;
    technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large,
    multi-year contracts; the outcome of pending and future
    litigation and governmental proceedings; continued availability
    of financing; financial resources in the amounts, at the times
    and on the terms required to support the Company’s future
    businesses; and material differences in the actual financial
    results of merger and acquisition activities compared with the
    Company’s expectations, including the full realization of
    anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements.

These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect
    the outcome of the forward-looking statements. In addition, such
    statements could be affected by general industry and market
    conditions and growth rates, general economic and political
    conditions, either nationally or in the states in which the
    Company conducts business, including interest rate and currency
    exchange rate fluctuations, changes and trends in the securities
    markets, and other Future Factors.

Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting at
    M

&

T Bank Corporation
    and subsidiaries (“the Company”). Management has
    assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006
    based on criteria described in “Internal Control-Integrated
    Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that
    assessment, management concluded that the Company maintained
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006.

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, that was engaged to express
    an opinion as to the fairness of presentation of such financial
    statements. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was also engaged to audit
    management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The
    report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP follows this report.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and
    Stockholders of

M&

T Bank Corporation:

We have completed integrated audits of
    M

&

T Bank
    Corporation’s consolidated financial statements and of its
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006 in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our
    opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
    financial statements

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of
    M

&

T Bank Corporation
    and subsidiaries (the “Company”) at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, and the results of its operations and its cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
    conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
    standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
    audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
    audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal
    control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
    the Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
    appearing under Item 8, that the Company maintained
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (“COSO”), is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion,
    the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
    opinions on management’s assessment and on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit
    of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
    the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal
    control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
    the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
    performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.



A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Significant
    accounting policies

M

&

T Bank Corporation
    (“M

&

T”)is a
    bank holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York. Through
    subsidiaries, M

&

T
    provides individuals, corporations and other businesses, and
    institutions with commercial and retail banking services,
    including loans and deposits, trust, mortgage banking, asset
    management, insurance and other financial services. Banking
    activities are largely focused on consumers residing in New York
    State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and the District of Columbia and
    on small and medium-size businesses based in those areas.
    Banking services are also provided in Delaware, Virginia, West
    Virginia and New Jersey (effective January 2, 2007), while
    certain subsidiaries also conduct activities in other states.

The accounting and reporting policies of
    M

&

T and subsidiaries
    (“the Company”) conform to generally accepted
    accounting principles and to general practices within the
    banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates. The more significant accounting
    policies are as follows:

Consolidation

Except as described in note 18, the consolidated financial
    statements include M

&

T
    and all of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
    accounts and transactions of consolidated subsidiaries have been
    eliminated in consolidation. The financial statements of
    M

&

T included in
    note 24 report investments in subsidiaries under the equity
    method. Information about some limited purpose entities that are
    affiliates of the Company but are not included in the
    consolidated financial statements appears in note 18.

Consolidated
    Statement of Cash Flows

For purposes of this statement, cash and due from banks and
    federal funds sold are considered cash and cash equivalents.

Securities
    purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under
    agreements to repurchase

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities
    sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as
    collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at
    amounts equal to the cash or other consideration exchanged. It
    is generally the Company’s policy to take possession of
    collateral pledged to secure agreements to resell.

Trading
    account

Financial instruments used for trading purposes are stated at
    fair value. Realized gains and losses and unrealized changes in
    fair value of financial instruments utilized in trading
    activities are included in trading account and foreign exchange
    gains in the consolidated statement of income.

Investment
    securities

Investments in debt securities are classified as held to
    maturity and stated at amortized cost when management has the
    positive intent and ability to hold such securities to maturity.
    Investments in other debt securities and equity securities
    having readily determinable fair values are classified as
    available for sale and stated at estimated fair value. Except
    for investment securities for which the Company has entered into
    a related fair value hedge, unrealized gains or losses on
    investment securities available for sale are reflected in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable
    income taxes.

Other securities are stated at cost and include stock of the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Home
    Loan Bank of New York.

Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts for
    investment securities available for sale and held to maturity
    are included in interest income. The cost basis of individual
    securities is written down to estimated fair value through a
    charge to earnings when declines in value below amortized cost



M

&

T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

are considered to be other than
    temporary. Realized gains and losses on the sales of investment
    securities are determined using the specific identification
    method.

Loans
    and leases

Interest income on loans is accrued on a level yield method.
    Loans are placed on nonaccrual status and previously accrued
    interest thereon is charged against income when principal or
    interest is delinquent 90 days, unless management
    determines that the loan status clearly warrants other
    treatment. Loan balances are charged off when it becomes evident
    that such balances are not fully collectible. Loan fees and
    certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and
    recognized as an interest yield adjustment over the life of the
    loan. Net deferred fees have been included in unearned discount
    as a reduction of loans outstanding. Commitments to sell real
    estate loans are utilized by the Company to hedge the exposure
    to changes in fair value of real estate loans held for sale. The
    carrying value of hedged real estate loans held for sale
    recorded in the consolidated balance sheet includes changes in
    estimated fair market value during the hedge period, typically
    from the date of close through the sale date. Valuation
    adjustments made on these loans and commitments are included in
    mortgage banking revenues.

Except for consumer and residential mortgage loans that are
    considered smaller balance homogenous loans and are evaluated
    collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired for
    purposes of applying Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 114, “Accounting by Creditors
    for Impairment of a Loan,” as amended, when, based on
    current information and events, it is probable that the Company
    will be unable to collect all amounts according to the
    contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is
    delinquent 90 days. Impaired loans are classified as either
    nonaccrual or as loans renegotiated at below market rates. Loans
    less than 90 days delinquent are deemed to have an
    insignificant delay in payment and are generally not considered
    impaired for purposes of applying SFAS No. 114.
    Impairment of a loan is measured based on the present value of
    expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s
    effective interest rate, the loan’s observable market
    price, or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral
    dependent. Interest received on impaired loans placed on
    nonaccrual status is applied to reduce the carrying value of the
    loan or, if principal is considered fully collectible,
    recognized as interest income.

Residual value estimates for commercial leases are generally
    determined through internal or external reviews of the leased
    property. The Company reviews commercial lease residual values
    at least annually and recognizes residual value impairments
    deemed to be other than temporary. Initial estimates of residual
    value for automobile leases are recorded based on published
    industry standards and historical residual value losses incurred
    relative to the published industry standards. Automobile leases
    are considered small homogenous leases and, as such, impairments
    to residual value are determined based on projected residual
    value losses relative to the initially recorded residual values.

Allowance
    for credit losses

The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in
    management’s judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit
    losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the
    balance sheet date. The adequacy of the allowance is determined
    by management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio
    based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated
    with each loan category, the current financial condition of
    specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers
    operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any
    collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any
    guarantees or indemnifications.

Premises
    and equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation expense is computed principally using
    the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets.

Sales
    and securitizations of financial assets

Transfers of financial assets for which the Company has
    surrendered control of the financial assets are accounted for as
    sales to the extent that consideration other than beneficial
    interests in the transferred assets is received in exchange.
    Retained interests in a sale or securitization of financial
    assets are measured



M

&

T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

at the date of transfer by allocating the previous carrying
    amount between the assets transferred and any retained interests
    based on their relative estimated fair values. The fair values
    of retained debt securities are generally determined through
    reference to independent pricing information. The fair values of
    retained servicing rights and any other retained interests are
    determined based on the present value of expected future cash
    flows associated with those interests and by reference to market
    prices for similar assets.

Capitalized
    servicing rights

Servicing assets purchased or servicing liabilities assumed that
    are not recognized in connection with the sale or securitization
    of financial assets are initially measured at fair value.
    Capitalized servicing assets are included in other assets and
    are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated
    net servicing income.

To estimate the fair value of servicing rights, the Company
    considers market prices for similar assets and the present value
    of expected future cash flows associated with the servicing
    rights calculated using assumptions that market participants
    would use in estimating future servicing income and expense.
    Such assumptions include estimates of the cost of servicing
    loans, loan default rates, an appropriate discount rate, and
    prepayment speeds. For purposes of evaluating and measuring
    impairment of capitalized servicing rights, the Company
    stratifies such assets based on the predominant risk
    characteristics of the underlying financial instruments that are
    expected to have the most impact on projected prepayments, cost
    of servicing and other factors affecting future cash flows
    associated with the servicing rights. Such factors may include
    financial asset or loan type, note rate and term. The amount of
    impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value
    of the capitalized servicing rights for a stratum exceeds
    estimated fair value. Impairment is recognized through a
    valuation allowance.

Goodwill
    and core deposit and other intangible assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity
    over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
    Similar to goodwill, other intangible assets, which include core
    deposit intangibles, also lack physical substance but, as
    required by SFAS No. 141, “Business
    Combinations,” portions of the cost of an acquired entity
    have been assigned to such assets. The Company accounts for
    goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with
    SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets,” which, in general, requires that goodwill not be
    amortized, but rather that it be tested for impairment at least
    annually at the reporting unit level, which is either at the
    same level or one level below an operating segment. Other
    acquired intangible assets with finite lives, such as core
    deposit intangibles, are required to be amortized over their
    estimated lives. Core deposit and other intangible assets are
    amortized using accelerated methods over estimated useful lives
    of five to ten years. The Company periodically assesses whether
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amounts of core deposit and other intangible assets may be
    impaired.

Derivative
    financial instruments

The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in
    accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended.
    SFAS No. 133 requires that an entity recognize all
    derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet
    and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain
    conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated
    as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value
    of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm
    commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash
    flows of a forecasted transaction or (c) a hedge of the
    foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign
    operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, an available for
    sale security, or a foreign currency denominated forecasted
    transaction. Pursuant to SFAS No. 133, the accounting
    for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the
    intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. An
    entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to
    establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use
    for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and
    the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect
    of the hedge. Those methods must be consistent with the
    entity’s approach to managing risk.

    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of
    the management of interest rate risk to modify the repricing
    characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities. For such agreements,
    amounts receivable or payable are recognized as accrued under
    the terms of the agreement and the net differential is recorded
    as an adjustment to interest income or expense of the related
    asset or liability. Interest rate swap agreements may be
    designated as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. In a
    fair value hedge, the fair values of the interest rate swap
    agreements and changes in the fair values of the hedged items
    are recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet
    with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current
    earnings. The difference between changes in the fair values of
    interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents
    hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in “other revenues
    from operations” in the Company’s consolidated
    statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, the effective portion
    of the derivative’s unrealized gain or loss is initially
    recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and
    subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted
    transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the
    unrealized gain or loss is reported in “other revenues from
    operations” immediately.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to
    hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of real estate
    loans held for sale. Commitments to originate real estate loans
    to be held for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans
    are generally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at
    estimated fair market value. However, in accordance with Staff
    Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 105,
    “Application of Accounting Principles to
    Loan Commitments,” issued by the United States
    Securities and Exchange Commission, value ascribable to cash
    flows that will be realized in connection with loan servicing
    activities has not been included in the determination of fair
    value of commitments to originate loans for sale. Value
    ascribable to that portion of cash flows is recognized at the
    time the underlying mortgage loans are sold.

Derivative instruments not related to mortgage banking
    activities, including financial futures commitments and interest
    rate swap agreements, that do not satisfy the hedge accounting
    requirements noted above are recorded at fair value and are
    generally classified as trading account assets or liabilities
    with resultant changes in fair value being recognized in trading
    account and foreign exchange gains in the Company’s
    consolidated statement of income.

Stock-based
    compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share Based
    Payment,” (“SFAS No. 123R”), an
    amendment of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation.” Prior to that date, the Company
    recognized expense for stock-based compensation using the fair
    value method of accounting described in SFAS No. 123.
    Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the vesting
    period of the stock-based grant based on the estimated grant
    date value of the stock-based compensation that is expected to
    vest, except that coincident with the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R, the Company began accelerating the
    recognition of compensation costs for stock-based awards granted
    to retirement-eligible employees and employees who will become
    retirement-eligible prior to full vesting of the award because
    the Company’s incentive compensation plan allows for
    vesting at the time an employee retires. Through
    December 31, 2005, stock-based compensation granted to such
    individuals was expensed over the normal vesting period and any
    remaining unrecognized compensation cost was recognized at the
    time an individual employee actually retired. Information on the
    determination of the estimated value of stock-based awards used
    to calculate stock-based compensation expense is included in
    note 10.

Income
    taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
    future tax effects attributable to differences between the
    financial statement value of existing assets and liabilities and
    their respective tax bases and carryforwards. Deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and
    laws.

Earnings
    per common share

Basic earnings per share exclude dilution and are computed by
    dividing income available to common stockholders by the
    weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and common
    shares issuable under deferred compensation arrangements during
    the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect

the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
    contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into
    common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that
    then shared in earnings. Proceeds assumed to have been received
    on such exercise or conversion are assumed to be used to
    purchase shares of M

    common stock at the average market price during the period, as
    required by the “treasury stock method” of accounting.

    to consumers, small businesses and middle market customers, and
    approximately $1.0 billion of deposits. The transaction did

    Gross realized losses on investment securities were $169,000 in

impairment charge related to $132,900,000 of variable rate
    preferred stock issuances of the Federal National Mortgage
    Association (“FNMA”) and the Federal Home Loan
    Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”). Although the
    securities were rated as investment grade, the Company
    recognized the impairment charge, in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, in light of changing
    circumstances during 2005 that included an announced further
    delay in FNMA’s ability to provide restated financial
    information about its results of operations and a further
    decline in the market value of certain of FHLMC’s preferred

The Company owned approximately five hundred individual
    investment securities with aggregate gross unrealized losses of
    $88,985,000 at December 31, 2006. Those investment
    securities consisted predominantly of mortgage-backed securities
    classified as available for sale. The unrealized losses at
    December 31, 2006 were generally attributable to the level
    of interest rates and, accordingly, were considered to be
    temporary in nature. At December 31, 2006, the Company had
    not identified events or changes in circumstance which may have
    a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the
    $356,851,000 of cost method investment securities.

At December 31, 2006, investment securities with a carrying
    value of $4,422,316,000, including $4,158,346,000 of investment
    securities available for sale, were pledged to secure demand
    notes issued to the U.S. Treasury, borrowings from various
    Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”), repurchase
    agreements, governmental deposits and interest rate swap
    agreements.

Investment securities pledged by the Company to secure
    obligations whereby the secured party is permitted by contract
    or custom to sell or repledge such collateral totaled
    $1,300,322,000 at December 31, 2006. The pledged securities
    are included in mortgage-backed securities available for sale.

At December 31, 2006, collateral accepted by the Company
    which by contract or custom can be sold or repledged consisted
    of securities with a fair value of $104,205,000 purchased under
    agreements to resell. Those securities have been pledged at
    December 31, 2006 to secure governmental deposits.

One-to-four

family residential mortgage loans held for sale were

    $1.2 billion at December 31, 2005.

One-to-four

family residential mortgage loans and smaller balance commercial
    mortgage loans with many repayment characteristics similar to
    residential mortgage loans that are serviced for others totaled
    approximately $16.7 billion and $15.6 billion at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2006, approximately $7 million of

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans serviced for others had been
    sold with credit recourse. Commercial mortgage loans held for
    sale were $49 million at December 31, 2006 and
    $199 million at December 31, 2005. Commercial mortgage
    loans serviced for others totaled approximately
    $4.9 billion and $4.3 billion at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2006,
    approximately $939 million of commercial mortgage loan
    balances serviced for others had been sold with recourse in
    conjunction with the Company’s participation in the FNMA
    Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (“DUS”) program.
    At December 31, 2006, the Company estimated that the
    recourse obligations described above were not material to the
    Company’s consolidated financial position. There have been
    no material losses incurred as a result of those recourse
    arrangements. Included in consumer loans were home equity loans
    held for sale of $65 million at December 31, 2006 and
    $38 million at December 31, 2005.

Nonperforming loans (loans on which interest was not being
    accrued or had been renegotiated at below-market interest rates)
    totaled $224,228,000 at December 31, 2006 and $156,451,000
    at December 31, 2005. If nonaccrual and renegotiated loans
    had been accruing interest at their originally contracted terms,
    interest income on such loans would have amounted to $17,173,000
    in 2006 and $12,144,000 in 2005. The actual amounts included in
    interest income during 2006 and 2005 on such loans were
    $6,770,000 and $3,279,000, respectively.

The recorded investment in loans considered impaired for
    purposes of applying SFAS No. 114 was $152,676,000 and
    $92,528,000 at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    The recorded investment in loans considered impaired for which
    there was a related valuation allowance for impairment included
    in the allowance for credit losses and the amount of such
    impairment allowance were $139,021,000 and $23,388,000,
    respectively, at December 31, 2006 and $65,244,000 and
    $15,343,000, respectively, at December 31, 2005. The
    recorded investment in loans considered impaired for which there
    was no related valuation allowance for impairment was
    $13,655,000 and $27,284,000 at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The average recorded investment in impaired loans
    during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $97,263,000, $106,603,000 and
    $135,431,000, respectively. Interest income recognized on

    respectively. During 2006, new borrowings by such persons
    amounted to $61,061,000 (including borrowings of new directors
    or officers that were outstanding at the time of their election)
    and repayments and other reductions (including reductions
    resulting from retirements) were $75,639,000.

At December 31, 2006, approximately $948 million of
    commercial mortgage loans and $2.3 billion of

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans were pledged to secure
    outstanding borrowings. As described in note 18, as of
    December 31, 2006, $565 million of automobile loans
    and related assets were effectively pledged to secure a
    $500 million revolving structured borrowing.

The Company’s loan and lease portfolio includes
    (i) commercial lease financing receivables consisting of
    direct financing and leveraged leases for machinery and

Capitalized servicing assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005
    included $153 million and $140 million, respectively,
    of capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing rights, net
    of the valuation allowance for impairment, and $21 million
    of capitalized commercial mortgage loan servicing rights at each
    of those dates. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, $9,750,000,
    $11,078,000 and $3,622,000, respectively, of the valuation
    allowance was reversed because of increases in the market value
    of certain strata of servicing assets relative to the amortized
    cost basis of the servicing assets in such strata. The estimated
    fair value of capitalized servicing assets was approximately
    $214 million at December 31, 2006 and
    $191 million at December 31, 2005. The fair value of
    capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets was
    estimated using weighted-average discount rates of 17.8% and
    16.6% at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and
    contemporaneous prepayment assumptions that vary by loan type.
    At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the discount rate
    represented a weighted-average option-adjusted spread
    (“OAS”) of 1,227 basis points (hundredths of one
    percent) and 1,073 basis points, respectively, over market
    implied forward London Interbank Offered Rates. The estimated
    market value of capitalized servicing rights may vary
    significantly in subsequent periods due to changing interest
    rates and the effect thereof on prepayment speeds. An 18%
    discount rate was used to estimate the fair value of capitalized
    commercial mortgage loan servicing rights at December 31,
    2006 and 2005 with no prepayment assumptions because, in
    general, the servicing agreements allow the Company to share in
    customer loan prepayment fees and thereby recover the remaining
    carrying value of the capitalized servicing rights associated
    with such loan. The Company’s ability to realize the
    carrying value of capitalized commercial mortgage servicing
    rights is more dependent on the borrowers’ abilities to
    repay the underlying loans than on prepayments or changes in
    interest rates.

The key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of
    capitalized servicing rights at December 31, 2006 and the
    sensitivity of such value to changes in those assumptions are
    summarized in the table that follows. Those calculated
    sensitivities are hypothetical and actual changes in the fair
    value of capitalized servicing rights may differ significantly
    from the amounts presented herein. The effect of a variation in
    a particular assumption on the fair value of the servicing
    rights is calculated without changing any other assumption. In
    reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another
    which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities. The changes
    in assumptions are presumed to be instantaneous.

Goodwill
    and other intangible assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company does not
    amortize goodwill associated with corporate acquisitions,
    however, core deposit and other intangible assets are amortized
    over the estimated life of each respective asset. Total
    amortizing intangible assets were comprised of the following:

Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets was
    generally computed using accelerated methods over original
    amortization periods of five to ten years. The weighted-average
    original amortization period was approximately eight years. The
    remaining weighted-average amortization period as of
    December 31, 2006 was also approximately eight years.
    Amortization expense for core deposit and other intangible
    assets was $63,008,000, $56,805,000, and $75,410,000 for the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
    Estimated amortization expense in future years for such
    intangible assets is as follows:

Also in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 142, the Company completed annual goodwill
    impairment tests as of October 1, 2004, 2005 and 2006. For
    purposes of testing for impairment, the Company assigned all
    recorded goodwill to the reporting units originally intended to
    benefit from past business combinations. Goodwill was generally
    assigned based on the implied fair value of the acquired
    goodwill applicable to the benefited reporting units at the time
    of each respective acquisition. The



M

&

T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

implied fair value of the goodwill was determined as the
    difference between the estimated incremental overall fair value
    of the reporting unit and the estimated fair value of the net
    assets assigned to the reporting unit as of each respective
    acquisition date. To test for goodwill impairment at each
    evaluation date, the Company compared the estimated fair value
    of each of its reporting units to their respective carrying
    amounts and certain other assets and liabilities assigned to the
    reporting unit, including goodwill and core deposit and other
    intangible assets. The methodologies used to estimate fair
    values of reporting units as of the acquisition dates and as of
    the evaluation dates were similar. For the Company’s core
    customer relationship business reporting units, fair value was
    estimated as the present value of the expected future cash flows
    of the reporting unit. The Company’s non-relationship
    business reporting units were individually analyzed and fair
    value was largely determined by comparisons to market
    transactions for similar businesses. Based on the results of the
    goodwill impairment tests, the Company concluded that the amount
    of recorded goodwill was not impaired at the respective testing
    dates.

A summary of goodwill assigned to each of the Company’s
    reportable segments for purposes of testing for impairment was

    In December 2006, M

    Bank issued $500 million of subordinated notes which bear a

    floating rate thereafter until maturity in December 2021, at a
    rate equal to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate

T Bank may, at its
    option and subject to prior regulatory approval, redeem some or
    all of the notes on any interest payment date. In December 2005,
    M

&

T Bank completed an
    offer to the holders of its 8% subordinated notes due
    October 2010 to exchange their notes for fixed rate/floating
    rate subordinated notes due December 2020. Approximately
    $363 million of the 8% notes with a carrying value of
    $348 million were exchanged for new subordinated notes with
    a face value of $409 million. The new subordinated notes
    bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.585% until December 2015 and
    a floating rate of interest thereafter until maturity in
    December 2020, at a rate equal to the one-month LIBOR plus
    1.215%. Beginning December 2015,
    M

&

T Bank may, at its
    option and subject to prior regulatory approval, redeem some or
    all of the new notes on any interest payment date. In accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company
    accounted for the exchange as a modification of debt terms and
    not as an extinguishment of debt because, among other factors,
    the present value of the cash flows under the terms of the new
    subordinated notes was not at least ten percent different from
    the present value of the cash flows under the original terms of
    the exchanged subordinated notes. Coincident with the exchange,
    M

&

T Bank terminated
    $363 million of interest rate swap agreements that were
    used to hedge the 8.0% subordinated notes that were
    exchanged. A $15 million valuation adjustment on the
    previously hedged notes was included in the carrying value of
    the new subordinated notes. That valuation adjustment is being
    amortized to interest expense over the period to expected
    maturity of the new notes. The unamortized balance of such
    valuation adjustment was

$14 million and $15 million at December 31, 2006

    effective rate of 7.76%.

Long-term variable rate advances from the FHLB had contractual
    interest rates that ranged from 5.31% to 5.37% at

    interest rates payable were 5.52% and 5.28% at December 31,

Stock-based
    compensation plans

The Company recognizes expense for stock-based compensation
    using the fair value method of accounting. For 2006, 2005 and
    2004, the Company recognized $51 million, $45 million
    and $48 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation
    expense and $13 million, $11 million and
    $13 million, respectively, of related income tax benefits.
    As required, coincident with the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R, the Company began accelerating the
    recognition of compensation costs for stock-based awards granted
    to retirement-eligible employees and employees who become
    retirement-eligible prior to full vesting of the award because
    the Company’s incentive compensation plans allow for
    vesting at the time an employee retires. Stock-based
    compensation granted to retirement-eligible individuals through
    December 31, 2005 was expensed over the normal vesting
    period with any remaining unrecognized compensation cost
    recognized at the time of retirement. This change affected the
    timing of stock-based compensation expense recognition in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements for 2006, but
    did not affect the value ascribed to stock-based compensation
    granted to employees nor the aggregate amount of stock-based
    compensation expense to be recognized by the Company. The
    acceleration of such expense increased stock-based compensation
    expense for 2006 by $4 million ($3 million after
    taxes), and reduced basic and diluted earnings per share by $.03
    from what would otherwise have been recognized in that period
    had the expense recognition not been accelerated. If not for
    this required change, the additional $4 million of
    stock-based compensation expense recognized in 2006 would have
    been recognized throughout 2007, 2008 and 2009 following the
    normal vesting schedule for stock options granted by the Company.

Stock
    option plans

The Company’s 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan allows for
    the issuance of various forms of stock-based compensation,
    including stock options, restricted stock and performance-based
    awards. Through December 31, 2006, only stock options that
    vest with the passage of time as service is provided have been
    issued. Stock options issued generally vest over four years and
    are exercisable over terms not exceeding ten years and one day.
    In 2005, the Company granted 125,600 options to substantially
    all employees who had not been previously receiving awards. The
    options granted under that award vest three years after grant
    date and are exercisable for a period of seven years thereafter.
    The 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan allows for share grants not
    to exceed 6,000,000 shares of stock plus the shares that
    remained available for grant under a prior plan. At
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, there were
    7,199,903 and 8,810,196 shares available for future grant.

The Company used an option pricing model to estimate the grant
    date present value of stock options granted. The
    weighted-average estimated grant date value per option was
    $28.10 in 2006, $22.96 in 2005 and $22.64 in 2004. The values
    were calculated using the following weighted-average
    assumptions; an option term of 6.5 years (representing the
    estimated period between grant date and exercise date based on
    historical data); a risk-free interest rate of 4.28% in 2006,
    3.95% in 2005 and 3.53% in 2004 (representing the yield on a
    U.S. Treasury security with a remaining term equal to the
    expected option term); expected volatility of 24% in 2006, 21%
    in 2005 and 24% in 2004 (based on historical volatility of
    M

and 1.31% in 2004 (representing
    the approximate annualized cash dividend rate paid with respect
    to a share of common stock at or near the grant date). Based on
    historical data and projected employee turnover rates, the
    Company reduced the estimated value of stock options for
    purposes of recognizing stock-based compensation expense by 7%
    in 2006 and 8% in 2005 and 2004 to reflect the probability of
    forfeiture prior to vesting. Aggregate fair value of options
    expected to vest that were granted in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were
    $49 million, $41 million and $47 million,
    respectively.

    respectively, in cash and realized $27 million,
    $31 million and $30 million, respectively, in tax
    benefits from the exercise of stock options. The intrinsic value
    of stock options exercised during those periods was
    $86 million, $92 million and $93 million,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2006, there was
    $42 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related
    to non-vested stock options. That cost is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years. The
    total grant date fair value of stock options vested during 2006,
    2005 and 2004 was $37 million, $41 million and
    $36 million, respectively.  Upon the exercise of stock
    options, the Company generally issues shares from treasury stock
    to the extent available, but may also issue new shares.

Stock
    purchase plan

The stock purchase plan provides eligible employees of the
    Company with the right to purchase shares of
    M

&

T common stock
    through accumulated payroll deductions. Shares of
    M

&

T common stock will
    be issued at the end of an option period, typically one year or
    six months. In connection with the employee stock purchase plan,
    1,000,000 shares of
    M

&

T common stock were
    authorized for issuance, of which 392,955 shares have been
    issued, including 102,400 shares in 2006,
    103,694 shares in 2005 and 104,378 shares in 2004. For
    2006, 2005 and 2004,
    M

&

T received
    $10 million, $9 million and $8 million,
    respectively, in cash for shares purchased through the employee
    stock purchase plan.

Similar to the stock option plans, the Company used an option
    pricing model to estimate the grant date present value of
    purchase rights under the stock purchase plan. The estimated
    weighted-average grant date value per right was $16.43 in 2006,
    $14.44 in 2005 and $11.93 in 2004. Such values were calculated
    using the following weighted-average assumptions: a term of six
    months to one year (representing the period between grant date
    and exercise date); a risk-free interest rate of 4.95% in 2006,
    3.64% in 2005 and 1.84% in 2004 (representing the yield on a
    U.S. Treasury security with a like term); expected
    volatility of 14% in 2006, 16% in 2005 and 17% in 2004 (based on
    historical volatility of
    M

&

T’s common stock
    price); and an estimated dividend yield of 1.96% in 2006, 1.67%
    in 2005 and 1.68% in 2004 (representing the approximate
    annualized cash dividend rate paid with respect to a share of
    common stock at or near the grant date).

Deferred
    bonus plan

The Company provides a deferred bonus plan pursuant to which
    eligible employees may elect to defer all or a portion of their
    current annual incentive compensation awards and allocate such
    awards to several investment options, including
    M

&

T common stock.
    Participants may elect the timing of distributions from the
    plan. Such distributions are payable in cash with the exception

    common stock issuable in the consolidated balance sheet. Through
    December 31, 2006, 91,407 shares have been issued in
    connection with the deferred bonus plan.

Directors’
    stock plan

The Company maintains a compensation plan for non-employee
    members of the Company’s boards of directors and directors
    advisory councils that allows such members to receive all or a
    portion of their compensation in shares of
    M

The Company has an unfunded supplemental pension plan for
    certain key executives. The projected benefit obligation and
    accumulated benefit obligation included in the preceding data
    related to such plan were $44,125,000 and $43,413,000,
    respectively, as of December 31, 2006 and were each
    $46,923,000 as of December 31, 2005.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit
    pension plans was $649,925,000 and $659,728,000 at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans,” which requires an employer to recognize in its
    balance sheet as an asset or liability the overfunded or
    underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan,
    measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets
    and the

benefit obligation. For a pension
    plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit
    obligation; for any other postretirement benefit plan, such as a
    retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the
    accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.
    SFAS No. 158 requires that gains or losses and prior
    service costs or credits that arise during the period, but are
    not included as components of net periodic benefit expense
    pursuant to SFAS No. 87 or SFAS No. 106, be
    recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. An
    employer with publicly-traded equity securities is required to
    initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit
    postretirement plan as of the end of the fiscal year ending
    after December 15, 2006. The Company adopted the provisions
    of SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006. As indicated in
    the preceding table, the Company recorded an additional minimum
    liability totaling $46,334,000 ($38,582,000 related to pension
    plans and $7,752,000 related to other postretirement benefits)
    with a corresponding reduction of stockholders’ equity, net
    of applicable deferred taxes, of $28,263,000. Of the $38,582,000
    related to pension plans, $7,955,000 was related to unfunded
    nonqualified defined benefit plans. Because the recognition
    requirements of SFAS No. 158 were required to be
    applied at the end of the year of adoption, the Company had to
    first recognize the minimum liability amounts required under the
    provisions of SFAS No. 87. As a result, as of
    December 31, 2006 the Company decreased its previously
    recorded minimum pension liability by $50,708,000 with a
    corresponding increase to other comprehensive income that, net
    of applicable deferred taxes, was $30,932,000. In order to
    recognize the funded status of the Company’s combined
    postretirement defined benefit plans under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 158, the Company then recorded an incremental
    minimum liability of $16,166,000 with a corresponding reduction
    of stockholders’ equity that, net of applicable deferred
    taxes, was $9,841,000. In total, the Company decreased its
    minimum liability from that which was recorded at
    December 31, 2005 by $34,542,000 with a corresponding
    increase to stockholders’ equity that, net of applicable
    deferred taxes, was $21,091,000. The following table reflects
    the amortization of amounts in accumulated other comprehensive
    income expected to be recognized as components of net periodic
    benefit expense during 2007:

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company amended certain
    provisions of its defined benefit pension plans. The formula was
    changed to reduce the future accrual of benefits by lowering the
    accrual percentage and through use of a career-average-pay
    formula as opposed to the previous final-average-pay formula.
    The amendments affected benefits earned for service periods
    beginning after December 31, 2005. The amendments caused
    the projected benefit obligation associated with the defined
    benefit plans to decrease by approximately $98 million as
    of December 31, 2005. There was no corresponding effect on
    the accumulated benefit obligation. Amortization of prior
    service credits lowered pension expense in 2006 by approximately
    $7 million. Also effective January 1, 2006, the
    Company began to provide a new qualified defined contribution
    pension plan. Active participants in the old defined benefit
    plan had the choice of electing to remain in the defined benefit
    plan under the reduced benefit formula, or electing to
    participate in the new qualified defined contribution plan.
    Under the new defined contribution pension plan, the Company
    makes contributions to the plan each year in an amount that is
    based on an individual participant’s total compensation
    (generally defined as total wages, incentive compensation,
    commissions and bonuses) and years of service. Participants do
    not contribute to the defined contribution pension plan.
    Employees who were not participants in the defined benefit plan
    at December 31, 2005 can no longer participate in that
    plan, but are eligible to participate in the defined
    contribution plan. Pension expense recorded in 2006 associated
    with the defined contribution pension plan was approximately
    $7 million.

As of December 31, 2006, the accumulated benefit obligation
    and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated
    benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $643,095,000
    (including $43,413,000 related to the unfunded supplemental
    pension plan) and $506,268,000, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2005, the accumulated benefit obligation and
    fair value of plan assets for pension plans

Weighted-average pension plan asset allocations based on the

The expected long-term rate of return assumption as of each
    measurement date was determined by taking into consideration
    asset allocations as of each such date, target allocations of
    assets, historical returns on the types of assets held and
    current economic factors. The Company’s investment policy
    for determining the asset allocation targets was developed based
    on the desire to maximize total return while placing a strong
    emphasis on preservation of capital. In general, it is hoped
    that, in the aggregate, changes in the fair value of plan assets
    will be less volatile than similar changes in appropriate market
    indices. Returns on invested assets are periodically compared
    with target market indices for each asset type to aid management
    in evaluating such returns. Furthermore, management regularly
    reviews the investment policy and may, if deemed appropriate,
    make changes to the target allocations presented above.

Pension plan assets included common stock of
    M

&

T with a fair value
    of $40,059,000 (8% of total plan assets) at December 31,
    2006 and $35,760,000 (8% of total plan assets) at
    December 31, 2005.

The Company makes contributions to its funded qualified defined
    benefit pension plans as required by government regulation or as
    deemed appropriate by management after considering the fair
    value of plan assets, expected returns on such assets, and the
    present value of benefit obligations of the plans. Subject to
    the impact of actual events and circumstances that may occur in
    2007, the Company may make contributions to the qualified
    defined benefit pension plans in 2007, but the amount of any
    such contribution has not yet been determined. No minimum
    contribution is required in 2007 under government regulations
    for qualified defined benefit pension plans. The Company
    contributed $36 million to the qualified defined benefit
    pension plans in 2006. There were no contributions to such plans
    in 2005. The Company regularly funds the payment of benefit
    obligations for the supplemental defined benefit pension and
    postretirement benefit plans because such plans do not hold
    assets for investment. Payments made by the Company for
    supplemental pension benefits were $4,835,000 and $5,778,000 in
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Payments made by the Company for
    postretirement benefits were $8,186,000

and $9,682,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Payments for
    supplemental pension and other postretirement benefits for 2007
    are not expected to differ from those made in 2006 by an amount
    that will be material to the Company’s consolidated
    financial position.

Estimated benefits expected to be paid in future years related
    to the Company’s defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement benefits plans are as follows:

For measurement of other postretirement benefits, a 9% annual
    rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care
    benefits was assumed for 2007. The rate was assumed to decrease
    gradually to 5% over 5 years and remain constant
    thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a
    significant effect on the amounts reported for health care
    plans. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost

The Company has a retirement savings plan (“Savings
    Plan”) that is a defined contribution plan in which
    eligible employees of the Company may defer up to 50% of
    qualified compensation via contributions to the plan. The
    Company makes an employer matching contribution in an amount
    equal to 75% of an employee’s contribution, up to 4.5% of
    the employee’s qualified compensation. Employees’
    accounts, including employee contributions, employer matching
    contributions and accumulated earnings thereon, are at all times
    fully vested and nonforfeitable. Employee benefits expense
    resulting from the Company’s contributions to the Savings
    Plan totaled $21,152,000, $16,507,000 and $16,215,000 in 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return
    reflecting taxable income earned by all subsidiaries. In prior
    years, applicable federal tax law allowed certain financial
    institutions the option of deducting as bad debt expense for tax
    purposes amounts in excess of actual losses. In accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles, such financial
    institutions were not required to provide deferred income taxes
    on such excess. Recapture of the excess tax bad debt reserve
    established under the previously allowed method will result in
    taxable income if M

    Bank fails to maintain bank status as defined in the Internal
    Revenue Code or charges are made to the reserve for other than
    bad debt losses. At December 31, 2006,
    M

&

T Bank’s tax bad
    debt reserve for which no federal income taxes have been
    provided was $74,021,000. No actions are planned that would
    cause this reserve to become wholly or partially taxable.

The portion of income taxes attributable to gains or losses on
    bank investment securities was an expense of $976,000 in 2006, a
    benefit of $5,434,000 in 2005, and an expense of $1,121,000 in
    2004. No alternative minimum tax expense was recognized in 2006,
    2005 or 2004.

Total income taxes differed from the amount computed by applying
    the statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income as

During 2004 the Company reorganized two of its subsidiaries
    which altered the taxable status of such subsidiaries in certain
    jurisdictions thereby decreasing the Company’s effective
    state income tax rate. As a result of the reorganizations, both
    income tax expense and deferred tax liabilities were reduced by
    $12,499,000 in 2004.

International
    activities

The Company engages in certain international activities
    consisting largely of collecting Eurodollar deposits, engaging
    in foreign currency trading, providing credit to support the
    international activities of domestic companies and holding
    certain loans to foreign borrowers. Net assets identified with
    international activities amounted to $185,175,000 and
    $230,021,000 at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Such assets included $175,528,000 and $216,798,000,
    respectively, of loans to foreign borrowers. Deposits at
    M

&

T Bank’s
    offshore branch office were $5,429,668,000 and $2,809,532,000 at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company uses
    such deposits to facilitate customer demand and as an
    alternative to short-term borrowings when the costs of such
    deposits seem reasonable.

17.

Derivative
    financial instruments

As part of managing interest rate risk, the Company has entered
    into several interest rate swap agreements. The agreements
    modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of the
    Company’s portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing
    liabilities. Interest rate swap agreements are generally entered
    into with counterparties that meet established credit standards
    and most contain collateral provisions protecting the at-risk
    party. The Company believes that the credit risk inherent in
    these contracts is not significant.

The Company designates interest rate swap agreements utilized in
    the management of interest rate risk as either fair value hedges
    or cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS No. 133. Fair
    value hedges are intended to protect against exposure to changes
    in the fair value of designated assets or liabilities. Cash flow
    hedges are intended to protect against the variability of cash
    flows associated with designated assets or liabilities.

Under the terms of these
    agreements, the Company receives settlement amounts at a fixed
    rate and pays at a variable rate.

The estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements
    represents the amount the Company would have expected to receive
    (pay) to terminate such contracts. The estimated fair value of
    such swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005 included
    gross unrealized gains of $115,000 and $81,000, respectively,
    and gross unrealized losses of $15,120,000 and $8,929,000,
    respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the estimated
    fair values of interest rate swap agreements designated as fair
    value hedges were substantially offset by unrealized gains and
    losses resulting from changes in the fair values of the hedged
    items.

The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered
    into for risk management purposes that were outstanding at
    December 31, 2006 mature as follows:

The net effect of interest rate swap agreements was to decrease
    net interest income by $4,281,000 in 2006, and to increase net
    interest income by $5,526,000 in 2005 and $18,276,000 in 2004.
    The average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements
    impacting net interest income that were entered into for
    interest rate risk management purposes were $774,268,000 in
    2006, $767,175,000 in 2005 and $696,284,000 in 2004. The amount
    of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was
    not material to the Company’s results of operations.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell residential and
    commercial real estate loans to hedge the exposure to changes in
    the fair value of real estate loans held for sale. Such
    commitments have been designated as fair value hedges. The
    Company also utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to
    offset

the exposure to changes in the
    fair value of certain commitments to originate real estate loans
    for sale. As a result of these activities, net unrealized
    pre-tax gains related to hedged loans held for sale, commitments
    to originate loans for sale, and commitments to sell loans were
    approximately $4 million at December 31, 2006,
    compared with unrealized pre-tax losses of $5 million at
    December 31, 2005. Changes in unrealized gains or losses
    are included in mortgage banking revenues and, in general, are
    realized in subsequent periods as the related loans are sold and
    commitments satisfied.

Derivative financial instruments used for trading purposes
    included interest rate contracts, foreign exchange and other
    option contracts, foreign exchange forward and spot contracts,
    and financial futures. Interest rate contracts entered into for
    trading purposes had notional values and estimated fair value
    gains of $7.6 billion and $17,122,000, respectively, at
    December 31, 2006 and notional values and estimated fair
    value gains of $6.7 billion and $12,486,000, respectively,
    at December 31, 2005. Foreign exchange and other option and
    futures contracts totaled approximately $613 million and
    $679 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Such contracts were valued at gains of $477,000
    and $428,000 at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Trading account assets and liabilities are recorded in the
    consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair value. The

T Bank formed in 2002
    for the purpose of borrowing $500 million in a revolving

    lender. The revolving asset-backed structured borrowing is
    secured by automobile loans and other assets transferred to the
    special purpose subsidiary by
    M

T Bank or other of
    its subsidiaries that totaled $565 million and
    $572 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The activities of
    M

&

T Auto
    Receivables I, LLC are generally restricted to purchasing
    and owning automobile loans for the purpose of securing this
    revolving borrowing arrangement. Proceeds from payments on the
    automobile loans are required to be applied in priority order
    for fees, principal and interest on the borrowing, and funding
    the monthly replenishment of loans. Any remaining proceeds are
    available for distribution to
    M

T Bank. The secured
    borrowing is prepayable, in whole or in part, at any time and is
    non-recourse to M

&

T
    Bank and the Company. However, 80% of the borrowing can be put
    back to M

&

T Bank upon
    demand. The Company’s maximum incremental exposure to loss
    resulting from the structure of this borrowing arrangement is
    generally restricted to the amount that such borrowing is
    overcollateralized. Management currently estimates no material
    losses as a result of the pledging of assets and the terms of
    the borrowing arrangement. The assets and liabilities of
    M

    investment securities available for sale were 651,688 AIB ADSs
    with a carrying value of approximately $15 million at
    December 31, 2006, compared with 797,438 AIB ADSs with a

    December 31, 2006 and 2005. The options expire at various
    dates through June 2012.
    M

T’s maximum
    exposure to loss is $15 million at December 31, 2006.

As described in note 9,
    M

&

T has issued junior
    subordinated debentures payable to the Trusts and the Allfirst
    Asset Trust and owns the common securities of those entities.
    The Trusts and the Allfirst Asset Trust are not included in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements because the
    Company is not considered to be the primary beneficiary of those
    entities. Accordingly, at December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
    Company included the Junior Subordinated Debentures payable to
    the Trusts and the Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures
    payable to the Allfirst Asset Trust as long-term borrowings in
    its consolidated balance sheet. The Company has recognized
    $30 million in other assets for its “investment”
    in the common securities of the Trusts and Allfirst Asset Trust
    that will be concomitantly repaid to
    M

&

T by the respective
    trust from the proceeds of
    M

&

T’s repayment of
    the junior subordinated debentures associated with preferred
    capital securities described in note 9.

The Company has invested as a limited partner in various real
    estate partnerships that collectively had total assets of
    approximately $339 million and $331 million at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Those
    partnerships generally construct or acquire properties for which
    the investing partners are eligible to receive certain federal
    income tax credits in accordance with government guidelines.
    Such investments may also provide tax deductible losses to the
    partners. The partnership investments also assist the Company in
    achieving its community reinvestment initiatives. As a limited
    partner, there is no recourse to the Company by creditors of the
    partnerships. However, the tax credits that result from the
    Company’s investments in such partnerships are generally
    subject to recapture should a partnership fail to comply with
    the respective government regulations. The Company’s
    maximum exposure to loss of its investments in such partnerships
    was $142 million, including $25 million of unfunded
    commitments, at December 31, 2006 and $143 million,
    including $27 million of unfunded commitments, at
    December 31, 2005. Management currently estimates that no
    material losses are probable as a result of the Company’s
    involvement with such entities. In accordance with the
    accounting provisions for variable interest entities, the
    partnership entities are not included in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Securitizations

In December 2005, the Company securitized approximately
    $126 million, of

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans in a guaranteed mortgage
    securitization with FNMA. The Company recognized no gain or loss
    on the transaction as it retained all of the resulting
    securities. Such securities were classified as investment
    securities available for sale. The Company expects no material
    credit-related losses on the retained securities as a result of
    the guarantees by FNMA.

In prior years, the Company transferred approximately
    $1.9 billion

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans to qualified special purpose
    trusts in non-recourse securitization transactions. In exchange
    for the loans, the Company received cash, no more than 88% of
    the resulting securities, and the servicing rights to the loans.
    All of the retained securities were classified as investment
    securities available for sale. The qualified special purpose
    trusts are not included in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements. Because the transactions were
    non-recourse, the Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a
    result of its association with the trusts is limited to
    realizing the carrying value of the retained securities and
    servicing rights. The combined outstanding principal amount of
    mortgage-backed securities issued by the qualified special
    purpose trusts was $732 million at December 31, 2006
    and $877 million at December 31, 2005. The principal
    amount of such securities held by the Company was
    $627 million and $757 million at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    loans of the trusts that were 30 or more days delinquent totaled
    $14 million and $16 million, respectively. Credit
    losses, net of recoveries, for the trusts in 2006 and 2005 were
    insignificant. There were no significant repurchases of

A summary of the fair values of retained subordinated interests
    resulting from the Company’s residential mortgage loan
    securitization activities follows. Although the estimated fair
    values of the retained subordinated interests were obtained from
    independent pricing sources, the Company has modeled the
    sensitivity of such fair values to changes in certain
    assumptions as summarized in the table below. These calculated
    sensitivities are hypothetical and actual changes in the fair
    value may differ significantly from the amounts presented
    herein. The effect of a variation in a particular assumption on
    the fair values is calculated without changing any other
    assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in
    changes in another which may magnify or counteract the
    sensitivities. The changes in assumptions are presumed to be
    instantaneous. The hypothetical effect of adverse changes on the
    Company’s retained capitalized servicing assets at
    December 31, 2006 is included in note 7.

Fair
    value of financial instruments

SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of
    Financial Instruments,” requires disclosure of the
    estimated fair value of financial instruments. Fair value is
    generally defined as the price a willing buyer and a willing
    seller would exchange for a financial instrument in other than a
    distressed sale situation.

With the exception of marketable securities, certain off-balance
    sheet financial instruments and

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans originated for sale, the
    Company’s financial instruments are not readily marketable
    and market prices do not exist. The Company, in attempting to
    comply with the provisions of SFAS No. 107, has not
    attempted to market its financial instruments to potential
    buyers, if any exist. Since negotiated prices in illiquid
    markets depend greatly upon the then present motivations of the
    buyer and seller, it is reasonable to assume that actual sales
    prices could vary widely from any estimate of fair value made
    without the benefit of negotiations. Additionally, changes in
    market interest rates can dramatically impact the value of
    financial instruments in a short period of time.

The estimated fair values of investments in readily marketable
    debt and equity securities were calculated based on quoted
    market prices at the respective year-end. In determining amounts
    to present for other financial instruments, the Company
    generally used calculations based upon discounted cash flows of
    the related financial instruments or assigned some other amount
    as required by SFAS No. 107. Additional information
    about the assumptions and calculations utilized is presented
    below.

The following assumptions and methods or calculations were used
    in determining the disclosed value of financial instruments.

Cash
    and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits at banks,
    short-term borrowings, accrued interest receivable and accrued
    interest payable

Due to the nature of cash and cash equivalents and the near
    maturity of interest-bearing deposits at banks, short-term
    borrowings, accrued interest receivable and accrued interest
    payable, the Company estimated that the carrying amount of such
    instruments approximated estimated fair value.

Trading
    account assets and liabilities

Trading account assets and liabilities are carried in the
    consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair value which, in
    general, is based on quoted market prices. Trading account
    liabilities are included in other liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheet.



M

&

T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

Agreements
    to resell securities

The amounts assigned to agreements to resell securities were
    based on discounted calculations of projected cash flows.

Investment
    securities

Estimated fair values of investments in readily marketable debt
    and equity securities were based on quoted market prices.
    Investment securities that were not readily marketable were
    assigned amounts based on estimates provided by brokers,
    discounted calculations of projected cash flows or, in the case
    of other investment securities, which include capital stock of
    the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Home
    Loan Bank of New York, at an amount equal to the carrying
    amount.

Loans
    and leases

In general, discount rates used to calculate values for loan
    products were based on the Company’s pricing at the
    respective year end. A higher discount rate was assumed with
    respect to estimated cash flows associated with nonaccrual
    loans. The allowance for credit losses represents the
    Company’s assessment of the overall level of credit losses
    inherent in the portfolio as of the respective year end and may
    not be indicative of the credit-related discount that a
    purchaser of the Company’s loans and leases would seek.

Deposits

SFAS No. 107 requires that the estimated fair value
    ascribed to noninterest-bearing deposits, savings deposits and
    NOW accounts be established at carrying value because of the
    customers’ ability to withdraw funds immediately. Time
    deposit accounts are required to be revalued based upon
    prevailing market interest rates for similar maturity
    instruments. As a result, amounts assigned to time deposits were
    based on discounted cash flow calculations using prevailing
    market interest rates for deposits with comparable remaining
    terms to maturity.

The Company believes that deposit accounts have a value greater
    than that prescribed by SFAS No. 107. The Company
    feels, however, that the value associated with these deposits is
    greatly influenced by characteristics of the buyer, such as the
    ability to reduce the costs of servicing the deposits and
    deposit attrition which often occurs following an acquisition.
    Accordingly, estimating the fair value of deposits with any
    degree of certainty is not practical.

Long-term
    borrowings

The amounts assigned to long-term borrowings were based on
    quoted market prices, when available, or were based on
    discounted cash flow calculations using prevailing market
    interest rates for borrowings of similar terms.

Commitments
    to originate real estate loans for sale and commitments to sell
    real estate loans

As described in note 17, the Company enters into various
    commitments to originate real estate loans for sale and
    commitments to sell real estate loans. Such commitments are
    considered to be derivative financial instruments and,
    therefore, are carried at estimated fair value on the
    consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair values of such
    commitments were generally calculated by reference to quoted
    market prices for commitments to sell real estate loans to
    certain government-sponsored entities and other parties.

Interest
    rate swap agreements used for interest rate risk
    management

The estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements used
    for interest rate risk management represents the amount the
    Company would have expected to receive or pay to terminate such
    agreements.

Other
    commitments and contingencies

As described in note 20, in the normal course of business,
    various commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding,
    such as loan commitments, credit guarantees and letters of
    credit. The Company’s pricing of such financial instruments
    is based largely on credit quality and relationship, probability
    of

&

T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

funding and other requirements. Loan commitments often have
    fixed expiration dates and contain termination and other clauses
    which provide for relief from funding in the event of
    significant deterioration in the credit quality of the customer.
    The rates and terms of the Company’s loan commitments,
    credit guarantees and letters of credit are competitive with
    other financial institutions operating in markets served by the
    Company. The Company believes that the carrying amounts, which
    are included in other liabilities, are reasonable estimates of
    the fair value of these financial instruments.

The Company does not believe that the estimated information
    presented herein is representative of the earnings power or
    value of the Company. The preceding analysis, which is
    inherently limited in depicting fair value, also does not
    consider any value associated with existing customer
    relationships nor the ability of the Company to create value
    through loan origination, deposit gathering or fee generating
    activities.

Many of the estimates presented herein are based upon the use of
    highly subjective information and assumptions and, accordingly,
    the results may not be precise. Management believes that fair
    value estimates may not be comparable between financial
    institutions due to the wide range of permitted valuation
    techniques and numerous estimates which must be made.
    Furthermore, because the disclosed fair value amounts were
    estimated as of the balance sheet date, the amounts actually
    realized or paid upon maturity or settlement of the various
    financial instruments could be significantly different.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to
    customers, generally having fixed expiration dates or other
    termination clauses that may require payment of a fee. Standby
    and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments
    issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third
    party. Standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon
    the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of
    the underlying contract with the third party, whereas commercial
    letters of credit are issued to facilitate commerce and
    typically result in the commitment being funded when the
    underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and
    third party. The credit risk associated with commitments to
    extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit is
    essentially the same as that involved with extending loans to
    customers and is subject to normal credit policies. Collateral
    may be obtained based on management’s assessment of the
    customer’s creditworthiness.

Financial guarantees and indemnification contracts are
    oftentimes similar to standby letters of credit and include
    mandatory purchase agreements issued to ensure that customer
    obligations are fulfilled, recourse obligations associated with
    sold loans, and other guarantees of customer performance or
    compliance with designated rules and regulations. Included in
    financial guarantees and indemnification contracts are loan
    principal amounts sold with recourse in conjunction with the
    Company’s

involvement in the FNMA DUS program. Under this program, the
    Company’s maximum credit risk associated with loans sold
    with recourse at December 31, 2006 and 2005 totaled
    $939 million and $941 million, respectively. Those
    recourse amounts were approximately equal to one-third of each
    sold loan’s outstanding principal balance.

Since many loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and
    guarantees and indemnification contracts expire without being
    funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not
    necessarily indicative of future cash flows.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to
    hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of real estate loans
    held for sale. Such commitments are considered derivatives in
    accordance with SFAS No. 133 and along with
    commitments to originate real estate loans to be held for sale
    are generally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at
    estimated fair market value. However, in estimating that fair
    value for commitments to originate loans for sale, value
    ascribable to cash flows that will be realized in connection
    with loan servicing activities has not been included. Value
    ascribable to that portion of cash flows is recognized at the
    time the underlying mortgage loans are sold. Additional
    information about such derivative financial instruments is
    included in note 17.

The Company occupies certain banking offices and uses certain
    equipment under noncancellable operating lease agreements
    expiring at various dates over the next 32 years. Minimum
    lease payments under noncancellable operating leases are

21.

Segment
    information

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131,
    “Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
    Information,” reportable segments have been determined
    based upon the Company’s internal profitability reporting
    system, which is organized by strategic business units. Certain
    strategic business units have been combined for segment
    information reporting purposes where the nature of the products
    and services, the type of customer and the distribution of those
    products and services are similar. The reportable segments are
    Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary
    Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking.

The financial information of the Company’s segments has
    been compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in
    note 1 with certain exceptions. The more significant of
    these exceptions are described herein. The Company allocates
    interest income or interest expense using a methodology that



M

&

T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

charges users of funds (assets) interest expense and credits
    providers of funds (liabilities) with income based on the
    maturity, prepayment

and/or

repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities. The net
    effect of this allocation is recorded in the “All
    Other” category. A provision for credit losses is allocated
    to segments in an amount based largely on actual net charge-offs
    incurred by the segment during the period plus or minus an
    amount necessary to adjust the segment’s allowance for
    credit losses due to changes in loan balances. In contrast, the
    level of the consolidated provision for credit losses is
    determined using the methodologies described in note 1 to
    assess the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.
    Indirect fixed and variable expenses incurred by certain
    centralized support areas are allocated to segments based on
    actual usage (for example, volume measurements) and other
    criteria. Certain types of administrative expenses and bankwide
    expense accruals (including amortization of core deposit and
    other intangible assets associated with acquisitions of
    financial institutions) are generally not allocated to segments.
    Income taxes are allocated to segments based on the
    Company’s marginal statutory tax rate adjusted for any
    tax-exempt income or non-deductible expenses. Equity is
    allocated to the segments based on regulatory capital
    requirements and in proportion to an assessment of the inherent
    risks associated with the business of the segment (including
    interest, credit and operating risk).

The management accounting policies and processes utilized in
    compiling segment financial information are highly subjective
    and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative
    guidance similar to generally accepted accounting principles. As
    a result, reported segment results are not necessarily
    comparable with similar information reported by other financial
    institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or
    allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in
    reported segment financial data. Information about the
    Company’s segments is presented in the accompanying table.

(a)

Net interest income is the
    difference between actual taxable-equivalent interest earned on
    assets and interest paid on liabilities by a segment and a
    funding charge (credit) based on the Company’s internal
    funds transfer pricing methodology. Segments are charged a cost
    to fund any assets (e.g. loans) and are paid a funding credit
    for any funds provided (e.g. deposits). The taxable-equivalent
    adjustment aggregated $19,667,000 in 2006, $17,311,000 in 2005
    and $17,330,000 in 2004 and is eliminated in “All
    Other” net interest income and income tax expense
    (benefit).

The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit
    products and banking services to middle-market and large
    commercial customers, largely within the markets the Company
    serves. Among the services provided by this segment are
    commercial lending and leasing, letters of credit, deposit
    products and cash management services. The Commercial Real
    Estate segment provides credit

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

services which are secured by
    various types of multifamily residential and commercial real
    estate and deposit services to its customers. Activities of this
    segment include the origination, sales and servicing of
    commercial real estate loans. The Discretionary Portfolio
    segment includes securities, residential mortgage loans and
    other assets; short-term and long-term borrowed funds; brokered
    certificates of deposit and interest rate swap agreements
    related thereto; and offshore branch deposits. This segment also
    provides foreign exchange services to customers. The Residential
    Mortgage Banking segment originates and services residential
    mortgage loans for consumers and sells substantially all of
    those loans in the secondary market to investors or to bank
    subsidiaries of M&T. The segment periodically
    purchases servicing rights to loans that have been originated by
    other entities. This segment also originates and services loans
    to developers of residential real estate properties. Residential
    mortgage loans held for sale are included in the Residential
    Mortgage Banking segment. The Retail Banking segment offers a
    variety of services to consumers and small businesses through
    several delivery channels that include banking offices,
    automated teller machines, telephone banking and Internet
    banking. The “All Other” category includes other
    operating activities of the Company that are not directly
    attributable to the reported segments as determined in
    accordance with SFAS No. 131, the difference between
    the provision for credit losses and the calculated provision
    allocated to the reportable segments, goodwill and core deposit
    and other intangible assets resulting from acquisitions of
    financial institutions, the net impact of the Company’s
    internal funds transfer pricing methodology, eliminations of
    transactions between reportable segments, certain nonrecurring
    transactions, the residual effects of unallocated support
    systems and general and administrative expenses, and the impact
    of interest rate risk management strategies. The amount of
    intersegment activity eliminated in arriving at consolidated
    totals was included in the “All Other” category as
    follows:

Regulatory
    matters

Payment of dividends by
    M

&

T’s banking
    subsidiaries is restricted by various legal and regulatory
    limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to
    M

&

T are limited by the
    amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current year
    and the preceding two years. For purposes of this test, at
    December 31, 2006, approximately $108,084,000 was available
    for payment of dividends to
    M

&

T from banking
    subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval.

Banking regulations prohibit extensions of credit by the
    subsidiary banks to M

&

T
    unless appropriately secured by assets. Securities of affiliates
    are not eligible as collateral for this purpose.

The bank subsidiaries are required to maintain
    noninterest-earning reserves against certain deposit
    liabilities. During the maintenance periods that included
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, cash and due from banks
    included a daily average of $182,953,000 and $388,697,000,
    respectively, for such purpose.

Federal regulators have adopted capital adequacy guidelines for
    bank holding companies and banks. Failure to meet minimum
    capital requirements can result in certain mandatory, and
    possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that,
    if undertaken, could have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial statements. Under the capital adequacy
    guidelines, the so-called “Tier 1 capital” and
    “Total capital” as a percentage of risk-weighted
    assets and certain off-balance sheet financial instruments must
    be at least 4% and 8%, respectively. In addition to these
    risk-based measures, regulators also require banking
    institutions that meet certain qualitative criteria to maintain
    a minimum “leverage” ratio of “Tier 1
    capital” to average total assets, adjusted for goodwill and
    certain other items, of at least 3% to be

T

Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)

considered adequately capitalized.
    As of December 31, 2006, M&

T and each of its
    banking subsidiaries exceeded all applicable capital adequacy
    requirements. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the most
    recent notifications from federal regulators categorized each of
    M

&

T’s bank
    subsidiaries as “well capitalized” under the
    regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be
    considered “well capitalized,” a banking institution
    must maintain Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based
    capital and leverage ratios of at least 6%, 10% and 5%,
    respectively. Management is unaware of any conditions or events
    since the latest notifications from federal regulators that have
    changed the capital adequacy category of
    M

&

T’s bank
    subsidiaries.

Relationship
    of
    M

&

T
    and AIB

AIB received 26,700,000 shares of
    M

&

T common stock on
    April 1, 2003 as a result of
    M

&

T’s acquisition
    of a subsidiary of AIB on that date. Those shares of common
    stock owned by AIB represented 24.2% of the issued and
    outstanding shares of
    M

&

T common stock on
    December 31, 2006. While AIB maintains a significant
    ownership in M

&

T, the
    Agreement and Plan of Reorganization between
    M

&

T and AIB
    (“Reorganization Agreement”) includes several
    provisions related to the corporate governance of
    M

&

T that provide AIB
    with representation on the
    M

&

T and
    M

&

T Bank boards of
    directors and key board committees and certain protections of
    its rights as a substantial
    M

&

T shareholder. In
    addition, AIB has rights that will facilitate its ability to
    maintain its proportionate ownership position in
    M

&

T.

With respect to AIB’s right to have representation on the
    M

&

T and
    M

&

T Bank boards of
    directors and key board committees, for as long as AIB holds at
    least 15% of M

&

T’s
    outstanding common stock, AIB is entitled to designate four
    individuals, reasonably acceptable to
    M

&

T, on both the
    M

&

T and
    M

&

T Bank boards of
    directors. In addition, one of the AIB designees to the
    M

&

T board of directors
    will serve on each of the Executive; Nomination, Compensation
    and Governance; and Audit and Risk committees. Also, as long as
    AIB holds at least 15% of
    M

&

T’s outstanding
    common stock, neither the
    M

&

T nor the
    M

&

T Bank board of
    directors may consist of more than 28 directors without the
    consent of the M

&

T
    directors designated by AIB. AIB will continue to enjoy these
    rights if its holdings of
    M

&

T common stock drop
    below 15%, but not below 12%, so long as AIB restores its
    ownership percentage to 15% within one year. In the event that
    AIB holds at least 10%, but less than 15%, of
    M

&

T’s outstanding
    common stock, AIB will be entitled to designate at least two
    individuals on both the
    M

&

T and
    M

&

T Bank boards of
    directors and, in the event that AIB holds at least 5%, but less
    than 10%, of M

&

T’s
    outstanding common stock, AIB will be entitled to designate one
    individual on both the
    M

&

T and
    M

&

T Bank boards of
    directors. M

&

T also has
    the right to appoint one representative to the AIB board while
    AIB remains a significant shareholder.

There are several other corporate governance provisions that
    serve to protect AIB’s rights as a substantial
    M

&

T shareholder and are
    embodied in M

&

T’s
    certificate of incorporation and bylaws. These protections
    include an effective consent right in connection with certain
    actions by M

&

T, such as
    amending M

&

T’s
    certificate of incorporation or bylaws in a manner inconsistent
    with AIB’s rights, engaging in activities not permissible
    for a bank holding company or adopting any shareholder rights
    plan or other measures intended to prevent or delay any
    transaction involving a change in control of
    M

&

T. AIB has the right
    to limit, with the agreement of at least one non-AIB designee on
    the M

&

T board of
    directors, other actions by
    M

&

T, such as reducing
    M

&

T’s cash
    dividend policy such that the ratio of cash dividends to net
    income is less than 15%, acquisitions and dispositions of
    significant amounts of assets, and the appointment or election
    of the chairman of the board of directors or the chief executive
    officer of M

&

T. The
    protective provisions described above will cease to be
    applicable when AIB no longer owns at least 15% of
    M

&

T’s outstanding
    common stock, calculated as described in the Reorganization
    Agreement.
