Item 1.

Business.

M&T Bank Corporation (“Registrant” or
    “M&T”) is a New York business corporation which
    is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding
    Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”) and under

Article III-A

of the New York Banking Law (“Banking Law”). The
    principal executive offices of the Registrant are located at One
    M&T Plaza, Buffalo, New York 14203. The Registrant was
    incorporated in November 1969. The Registrant and its direct and
    indirect subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the
    “Company.” As of December 31, 2010 the Company
    had consolidated total assets of $68.0 billion, deposits of
    $49.8 billion and shareholders’ equity of
    $8.4 billion. The Company had 12,031 full-time and
    1,334 part-time employees as of December 31, 2010.

At December 31, 2010, the Registrant had two wholly owned
    bank subsidiaries: M&T Bank and M&T Bank, National
    Association (“M&T Bank, N.A.”). The banks
    collectively offer a wide range of commercial banking, trust and
    investment services to their customers. At December 31,
    2010, M&T Bank represented 99% of consolidated assets of
    the Company.

The Company from time to time considers acquiring banks, thrift
    institutions, branch offices of banks or thrift institutions, or
    other businesses within markets currently served by the Company
    or in other locations that would complement the Company’s
    business or its geographic reach. The Company has pursued
    acquisition opportunities in the past, continues to review
    different opportunities, including the possibility of major
    acquisitions, and intends to continue this practice.

Relationship
    with Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c.

On April 1, 2003, M&T completed the acquisition of
    Allfirst Financial Inc. (“Allfirst”), a bank holding
    company headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland from Allied Irish
    Banks, p.l.c. (“AIB”). Under the terms of the
    Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated September 26,
    2002 by and among AIB, Allfirst and M&T, M&T combined
    with Allfirst through the acquisition of all of the issued and
    outstanding Allfirst stock in exchange for
    26,700,000 shares of M&T common stock and $886,107,000
    in cash paid to AIB. Those shares of common stock owned by AIB
    represented 22.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of
    M&T common stock on September 30, 2010. In an effort
    to raise its capital position to meet new Irish
    government-mandated capital requirements, on November 4,
    2010 AIB sold those 26,700,000 shares. As a result, the
    provisions of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization between
    M&T and AIB, which included several provisions related to
    AIB’s rights as a substantial shareholder in the corporate
    governance of M&T, became inoperative.

Segment
    Information, Principal Products/Services and Foreign
    Operations

Information about the Registrant’s business segments is
    included in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements filed
    herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data” and is further discussed
    in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.” The Registrant’s reportable segments have
    been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting
    system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain
    strategic business units have been combined for segment
    information reporting purposes where the nature of the products
    and services, the type of customer and the distribution of those
    products and services are similar. The reportable segments are
    Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate,
    Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail
    Banking. The Company’s international activities are
    discussed in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements filed

    Statements and Supplementary Data.”

The only activities that, as a class, contributed 10% or more of
    the sum of consolidated interest income and other income in any
    of the last three years were interest on loans and investment
    securities and fees for providing deposit account services. The
    amount of income from such sources during those years is set
    forth on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income
    filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Supervision
    and Regulation of the Company

M&T and its subsidiaries are subject to the extensive
    regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and
    their subsidiaries. Regulation of financial institutions such as
    M&T and its subsidiaries is intended primarily for the
    protection of depositors, the FDIC’s DIF and the banking
    system as a whole, and generally is not intended for the
    protection of stockholders, creditors or other investors.
    Described below are the material elements of selected laws and
    regulations applicable to M&T and its subsidiaries. The
    descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified
    in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes
    and regulations described. Changes in applicable law or
    regulation, and in their application by regulatory agencies,
    cannot be predicted, but they may have a material effect on the
    business and results of M&T and its subsidiaries.

Overview

M&T is registered with the Board of Governors of the
    Federal Reserve Board System (the “Federal Reserve
    Board”) as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding
    Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”). As such,
    M&T and its subsidiaries are subject to the supervision,
    examination and reporting requirements of the BHCA and the
    regulations of the Federal Reserve Board.

In general, the BHCA limits the business of bank holding
    companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other
    activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be
    so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident
    thereto. In addition, bank holding companies that qualify and
    elect to be financial holding companies may engage in any
    activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged
    in any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or
    incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the
    Federal Reserve Board in consultation with the Secretary of the
    Treasury)



or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and does not
    pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of
    depository institutions or the financial system generally (as
    solely determined by the Federal Reserve Board), without prior
    approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Activities that are
    financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing,
    insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments.

In order to qualify and register with the Federal Reserve Board
    as a financial holding company, a bank holding company must
    demonstrate that each of its bank subsidiaries is “well
    capitalized,” “well managed,” and has at least a
    “satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment
    Act of 1977 (“CRA”). Beginning in July 2011, a bank
    holding company’s eligibility to elect financial holding
    company status will also depend upon the holding company being
    well-capitalized and well-managed. M&T filed a declaration
    to elect to become a financial holding company on
    January 26, 2011.

The financial activities authorized by the BHCA may also be
    engaged in by a “financial subsidiary” of a national
    or state bank, except for insurance or annuity underwriting,
    insurance company portfolio investments, real estate investment
    and development, and merchant banking, which must be conducted
    in a financial holding company. In order for these financial
    activities to be engaged in by a financial subsidiary of a
    national or state bank, federal law requires each of the parent
    bank (and its sister-bank affiliates) to be well capitalized and
    well managed; the aggregate consolidated assets of all of that
    bank’s financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of
    45% of its consolidated total assets or $50 billion; the
    bank must have at least a satisfactory CRA rating; and, if that
    bank is one of the 100 largest national banks, it must meet
    certain financial rating or other comparable requirements.
    M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. have not elected to engage
    in financial activities through financial subsidiaries. Current
    federal law also establishes a system of functional regulation
    under which the federal banking agencies will regulate the
    banking activities of financial holding companies and
    banks’ financial subsidiaries, the U.S. Securities and
    Exchange Commission will regulate their securities activities,
    and state insurance regulators will regulate their insurance
    activities. Rules developed by the federal financial
    institutions regulators under these laws require disclosure of
    privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow
    consumers to prevent the disclosure of certain personal
    information to nonaffiliated third parties.

Recent
    Developments

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
    (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), which was enacted in July
    2010, significantly restructures the financial regulatory regime
    in the United States, including through the creation of a new
    resolution authority, mandating higher capital and liquidity
    requirements, requiring banks to pay increased fees to
    regulatory agencies, and through numerous other provisions aimed
    at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services
    sector. The Dodd-Frank Act also creates a new systemic risk
    oversight body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council
    (“FSOC”). The FSOC will oversee and coordinate the
    efforts of the primary U.S. financial regulatory agencies
    (including the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the SEC) in
    establishing regulations to address financial stability
    concerns. The Dodd-Frank Act directs the FSOC to make
    recommendations to the Federal Reserve Board regarding
    supervisory requirements and prudential standards applicable to
    systemically important financial institutions which, based upon
    the proposed rule issued on February 8, 2011, is expected
    to include M&T, including capital, leverage, liquidity and
    risk-management requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates that
    the requirements applicable to systemically important financial
    institutions be more stringent than those applicable to other
    financial companies.

In addition to the framework for systemic risk oversight
    implemented through the FSOC, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes
    heightened prudential requirements on bank holding companies
    with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets,
    such as M&T, and requires the Federal Reserve Board to
    establish prudential standards for such large bank holding
    companies that are more stringent than those applicable to other
    bank holding companies, including standards for risk-based
    capital requirements and leverage limits, liquidity,
    risk-management requirements, resolution plan and credit
    exposure reporting, and concentration. The Federal Reserve Board
    has discretionary authority to establish additional prudential
    standards, on its own or at the FSOC’s recommendation,
    regarding contingent capital, enhanced public disclosures,
    short-term debt limits, and otherwise as it deems appropriate.
    The Dodd-Frank Act also



requires the Federal Reserve Board to conduct annual analyses of
    such bank holding companies to evaluate whether the companies
    have sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis necessary
    to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions.

Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act provides for the creation of
    the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”),
    a new consumer financial services regulator. The CFPB is
    directed to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices and
    ensure that all consumers have access to markets for consumer
    financial products and services, and that such markets are fair,
    transparent and competitive. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB
    authority to enforce and issue rules and regulations
    implementing existing consumer protection laws and
    responsibility for all such existing regulations. Depository
    institutions with assets exceeding $10 billion, such as
    M&T Bank, their affiliates, and other “larger
    participants” in the markets for consumer financial
    services (as determined by the CFPB) will be subject to direct
    supervision by the CFPB, including any applicable examination,
    enforcement and reporting requirements the CFPB may establish.

New laws or regulations or changes to existing laws and
    regulations (including changes in interpretation or enforcement)
    could materially adversely affect M&T’s financial
    condition or results of operations. As discussed further
    throughout this section, many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are
    subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several
    years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial
    impact on M&T and its subsidiaries or the financial
    services industry generally. In addition to the discussion in
    this section, see “Recent Legislative Developments” in
    Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations” for a discussion of the potential impact
    legislative and regulatory reforms may have on our results of
    operations and financial condition.

Dividends

The Registrant is a legal entity separate and distinct from its
    banking and other subsidiaries. Historically, the majority of
    the Registrant’s revenue has been from dividends paid to
    the Registrant by its subsidiary banks. M&T Bank and
    M&T Bank, N.A. are subject, under one or more of the
    banking laws, to restrictions on the amount of dividend
    declarations. Future dividend payments to the Registrant by its
    subsidiary banks will be dependent on a number of factors,
    including the earnings and financial condition of each such
    bank, and are subject to the limitations referred to in
    note 23 of Notes to Financial Statements filed herewith in
    Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data,” and to other statutory powers of bank
    regulatory agencies.

An insured depository institution is prohibited from making any
    capital distribution to its owner, including any dividend, if,
    after making such distribution, the depository institution fails
    to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital
    measure, including the risk-based capital adequacy and leverage
    standards discussed herein.

As described herein under the heading “U.S. Treasury
    Capital Purchase Program”, in connection with the issuance
    of Series A Preferred Stock to the U.S. Department of
    the Treasury (“U.S. Treasury”), M&T is
    restricted from increasing its common stock dividend.

Supervision
    and Regulation of M&T Bank’s Subsidiaries

M&T Bank has a number of subsidiaries. These subsidiaries
    are subject to the laws and regulations of both the federal
    government and the various states in which they conduct
    business. For example, M&T Securities is regulated by the
    Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry
    Regulatory Authority and state securities regulators.

Capital
    Requirements

M&T and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with
    the applicable capital adequacy standards established by the
    Federal Reserve Board. There are two basic measures of capital
    adequacy for bank holding companies that have been promulgated
    by the Federal Reserve Board: a risk-based measure and a
    leverage measure.

Risk-based Capital Standards.

The risk-based
    capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital
    requirements more sensitive to differences in credit and market
    risk profiles among banks and



financial holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet
    exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid
    assets. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad
    risk categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting
    capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total
    risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items.

The minimum guideline for the ratio of total capital
    (“Total Capital”) to risk-weighted assets (including
    certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of
    credit) is 8.0%. At least half of the Total Capital must be
    “Tier 1 Capital,” which currently consists of
    qualifying common equity, qualifying noncumulative perpetual
    preferred stock (including related surplus), senior perpetual
    preferred stock issued to the U.S. Department of the
    Treasury (the “U.S. Treasury”) as part of the
    Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program (the
    “CPP”), minority interests relating to qualifying
    common or noncumulative perpetual preferred stock issued by a
    consolidated U.S. depository institution or foreign bank
    subsidiary, and certain “restricted core capital
    elements,” as discussed below, less goodwill and certain
    other intangible assets. Currently, “Tier 2
    Capital” may consist of, among other things, qualifying
    subordinated debt, mandatorily convertible debt securities,
    preferred stock and trust preferred securities not included in
    the definition of Tier 1 Capital, and a limited amount of
    the allowance for loan losses. Non-cumulative perpetual
    preferred stock, trust preferred securities and other so-called
    “restricted core capital elements” are currently
    limited to 25% of Tier 1 Capital. Pursuant to the
    Dodd-Frank Act, trust preferred securities will be phased-out of
    the definition of Tier 1 Capital of bank holding companies
    having consolidated assets exceeding $500 million, such as
    M&T, over a three-year period beginning in January 2013.

The minimum guideline to be considered well-capitalized for
    Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital is 6.0% and 10.0%,
    respectively. At December 31, 2010, the Registrant’s
    consolidated Tier 1 Capital ratio was 9.47% and its Total
    Capital ratio was 13.08%. The elements currently comprising
    Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital and the minimum
    Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios may in the future
    be subject to change, as discussed in greater detail below.

Basel I and II Standards.

M&T
    currently calculates its risk-based capital ratios under
    guidelines adopted by the Federal Reserve Board based on the
    1988 Capital Accord (“Basel I”) of the Basel Committee
    on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”). In
    2004, the Basel Committee published a new set of risk-based
    capital standards (“Basel II”) in order to update
    Basel I. Basel II provides two approaches for setting
    capital standards for credit risk — an internal
    ratings-based approach tailored to individual institutions’
    circumstances and a standardized approach that bases
    risk-weighting on external credit assessments to a much greater
    extent than permitted in the existing risk-based capital
    guidelines. Basel II also would set capital requirements
    for operational risk and refine the existing capital
    requirements for market risk exposures. A definitive final rule
    for implementing the advanced approaches of Basel II in the
    United States, which applies only to internationally active
    banking organizations, or “core banks” (defined as
    those with consolidated total assets of $250 billion or
    more or consolidated on-balance sheet foreign exposures of
    $10 billion or more) became effective on April 1,
    2008. Other U.S. banking organizations may elect to adopt
    the requirements of this rule (if they meet applicable
    qualification requirements), but are not required to comply. The
    rule also allows a banking organization’s primary federal
    supervisor to determine that application of the rule would not
    be appropriate in light of the bank’s asset size, level of
    complexity, risk profile or scope of operations. Neither
    M&T Bank nor M&T Bank, N.A. is currently required to
    comply with Basel II.

In July 2008, the U.S. bank regulatory agencies issued a
    proposed rule that would provide banking organizations that do
    not use the advanced approaches with the option to implement a
    new risk-based capital framework. This framework would adopt the
    standardized approach of Basel II for credit risk, the
    basic indicator approach of Basel II for operational risk,
    and related disclosure requirements. While this proposed rule
    generally parallels the relevant approaches under Basel II, it
    diverges where United States markets have unique characteristics
    and risk profiles, most notably with respect to risk weighting
    residential mortgage exposures. The proposed rule, if adopted,
    would replace the agencies’ earlier proposed amendments to
    existing risk-based capital guidelines to make them more risk
    sensitive (formerly referred to as the “Basel I-A”
    approach).



Leverage Requirements.

Neither Basel I nor
    Basel II includes a leverage requirement as an
    international standard, however, the Federal Reserve Board has
    established minimum leverage ratio guidelines to be considered
    well-capitalized for bank holding companies. These guidelines
    provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to average
    total assets, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets
    (the “Leverage Ratio”), of 3.0% for bank holding
    companies that meet certain specified criteria, including having
    the highest regulatory rating. All other bank holding companies
    generally are required to maintain a Leverage Ratio of at least
    4%. M&T’s Leverage Ratio at December 31, 2010 was
    9.33%.

The guidelines also provide that bank holding companies
    experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be
    expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially
    above the minimum supervisory levels without significant
    reliance on intangible assets. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve
    Board has indicated that it will consider a “tangible
    Tier 1 Capital leverage ratio” (deducting all
    intangibles) and other indicators of capital strength in
    evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities.

Basel III Standards.

In December 2010,
    the Basel Committee released its final framework for
    strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation,
    now officially identified by the Basel Committee as “Basel
    III.” Basel III, when implemented by the U.S. bank
    regulatory agencies and fully phased-in, will require bank
    holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain
    substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common
    equity. The Basel III final capital framework, among other
    things:

•

introduces as a new capital measure “Common Equity
    Tier 1”

,

or “CET1”, specifies that
    Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional
    Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified
    requirements, defines CET1 narrowly by requiring that most
    deductions or adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made
    to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and expands
    the scope of the deductions or adjustments as compared to
    existing regulations;

•

when fully phased in on January 1, 2019, requires banks to
    maintain:

•

as a newly adopted international standard, a minimum ratio of
    CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5%
    “capital conservation buffer” (which is added to the
    4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively
    resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of
    at least 7%);

•

a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets
    of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is
    added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is
    phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1
    capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation);

•

a minimum ratio of Total (that is, Tier 1 plus
    Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least
    8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to
    the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in,
    effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%
    upon full implementation);

•

as a newly adopted international standard, a minimum leverage
    ratio of 3%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to
    balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures
    (as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the
    quarter); and

•

provides for a “countercyclical capital buffer”,
    generally to be imposed when national regulators determine that
    excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup
    of systemic risk, that would be a CET1 add-on to the capital
    conservation buffer in the range of 0% to 2.5% when fully
    implemented (potentially resulting in total buffers of between
    2.5% and 5%).

The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses
    during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a
    ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but
    below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital
    conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the
    latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity
    repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the
    shortfall.

The implementation of the Basel III final framework will
    commence January 1, 2013. On that date, banking
    institutions will be required to meet the following minimum
    capital ratios before the application of any buffer:

•

3.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;

•

4.5% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; and

•

8.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets.



The Basel III final framework provides for a number of new
    deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for
    example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights,
    deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and
    significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities
    be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category
    exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate
    exceed 15% of CET1.

Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1
    will begin on January 1, 2014 and will be phased-in over a
    five-year period (20% per year). The implementation of the
    capital conservation buffer will begin on January 1, 2016
    at 0.625% and be phased in over a four-year period (increasing
    by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it
    reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).

The U.S. banking agencies have indicated informally that
    they expect to propose regulations implementing Basel III
    in mid-2011 with final adoption of implementing regulations in
    mid-2012. Notwithstanding its release of the Basel III
    framework as a final framework, the Basel Committee is
    considering further amendments to Basel III, including the
    imposition of additional capital surcharges on globally
    systemically important financial institutions. In addition to
    Basel III, the Dodd-Frank Act requires or permits the Federal
    banking agencies to adopt regulations affecting banking
    institutions’ capital requirements in a number of respects,
    including potentially more stringent capital requirements for
    systemically important financial institutions. Accordingly, the
    regulations ultimately applicable to M&T may be
    substantially different from the Basel III final framework
    as published in December 2010.

Liquidity Ratios under Basel
    III.

Historically, regulation and monitoring of
    bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a
    supervisory matter, both in the U.S. and internationally,
    without required formulaic measures. The Basel III final
    framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure
    their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although
    similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically
    applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory
    purposes, going forward will be required by regulation. One
    test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio
    (“LCR”), is designed to ensure that the banking entity
    maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid
    assets equal to the entity’s expected net cash outflow for
    a

30-day

time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash
    outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other,
    referred to as the net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”),
    is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the
    assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time
    horizon. These requirements will incent banking entities to
    increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and
    other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the
    use of long-term debt as a funding source. The LCR would be
    implemented subject to an observation period beginning in 2011,
    but would not be introduced as a requirement until
    January 1, 2015, and the NSFR would not be introduced as a
    requirement until January 1, 2018. These new standards are
    subject to further rulemaking and their terms may well change
    before implementation.

Capital Requirements of Subsidiary Depository
    Institutions.

M&T Bank and M&T Bank,
    N.A. are subject to substantially similar capital requirements
    as those applicable to M&T. As of December 31, 2010,
    both M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. were in compliance
    with applicable minimum capital requirements. None of M&T,
    M&T Bank or M&T Bank, N.A. has been advised by any
    federal banking agency of any specific minimum capital ratio
    requirement applicable to it as of December 31, 2010.
    Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a
    variety of enforcement remedies, including the termination of
    deposit insurance by the FDIC, and to certain restrictions on
    its business. See “Regulatory Remedies under the FDIA”
    below.

Given that the Basel III rules are subject to change and
    the scope and content of capital regulations that
    U.S. federal banking agencies may adopt under the
    Dodd-Frank Act is uncertain, M&T cannot be certain of the
    impact new capital regulations will have on its capital ratios
    or those of its bank subsidiaries.

Safety
    and Soundness Standards

Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies
    pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the
    “FDIA”), establish general standards relating to
    internal controls and information systems, internal audit
    systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate
    exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and benefits. In
    general, these guidelines require, among other things,



appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the
    risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. Additionally,
    the agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not
    require, an agency to order an institution that has been given
    notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety
    and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after
    being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable
    compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an
    acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order
    directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an
    order directing other actions of the types to which an
    undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt
    corrective action” provisions of the FDIA. See
    “Regulatory Remedies under the FDIA” below. If an
    institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may
    seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose
    civil money penalties.

Regulatory
    Remedies under the FDIA

The FDIA establishes a system of regulatory remedies to resolve
    the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The federal
    banking regulators have established five capital categories
    (“well-capitalized,” “adequately
    capitalized,” “undercapitalized,”
    “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically
    undercapitalized”) and must take certain mandatory
    supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other
    discretionary actions, with respect to institutions which are
    undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically
    undercapitalized. The severity of these mandatory and
    discretionary supervisory actions depend upon the capital
    category in which the institution is placed. Generally, subject
    to a narrow exception, the FDIA requires the banking regulator
    to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is
    critically undercapitalized. The federal bank regulatory
    agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital
    levels for each category:

“Well-Capitalized”

“Adequately
    Capitalized”

Leverage Ratio of 5%,

Tier 1 Capital ratio of 6%,

Total Capital ratio of 10%, and

Not subject to a written agreement, order, capital

directive or regulatory remedy directive requiring

a specific capital level.

Leverage Ratio of 4%,

Tier 1 Capital ratio of 4%, and

Total Capital ratio of 8%.

“Undercapitalized”

“Significantly Undercapitalized”

Leverage Ratio less than 4%,

Tier 1 Capital ratio less than 4%, or

Total Capital ratio less than 8%.

Leverage Ratio less than 3%,

Tier 1 Capital ratio less than 3%, or

Total Capital ratio less than 6%.

“Critically undercapitalized”

Tangible equity to total assets less than 2%.

For purposes of these regulations, the term “tangible
    equity” includes core capital elements counted as
    Tier 1 Capital for purposes of the risk-based capital
    standards plus the amount of outstanding cumulative perpetual
    preferred stock (including related surplus), minus all
    intangible assets with certain exceptions. An institution that
    is classified as well-capitalized based on its capital levels
    may be classified as adequately capitalized, and an institution
    that is adequately capitalized or undercapitalized based upon
    its capital levels may be treated as though it were
    undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized,
    respectively, if the appropriate federal banking agency, after
    notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or
    unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such
    treatment.

An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized,
    significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is
    required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its
    appropriate federal banking regulator. Under the FDIA, in order
    for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the
    appropriate federal banking agency, a bank holding company must
    guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution will comply
    with its capital restoration plan, subject to certain
    limitations. The bank holding company must also provide
    appropriate assurances of performance. The obligation of a
    controlling bank holding company under the FDIA to fund a
    capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of 5.0% of an



undercapitalized subsidiary’s assets or the amount required
    to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized
    institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its
    average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any
    branches or engaging in any new line of business, except in
    accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the
    approval of the FDIC. Institutions that are significantly
    undercapitalized or undercapitalized and either fail to submit
    an acceptable capital restoration plan or fail to implement an
    approved capital restoration plan may be subject to a number of
    requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell
    sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized,
    requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of
    deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized
    depository institutions failing to submit or implement an
    acceptable capital restoration plan are subject to appointment
    of a receiver or conservator.

Support
    of Subsidiary Banks

Under longstanding Federal Reserve Board policy which has been
    codified by the Dodd-Frank Act, M&T is expected to act as a
    source of financial strength to, and to commit resources to
    support, its subsidiary banks. This support may be required at
    times when M&T may not be inclined to provide it. In
    addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to a
    subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits
    and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In
    the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any
    commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank
    regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank
    will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a
    priority of payment.

Cross-Guarantee
    Provisions

Each insured depository institution “controlled” (as
    defined in the BHCA) by the same bank holding company can be
    held liable to the FDIC for any loss incurred, or reasonably
    expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of any
    other insured depository institution controlled by that holding
    company and for any assistance provided by the FDIC to any of
    those banks that is in danger of default. The FDIC’s claim
    under the cross-guarantee provisions is superior to claims of
    shareholders of the insured depository institution or its
    holding company and to most claims arising out of obligations or
    liabilities owed to affiliates of the institution, but is
    subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and
    holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the
    commonly controlled insured depository institution. The FDIC may
    decline to enforce the cross-guarantee provisions if it
    determines that a waiver is in the best interest of the DIF.

Transactions
    with Affiliates

There are various legal restrictions on the extent to which
    M&T and its non-bank subsidiaries may borrow or otherwise
    obtain funding from M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. In
    general, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Board
    Act and Federal Reserve Board Regulation W require that any
    “covered transaction” by M&T Bank and M&T
    Bank, N.A. (or any of their respective subsidiaries) with an
    affiliate must be secured by designated amounts of specified
    collateral and must be limited to (a) in the case of any
    single such affiliate, the aggregate amount of covered
    transactions of the insured depository institution and its
    subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of the capital stock and surplus
    of such insured depository institution, and (b) in the case
    of all affiliates, the aggregate amount of covered transactions
    of an insured depository institution and its subsidiaries may
    not exceed 20% of the capital stock and surplus of such insured
    depository institution. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expands
    the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate
    transactions within a banking organization. For example,
    commencing in July 2011, the Dodd-Frank Act will require that
    the 10% of capital limit on covered transactions begin to apply
    to financial subsidiaries. “Covered transactions” are
    defined by statute to include, among other things, a loan or
    extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued
    by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted
    by the Federal Reserve Board) from the affiliate, the acceptance
    of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan,
    and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit
    on behalf of an affiliate. All covered transactions, including
    certain additional transactions (such as transactions with a
    third party in which an affiliate has a financial interest),
    must be conducted on market terms.



FDIC
    Insurance Assessments

Deposit Insurance Assessments.

M&T Bank
    and M&T Bank, N.A. pay deposit insurance premiums to the
    FDIC based on an assessment rate established by the FDIC. FDIC
    assessment rates generally depend upon a combination of
    regulatory ratings and financial ratios. Regulatory ratings
    reflect the applicable bank regulatory agency’s evaluation
    of the financial institution’s capital, asset quality,
    management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity (or
    “CAMELS” ratings) to risk. The assessment rate for
    large institutions with long-term debt issuer ratings, such as
    M&T Bank, are currently determined using a combination of
    the institutions weighted-average regulatory ratings, its
    long-term debt issuer ratings and the institution’s
    financial ratios, each equally weighted. Assessment rates for
    institutions that are in the lowest risk category currently vary
    from seven to twenty-four basis points per $100 of insured
    deposits, and may be increased or decreased by the FDIC on a
    semi-annual basis. Such base assessment rates are subject to
    adjustments based upon the institution’s ratio of
    (i) long-term unsecured debt to its domestic deposits,
    (ii) secured liabilities to domestic deposits and
    (iii) brokered deposits to domestic deposits (if greater
    than 10%).

In February 2011, the FDIC adopted a final rule (the “New
    Assessment Rule”) that changes the deposit insurance
    assessment system for large institutions. The New Assessment
    Rule creates a two scorecard system for large institutions, one
    for most large institutions that have more than $10 billion
    in assets, such as M&T Bank, and another for “highly
    complex” institutions that have over $50 billion in
    assets and are fully owned by a parent with over
    $500 billion in assets. Each scorecard will have a
    performance score and a loss-severity score that will be
    combined to produce a total score, which will be translated into
    an initial assessment rate. In calculating these scores, the
    FDIC will continue to utilize CAMELS ratings and will introduce
    certain new forward-looking financial measures to assess an
    institution’s ability to withstand asset-related stress and
    funding-related stress. The New Assessment Rule also eliminates
    the use of risk categories and long-term debt issuer ratings for
    calculating  risk-based assessments for institutions having more
    than $10 billion in assets. The FDIC will continue to have
    the ability under the New Assessment Rule to make discretionary
    adjustments to the total score, up or down, based upon
    significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the
    scorecard. The total score will then translate to an initial
    base assessment rate on a non-linear, sharply-increasing scale.
    The New Assessment Rule preserves the adjustments to an
    institution’s base assessment rates based on its long-term
    unsecured debt and brokered deposits (if greater than 10%) and
    creates a new adjustment based on the institution’s
    holdings of long-term unsecured debt issued by a different
    insured depository institution. The New Assessment Rule
    eliminates the adjustment to an institution’s base
    assessment rate based on its secured liabilities. The final rule
    will be effective April 1, 2011.

M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A.’s deposit insurance
    assessments are currently based on the total domestic deposits
    held by such insured depository institution. The Dodd-Frank Act
    requires the FDIC to amend its regulations to base insurance
    assessments on the average consolidated assets less the average
    tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the
    assessment period. Under the New Assessment Rule, which
    implements these requirements effective April 1, 2011,
    assessments paid by M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. are
    expected to increase in 2011.

On November 17, 2009, the FDIC implemented a final rule
    requiring insured institutions, such as M&T Bank and
    M&T Bank, N.A., to prepay their estimated quarterly
    risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009, and for
    all of 2010, 2011 and 2012. Such prepaid assessments were paid
    on December 30, 2009, along with each institution’s
    quarterly risk-based deposit insurance assessment for the third
    quarter of 2009 (assuming 5% annual growth in deposits between
    the third quarter of 2009 and the end of 2012 and taking into
    account, for 2011 and 2012, the annualized three basis point
    increase discussed below). The remaining amount of prepaid
    insurance assessments at December 31, 2010 related to 2011
    and 2012 for M&T Bank was $178.5 million and for
    M&T Bank, N.A. was $2.5 million.

The FDIA establishes a minimum ratio of deposit insurance
    reserves to estimated insured deposits, the designated reserve
    ratio (the “DRR”), of 1.15% prior to September 2020
    and 1.35% thereafter. On December 20, 2010, the FDIC issued
    a final rule setting the DRR at 2%. Because the DRR fell below
    1.15% as of June 30, 2008, and was expected to remain below
    1.15% the FDIC was required to establish and implement a
    Restoration Plan that would restore the reserve ratio to at
    least 1.15% within five years. In October 2008, the FDIC adopted
    such a restoration plan (the “Restoration Plan”). In
    February 2009,



in light of the extraordinary challenges facing the banking
    industry, the FDIC amended the Restoration Plan to allow seven
    years for the reserve ratio to return to 1.15%. In May 2009, the
    FDIC adopted a final rule that imposed a five basis point
    special assessment on each institution’s assets minus
    Tier 1 Capital (as of June 30, 2009). Such special
    assessment was collected on September 30, 2009. In October
    2009, the FDIC passed a final rule extending the term of the
    Restoration Plan to eight years. Such final rule also included a
    provision that implements a uniform three basis point increase
    in assessment rates, effective January 1, 2011, to help
    ensure that the reserve ratio returns to at least 1.15% within
    the eight year period called for by the Restoration Plan. In
    October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new restoration plan to ensure
    the DRR reaches 1.35% by September 2020. As part of the revised
    plan, the FDIC will forego the uniform three-basis point
    increase in assessment rates scheduled to take place in January
    2011. The FDIC will, at least semi-annually, update its income
    and loss projections for the DIF and, if necessary, propose
    rules to further increase assessment rates. In addition, on
    January 12, 2010, the FDIC announced that it would seek
    public comment on whether banks with compensation plans that
    encourage risky behavior should be charged higher deposit
    assessment rates than such banks would otherwise be charged. See
    also “Executive and Incentive Compensation” below. It
    cannot predicted whether, as a result of an adverse change in
    economic conditions or other reasons, the FDIC will in the
    future further increase deposit insurance assessment levels.

Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the
    FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe
    and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to
    continue operations, or has violated any applicable law,
    regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.

FICO Assessments.

In addition, the Deposit
    Insurance Funds Act of 1996 authorized the Financing Corporation
    (“FICO”) to impose assessments on DIF applicable
    deposits in order to service the interest on FICO’s bond
    obligations from deposit insurance fund assessments. The amount
    assessed on individual institutions by FICO is in addition to
    the amount, if any, paid for deposit insurance according to the
    FDIC’s risk-related assessment rate schedules. FICO
    assessment rates may be adjusted quarterly to reflect a change
    in assessment base. M&T Bank recognized $5 million of
    expense related to its FICO assessments and M&T Bank, N.A.
    recognized $57 thousand of such expense in 2010.

Acquisitions

The BHCA requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior
    approval of the Federal Reserve Board before: (1) it may
    acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting
    shares of any bank or savings and loan association, if after
    such acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or
    indirectly own or control 5% or more of the voting shares of the
    institution; (2) it or any of its subsidiaries, other than
    a bank, may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of
    any bank or savings and loan association; or (3) it may
    merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company.
    Effective July 2011, financial holding companies and bank
    holding companies with consolidated assets exceeding
    $50 billion, such as M&T, must (i) obtain prior
    approval from the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring certain
    nonbank financial companies with assets exceeding
    $10 billion and (ii) provide prior written notice to
    the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring direct or indirect
    ownership or control of any voting shares of any company having
    consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. Bank holding
    companies seeking approval to complete an acquisition must be
    well-capitalized and well-managed effective July 2011.

The BHCA further provides that the Federal Reserve Board may not
    approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or would
    be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize
    or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section
    of the United States, or the effect of which may be
    substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a
    monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any other
    manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the
    anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly
    outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and
    needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve Board
    is also required to consider the financial and managerial
    resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and
    banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community
    to be served. Consideration of financial resources generally
    focuses on capital adequacy, and consideration of convenience
    and needs issues includes the parties’



performance under the CRA, both of which are discussed below. In
    addition, the Federal Reserve Board must take into account the
    institutions’ effectiveness in combating money laundering.

FDIC
    Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program

In October 2008, the FDIC announced the Temporary Liquidity
    Guarantee Program (“TLGP”), under which the FDIC would
    guarantee certain senior unsecured debt of FDIC-insured
    U.S. depository institutions and U.S. bank holding
    companies as well as non-interest bearing transaction account
    deposits at FDIC-insured U.S. depository institutions,
    unless such institutions opted out of the program. M&T
    participated in the Debt Guarantee Program through
    October 31, 2009. Although the guarantee of non-interest
    bearing transaction account deposits under the TLGP ended on
    June 30, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act extended this guarantee
    to all insured institutions, regardless of participation in the
    TLGP, until January 1, 2013.

U.S.
    Treasury Capital Purchase Program

Pursuant to the CPP, on December 23, 2008, M&T issued
    and sold to the U.S. Treasury in a private offering
    (i) $600 million of Series A Preferred Stock and
    (ii) a warrant to purchase 1,218,522 shares of
    M&T Common Stock at an exercise price of $73.86 per share,
    subject to certain anti-dilution and other adjustments. M&T
    elected to participate in the capital purchase program at an
    amount equal to approximately 1% of its risk-weighted assets at
    the time. In connection with its acquisition of Provident on
    May 23, 2009, M&T issued $152 million of
    Series C Preferred Stock in exchange for the securities
    issued by Provident to the U.S. Treasury on
    November 14, 2008, and assumed a warrant issued by
    Provident to the U.S. Treasury, which, on a converted
    basis, provides for the purchase of 407,542 shares of
    M&T Common Stock at $55.76 per share.

The securities purchase agreement, dated December 23, 2008,
    pursuant to which the securities issued to the
    U.S. Treasury under the CPP were sold, limits the payment
    of quarterly dividends on M&T’s common stock to $0.70
    per share without prior approval of the U.S. Treasury,
    limits M&T’s ability to repurchase shares of its
    common stock (with certain exceptions, including the repurchase
    of our common stock to offset share dilution from equity-based
    compensation awards), grants the holders of the Series A
    Preferred Stock, the Warrant and the common stock of M&T to
    be issued under the warrant certain registration rights, and
    subjects M&T to certain of the executive compensation
    limitations included in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act
    of 2008 (“EESA”), as amended by the American Recovery
    and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”), described below
    under “Executive and Incentive Compensation”. The
    securities purchase agreement between Provident and the
    U.S. Treasury, to which M&T succeeded, has the same
    limitations and effects.

Depositor
    Preference

Under federal law, depositors and certain claims for
    administrative expenses and employee compensation against an
    insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over
    other general unsecured claims against such an institution in
    the “liquidation or other resolution” of such an
    institution by any receiver. If an insured depository
    institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with
    the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured,
    non-deposit creditors, including depositors whose deposits are
    payable only outside of the United States and the parent bank
    holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they
    have made to such insured depository institution.

Executive
    and Incentive Compensation

ARRA, an economic stimulus package signed into law on
    February 17, 2009, significantly expanded the restrictions
    on executive compensation that were included in Section 111
    of EESA and imposed various corporate governance standards on
    recipients of TARP funds, including under the
    U.S. Treasury’s capital purchase program, until such
    funds are repaid. On June 10, 2009, the U.S. Treasury
    issued the TARP Interim Final Rule to clarify and provide
    additional guidance with respect to the restrictions on
    executive compensation that apply to executives and certain
    other employees of TARP recipients that includes: (i) a
    prohibition on paying bonuses, retention awards and incentive
    compensation, other than long-term restricted stock or pursuant
    to certain preexisting employment contracts, to its Senior
    Executive Officers



(“SEOs”) and next 20 most highly-compensated
    employees; (ii) a prohibition on the payment of
    “golden parachute payments” to its SEOs and next five
    most highly compensated employees; (iii) a prohibition on
    paying incentive compensation for “unnecessary and
    excessive risks” and earnings manipulations; (iv) a
    requirement to clawback any bonus, retention award, or incentive
    compensation paid to a SEO and any of the next twenty most
    highly compensated employees based on statements of earnings,
    revenues, gains, or other criteria later found to be materially
    inaccurate; (v) a requirement to establish a policy on
    luxury or excessive expenditures, including entertainment or
    events, office and facility renovations, company owned aircraft
    and other transportation and similar activities or events;
    (vi) a requirement to provide shareholders with a
    non-binding advisory “say on pay” vote on executive
    compensation; (vii) a prohibition on deducting more than
    $500,000 in annual compensation or performance based
    compensation for the SEOs under Internal Revenue Code
    Section 162(m); (viii) a requirement that the
    compensation committee of the board of directors evaluate and
    review on a semi-annual basis the risks involved in employee
    compensation plans; and (ix) a requirement that the chief
    executive officer and chief financial officer provide written
    certifications of compliance with the foregoing requirements.

Guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies pursuant to
    the FDIA prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and
    unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the
    amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the
    services performed by an executive officer, employee, director
    or principal stockholder. In June 2010, the Federal Reserve
    Board issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation
    policies (the “Incentive Compensation Guidance”)
    intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of
    banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness
    of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The
    Incentive Compensation Guidance, which covers all employees that
    have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an
    organization, either individually or as part of a group, is
    based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s
    incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide
    incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the
    organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage
    risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls
    and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong
    corporate governance, including active and effective oversight
    by the organization’s board of directors. Any deficiencies
    in compensation practices that are identified may be
    incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings,
    which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform
    other actions. The Incentive Compensation Guidance provides that
    enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization
    if its incentive compensation arrangements or related
    risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to
    the organization’s safety and soundness and the
    organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to
    correct the deficiencies. In addition, on January 12, 2010,
    the FDIC announced that it would seek public comment on whether
    banks with compensation plans that encourage risky behavior
    should be charged higher deposit assessment rates than such
    banks would otherwise be charged.

The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators’
    policies on incentive compensation are continuing to develop and
    are likely to continue evolving in the near future. It cannot be
    determined at this time whether compliance with such policies
    will adversely affect the ability of M&T and its
    subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate their key employees.

Orderly
    Liquidation Authority

The Dodd-Frank Act creates the Orderly Liquidation Authority
    (“OLA”), a resolution regime for systemically
    important non-bank financial companies, including bank holding
    companies, under which the FDIC may be appointed receiver to
    liquidate such a company if the company is in danger of default
    and presents a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability.
    This determination must come after supermajority recommendations
    by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC and consultation
    between the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury and the
    President. This resolution authority is similar to the FDIC
    resolution model for depository institutions, with certain
    modifications to reflect differences between depository
    institutions and non-financial companies and to reduce
    disparities between the treatment of creditors’ claims
    under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and in an orderly
    liquidation authority proceeding compared to those that would
    exist under the resolution model for insured depository
    institutions.



An Orderly Liquidation Fund will fund OLA liquidation
    proceedings through borrowings from the Treasury Department and
    risk-based assessments made, first, on entities that received
    more in the resolution than they would have received in
    liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if
    necessary, on bank holding companies with total consolidated
    assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&T. If an
    orderly liquidation is triggered, M&T could face
    assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund.

Financial
    Privacy

The federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the
    ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose
    non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third
    parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy
    policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow
    consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information
    to a non-affiliated third party. These regulations affect how
    consumer information is transmitted through diversified
    financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In
    addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain
    information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used
    to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that
    shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income
    information from applications. Consumers also have the option to
    direct banks and other financial institutions not to share
    information about transactions and experiences with affiliated
    companies for the purpose of marketing products or services.

Consumer
    Protection Laws

In connection with their respective lending and leasing
    activities, M&T Bank, certain of its subsidiaries, and
    M&T Bank, N.A. are each subject to a number of federal and
    state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to
    various sectors of the economy. These laws include the Equal
    Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair
    and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Truth in Lending Act,
    the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Real Estate Settlement
    Procedures Act, and various state law counterparts.

In addition, federal law currently contains extensive customer
    privacy protection provisions. Under these provisions, a
    financial institution must provide to its customers, at the
    inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter,
    the institution’s policies and procedures regarding the
    handling of customers’ nonpublic personal financial
    information. These provisions also provide that, except for
    certain limited exceptions, a financial institution may not
    provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties
    unless the institution discloses to the customer that such
    information may be so provided and the customer is given the
    opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. Federal law makes it
    a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain
    or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature
    by fraudulent or deceptive means.

Effective July 1, 2010, a new federal banking rule under
    the Electronic Fund Transfer Act prohibits financial
    institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts
    on automated teller machines (“ATM”) and one-time
    debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in,
    to the overdraft service for those type of transactions. If a
    consumer does not opt in, any ATM transaction or debit that
    overdraws the consumer’s account will be denied. Overdrafts
    on the payment of checks and regular electronic bill payments
    are not covered by this new rule. Before opting in, the consumer
    must be provided a notice that explains the financial
    institution’s overdraft services, including the fees
    associated with the service, and the consumer’s choices.
    Financial institutions must provide consumers who do not opt in
    with the same account terms, conditions and features (including
    pricing) that they provide to consumers who do opt in.

Sarbanes-Oxley
    Act of 2002

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 implemented a broad range of
    corporate governance, accounting and reporting measures for
    companies that have securities registered under the Exchange
    Act, including publicly-held bank holding companies such as
    M&T. Specifically, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
    various regulations promulgated thereunder, established, among
    other things: (i) requirements for audit committees,
    including independence, expertise, and responsibilities;
    (ii) responsibilities regarding



financial statements for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer of the reporting company; (iii) the
    forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive-based compensation and
    profits from the sale of the reporting company’s securities
    by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in
    the twelve-month period following the initial publication of any
    financial statements that later require restatement;
    (iv) the creation of an independent accounting oversight
    board; (v) standards for auditors and regulation of audits,
    including independence provisions that restrict non-audit
    services that accountants may provide to their audit clients;
    (vi) disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting
    company and their directors and executive officers, including
    accelerated reporting of stock transactions and a prohibition on
    trading during pension blackout periods; (vii) a
    prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers, except
    certain loans made by insured financial institutions on
    nonpreferential terms and in compliance with other bank
    regulatory requirements; and (viii) a range of civil and
    criminal penalties for fraud and other violations of the
    securities laws.

Community
    Reinvestment Act

M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. are subject to the
    provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of the CRA, each
    appropriate federal bank regulatory agency is required, in
    connection with its examination of a bank, to assess such
    bank’s record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of
    the communities served by that bank, including low- and
    moderate-income neighborhoods. During these examinations, the
    regulatory agency rates such bank’s compliance with the CRA
    as “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,”
    “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial
    Noncompliance.” The regulatory agency’s assessment of
    the institution’s record is part of the regulatory
    agency’s consideration of applications to acquire, merge or
    consolidate with another banking institution or its holding
    company, or to open or relocate a branch office. M&T Bank
    has a CRA rating of “Outstanding” and M&T Bank,
    N.A. has a CRA rating of “Satisfactory.” In the case
    of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a
    bank or bank holding company, the Federal Reserve Board will
    assess the record of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank
    holding company in considering the application, and such records
    may be the basis for denying the application. The Banking Law
    contains provisions similar to the CRA which are applicable to
    New York-chartered banks. M&T Bank has a CRA rating of
    “Outstanding” as determined by the New York State
    Banking Department.

USA
    Patriot Act

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate
    Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001
    (the “USA Patriot Act”) imposes obligations on
    U.S. financial institutions, including banks and broker
    dealer subsidiaries, to implement and maintain appropriate
    policies, procedures and controls which are reasonably designed
    to prevent, detect and report instances of money laundering and
    the financing of terrorism and to verify the identity of their
    customers. In addition, provisions of the USA Patriot Act
    require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to
    consider the effectiveness of a financial institution’s
    anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and
    bank holding company acquisitions. Failure of a financial
    institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to
    combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have
    serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.
    The Registrant and its impacted subsidiaries have approved
    policies and procedures that are believed to be compliant with
    the USA Patriot Act.

Office of
    Foreign Assets Control Regulation

The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect
    transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and
    others. These are typically known as the “OFAC” rules
    based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury
    Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”).
    The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many
    different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of
    the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or
    investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions
    against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a
    sanctioned country and prohibitions on
    “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions
    relating to making investments in, or providing
    investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned
    country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the
    government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned
    country



have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject
    to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession
    or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g. property
    and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or
    transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure
    to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and
    reputational consequences.

Regulation
    of Insurers and Insurance Brokers

M&T’s operations in the areas of insurance brokerage
    and reinsurance of credit life insurance are subject to
    regulation and supervision by various state insurance regulatory
    authorities. Although the scope of regulation and form of
    supervision may vary from state to state, insurance laws
    generally grant broad discretion to regulatory authorities in
    adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities. This
    supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance
    brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling of
    customer funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Certain of
    M&T’s insurance company subsidiaries are subject to
    extensive regulatory supervision and to insurance laws and
    regulations requiring, among other things, maintenance of
    capital, record keeping, reporting and examinations.

Governmental
    Policies

The earnings of the Company are significantly affected by the
    monetary and fiscal policies of governmental authorities,
    including the Federal Reserve Board. Among the instruments of
    monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement
    these objectives are open-market operations in
    U.S. Government securities and federal funds, changes in
    the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in
    reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These
    instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations
    to influence the overall level of bank loans, investments and
    deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans and paid for
    deposits. The Federal Reserve Board frequently uses these
    instruments of monetary policy, especially its open-market
    operations and the discount rate, to influence the level of
    interest rates and to affect the strength of the economy, the
    level of inflation or the price of the dollar in foreign
    exchange markets. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve
    Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of
    banking institutions in the past and are expected to continue to
    do so in the future. It is not possible to predict the nature of
    future changes in monetary and fiscal policies, or the effect
    which they may have on the Company’s business and earnings.

Competition

The Company competes in offering commercial and personal
    financial services with other banking institutions and with
    firms in a number of other industries, such as thrift
    institutions, credit unions, personal loan companies, sales
    finance companies, leasing companies, securities firms and
    insurance companies. Furthermore, diversified financial services
    companies are able to offer a combination of these services to
    their customers on a nationwide basis. The Company’s
    operations are significantly impacted by state and federal
    regulations applicable to the banking industry. Moreover, the
    provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the Interstate
    Banking Act and the Banking Law have allowed for increased
    competition among diversified financial services providers.

Other
    Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives

Proposals may be introduced in the United States Congress and
    state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such
    initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the
    powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or
    proposals to substantially change the financial institution
    regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking
    statutes and the operating environment of the Registrant in
    substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation
    could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or
    expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance
    among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other
    financial institutions. M&T cannot predict whether any such
    legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that
    it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial
    condition or results of operations of the Registrant. A change
    in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to
    M&T or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect
    on the business of the Registrant. See the section captioned
    “Recent Developments” included elsewhere in this item.

Interest income data are on a
    taxable-equivalent basis. The apportionment of changes resulting
    from the combined effect of both volume and rate was based on
    the separately determined volume and rate changes.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

M&T and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by
    various risks and uncertainties which are difficult to predict.
    As a financial institution, the Company has significant exposure
    to market risk, including interest-rate risk, liquidity risk and
    credit risk, among others. Adverse experience with these or
    other risks could have a material impact on the Company’s
    financial condition and results of operations,



as well as on the value of the Company’s financial
    instruments in general, and M&T’s common stock, in
    particular.

Interest Rate Risk — The Company is exposed to
    interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and
    deposit-taking since assets and liabilities reprice at different
    times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a
    result, net interest income, which represents the largest
    revenue source for the Company, is subject to the effects of
    changing interest rates. The Company closely monitors the
    sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates
    and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as
    interest rates change. The Company makes use of both on- and
    off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to
    interest rate risk. Possible actions to mitigate such risk
    include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan
    and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to,
    modifying or terminating interest rate swap agreements or other
    financial instruments used for interest rate risk management
    purposes.

Liquidity Risk — Liquidity refers to the
    Company’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and
    liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future
    financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit
    withdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporate
    purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of
    financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.
    The Company obtains funding through deposits and various
    short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal
    funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to
    repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, Cayman Islands
    branch deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank
    of New York and others. Should the Company experience a
    substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt
    ratings, or should the availability of funding become restricted
    due to disruption in the financial markets, the Company’s
    ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could be
    negatively impacted. The Company attempts to quantify such
    credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the
    liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade
    over various grading levels. The Company estimates such impact
    by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines
    of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and
    securitizable assets. To mitigate such risk, the Company
    maintains available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve
    Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York that
    are secured by loans and investment securities. On an ongoing
    basis, management closely monitors the Company’s liquidity
    position for compliance with internal policies and believes that
    available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding
    needs in the normal course of business.

Credit Risk — Factors that influence the
    Company’s credit loss experience include overall economic
    conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and,
    due to the size of the Company’s real estate loan portfolio
    and mortgage-related investment securities portfolio, real
    estate valuations, in particular. Other factors that can
    influence the Company’s credit loss experience, in addition
    to general economic conditions and borrowers’ specific
    abilities to repay loans, include: (i) the impact of
    declining real estate values in the Company’s portfolio of
    loans to residential real estate builders and developers;
    (ii) the repayment performance associated with the
    Company’s portfolio of alternative residential mortgage
    loans and residential and other mortgage loans supporting
    mortgage-related securities; (iii) the concentrations of
    commercial real estate loans in the Company’s loan
    portfolio; (iv) the amount of commercial and industrial
    loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the
    New York City metropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that
    have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality
    than the vast majority of other regions of the country; and
    (v) the size of the Company’s portfolio of loans to
    individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher
    net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than many
    other loan types. Considerable concerns exist about the economic
    recovery in both national and international markets; the level
    and volatility of energy prices; a weakened housing market; the
    troubled state of financial and credit markets; Federal Reserve
    positioning of monetary policy; high levels of unemployment; the
    impact of economic conditions on businesses’ operations and
    abilities to repay loans in light of continued stagnant
    population growth in the upstate New York and central
    Pennsylvania regions; and continued uncertainty about possible
    responses to state and local government budget deficits.



Numerous factors can affect the Company’s credit loss
    experience. To help manage credit risk, the Company maintains a
    detailed credit policy and utilizes various committees that
    include members of senior management to approve significant
    extensions of credit. The Company also maintains a credit review
    department that regularly reviews the Company’s loan and
    lease portfolios to ensure compliance with established credit
    policy. The Company utilizes an extensive loan grading system
    which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate
    loans. On a quarterly basis, the Company’s loan review
    department reviews commercial loans and commercial real estate
    loans that are classified as Special Mention or worse. Meetings
    are held with loan officers and their managers, workout
    specialists and Senior Management to discuss each of the
    relationships. Borrower-specific information is reviewed,
    including operating results, future cash flows, recent
    developments and the borrower’s outlook, and other
    pertinent data. The timing and extent of potential losses,
    considering collateral valuation and other factors, and the
    Company’s potential courses of action are reviewed. The
    Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in
    management’s judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent
    in the loan and lease portfolio. In addition, the Company
    regularly reviews its investment securities for declines in
    value below amortized cost that might be characterized as
    “other than temporary.” Any declines in value below
    amortized cost that are deemed to be “other than
    temporary” are charged to earnings.

Economic Risk — The U.S. economy experienced weak
    economic conditions during the last three years. Those
    conditions contributed to risk as follows:

•

The significant downturn in the residential real estate market
    that began in 2007 continued through the 2010 year-end. The
    impact of that downturn has resulted in depressed home prices,
    higher than historical levels of foreclosures and loan
    charge-offs, and lower market prices on investment securities
    backed by residential real estate. Those factors have negatively
    impacted M&T’s results of operations and could
    continue to do so.

•

Lower demand for the Company’s products and services and
    lower revenues and earnings could result from ongoing weak
    economic conditions. Those conditions could also result in
    higher loan charge-offs due to the inability of borrowers to
    repay loans.

•

Lower fee income from the Company’s brokerage and trust
    businesses could result from significant declines in stock
    market prices.

•

Lower earnings could result from

other-than-temporary

impairment charges related to the Company’s investment
    securities portfolio.

•

Higher FDIC assessments could be imposed on the Company due to
    bank failures that have caused the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund
    to fall below minimum required levels.

•

There is no assurance that the Emergency Economic Stabilization
    Act of 2008 or the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
    2009 will improve the condition of the financial markets.

Supervision and Regulation — The Company is subject to
    extensive state and federal laws and regulations governing the
    banking industry, in particular, and public companies, in
    general, including laws related to corporate taxation. Many of
    those laws and regulations are described in Part I,
    Item 1 “Business.” Changes in those or other laws
    and regulations, or the degree of the Company’s compliance
    with those laws and regulations as judged by any of several
    regulators, including tax authorities, that oversee the Company,
    could have a significant effect on the Company’s operations
    and its financial results. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act
    represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services
    industry within the United States and requires federal agencies
    to implement many new rules. It is expected that at a minimum
    those new rules will result in increased costs, decreased
    revenues and more stringent capital and liquidity requirements.

Detailed discussions of the specific risks outlined above and
    other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

in Part I, Item 1 “Business,” and
    Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
    Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading
    “Forward-Looking Statements” is included a description
    of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by
    management that are difficult to predict and that could
    materially affect the Company’s financial condition and
    results of operations, as well as the value of the
    Company’s financial instruments in general, and M&T
    common stock, in particular.

In addition, the market price of M&T common stock may
    fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other
    factors, including changes in securities analysts’
    estimates of financial performance,



volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or
    erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar
    companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as
    may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or
    other regulatory agencies.

Properties.

Both M&T and M&T Bank maintain their executive offices
    at One M&T Plaza in Buffalo, New York. This twenty-one
    story headquarters building, containing approximately
    300,000 rentable square feet of space, is owned in fee by
    M&T Bank and was completed in 1967. M&T, M&T Bank
    and their subsidiaries occupy approximately 98% of the building
    and the remainder is leased to non-affiliated tenants. At
    December 31, 2010, the cost of this property (including
    improvements subsequent to the initial construction), net of
    accumulated depreciation, was $8.6 million.

In September 1992, M&T Bank acquired an additional facility
    in Buffalo, New York with approximately 395,000 rentable
    square feet of space. Approximately 89% of this facility, known
    as M&T Center, is occupied by M&T Bank and its
    subsidiaries, with the remainder leased to non-affiliated
    tenants. At December 31, 2010, the cost of this building
    (including improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of
    accumulated depreciation, was $10.4 million.

M&T Bank also owns and occupies two separate facilities in
    the Buffalo area which support certain back-office and
    operations functions of the Company. The total square footage of
    these facilities approximates 225,000 square feet and their
    combined cost (including improvements subsequent to
    acquisition), net of accumulated depreciation, was
    $20.4 million at December 31, 2010.

M&T Bank also owns a facility in Syracuse, New York with
    approximately 160,000 rentable square feet of space.
    Approximately 65% of this facility is occupied by M&T Bank.
    At December 31, 2010, the cost of this building (including
    improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of accumulated
    depreciation, was $5.7 million.

M&T Bank also owns facilities in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
    and Millsboro, Delaware with approximately 215,000 and
    325,000 rentable square feet of space, respectively.
    M&T Bank occupies approximately 35% and 85% of these
    respective facilities. At December 31, 2010, the cost of
    these buildings (including improvements subsequent to
    acquisition), net of accumulated depreciation, was
    $11.9 million and $7.2 million, respectively.

No other properties owned by M&T Bank have more than
    100,000 square feet of space. The cost, net of accumulated
    depreciation and amortization, of the Company’s premises
    and equipment is detailed in note 6 of Notes to Financial
    Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8,
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Of the
    739 domestic banking offices of the Registrant’s subsidiary
    banks at December 31, 2010, 286 are owned in fee and 453
    are leased.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings.

M&T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course
    of business to various pending and threatened legal proceedings
    in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. Management,
    after consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that
    the aggregate ultimate liability arising out of litigation
    pending against M&T or its subsidiaries will be material to
    M&T’s consolidated financial position, but at the
    present time is not in a position to determine whether such
    litigation will have a material adverse effect on
    M&T’s consolidated results of operations in any future
    reporting period.

    awards and allocate such awards to several investment options,
    including M&T common stock. At the time of the deferral
    election, participants also elected the timing of distributions

    exception of balances allocated to M&T common stock which
    are distributable in the form of shares of common stock.

    N.A.”).

M&T Bank, with total assets of $67.1 billion at
    December 31, 2010, is a New York-chartered commercial bank
    with 738 domestic banking offices in New York State,
    Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Virginia,
    West Virginia, and the District of Columbia, a full-service
    commercial banking office in Ontario, Canada, and an office in
    the Cayman Islands. M&T Bank and its subsidiaries offer a
    broad range of financial services to a diverse base of
    consumers, businesses, professional clients, governmental
    entities and financial institutions located in their markets.
    Lending is largely focused on consumers residing in New York
    State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and
    Washington, D.C., and on small and medium size businesses
    based in those areas, although loans are originated through
    lending offices in other states and in Ontario, Canada. Certain
    lending activities are also conducted in other states through
    various subsidiaries. M&T Bank’s subsidiaries include:
    M&T Real Estate Trust, a commercial mortgage lender;
    M&T Realty Capital Corporation, a multifamily commercial
    mortgage lender; M&T Securities, Inc., which provides
    brokerage, investment advisory and insurance services; MTB
    Investment Advisors, Inc., which serves as investment advisor to
    the MTB Group of Funds, a family of proprietary mutual funds,
    and other funds and institutional clients; and M&T
    Insurance Agency, Inc., an insurance agency.

M&T Bank, N.A., with total assets of $797 million at
    December 31, 2010, is a national bank with an office in
    Oakfield, New York. M&T Bank, N.A. offers selected deposit
    and loan products on a nationwide basis, largely through
    telephone, Internet and direct mail marketing techniques.

On November 5, 2010, M&T Bank entered into a purchase
    and assumption agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation (“FDIC”) to assume all of the deposits,
    except certain brokered deposits, and acquire certain assets of
    K Bank, based in Randallstown, Maryland. As part of the
    transaction, M&T Bank entered into a loss-share arrangement
    with the FDIC whereby M&T Bank will be



reimbursed by the FDIC for most losses it incurs on the acquired
    loan portfolio. The transaction has been accounted for using the
    acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair
    value on the acquisition date. Assets acquired in the
    transaction totaled approximately $556 million, including
    $154 million of loans and $186 million in cash, and
    liabilities assumed aggregated $528 million, including
    $491 million of deposits. In accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), M&T Bank
    recorded an after-tax gain on the transaction of
    $17 million ($28 million before taxes).

On November 1, 2010, M&T entered into a definitive
    agreement with Wilmington Trust Corporation
    (“Wilmington Trust”), headquartered in Wilmington,
    Delaware, under which Wilmington Trust will be acquired by
    M&T. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Wilmington
    Trust common shareholders will receive .051372 shares of
    M&T common stock in exchange for each share of Wilmington
    Trust common stock in a

stock-for-stock

transaction valued at $351 million (with the price based on
    M&T’s closing price of $74.75 per share as of
    October 29, 2010), plus the assumption of $330 million
    in preferred stock issued by Wilmington Trust as part of the
    Troubled Asset Relief Program — Capital Purchase
    Program of the U.S. Department of Treasury
    (“U.S. Treasury”).

At December 31, 2010, Wilmington Trust had approximately
    $10.9 billion of assets, including $7.5 billion of
    loans, $10.1 billion of liabilities, including
    $9.0 billion of deposits, and $60.1 billion of
    combined assets under management, including $43.6 billion
    managed by Wilmington Trust and $16.5 billion managed by
    affiliates. The merger is subject to a number of conditions,
    including the approval of various state and Federal regulators
    and Wilmington Trust’s common shareholders, and is expected
    to be completed by mid-year 2011.

Net acquisition and integration-related gains and expenses
    (included herein as merger-related expenses) associated with the
    K Bank acquisition transaction and with the pending Wilmington
    Trust acquisition incurred during 2010 totaled to a net gain of
    $27 million ($16 million after tax-effect, or $.14 of
    diluted earnings per common share). Reflected in that amount are
    the $28 million gain ($17 million after tax-effect, or
    $.14 of diluted earnings per common share) on the K Bank
    transaction and $771 thousand ($469 thousand after tax-effect)
    of expenses associated with the K Bank and Wilmington Trust
    transactions. The gain reflects the amount of financial support
    and indemnification against loan losses that M&T Bank
    obtained from the FDIC.

The condition of the domestic and global economy over the last
    three years has significantly impacted the financial services
    industry as a whole, and specifically, the financial results of
    the Company. In particular, rising unemployment and
    significantly depressed residential real estate valuations have
    led to elevated levels of loan charge-offs experienced by
    financial institutions throughout that time period, resulting in
    reduced capital levels. Although most economists believe that
    the recession in the United States ended sometime in the
    latter half of 2009, the recovery of the economy since then has
    been very slow. While the Company experienced lower levels of
    loan charge-offs during 2010 as compared with 2009, such
    charge-offs continued to be at higher than historical levels. In
    addition, many financial institutions have continued to
    experience unrealized losses related to investment securities
    backed by residential and commercial real estate due to a lack
    of liquidity in the financial markets and anticipated credit
    losses. Many financial institutions, including the Company, have
    taken charges for those unrealized losses that were deemed to be
    other than temporary.

Allied Irish Banks (“AIB”) received
    26,700,000 shares of M&T common stock on April 1,
    2003 as a result of M&T’s acquisition of a subsidiary
    of AIB on that date. Those shares of common stock owned by AIB
    represented 22.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of
    M&T common stock on September 30, 2010. In an effort
    to raise its capital position to meet new Irish
    government-mandated capital requirements, AIB completed the sale
    of the 26,700,000 shares on November 4, 2010. As a
    result, the provisions of the Agreement and Plan of
    Reorganization between M&T and AIB related to AIB’s
    rights as a substantial shareholder in the corporate governance
    of M&T became inoperative as of that date.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    amended GAAP in June 2009 relating to: (1) the
    consolidation of variable interest entities to eliminate the
    quantitative approach previously required for determining the
    primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and
    (2) accounting for transfers of financial assets to
    eliminate the exceptions for qualifying special-purpose entities
    from the consolidation guidance and the exception that permitted
    sale accounting for certain mortgage



securitizations when a transferor has not surrendered control
    over the transferred assets. The amended guidance became
    effective as of January 1, 2010. The recognition and
    measurement provisions of the amended guidance were applied to
    transfers that occurred on or after the effective date.
    Additionally, beginning January 1, 2010, the concept of a
    qualifying special-purpose entity is no longer relevant for
    accounting purposes. Therefore, formerly qualifying
    special-purpose entities must now be evaluated for consolidation
    in accordance with applicable consolidation guidance, including
    the new accounting guidance relating to the consolidation of
    variable interest entities.

In accordance with the new accounting requirements, effective
    January 1, 2010 the Company included in its consolidated
    financial statements

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans that were included in
    non-recourse securitization transactions using qualified
    special-purpose trusts. The effect of that consolidation as of
    January 1, 2010 was to increase residential real estate
    loans by $424 million, decrease the amortized cost of

available-for-sale

investment securities by $360 million (fair value of
    $355 million as of January 1, 2010), and increase
    borrowings by $65 million. Information concerning those
    loans is included in note 19 of Notes to Financial
    Statements.

On August 28, 2009, M&T Bank entered into a purchase
    and assumption agreement with the FDIC to assume all of the
    deposits and acquire certain assets of Bradford Bank
    (“Bradford”), based in Baltimore, Maryland. As part of
    the transaction, M&T Bank entered into a loss-share
    arrangement with the FDIC whereby M&T Bank will be
    reimbursed by the FDIC for most losses it incurs on the acquired
    loan portfolio. The transaction has been accounted for using the
    acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair
    value on the acquisition date. Assets acquired in the
    transaction totaled approximately $469 million, including
    $302 million of loans, and liabilities assumed aggregated
    $440 million, including $361 million of deposits. In
    accordance with GAAP, M&T Bank recorded an after-tax gain
    on the transaction of $18 million ($29 million before
    taxes).

On May 23, 2009, M&T acquired all of the outstanding
    common stock of Provident Bankshares Corporation
    (“Provident”), a bank holding company based in
    Baltimore, Maryland, in a

stock-for-stock

transaction. Provident Bank, Provident’s banking
    subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank on that date. The
    results of operations acquired in the Provident transaction have
    been included in the Company’s financial results since
    May 23, 2009. Provident common shareholders received
    .171625 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for
    each share of Provident common stock, resulting in M&T
    issuing a total of 5,838,308 common shares with an acquisition
    date fair value of $273 million. In addition, based on the
    merger agreement, outstanding and unexercised options to
    purchase Provident common stock were converted into options to
    purchase the common stock of M&T. Those options had an
    estimated fair value of approximately $1 million. In total,
    the purchase price was approximately $274 million based on
    the fair value on the acquisition date of M&T common stock
    exchanged and the options to purchase M&T common stock.
    Holders of Provident’s preferred stock were issued shares
    of new Series B and Series C Preferred Stock of
    M&T having substantially identical terms. That preferred
    stock and warrants to purchase common stock associated with the
    Series C Preferred Stock added $162 million to
    M&T’s shareholders’ equity. The Series B
    Preferred Stock has a preference value of $27 million, pays
    non-cumulative dividends at a rate of 10%, and is convertible
    into 433,148 shares of M&T common stock. The
    Series C Preferred Stock has a preference value of
    $152 million, pays cumulative dividends at a rate of 5%
    through November 2013 and 9% thereafter, and is held by the
    U.S. Treasury under the Troubled Asset Relief
    Program — Capital Purchase Program.

The Provident transaction was accounted for using the
    acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets
    acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration exchanged were
    recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Assets
    acquired totaled $6.3 billion, including $4.0 billion
    of loans and leases (including approximately $1.7 billion
    of commercial real estate loans, $1.4 billion of consumer
    loans, $700 million of commercial loans and leases and
    $300 million of residential real estate loans) and
    $1.0 billion of investment securities. Liabilities assumed
    were $5.9 billion, including $5.1 billion of deposits.
    The transaction added $436 million to M&T’s
    shareholders’ equity, including $280 million of common
    equity and $156 million of preferred equity. In connection
    with the acquisition, the Company recorded $332 million of
    goodwill and $63 million of core deposit intangible. The
    core deposit intangible is being amortized over seven years
    using an accelerated method. The acquisition of Provident
    expanded



the Company’s presence in the Mid-Atlantic area, gave the
    Company the second largest deposit share in Maryland, and
    tripled the Company’s presence in Virginia.

Application of the acquisition method requires that acquired
    loans be recorded at fair value and prohibits the carry-over of
    the acquired entity’s allowance for credit losses.
    Determining the fair value of the acquired loans required
    estimating cash flows expected to be collected on the loans. The
    impact of estimated credit losses on all acquired loans was
    considered in the estimation of future cash flows used in the
    determination of estimated fair value as of the acquisition date.

Net merger-related expenses associated with the Bradford and
    Provident acquisition transactions incurred during 2009 totaled
    $60 million ($36 million after tax effect, or $.31 of
    diluted earnings per common share). Reflected in that amount are
    the $29 million ($18 million after tax effect, or $.15
    of diluted earnings per common share) gain on the Bradford
    transaction and $89 million ($54 million after tax
    effect, or $.46 of diluted earnings per common share) of
    expenses associated with the Provident and Bradford
    transactions. The gain reflects the amount of financial support
    and indemnification against loan losses that M&T Bank
    obtained from the FDIC. The expenses were for professional
    services and other temporary help fees associated with the
    conversion of systems

and/or

integration of operations; costs related to branch and office
    consolidations; costs related to termination of existing
    Provident contractual arrangements for various services; initial
    marketing and promotion expenses designed to introduce M&T
    Bank to customers of Bradford and Provident; severance for
    former employees of Provident; incentive compensation costs;
    travel costs; and printing, supplies and other costs of
    commencing operations in new markets and offices.

In the third quarter of 2008, the Federal Reserve, the
    U.S. Treasury and the FDIC initiated measures to stabilize
    the financial markets and to provide liquidity for financial
    institutions. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008
    (“EESA”) was signed into law on October 3, 2008
    and authorized the U.S. Treasury to provide funds to be
    used to restore liquidity and stability to the
    U.S. financial system pursuant to the Troubled Asset Relief
    Program (“TARP”). Under the authority of EESA, the
    U.S. Treasury instituted a voluntary capital purchase
    program under TARP to encourage U.S. financial institutions
    to build capital to increase the flow of financing to
    U.S. businesses and consumers and to support the
    U.S. economy. Under the program, the U.S. Treasury
    purchased senior preferred shares of financial institutions
    which pay cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% per year for five
    years and thereafter at a rate of 9% per year. The terms of the
    senior preferred shares, as amended by the American Recovery and
    Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”), provide that the
    shares may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at par value plus
    accrued and unpaid dividends upon approval of the
    U.S. Treasury and the participating financial
    institution’s primary banking regulator. The senior
    preferred shares are non-voting and qualify as Tier 1
    capital for regulatory reporting purposes. In connection with
    purchasing senior preferred shares, the U.S. Treasury also
    received warrants to purchase the common stock of participating
    financial institutions having a market price of 15% of the
    amount of senior preferred shares on the date of investment with
    an exercise price equal to the market price of the participating
    institution’s common stock at the time of approval,
    calculated on a 20-trading day trailing average. The warrants
    have a term of ten years and are immediately exercisable, in
    whole or in part. For a period of three years, the consent of
    the U.S. Treasury will be required for participating
    institutions to increase their common stock dividend or
    repurchase their common stock, other than in connection with
    benefit plans consistent with past practice. Participation in
    the capital purchase program also includes certain restrictions
    on executive compensation that were modified by ARRA and further
    defined by the U.S. Treasury in its Interim Final Rule on
    TARP Standards for Compensation and Corporate Governance. The
    minimum subscription amount available to a participating
    institution was one percent of total risk-weighted assets. The
    maximum suggested subscription amount was three percent of
    risk-weighted assets. On December 23, 2008, M&T issued
    to the U.S. Treasury $600 million of Series A
    Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 1,218,522 shares
    of M&T common stock at $73.86 per share. M&T elected
    to participate in the capital purchase program at an amount
    equal to approximately 1% of its risk-weighted assets at the
    time. As already noted, Provident also participated in the
    capital purchase program. Preferred stock resulting from that
    participation was converted into $152 million of M&T
    Series C Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase
    407,542 shares of M&T common stock at $55.76 per
    share. In total, M&T has $752 million of preferred
    stock outstanding related to the capital purchase program.



Additional information regarding preferred stock of M&T is
    included in note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Recent
    Legislative Developments

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
    (“Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law on
    July 21, 2010. This new law has and will continue to
    significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and
    affect the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating
    activities of financial institutions and their holding
    companies, and will fundamentally change the system of
    regulatory oversight of the Company, including through the
    creation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The
    Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a
    broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to
    prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal
    agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the
    implementing rules and regulations, and, as a result, many of
    the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act is not
    yet known. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, could have a material
    adverse impact either on the financial services industry as a
    whole, or on M&T’s business, results of operations,
    financial condition and liquidity.

The Dodd-Frank Act broadens the base for FDIC insurance
    assessments. Assessments will now be based on the average
    consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a
    financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently
    increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks,
    savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per
    depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2009, and non-interest
    bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance
    through December 31, 2013.

The legislation also requires that publicly traded companies
    give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation
    and “golden parachute” payments, and authorizes the
    Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate rules that
    would allow shareholders to nominate their own candidates using
    a company’s proxy materials. The Dodd-Frank Act also
    directs the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules
    prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company
    executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded.

The Dodd-Frank Act established a new Bureau of Consumer
    Financial Protection with broad powers to supervise and enforce
    consumer protection laws. The Bureau of Consumer Financial
    Protection has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of
    consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings
    institutions, including the authority to prohibit “unfair,
    deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Bureau of
    Consumer Financial Protection has examination and enforcement
    authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than
    $10 billion in assets.

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act, among other things:

•

Weakens the federal preemption rules that have been applicable
    for national banks and gives state attorneys general the ability
    to enforce federal consumer protection laws;

•

Amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”)
    which has resulted in, among other things, the Federal Reserve
    Board issuing rules aimed at limiting debit-card interchange
    fees;

•

Applies the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements
    that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank
    holding companies which, among other things, will, after a
    three-year phase-in period which begins January 1, 2013,
    remove trust preferred securities as a permitted component of a
    holding company’s Tier 1 capital;

•

Provides for an increase in the FDIC assessment for depository
    institutions with assets of $10 billion or more and
    increases the minimum reserve ratio for the deposit insurance
    fund from 1.15% to 1.35%;

•

Imposes comprehensive regulation of the

over-the-counter

derivatives market, which would include certain provisions that
    would effectively prohibit insured depository institutions from
    conducting certain derivatives businesses in the institution
    itself;

•

Repeals the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on
    demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to
    pay interest on business transaction and other accounts;

•

Provides mortgage reform provisions regarding a customer’s
    ability to repay, restricting variable-rate lending by requiring
    the ability to repay to be determined for variable-rate loans by
    using the maximum rate that will apply during the first five
    years of a variable-rate loan term, and making



more loans subject to provisions for higher cost loans, new
    disclosures, and certain other revisions; and

•

Creates the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which will
    recommend to the Federal Reserve Board increasingly strict rules
    for capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management and other
    requirements as companies grow in size and complexity.

The environment in which banking organizations will operate
    after the financial crisis, including legislative and regulatory
    changes affecting capital, liquidity, supervision, permissible
    activities, corporate governance and compensation, changes in
    fiscal policy and steps to eliminate government support for
    banking organizations, may have long-term effects on the
    business model and profitability of banking organizations, the
    full extent of which cannot now be foreseen. Many aspects of the
    Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to rulemaking and will take effect
    over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the
    overall financial impact on M&T, its customers or the
    financial industry more generally. Provisions in the legislation
    that affect deposit insurance assessments, payment of interest
    on demand deposits and interchange fees could increase the costs
    associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain
    revenues those deposits may generate. Provisions in the
    legislation that revoke the Tier 1 capital treatment of
    trust preferred securities and otherwise require revisions to
    the capital requirements of M&T and M&T Bank could
    require M&T and M&T Bank to seek other sources of
    capital in the future. The impact of new rules relating to
    overdraft fee practices is included herein under the heading
    “Other Income.”

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

The Company’s significant accounting policies conform with
    GAAP and are described in note 1 of Notes to Financial
    Statements. In applying those accounting policies, management of
    the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many
    of the methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized.
    Certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent
    on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility
    in the Company’s reported financial performance should the
    assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes
    in circumstances. Some of the more significant areas in which
    management of the Company applies critical assumptions and
    estimates include the following:

•

Allowance for credit losses — The allowance for credit
    losses represents the amount which, in management’s
    judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in
    the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. A
    provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of
    the allowance as deemed necessary by management. In estimating
    losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, assumptions and
    judgment are applied to measure amounts and timing of expected
    future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to
    determine the borrowers’ abilities to repay obligations.
    Historical loss trends are also considered, as are economic
    conditions, industry trends, portfolio trends and
    borrower-specific financial data. Changes in the circumstances
    considered when determining management’s estimates and
    assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and
    assumptions, which may result in adjustment of the allowance. A
    detailed discussion of facts and circumstances considered by
    management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit
    losses is included herein under the heading “Provision for
    Credit Losses.”

•

Valuation methodologies — Management of the Company
    applies various valuation methodologies to assets and
    liabilities which often involve a significant degree of
    judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the
    particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred
    to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as
    trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real
    estate loans held for sale and related commitments. However, for
    those items for which an observable liquid market does not
    exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions
    to value such items. Examples of these items include loans,
    privately issued mortgage-backed securities, deposits,
    borrowings, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets,
    and other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business
    combinations; capitalized servicing assets; pension and other
    postretirement benefit obligations; value ascribed to
    stock-based compensation; estimated residual values of property
    associated with leases; and certain derivative and other
    financial instruments. These valuations require the use of
    various



assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of
    return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates,
    costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of different
    assumptions could produce significantly different results, which
    could have material positive or negative effects on the
    Company’s results of operations. In addition to valuation,
    the Company must assess whether there are any declines in value
    below the carrying value of assets that should be considered
    other than temporary or otherwise require an adjustment in
    carrying value and recognition of a loss in the consolidated
    statement of income. Examples include investment securities,
    other investments, mortgage servicing rights, goodwill, core
    deposit and other intangible assets, among others. Specific
    assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed
    in detail herein in management’s discussion and analysis of
    financial condition and results of operations and in
    notes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 18, 19 and 20 of Notes to
    Financial Statements.

•

Commitments, contingencies and off-balance sheet
    arrangements — Information regarding the
    Company’s commitments and contingencies, including
    guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation,
    and their potential effects on the Company’s results of
    operations is included in note 21 of Notes to Financial
    Statements. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to
    examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such
    examinations may result in challenges to the tax return
    treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions.
    Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to
    record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate.
    Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that
    management’s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and
    adjustments required could have a material effect on the
    Company’s results of operations. Information regarding the
    Company’s income taxes is presented in note 13 of
    Notes to Financial Statements. The recognition or de-recognition
    in the Company’s consolidated financial statements of
    assets and liabilities held by so-called variable interest
    entities is subject to the interpretation and application of
    complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that
    require management to estimate and assess the probability of
    financial outcomes in future periods and the degree to which the
    Company can influence those outcomes. Information relating to
    the Company’s involvement in such entities and the
    accounting treatment afforded each such involvement is included
    in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Overview

The Company recorded net income during 2010 of $736 million
    or $5.69 of diluted earnings per common share, up 94% and 97%,
    respectively, from $380 million or $2.89 of diluted
    earnings per common share in 2009. Basic earnings per common
    share rose 97% to $5.72 in 2010 from $2.90 in 2009. Net income
    in 2008 aggregated $556 million, while diluted and basic
    earnings per common share were $5.01 and $5.04, respectively.
    The after-tax impact of net merger-related gains and expenses
    associated with the acquisition transactions previously
    described totaled to a net gain of $16 million
    ($27 million pre-tax) or $.14 of basic and diluted earnings
    per common share in 2010, and net expenses of $36 million
    ($60 million pre-tax) or $.31 of basic and diluted earnings
    per common share in 2009. Similar expenses of $2 million
    ($4 million pre-tax) or $.02 of basic and diluted earnings
    per common share were incurred in 2008 related to acquisition
    transactions completed in 2007. Net income expressed as a rate
    of return on average assets in 2010 was 1.08%, compared with
    .56% in 2009 and .85% in 2008. The return on average common
    shareholders’ equity was 9.30% in 2010, 5.07% in 2009 and
    8.64% in 2008.

The Company’s improved financial performance in 2010 as
    compared with 2009 was largely driven by higher net interest
    income and lower credit costs. The higher net interest income
    was the result of a 35 basis point (hundredths of one
    percent) widening of the net interest margin, or
    taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average
    earning assets. That widening reflects a 38 basis point
    reduction of rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities,
    including a 40 basis point reduction in rates paid on
    interest-bearing deposits. Reflecting the wider net interest
    margin, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased
    $214 million, or 10%, to $2.29 billion in 2010 from
    $2.08 billion in 2009.

While the provision for credit losses during 2010 was elevated
    when compared to historical levels, it declined 39% to
    $368 million from $604 million in 2009. Net
    charge-offs dropped 33% to $346 million in 2010 from
    $514 million in 2009. As a percentage of average loans
    outstanding, net charge-offs were .67% in 2010 and 1.01% in
    2009. The lower level of net charge-offs in 2010 was led by a
    decrease in



commercial loan charge-offs, which declined to $65 million
    from $172 million in 2009. Another significant factor in
    the higher net income in 2010 was a decrease in

other-than-temporary

impairment charges on investment securities to $86 million
    ($53 million after tax-effect) from $138 million
    ($84 million after tax-effect) in 2009. Those impairment
    charges were largely related to certain privately issued
    collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) backed by
    residential real estate loans and collateralized debt
    obligations (“CDOs”) backed by trust preferred
    securities issued by other financial institutions.

Several noteworthy items were reflected in the Company’s
    financial results in 2009. The provision for credit losses and
    net loan charge-offs during 2009 were at higher than historical
    levels, due largely to the recessionary state of the
    U.S. economy and its impact on consumers and businesses,
    and the continuation of a distressed residential real estate
    market. The provision for credit losses in 2009 was
    $604 million, up from $412 million in 2008. Net
    charge-offs during 2009 aggregated $514 million, compared
    with $383 million in 2008. As a percentage of average loans
    outstanding, net charge-offs were 1.01% and .78% in 2009 and
    2008, respectively. Charge-offs in all major loan categories
    rose from 2008 to 2009. The most dramatic increase in net
    charge-offs was related to commercial loans, which rose to
    $172 million in 2009 from $94 million in 2008. That
    increase was largely driven by a small number of significant
    commercial loan charge-offs. In addition, net charge-offs of
    residential real estate loans rose to $92 million in 2009
    from $63 million in 2008, reflecting turbulence in the
    residential real estate market place that resulted in
    deteriorating real estate values and increased delinquencies.
    The Company also incurred elevated costs in 2009 related to the
    workout process for modifying residential mortgage loans of
    creditworthy borrowers and to the foreclosure process for
    borrowers unable to make payments on their loans.

During 2009, $84 million of after-tax

other-than-temporary

impairment charges ($138 million before taxes) were
    recorded on certain

available-for-sale

investment securities, reducing basic and diluted earnings per
    common share by $.73. The Company also experienced substantially
    higher costs related to deposit assessments by the FDIC. Such
    costs rose to $97 million in 2009 from $7 million in
    2008 and reflected higher assessment rates, expirations of
    available credits and a $33 million second quarter 2009
    special assessment levied by the FDIC on insured financial
    institutions to rebuild the Deposit Insurance Fund. That special
    assessment reduced net income and diluted earnings per common
    share by $20 million and $.17, respectively.

The Company’s financial results for 2008 were also affected
    by several notable factors. Largely the result of the state of
    the U.S. economy and the distressed residential real estate
    marketplace, the Company’s provision for credit losses in
    2008 was $412 million, significantly higher than
    $192 million in 2007. Net charge-offs of loans in 2008 rose
    to $383 million from $114 million in 2007. Net loan
    charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were
    .78% and .26% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. While charge-offs
    were up in all major categories of loans, the most significant
    contributors to the sharp rise were loan charge-offs related to
    residential real estate markets; charge-offs of loans to
    builders and developers of residential real estate jumped from
    $4 million in 2007 to $100 million in 2008, and
    residential real estate loan charge-offs grew to
    $63 million in 2008 from $19 million in 2007. Not only
    did the condition of the residential real estate markets
    negatively impact the Company’s financial results in 2008
    through a higher provision for credit losses, but significantly
    higher costs were incurred related to the workout process for
    modifying residential mortgage loans and to the foreclosure
    process.

During the third quarter of 2008, a $153 million (pre-tax)

other-than-temporary

impairment charge was recorded related to preferred stock
    issuances of the Federal National Mortgage Association
    (“Fannie Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
    Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). The write-down was taken
    on preferred stock with a basis of $162 million following
    the U.S. Government’s placement of Fannie Mae and
    Freddie Mac under conservatorship on September 7, 2008. The
    Company recognized additional

other-than-temporary

impairment charges during 2008 totaling $29 million
    (pre-tax) related to certain CDOs and CMOs. In total,

other-than-temporary

impairment charges on investment securities aggregated
    $182 million ($111 million after tax effect) during
    2008, thereby lowering diluted earnings per common share by
    $1.00.

Also reflected in the Company’s 2008 results was
    $29 million of after-tax income, or $.26 of diluted
    earnings per common share, resulting from M&T Bank’s
    status as a member bank of Visa. During the last quarter of
    2007, Visa completed a reorganization in contemplation of its
    initial public offering



(“IPO”) in 2008. As part of that reorganization
    M&T Bank and other member banks of Visa received shares of
    Class B common stock of Visa. M&T Bank was allocated
    1,967,028 Class B common shares of Visa based on its
    proportionate ownership of Visa. Of those shares, 760,455 were
    mandatorily redeemed in March 2008 for an after-tax gain of
    $20 million ($33 million pre-tax), which was recorded
    as “gain on bank investment securities” in the
    consolidated statement of income, adding $.18 to diluted
    earnings per common share. In accordance with GAAP, the Company
    has not recognized any value for its remaining common stock
    ownership interest in Visa. During the first quarter of 2008,
    Visa completed its IPO of common stock and, as part of the
    transaction, funded an escrow account with $3 billion from
    the proceeds of the IPO to cover potential settlements arising
    out of certain litigation against Visa. As a result, during the
    first three months of 2008, the Company reversed approximately
    $15 million of a liability accrued during the fourth
    quarter of 2007 related to such litigation, adding
    $9 million to net income ($.08 per diluted common share).
    That liability had been accrued in 2007 because M&T Bank
    and other member banks of Visa are obligated under various
    agreements to share in losses stemming from certain litigation
    against Visa. Visa subsequently announced that it had further
    funded the escrow account to provide for the settlement of the
    litigation. Those subsequent fundings did not result in a
    material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial
    position or results of operations as of or for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

The Company resolved certain tax issues during the third quarter
    of 2008 related to its activities in various jurisdictions
    during the years

1999-2007.

As a result, the Company paid $40 million to settle those
    issues, but was able to reduce previously accrued income tax
    expense in 2008 by $40 million, thereby adding $.36 to that
    year’s diluted earnings per common share.

As previously noted, net interest income recorded on a
    taxable-equivalent basis rose 10% to $2.29 billion in 2010
    from $2.08 billion in 2009, reflecting a wider net interest
    margin. Average earning assets during 2010 were
    $59.7 billion, little changed from $59.6 billion in
    2009.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income in 2009 was 6% higher
    than $1.96 billion in 2008. Contributing to the improvement
    were growth in average earning assets and a widening of the
    Company’s net interest margin. Average earning assets rose
    3% to $59.6 billion in 2009 from $58.0 billion in 2008,
    largely due to the $5.5 billion of earning assets obtained
    in the Provident and Bradford transactions. The net interest
    margin widened 11 basis points to 3.49% in 2009 from 3.38%
    in 2008, largely due to lower interest rates paid on deposits
    and borrowings.

As previously noted, the provision for credit losses of
    $368 million in 2010 was down 39% from $604 million in
    2009. Net charge-offs totaled $346 million in 2010, down
    from $514 million in 2009. The provision for credit losses
    and net charge-offs in 2009 were up significantly from
    $412 million and $383 million, respectively, in 2008.
    Deteriorating economic conditions impacting the quality of
    outstanding loans to businesses and consumers, and depressed
    residential real estate valuations and their impact on the
    Company’s portfolios of residential mortgage loans and
    loans to residential real estate builders and developers, were
    the most significant factors contributing to the higher levels
    of the provision and net charge-offs in 2009 as compared with
    the preceding year. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average
    loans and leases outstanding were .78% in 2008. The provision in
    each year represents the result of management’s analysis of
    the composition of the loan and lease portfolio and other
    factors, including concern regarding uncertainty about economic
    conditions, both nationally and in many of the markets served by
    the Company, and the impact of such conditions and prospects on
    the abilities of borrowers to repay loans.

Noninterest income rose 6% to $1.11 billion in 2010 from
    $1.05 billion in 2009. Gains and losses on bank investment
    securities (consisting predominantly of

other-than-temporary

impairment charges) totaled to net losses of $84 million in
    2010 and $137 million in 2009. Excluding gains and losses
    from bank investment securities, the $28 million gain
    recorded on the K Bank transaction in 2010 and the
    $29 million gain recorded on the Bradford transaction in
    2009, noninterest income was $1.16 billion in each of 2010
    and 2009. Declines in revenues related to residential mortgage
    banking, brokerage services and the Company’s trust
    business were offset by higher service charges on deposit
    accounts, credit-related fees and other revenues from operations.

Noninterest income in 2009 was up 12% from $939 million in
    2008. Gains and losses on bank investment securities (including

other-than-temporary

impairment losses) totaled to net losses of



$148 million in 2008. Those losses in 2008 were due to

other-than-temporary

impairment charges related to certain of the Company’s
    privately issued CMOs, CDOs and preferred stock holdings of
    Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The investment securities losses in
    2008 are net of the $33 million gain from the sale of
    shares of Visa. Excluding gains and losses from bank investment
    securities and the $29 million gain recorded on the
    Bradford transaction, noninterest income of $1.16 billion
    in 2009 was 6% higher than $1.09 billion in 2008.
    Contributing to that improvement were higher mortgage banking
    revenues and service charges on acquisition-related deposit
    accounts, partially offset by declines in trust and brokerage
    services income.

Noninterest expense in 2010 totaled $1.91 billion, down 3%
    from $1.98 billion in 2009. During 2008, noninterest
    expense aggregated $1.73 billion. Included in such amounts
    are expenses considered by M&T to be
    “nonoperating” in nature, consisting of amortization
    of core deposit and other intangible assets of $58 million,
    $64 million and $67 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, and merger-related expenses of $771,000 in 2010,
    $89 million in 2009 and $4 million in 2008. Exclusive
    of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses
    aggregated $1.86 billion in 2010, $1.83 billion in
    2009 and $1.66 billion in 2008. The increase in such
    expenses from 2009 to 2010 was largely attributable to higher
    costs for professional services and advertising in 2010, and a
    $22 million reduction of the allowance for impairment of
    capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights in 2009. For
    the year ended December 31, 2010, there was no change to
    that impairment allowance. Partially offsetting those factors
    were declines in expenses in 2010 related to foreclosed
    properties and FDIC assessments. The most significant factors
    for the higher level of noninterest operating expenses in 2009
    as compared with 2008 were the higher FDIC assessments, costs
    associated with the acquired operations of Provident and
    Bradford, and higher foreclosure-related expenses. Partially
    offsetting those increases was a partial reversal of the
    valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage
    servicing rights of $22 million in 2009, compared with an
    addition to the valuation allowance of $16 million in 2008.
    Included in operating expenses in 2010 were $15 million of
    tax-deductible contributions made to The M&T Charitable
    Foundation, a tax-exempt private charitable foundation. Similar
    contributions of $12 million and $6 million were made
    in 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The efficiency ratio expresses the relationship of operating
    expenses to revenues. The Company’s efficiency ratio, or
    noninterest operating expenses (as previously defined) divided
    by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and
    noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank
    investment securities and gains on merger transactions), was
    53.7% in 2010, compared with 56.5% in 2009 and 54.4% in 2008.

Supplemental
    Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations

As a result of business combinations and other acquisitions, the
    Company had intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core
    deposit and other intangible assets totaling $3.7 billion
    at each of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and $3.4 billion
    at December 31, 2008. Included in such intangible assets
    was goodwill of $3.5 billion at each of December 31,
    2010 and 2009 and $3.2 billion at December 31, 2008.
    Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after
    tax effect, totaled $35 million, $39 million and
    $41 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

M&T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its
    results on a “net operating” or “tangible”
    basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of
    amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and
    the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other
    intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax
    amounts) and gains and expenses associated with merging acquired
    operations into the Company, since such items are considered by
    management to be “nonoperating” in nature. Although
    “net operating income” as defined by M&T is not a
    GAAP measure, M&T’s management believes that this
    information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition
    activity in reported results.

Net operating income aggregated $755 million in 2010, up
    66% from $455 million in 2009. Diluted net operating
    earnings per common share in 2010 rose 65% to $5.84 from $3.54
    in 2009. Net operating income and diluted net operating earnings
    per common share were $599 million and $5.39, respectively,
    during 2008.

Net operating income expressed as a rate of return on average
    tangible assets was 1.17% in 2010, compared with .71% in 2009
    and .97% in 2008. Net operating return on average tangible
    common equity was 18.95% in 2010, compared with 13.42% and
    19.63% in 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Reconciliations of GAAP amounts with corresponding non-GAAP
    amounts are presented in table 2.

Net
    Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities

Reflecting a 35 basis point widening of the net interest
    margin, taxable-equivalent net interest income rose 10% to
    $2.29 billion in 2010 from $2.08 billion in 2009. The
    Company’s net interest margin increased to 3.84% in 2010
    from 3.49% in 2009, predominantly the result of lower interest
    rates paid on deposits and borrowings. Average earning assets
    were $59.7 billion in 2010, compared with
    $59.6 billion in 2009. As compared with 2009, a slight
    increase in average outstanding balances of loans and leases was
    offset by a decline in average outstanding balances of
    investment securities.

Average loans and leases were $51.3 billion in 2010, up 1%
    from $51.0 billion in 2009. The full-year impact of the
    loans obtained in the Provident and Bradford acquisition
    transactions was offset by sluggish borrower demand for
    commercial loans. Average commercial loans and leases declined
    6% to $13.1 billion in 2010 from $13.9 billion in
    2009. Commercial real estate loans averaged $20.7 billion
    in 2010, up 3% from $20.1 billion in 2009. Average
    residential real estate loans increased 8% to $5.7 billion
    in 2010 from $5.3 billion in 2009, largely due to the
    impact of adopting the previously noted new accounting rules on
    January 1, 2010. The Company’s consumer loan portfolio
    averaged $11.7 billion in each of 2010 and 2009.

Net interest income expressed on a taxable-equivalent basis
    aggregated $2.08 billion in 2009, up 6% from
    $1.96 billion in 2008, the result of growth in average
    earning assets and a widening of the Company’s net interest
    margin. Average earning assets totaled $59.6 billion in
    2009, up 3% from $58.0 billion in 2008. Growth in average
    loan and lease balances outstanding, which rose 4% to
    $51.0 billion in 2009 from $48.8 billion in 2008, was
    partially offset by a decline in average investment securities,
    which decreased 6% to $8.4 billion in 2009 from
    $9.0 billion in 2008. The growth in average loans in 2009
    was predominantly the result of loans obtained in the Provident
    and Bradford transactions of $4.0 billion on May 23,
    2009 and $302 million on August 28, 2009,
    respectively. In total, the acquired loans consisted of
    approximately $700 million of commercial loans,
    $1.8 billion of commercial real estate loans,
    $400 million of residential real estate loans and
    $1.4 billion of consumer loans. Including the impact of
    acquired loan balances, commercial loans and leases averaged
    $13.9 billion in 2009, up slightly from $13.8 billion
    in 2008; average commercial real estate loans increased 9% to
    $20.1 billion in 2009 from $18.4 billion in 2008;
    average residential real estate loans declined 3% to
    $5.3 billion in 2009 from $5.5 billion in 2008; and
    consumer loans averaged $11.7 billion in 2009, 5% higher
    than $11.2 billion in 2008. The improvement in the net
    interest margin, which widened 11 basis points to 3.49% in
    2009 from 3.38% in 2008, was largely the result of lower
    interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings.

Commercial loans and leases, excluding loans secured by real
    estate, aggregated $13.4 billion at December 31, 2010,
    representing 26% of total loans and leases. Table 5 presents
    information on commercial loans and leases as of
    December 31, 2010 relating to geographic area, size,
    borrower industry and whether the loans are secured by
    collateral or unsecured. Of the $13.4 billion of commercial
    loans and leases outstanding at the end of 2010, approximately
    $11.4 billion, or 85%, were secured, while 46%, 24% and 18%
    were granted to businesses in New York State, Pennsylvania and
    the Mid-Atlantic area (which includes Maryland, Delaware,
    Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia),
    respectively. The Company provides financing for leases to
    commercial customers, primarily for equipment. Commercial leases
    included in total commercial loans and leases at
    December 31, 2010 aggregated $1.4 billion, of which
    44% were secured by collateral located in New York State, 16%
    were secured by collateral in the Mid-Atlantic area and another
    10% were secured by collateral in Pennsylvania.

International loans included in commercial loans and leases
    totaled $105 million and $55 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in
    such loans was due to $61 million of loans at M&T
    Bank’s commercial branch in Ontario, Canada, which opened
    in the second quarter of 2010. The Company participates in the
    insurance and guarantee programs of the Export-Import Bank of
    the United States. These programs provide U.S. government
    repayment coverage of 90% to 100% on loans supporting foreign
    borrowers’ purchases of U.S. goods and services and
    coverage of 90% on loans to U.S. exporters of goods and
    services to foreign buyers. The loans generally range up to
    $10 million. The outstanding balances of loans under those
    programs at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were
    $32 million and $43 million, respectively.

Loans secured by real estate, including outstanding balances of
    home equity loans and lines of credit which the Company
    classifies as consumer loans, represented approximately 65% of
    the loan and lease portfolio during 2010, compared with 62% in
    2009 and 60% in 2008. At December 31, 2010, the Company
    held approximately $21.2 billion of commercial real estate
    loans, $5.9 billion of consumer real estate loans secured
    by

one-to-four

family residential properties (including $341 million of
    loans held for sale) and $6.6 billion of outstanding
    balances of home equity loans and lines of credit, compared with
    $20.9 billion, $5.5 billion and $6.8 billion,
    respectively, at December 31, 2009. Loans obtained in the
    2009 Provident and Bradford acquisition transactions included
    $1.8 billion of commercial real estate loans,
    $400 million of consumer real estate loans secured by

one-to-four

family residential properties and $1.1 billion of
    outstanding home equity loans and lines of credit. Included in
    total loans and leases were amounts due from builders and
    developers of residential real estate aggregating
    $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively, of which $1.35 billion and
    $1.6 billion, respectively, were classified as commercial
    real estate loans.

Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company include
    fixed-rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon
    payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity, in many
    cases five years after origination. For borrowers in good
    standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the
    customer for an additional five years at the then current market
    rate of interest. The Company also originates fixed-rate
    commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater than
    five years, generally having original maturity terms of
    approximately seven to ten years, and adjustable-rate commercial
    real estate loans. Excluding construction and development loans
    made to investors, adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans
    represented approximately 51% of the commercial real estate loan
    portfolio as of December 31, 2010. Table 6 presents
    commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of
    collateral and size of the loans outstanding at
    December 31, 2010. New York City metropolitan area
    commercial real estate loans totaled $7.3 billion at the
    2010 year-end. The $6.1 billion of investor-owned
    commercial real estate loans in the New York City metropolitan
    area were largely secured by multifamily residential properties,
    retail space, and office space. The Company’s experience
    has been that office, retail and service-related properties tend
    to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through
    economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do
    multifamily residential properties. Approximately 49% of the
    aggregate dollar amount of New York City-area loans were for
    loans with outstanding balances of $10 million or less,
    while loans of more than $50 million made up approximately
    14% of the total.

(a)

Includes approximately
    $450 million of construction loans.

Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located in
    other parts of New York State, Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic
    area tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and
    include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the
    mortgaged property in their trade or business (owner-occupied).
    Approximately 80% of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial
    real estate loans in New York State secured by properties
    located outside of the metropolitan New York City area were for



loans with outstanding balances of $10 million or less. Of
    the outstanding balances of commercial real estate loans in
    Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area, approximately 77% and
    68%, respectively, were for loans with outstanding balances of
    $10 million or less.

Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located
    outside of Pennsylvania, the Mid-Atlantic area, New York State
    and areas of states neighboring New York considered to be part
    of the New York City metropolitan area, comprised 8% of total
    commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2010.

Commercial real estate construction and development loans made
    to investors presented in table 6 totaled $3.8 billion at
    December 31, 2010, or 7% of total loans and leases.
    Approximately 96% of those construction loans had adjustable
    interest rates. Included in such loans at December 31, 2010
    were $1.35 billion of loans to developers of residential
    real estate properties. Information about the credit performance
    of the Company’s loans to builders and developers of
    residential real estate properties is included herein under the
    heading “Provision For Credit Losses.” The remainder
    of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio was
    comprised of loans made for various purposes, including the
    construction of office buildings, multifamily residential
    housing, retail space and other commercial development.

M&T Realty Capital Corporation, a commercial real estate
    lending subsidiary of M&T Bank, participates in the Fannie
    Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (“DUS”)
    program, pursuant to which commercial real estate loans are
    originated in accordance with terms and conditions specified by
    Fannie Mae and sold. Under this program, loans are sold with
    partial credit recourse to M&T Realty Capital Corporation.
    The amount of recourse is generally limited to one-third of any
    credit loss incurred by the purchaser on an individual loan,
    although in some cases the recourse amount is less than
    one-third of the outstanding principal balance. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately $1.6 billion
    and $1.3 billion, respectively, of commercial real estate
    loan balances serviced for others had been sold with recourse.
    There have been no material losses incurred as a result of those
    recourse arrangements. Commercial real estate loans held for
    sale at December 31, 2010 and 2009 aggregated
    $204 million and $123 million, respectively. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, commercial real estate loans
    serviced for other investors by the Company were
    $8.1 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively. Those
    serviced loans are not included in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet.

Real estate loans secured by

one-to-four

family residential properties were $5.9 billion at
    December 31, 2010, including approximately 39% secured by
    properties located in New York State, 13% secured by properties
    located in Pennsylvania and 21% secured by properties located in
    the Mid-Atlantic area. At December 31, 2010,
    $341 million of residential real estate loans were held for
    sale, compared with $530 million at December 31, 2009.
    The Company’s portfolio of Alt-A loans held for investment
    at December 31, 2010 totaled $648 million, compared
    with $789 million at December 31, 2009. Loans to
    individuals to finance the construction of

one-to-four

family residential properties totaled $71 million at
    December 31, 2010, or approximately .1% of total loans and
    leases, compared with $76 million or .1% at
    December 31, 2009. Information about the credit performance
    of the Company’s Alt-A mortgage loans and other residential
    mortgage loans is included herein under the heading
    “Provision For Credit Losses.”

Consumer loans comprised approximately 23% of the average loan
    portfolio during each of 2010 and 2009. The two largest
    components of the consumer loan portfolio are outstanding
    balances of home equity lines of credit and automobile loans.
    Average balances of home equity lines of credit outstanding
    represented approximately 11% of average loans outstanding in
    each of 2010 and 2009. Automobile loans represented
    approximately 5% and 6% of the Company’s average loan
    portfolio during 2010 and 2009, respectively. No other consumer
    loan product represented more than 4% of average loans
    outstanding in 2010. Approximately 44% of home equity lines of
    credit outstanding at December 31, 2010 were secured by
    properties in New York State, and 19% and 35% were secured by
    properties in Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area,
    respectively. Average outstanding balances on home equity lines
    of credit were approximately $5.8 billion and
    $5.4 billion in 2010 and 2009, respectively. At
    December 31, 2010, 35% and 26% of the automobile loan
    portfolio were to customers residing in New York State and
    Pennsylvania, respectively. Although automobile loans have
    generally been originated through dealers, all applications
    submitted through dealers are subject to the Company’s
    normal underwriting and loan approval



procedures. Outstanding automobile loan balances declined to
    $2.7 billion at December 31, 2010 from
    $2.9 billion at December 31, 2009.

Table 7 presents the composition of the Company’s loan and
    lease portfolio at the end of 2010, including outstanding
    balances to businesses and consumers in New York State,
    Pennsylvania, the

Mid-Atlantic

area and other states. Approximately 47% of total loans and
    leases at December 31, 2010 were to New York State
    customers, while 18% and 23% were to Pennsylvania and the
    Mid-Atlantic area customers, respectively.

Balances of investment securities averaged $8.0 billion in
    2010, compared with $8.4 billion and $9.0 billion in
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in such balances from
    2009 to 2010 largely reflects maturities and paydowns of
    mortgage-backed securities, maturities of federal agency notes
    and the impact of adopting the new accounting rules on
    January 1, 2010 as already noted, partially offset by
    purchases of mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and
    Freddie Mac during the first half of 2010, aggregating
    approximately $1.3 billion. The decline in average
    investment securities balances during 2009 as compared with 2008
    largely reflects paydowns of mortgage-backed securities,
    partially offset by the investment securities obtained in the
    Provident transaction and the impact of a first quarter 2009
    residential real estate loan securitization. The Company
    securitized approximately $141 million of residential real
    estate loans in a guaranteed mortgage securitization with Fannie
    Mae. During June and July 2008, the Company securitized
    approximately $875 million of residential real estate loans
    in guaranteed mortgage securitizations with Fannie Mae. The
    Company recognized no gain or loss on the 2009 and 2008
    securitizations because it retained all of the resulting
    securities.



The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of
    residential mortgage-backed securities and CMOs, debt securities
    issued by municipalities, capital preferred securities issued by
    certain financial institutions, and shorter-term
    U.S. Treasury and federal agency notes. When purchasing
    investment securities, the Company considers its overall
    interest-rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected
    returns relative to risks assumed, including prepayments. In
    managing the investment securities portfolio, the Company
    occasionally sells investment securities as a result of changes
    in interest rates and spreads, actual or anticipated
    prepayments, credit risk associated with a particular security,
    or as a result of restructuring its investment securities
    portfolio following completion of a business combination.

During the third quarter of 2008, the Company purchased a
    $142 million AAA-rated private placement mortgage-backed
    security that had been securitized by Bayview Financial
    Holdings, L.P. (together with its affiliates, “Bayview
    Financial”). Bayview Financial is a privately-held company
    and is the majority investor of Bayview Lending Group, LLC
    (“BLG”), a commercial mortgage lender in which
    M&T invested $300 million during 2007. Upon purchase,
    the mortgage-backed security was placed in the Company’s

held-to-maturity

portfolio, as management determined that it had the intent and
    ability to hold the security to maturity. Management
    subsequently reconsidered whether certain other similar
    mortgage-backed securities previously purchased from Bayview
    Financial and held in the Company’s

available-for-sale

portfolio should more appropriately be in the

held-to-maturity

portfolio. Concluding that it had the intent and ability to hold
    those securities to maturity as well, the Company transferred
    CMOs having a fair value of $298 million and a cost basis
    of $385 million from its

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio to the

held-to-maturity

portfolio during the third quarter of 2008.

The Company regularly reviews its investment securities for
    declines in value below amortized cost that might be
    characterized as “other than temporary.”

Other-than-temporary

impairment charges of $86 million (pre-tax) were recognized
    during 2010. Approximately $68 million of those charges
    related to privately issued CMOs backed by residential and
    commercial real estate loans, $6 million related to CDOs
    backed by trust preferred securities issued by financial
    institutions and $12 million related to American Depositary
    Shares (“ADSs”) of AIB. The AIB ADSs were obtained in
    the 2003 acquisition of a subsidiary of AIB and are held to
    satisfy options to purchase such shares granted by that
    subsidiary to certain employees. Factors contributing to the
    impairment charge included mounting credit and other losses
    incurred by AIB, the issuance of AIB common stock in lieu of
    dividend payments on certain preferred stock issuances held by
    the Irish government resulting in significant dilution of AIB
    common shareholders, and public announcements by Irish
    government officials suggesting that increased government
    support, which could further dilute AIB common shareholders, may
    be necessary.

Other-than-temporary

impairment charges of $138 million (pre-tax) were
    recognized during 2009 related to certain privately issued CMOs
    and CDOs held in the Company’s

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio. Specifically, $130 million
    of such impairment charges related to privately issued CMOs and
    CDOs backed by residential real estate loans and $8 million
    related to CDOs backed by trust preferred securities of
    financial institutions. During the third quarter of 2008, the
    Company recognized an

other-than-temporary

impairment charge of $153 million related to its holdings
    of preferred stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Additional

other-than-temporary

impairment charges of $29 million were recognized in 2008
    on CMOs backed by option adjustable rate residential mortgage
    loans (“ARMs”) and CDOs backed by trust preferred
    securities of financial institutions. Poor economic conditions,
    high unemployment and depressed real estate values are
    significant factors contributing to the recognition of the

other-than-temporary

impairment charges related to CMOs and CDOs. Based on
    management’s assessment of future cash flows associated
    with individual investment securities, as of December 31,
    2010, the Company concluded that the remaining declines
    associated with the rest of the investment securities portfolio
    were temporary in nature. A further discussion of fair values of
    investment securities is included herein under the heading
    “Capital.” Additional information about the investment
    securities portfolio is included in notes 3 and 20 of Notes
    to Financial Statements.

Other earning assets include interest-earning deposits at the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other banks, trading
    account assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell
    securities. Those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged
    $417 million in 2010, $189 million in 2009 and
    $198 million in 2008. Reflected in those balances were
    purchases of investment securities under agreements to resell,
    which averaged $214 million, $41 million and
    $96 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The



higher level of resell agreements in 2010 as compared with 2009
    and 2008 was due, in part, to the need to fulfill collateral
    requirements associated with certain municipal deposits.
    Agreements to resell securities, of which there were none
    outstanding at the 2010 and 2009 year-ends, are accounted
    for similar to collateralized loans, with changes in market
    value of the collateral monitored by the Company to ensure
    sufficient coverage. The amounts of investment securities and
    other earning assets held by the Company are influenced by such
    factors as demand for loans, which generally yield more than
    investment securities and other earning assets, ongoing
    repayments, the levels of deposits, and management of balance
    sheet size and resulting capital ratios.

The most significant source of funding for the Company is core
    deposits. During 2010 and prior years, the Company considered
    noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction
    accounts, savings deposits and domestic time deposits under
    $100,000 as core deposits. The Company’s branch network is
    its principal source of core deposits, which generally carry
    lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable
    maturities. Certificates of deposit under $100,000 generated on
    a nationwide basis by M&T Bank, N.A. were also included in
    core deposits. Average core deposits totaled $43.6 billion
    in 2010, up from $39.1 billion in 2009 and
    $31.7 billion in 2008. The K Bank acquisition transaction
    added $491 million of core deposits on November 5,
    2010, while the acquisition transactions in 2009 added
    $3.8 billion of core deposits on the respective acquisition
    dates. Average core deposits of M&T Bank, N.A. were
    $217 million in 2010, $337 million in 2009 and
    $274 million in 2008. Excluding deposits obtained in the
    acquisition transactions, the growth in core deposits from 2008
    to 2009 and from 2009 to 2010 was due, in part, to the lack of
    attractive alternative investments available to the
    Company’s customers resulting from lower interest rates and
    from the economic environment in the U.S. The low interest
    rate environment has resulted in a shift in customer savings
    trends, as average time deposits have continued to decline,
    while average noninterest-bearing deposits and savings deposits
    have increased. Funding provided by core deposits represented
    73% of average earning assets in 2010, compared with 66% and 55%
    in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Table 8 summarizes average core
    deposits in 2010 and percentage changes in the components of
    such deposits over the past two years.

A provision of the Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the
    maximum amount of FDIC deposit insurance for financial
    institutions to $250,000 per depositor. That maximum was
    $100,000 per depositor until 2009, when it was raised to
    $250,000 temporarily through December 31, 2013. As a result
    of the permanently increased deposit insurance coverage,
    effective December 31, 2010 the Company considers time
    deposits under $250,000 as core deposits. That change added
    $1.0 billion to core deposits, which aggregated
    $45.9 billion at December 31, 2010, but did not have
    an effect on average core deposits for 2010. As previously
    defined, core deposits totaled $43.1 billion at
    December 31, 2009.

Additional funding sources for the Company included domestic
    time deposits of $100,000 or more, deposits originated through
    the Company’s Cayman Islands branch office, and brokered
    deposits. Domestic time deposits over $100,000, excluding
    brokered certificates of deposit, averaged $1.7 billion in
    2010, compared with $2.6 billion in each of 2009 and 2008.
    Cayman Islands branch deposits, primarily comprised of accounts
    with balances of $100,000 or more, averaged $1.0 billion in
    2010, $1.7 billion in



2009 and $4.0 billion in 2008. Average brokered time
    deposits totaled $642 million in 2010, compared with
    $822 million in 2009 and $1.4 billion in 2008, and at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 totaled $485 million and
    $868 million, respectively. The Company also had brokered
    NOW and brokered money-market deposit accounts, which in the
    aggregate averaged $1.2 billion, $757 million and
    $218 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    significant increases in such average brokered deposit balances
    since 2008 reflect continued uncertain economic markets and the
    desire of brokerage firms to earn reasonable yields while
    ensuring that customer deposits were fully insured. Cayman
    Islands branch deposits and brokered deposits have been used by
    the Company as alternatives to short-term borrowings. Additional
    amounts of Cayman Islands branch deposits or brokered deposits
    may be added in the future depending on market conditions,
    including demand by customers and other investors for those
    deposits, and the cost of funds available from alternative
    sources at the time.

The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers,
    various Federal Home Loan Banks, the Federal Reserve and others
    as sources of funding. Average short-term borrowings were
    $1.9 billion in 2010, $2.9 billion in 2009 and
    $6.1 billion in 2008. Included in short-term borrowings
    were unsecured federal funds borrowings, which generally mature
    on the next business day, which averaged $1.7 billion,
    $1.8 billion and $4.5 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Overnight federal funds borrowings represented the
    largest component of average short-term borrowings and were
    obtained from a wide variety of banks and other financial
    institutions. Overnight federal funds borrowings totaled
    $826 million at December 31, 2010 and
    $2.1 billion at December 31, 2009. Average short-term
    borrowings during 2010, 2009 and 2008 included $31 million,
    $688 million and $682 million, respectively, of
    borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of
    New York and the FHLB of Atlanta. Also included in average
    short-term borrowings in 2009 and 2008 were secured borrowings
    with the Federal Reserve through their Term Auction Facility
    (“TAF”). Borrowings under the TAF averaged
    $268 million and $238 million during 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. There were no outstanding borrowings under the TAF
    at either December 31, 2010 or 2009. The need for
    short-term borrowings from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve
    Bank of New York has diminished with the continued growth in the
    Company’s core deposits. Also included in average
    short-term borrowings in 2008 was a $500 million revolving
    asset-backed structured borrowing secured by automobile loans
    that was paid off during late-2008. The average balance of that
    borrowing was $463 million in 2008.

Long-term borrowings averaged $9.2 billion in 2010,
    $11.1 billion in 2009 and $11.6 billion in 2008.
    Included in average long-term borrowings were amounts borrowed
    from FHLBs of $4.2 billion in 2010, $6.1 billion in
    2009 and $6.7 billion in 2008, and subordinated capital
    notes of $1.8 billion in 2010 and $1.9 billion in each
    of 2009 and 2008. The Company has utilized interest rate swap
    agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain
    components of long-term debt. As of December 31, 2010, swap
    agreements were used to hedge approximately $900 million of
    fixed rate subordinated notes. Further information on interest
    rate swap agreements is provided in note 18 of Notes to
    Financial Statements. Junior subordinated debentures associated
    with trust preferred securities that were included in average
    long-term borrowings were $1.2 billion in 2010 and
    $1.1 billion in each of 2009 and 2008. Additional
    information regarding junior subordinated debentures, as well as
    information regarding contractual maturities of long-term
    borrowings, is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial
    Statements. Also included in long-term borrowings were
    agreements to repurchase securities, which averaged
    $1.6 billion during 2010, 2009 and 2008. The agreements,
    which were entered into due to favorable rates available, have
    various repurchase dates through 2017, however, the contractual
    maturities of the underlying securities extend beyond such
    repurchase dates.

Changes in the composition of the Company’s earning assets
    and interest-bearing liabilities as discussed herein, as well as
    changes in interest rates and spreads, can impact net interest
    income. Net interest spread, or the difference between the
    taxable-equivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on
    interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.59% in 2010, compared with
    3.21% in 2009. The yield on the Company’s earning assets
    was 4.61% in each of 2010 and 2009, while the rate paid on
    interest-bearing liabilities declined 38 basis points to
    1.02% in 2010 from 1.40% in 2009. The yield on earning assets
    during 2009 was 108 basis points lower than 5.69% in 2008,
    while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased
    128 basis points from 2.68% in 2008. The improvement in
    spread in 2010 as compared with 2009 was due predominantly to
    lower average rates paid on deposits. The improvement



in spread from 2008 to 2009 reflected lower rates paid on
    deposits and borrowings. Those lower rates reflected the impact
    of the sluggish economy and the Federal Reserve’s monetary
    policies on both short-term and long-term interest rates. In
    addition, the Federal Open Market Committee noted in December
    2010 that economic conditions, including low rates of resource
    utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation
    expectations, were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels
    for the federal funds rate for an extended period of time. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Federal Reserve’s
    target range for the overnight federal funds rate was 0% to .25%.

Net interest-free funds consist largely of noninterest-bearing
    demand deposits and shareholders’ equity, partially offset
    by bank owned life insurance and non-earning assets, including
    goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets. Net
    interest-free funds averaged $14.4 billion in 2010,
    compared with $11.7 billion in 2009 and $8.1 billion
    in 2008. The significant increases in average net interest-free
    funds in 2010 and 2009 were largely the result of higher
    balances of noninterest-bearing deposits, which averaged
    $13.7 billion in 2010, $11.1 billion in 2009, and
    $7.7 billion in 2008. In connection with the Provident and
    Bradford transactions, the Company added noninterest-bearing
    deposits totaling $946 million at the respective 2009
    acquisition dates. Goodwill and core deposit and other
    intangible assets averaged $3.7 billion in 2010,
    $3.6 billion in 2009, and $3.4 billion in 2008. The
    cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged
    $1.5 billion in 2010, $1.4 billion in 2009 and
    $1.2 billion in 2008. Increases in the cash surrender value
    of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest
    income, but rather are recorded in “other revenues from
    operations.” The contribution of net interest-free funds to
    net interest margin was .25% in 2010, .28% in 2009 and .37% in
    2008. The decline in the contribution to net interest margin
    ascribed to net interest-free funds in 2010 as compared with
    2009 and in 2009 as compared with 2008 resulted largely from the
    impact of lower interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities
    used to value such contribution.

Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the
    contribution of interest-free funds as described herein, the
    Company’s net interest margin was 3.84% in 2010, compared
    with 3.49% in 2009 and 3.38% in 2008. Future changes in market
    interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition
    of the Company’s portfolios of earning assets and
    interest-bearing liabilities that result in reductions in
    spreads, could adversely impact the Company’s net interest
    income and net interest margin.

Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in
    interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income
    under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate
    risk, the Company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to
    modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its
    portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
    Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are
    generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or the
    rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The notional amount
    of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate
    risk management purposes was $900 million and
    $1.1 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. Under the terms of those swap agreements, the
    Company received payments based on the outstanding notional
    amount of the agreements at fixed rates and made payments at
    variable rates. Those swap agreements were designated as fair
    value hedges of certain fixed rate long-term borrowings and, to
    a lesser extent at December 31, 2009, certain fixed rate
    time deposits. There were no interest rate swap agreements
    designated as cash flow hedges at those respective dates.

In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the
    interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of
    the hedged item are recorded in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in
    current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair
    value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items
    represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in “other
    revenues from operations” in the Company’s
    consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, unlike
    in a fair value hedge, the effective portion of the
    derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a
    component of other comprehensive income and subsequently
    reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction
    affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is
    reported in “other revenues from operations”
    immediately. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in
    2010, 2009 and 2008 were not material to the Company’s
    results of operations. The estimated aggregate fair value of
    interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges
    represented gains of approximately $97 million at
    December 31, 2010 and $54 million at December 31,
    2009. The fair values of such swap agreements were substantially
    offset by changes in the fair values of the hedged



items. The changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap
    agreements and the hedged items primarily result from the
    effects of changing interest rates and spreads. The
    Company’s credit exposure as of December 31, 2010 with
    respect to the estimated fair value of interest rate swap
    agreements used for managing interest rate risk has been
    substantially mitigated through master netting arrangements with
    trading account interest rate contracts with the same
    counterparty as well as counterparty postings of
    $55 million of collateral with the Company. Additional
    information about swap agreements and the items being hedged is
    included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. The
    average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements
    entered into for interest rate risk management purposes, the
    related effect on net interest income and margin, and the
    weighted-average interest rates paid or received on those swap
    agreements are presented in table 9.

Provision
    for Credit Losses

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in
    management’s judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent
    in the loan and lease portfolio. A provision for credit losses
    is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed
    necessary by management. The provision for credit losses was
    $368 million in 2010, compared with $604 million in
    2009 and $412 million in 2008. Net loan charge-offs
    aggregated $346 million in 2010, $514 million in 2009
    and $383 million in 2008. Net loan charge-offs as a
    percentage of average loans outstanding were .67% in 2010,
    compared with 1.01% in 2009 and .78% in 2008. While the Company
    experienced improvement in its credit quality metrics during
    2010, the levels of the provision subsequent to 2007 have been
    higher than historical levels, reflecting a pronounced downturn
    in the U.S. economy and significant deterioration in the
    residential real estate market that began in early-2007.
    Declining real estate valuations and high levels of
    delinquencies and charge-offs significantly affected the quality
    of the Company’s residential real estate-related loan
    portfolios. Specifically, the Company’s Alt-A residential
    real estate loan portfolio and its residential real estate
    builder and developer loan portfolio experienced the majority of
    the credit problems related to the turmoil in the residential
    real estate marketplace. The Company also experienced higher
    levels of commercial and consumer loan charge-offs over the past
    three years due to, among other things, higher unemployment
    levels and the recessionary economy. A summary of the
    Company’s loan charge-offs, provision and allowance for
    credit losses is presented in table 10 and in note 5 of
    Notes to Financial Statements.

Loans acquired in connection with the 2010 and 2009 acquisition
    transactions were recorded at fair value with no carry-over of
    any previously recorded allowance for credit losses. Determining
    the fair value of the acquired loans required estimating cash
    flows expected to be collected on the loans and discounting
    those cash flows at current interest rates. The excess of cash
    flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is
    recognized as interest income over the remaining lives of the
    loans. The difference between contractually required payments at
    acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at
    acquisition reflects estimated future credit losses and other
    contractually required payments that the Company does not expect
    to collect. The Company regularly evaluates the reasonableness
    of its cash flow projections. Any decreases to the expected cash
    flows require the Company to evaluate the need for an additional
    allowance for credit losses and could lead to charge-offs of
    acquired loan balances. Any significant increases in expected
    cash flows result in additional interest income to be recognized
    over the then-remaining lives of the loans.



Nonaccrual loans totaled $1.24 billion or 2.38% of
    outstanding loans and leases at December 31, 2010, compared
    with $1.33 billion or 2.56% at December 31, 2009 and
    $755 million or 1.54% at December 31, 2008. The
    decline in nonaccrual loans at the end of 2010 as compared with
    December 31, 2009 was largely attributable to the impact of
    charge-offs, individually significant payments made in 2010 by a
    borrower that operates retirement communities and by a borrower
    that is a consumer finance and credit insurance company, and the
    transfer to real estate and other foreclosed assets of
    $98 million of collateral related to a commercial real
    estate loan that was placed in nonaccrual status during the
    fourth quarter of 2009. Those reductions were partially offset
    by additional loans being transferred to nonaccrual status. In
    particular, in the fourth quarter of 2010 such transfers
    included an $80 million relationship with a residential
    builder and developer and $66 million of commercial
    construction loans to an owner/operator of retirement and
    assisted living facilities. Major factors contributing to the
    rise in nonaccrual loans from December 31, 2008 to the
    2009 year-end were a $209 million increase in
    commercial loans and leases and a $319 million increase in
    commercial real estate loans, including a $113 million rise
    in loans to builders and developers of residential real estate.
    The continuing turbulence in the residential real estate
    marketplace has resulted in depressed real estate values and
    high levels of delinquencies, both for loans to consumers and
    loans to builders and developers of residential real estate. The
    sluggish U.S. economy has resulted in generally higher
    levels of nonaccrual loans than historically experienced by the
    Company.

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were
    $270 million or .52% of total loans and leases at
    December 31, 2010, compared with $208 million or .40%
    at December 31, 2009 and $159 million or .32% at
    December 31, 2008. Those loans included loans guaranteed by
    government-related entities of $214 million,
    $193 million and $114 million at December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Such guaranteed loans
    included

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company that
    were repurchased to reduce associated servicing costs, including
    a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that
    had not been received from individual mortgagors. Despite the
    loans being purchased by the Company, the insurance or guarantee
    by the applicable government-related entity remains in force.
    The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans are
    fully guaranteed by government-related entities and totaled
    $191 million at December 31, 2010, $176 million
    at December 31, 2009 and $108 million at
    December 31, 2008. Loans past due 90 days or more and
    accruing interest that were guaranteed by government-related
    entities also included foreign commercial and industrial loans
    supported by the Export-Import Bank of the United States that
    totaled $11 million at December 31, 2010,
    $13 million at December 31, 2009 and $5 million
    at December 31, 2008. A summary of nonperforming assets and
    certain past due, renegotiated and impaired loan data and credit
    quality ratios is presented in table 11.

Accruing loans that were

    value.

Loans obtained in the 2010 and 2009 acquisition transactions
    that were impaired at the date of acquisition were recorded at
    estimated fair value and are generally delinquent in payments,
    but, in accordance with GAAP the Company continues to accrue
    interest income on such loans based on the estimated expected
    cash flows associated with the loans. The carrying amount of
    such loans was $97 million at December 31, 2010, or
    approximately .2% of total loans.

In an effort to assist borrowers, the Company modified the terms
    of select loans secured by residential real estate, largely from
    the Company’s portfolio of Alt-A loans. Included in loans
    outstanding at December 31, 2010 were $308 million of
    such modified loans, of which $117 million were classified
    as nonaccrual. The remaining modified loans have demonstrated
    payment capability consistent with the modified terms and,
    accordingly, were classified as renegotiated loans and were
    accruing interest at the 2010 year-end. Loan modifications
    included such actions as the extension of loan maturity dates
    (generally from thirty to forty years) and the lowering of
    interest rates and monthly payments. The objective of the
    modifications was to increase loan repayments by customers and
    thereby reduce net charge-offs. In accordance with GAAP, the
    modified loans are included in impaired loans for purposes of
    determining the level of the allowance for credit losses.
    Modified residential real estate loans totaled $292 million
    at December 31, 2009, of which $108 million were in
    nonaccrual status. The Company has not generally granted loan
    modifications that involved a reduction of loan principal
    balance.

Net charge-offs of commercial loans and leases totaled
    $65 million in 2010, $172 million in 2009 and
    $94 million in 2008. The higher charge-offs experienced
    during 2009 were largely the result of a few individually
    significant charge-offs in that year, including a
    $45 million partial charge-off of an unsecured loan to a
    single customer in the commercial real estate sector and a
    $42 million partial charge-off of a relationship with an
    operator of retirement communities. Commercial loans and leases
    in nonaccrual status were $187 million at December 31,
    2010, $322 million at December 31, 2009 and
    $114 million at



December 31, 2008. The decline from December 31, 2009
    to the 2010 year-end reflects $62 million of payments
    related to a single borrower that operates retirement
    communities and the payoffs of a $37 million loan to a
    consumer finance and credit insurance company and a
    $36 million loan to a borrower in the commercial real
    estate sector. The rise in nonaccrual commercial loans from the
    2008 year-end to December 31, 2009 reflects the impact
    of general economic conditions on borrowers’ abilities to
    repay loans. Specifically contributing to that increase were the
    additions of the relationship to a borrower that operates
    retirement communities ($41 million), a $37 million
    loan to a consumer finance and credit insurance company, the
    loan to a borrower in the commercial real estate sector
    ($36 million) and a $22 million loan to a business in
    the health care sector.

Net charge-offs of commercial real estate loans during 2010,
    2009 and 2008 were $118 million, $121 million and
    $112 million, respectively. Reflected in 2010’s
    charge-offs were $71 million of loans to residential real
    estate builders and developers, compared with $92 million
    in 2009 and $100 million in 2008. Commercial real estate
    loans classified as nonaccrual totaled $682 million at
    December 31, 2010, compared with $638 million at
    December 31, 2009 and $319 million at
    December 31, 2008. The increase in such loans in 2010
    reflects a $40 million rise in nonperforming loans to
    homebuilders and developers and the addition of $66 million
    of construction loans to an owner/operator of retirement and
    assisted living facilities. Those factors were partially offset
    by the removal from this category of a loan collateralized by
    real estate in New York City that was initially placed on
    nonaccrual status in the fourth quarter of 2009. Following a
    $7 million charge-off, the remaining $98 million of
    that loan’s carrying value was transferred to “Real
    Estate and Other Foreclosed Assets” in the second quarter
    of 2010. Contributing to the rise in commercial real estate
    loans in nonaccrual status from December 31, 2008 to the
    2009 year-end were an increase of $113 million in such
    loans to residential homebuilders and developers and the loan
    collateralized by real estate in New York City
    ($104 million). At December 31, 2010 and 2009, loans
    to residential homebuilders and developers classified as
    nonaccrual aggregated $362 million and $322 million,
    respectively, compared with $209 million at
    December 31, 2008. Information about the location of
    nonaccrual and charged-off loans to residential real estate
    builders and developers as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 is presented in table 12.

Includes approximately
    $53 million of loans not secured by real estate, of which
    approximately $16 million are in nonaccrual
    status.

Residential real estate loans charged off, net of recoveries,
    were $61 million in 2010, $92 million in 2009 and
    $63 million in 2008. Nonaccrual residential real estate
    loans at the end of 2010 totaled $279 million, compared
    with $281 million and $256 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Depressed real
    estate values and high levels of delinquencies have contributed
    to the higher than historical levels of residential real estate
    loans classified as nonaccrual at the three most recent
    year-ends and to the elevated levels of charge-offs, largely in
    the Company’s Alt-A portfolio. Net charge-offs of Alt-



A loans were $34 million in 2010, $52 million in 2009
    and $44 million in 2008. Nonaccrual Alt-A loans aggregated
    $106 million at December 31, 2010, compared with
    $112 million and $125 million at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. Residential real estate loans past
    due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled
    $192 million, $178 million and $108 million at
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. A
    substantial portion of such amounts related to guaranteed loans
    repurchased from government-related entities. Information about
    the location of nonaccrual and charged-off residential real
    estate loans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010
    is presented in table 13.

Net charge-offs of consumer loans during 2010 were
    $102 million, representing .87% of average consumer loans
    and leases outstanding, compared with $129 million or 1.10%
    in 2009 and $114 million or 1.03% in 2008. Automobile loans
    represented the most significant category of consumer loan
    charge-offs during the past three years. Net charge-offs of
    automobile loans were $32 million during 2010,
    $56 million during 2009 and $51 million during 2008.
    Consumer loan charge-offs also included recreational vehicle
    loans of $23 million, $25 million and $21 million
    during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and home equity loans
    and lines of credit secured by

one-to-four

family residential properties of $31 million during each of
    2010 and 2008, and $39 million during 2009. Nonaccrual
    consumer loans were $91 million at each of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, representing .79% and .75%,
    respectively, of outstanding consumer loans, compared with
    $66 million or .60% at December 31, 2008. Included in
    nonaccrual consumer loans and leases at the 2010, 2009 and
    2008 year-ends were: indirect automobile loans of
    $32 million, $39 million and $21 million,
    respectively; recreational vehicle loans of $13 million,
    $15 million and $14 million; and outstanding balances
    of home equity loans and lines of credit, including second lien,
    Alt-A loans, of $43 million, $33 million and
    $29 million, respectively. At the 2010, 2009 and
    2008 year-ends, consumer loans and leases delinquent

30-89 days

totaled $120 million, $141 million and
    $118 million, respectively, or 1.04%, 1.17%, and 1.07% of
    outstanding consumer loans. Consumer loans past due 90 days
    or more and accruing interest totaled $4 million at each of
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 and
    $1 million at December 31, 2008. Information about the
    location of nonaccrual and charged-off home equity loans and
    lines of credit as of and for the year ended December 31,
    2010 is presented in table 13.

Information about past due and nonaccrual loans as of
    December 31, 2010 is also included in note 4 of Notes
    to Financial Statements.

Management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for
    credit losses by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and
    lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing
    economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial
    condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in
    which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the
    value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of
    any guarantees or indemnifications. Management evaluated the
    impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic
    conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment
    obligations when quantifying the Company’s exposure to
    credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the Company’s
    allowance for such losses as of each reporting date. Factors
    also considered by management when performing its assessment, in
    addition to general economic conditions and the other factors
    described above, included, but were not limited to: (i) the
    impact of declining residential real estate values in the
    Company’s portfolio of loans to residential real estate
    builders and developers; (ii) the repayment performance
    associated with the Company’s portfolio of Alt-A
    residential mortgage loans; (iii) the concentrations of
    commercial real estate loans in the Company’s loan
    portfolio; (iv) the amount of commercial and industrial
    loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the
    New York City metropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that
    have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality
    than the vast majority of other regions of the country; and
    (v) the size of the Company’s portfolio of loans to
    individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher
    net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than other
    loan types. The level of the allowance is adjusted based on the
    results of management’s analysis.

Management cautiously and conservatively evaluated the allowance
    for credit losses as of December 31, 2010 in light of:
    (i) residential real estate values and the level of
    delinquencies of residential real estate loans; (ii) the
    sluggish economic conditions in many of the markets served by
    the Company; (iii) continuing weakness in industrial
    employment in upstate New York and central Pennsylvania;
    (iv) the significant subjectivity involved in commercial
    real estate valuations for properties located in areas with
    stagnant or low growth economies; and (v) the amount of
    loan growth experienced by the Company. Considerable concerns
    exist about economic conditions in both national and
    international markets; the level and volatility of energy
    prices; a weakened housing market; the troubled state of
    financial and credit markets; Federal Reserve positioning of
    monetary policy; high levels of unemployment; the impact of
    economic conditions on businesses’ operations and abilities
    to repay loans; continued stagnant population growth in the
    upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions; and continued
    uncertainty about possible responses to state and local
    government budget deficits. Although the U.S. economy
    experienced recession and weak economic conditions during recent
    years, the impact of those conditions was not as pronounced on
    borrowers in the traditionally slower growth or stagnant regions
    of upstate New York and central Pennsylvania. Approximately
    one-half of the Company’s loans are to customers in upstate
    New York and Pennsylvania. Home prices in upstate New York and
    central Pennsylvania were largely unchanged in 2009 and 2010, in
    contrast to declines in values in many other regions of the
    country. Therefore, despite the conditions, as previously
    described, the most severe credit issues experienced by the
    Company have been centered around residential real estate,
    including loans to builders and developers of residential real
    estate, in areas other than New York State and Pennsylvania. In
    response, the Company has conducted detailed reviews of all
    loans to residential real estate builders and developers that
    exceeded $2.5 million. Those credit reviews often resulted
    in commencement of intensified collection efforts, including
    foreclosure. During 2009 and 2010, the Company also experienced
    increases in nonaccrual commercial real estate loans, in part
    due to builders and developers of residential real estate. The
    Company utilizes an extensive loan grading system which is
    applied to all commercial and commercial real estate loans. On a
    quarterly basis, the Company’s loan review department
    reviews commercial loans and commercial real estate loans that
    are classified as “Special Mention” or worse. Meetings
    are held with loan officers and their managers, workout
    specialists and Senior Management to discuss each of the
    relationships. Borrower-specific information is reviewed,
    including operating results, future cash flows, recent
    developments and the borrower’s outlook, and other
    pertinent data. The timing and extent of potential losses,
    considering collateral valuation, and the Company’s
    potential courses of action are reviewed. To the extent that
    these loans are collateral-dependent, they are evaluated based
    on



the fair value of the loan’s collateral as estimated at or
    near the financial statement date. As the quality of a loan
    deteriorates to the point of classifying the loan as
    “Special Mention,” the process of obtaining updated
    collateral valuation information is usually initiated, unless it
    is not considered warranted given factors such as the relative
    size of the loan, the characteristics of the collateral or the
    age of the last valuation. In those cases where current
    appraisals may not yet be available, prior appraisals are
    utilized with adjustments, as deemed necessary, for estimates of
    subsequent declines in value as determined by line of business

and/or

loan
    workout personnel in the respective geographic regions. Those
    adjustments are reviewed and assessed for reasonableness by the
    Company’s loan review department. Accordingly, for real
    estate collateral securing larger commercial and commercial real
    estate loans, estimated collateral values are based on current
    appraisals and estimates of value. For non-real estate loans,
    collateral is assigned a discounted estimated liquidation value
    and, depending on the nature of the collateral, is verified
    through field exams or other procedures. In assessing
    collateral, real estate and non-real estate values are reduced
    by an estimate of selling costs. With regard to residential real
    estate loans, the Company expanded its collections and loan
    work-out staff and further refined its loss identification and
    estimation techniques by reference to loan performance and house
    price depreciation data in specific areas of the country where
    collateral that was securing the Company’s residential real
    estate loans was located. For residential real estate-related
    loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, the
    excess of the loan balance over the net realizable value of the
    property collateralizing the loan is charged-off when the loan
    becomes 150 days delinquent. That charge-off is based on
    recent indications of value from external parties.

Factors that influence the Company’s credit loss experience
    include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and
    consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real
    estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the
    Company’s real estate loan portfolios. Reflecting the
    factors and conditions as described herein, the Company has
    experienced historically high levels of nonaccrual loans and net
    charge-offs of residential real estate-related loans, including
    first and second lien Alt-A mortgage loans and loans to builders
    and developers of residential real estate. The Company has also
    experienced higher than historical levels of nonaccrual
    commercial real estate loans in 2009 and 2010. Commercial real
    estate valuations can be highly subjective, as they are based
    upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly
    affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in
    business climate, economic conditions, interest rates, and, in
    many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other
    occupants of the real property. Similarly, residential real
    estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the
    availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, and
    general economic conditions affecting consumers.

In ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses,
    the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled
    credits identified through both normal and detailed or
    intensified credit review processes and also estimates losses
    inherent in other loans and leases. In quantifying incurred
    losses, the Company considers the factors and uses the
    techniques described herein. For purposes of determining the
    level of the allowance for credit losses, the Company segments
    its loan and lease portfolio by loan type. The amount of
    specific loss components in the Company’s loan and lease
    portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of
    commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in nonaccrual
    status. Measurement of the specific loss components is typically
    based on expected future cash flows, collateral values and other
    factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay.
    Except for consumer loans and leases and residential real estate
    loans that are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and
    are evaluated collectively, the Company considers a loan to be
    impaired when, based on current information and events, it is
    probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts
    according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the
    loan is delinquent 90 days or more and has been placed in
    nonaccrual status. Those impaired loans are evaluated for
    specific loss components. Modified loans, including smaller
    balance homogenous loans, that are considered to be troubled
    debt restructurings are evaluated for impairment giving
    consideration to the impact of the modified loan terms on the
    present value of the loan’s expected cash flows. Loans less
    than 90 days delinquent are deemed to have a minimal delay
    in payment and are generally not considered to be impaired.



The inherent base level loss components of the Company’s
    allowance for credit losses are generally determined by applying
    loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and
    management’s classification of such loans under the
    Company’s loan grading system. The Company utilizes an
    extensive loan grading system which is applied to all commercial
    and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers are
    responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans
    based on standards outlined in the Company’s Credit Policy.
    Internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the
    Company’s loan review department to ensure consistency and
    strict adherence to the prescribed standards. Loan balances
    utilized in the inherent base level loss component computations
    exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are
    maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss component factors that
    reflect the Company’s loss estimate for each group of loans
    and leases. Factors considered in assigning loan grades and loss
    component factors include borrower-specific information related
    to expected future cash flows and operating results, collateral
    values, financial condition, payment status, and other
    information; levels of and trends in portfolio charge-offs and
    recoveries; levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and
    impaired loans; changes in the risk profile of specific
    portfolios; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of
    changes in credit concentrations; and observed trends and
    practices in the banking industry. In assessing the overall
    adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, management also
    gives consideration to such factors as customer, industry and
    geographic concentrations as well as national and local economic
    conditions including: (i) the comparatively poorer economic
    conditions and unfavorable business climate in many market
    regions served by the Company, specifically upstate New York and
    central Pennsylvania, that result in such regions generally
    experiencing significantly poorer economic growth and vitality
    as compared with much of the rest of the country;
    (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding loan type,
    collateral type and geographic location; and
    (iii) additional risk associated with the Company’s
    portfolio of consumer loans, in particular automobile loans and
    leases, which generally have higher rates of loss than other
    types of collateralized loans.

In evaluating collateral, the Company relies extensively on
    internally and externally prepared valuations. In recent years,
    valuations of residential real estate, which are usually based
    on sales of comparable properties, declined significantly in
    many regions across the United States. Commercial real estate
    valuations also refer to sales of comparable properties but
    oftentimes are based on calculations that utilize many
    assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective.
    Specifically, commercial real estate values can be significantly
    affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in
    business climate, economic conditions and interest rates, and,
    in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other
    occupants of the real property. Additionally, management is
    aware that there is oftentimes a delay in the recognition of
    credit quality changes in loans and, as a result, in changes to
    assigned loan grades due to time delays in the manifestation and
    reporting of underlying events that impact credit quality.
    Accordingly, loss estimates derived from the inherent base level
    loss component computation are adjusted for current national and
    local economic conditions and trends. Economic indicators in the
    most significant market regions served by the Company were weak,
    but stabilizing, during 2010, indicative of a sluggish economy.
    For example, during 2010, private sector employment declined in
    most market areas served by the Company. Such declines were
    generally similar to the national average decline of 0.5%.
    Private sector employment in 2010 declined 0.5% in upstate New
    York, 0.7% in areas of Pennsylvania served by the Company and
    0.3% in Maryland, but increased by 0.4% in Greater Washington
    D.C. Private employment in areas of Pennsylvania served by the
    Company declined by 4.2% in 2009, while employment in the
    Maryland and Greater Washington D.C. regions fell by 4.0% and
    2.9%, respectively, compared with the national average of a 5.2%
    decrease. In New York City, private sector employment increased
    by .2% in 2010, however, unemployment rates there remain
    elevated and are expected to continue at above historical levels
    during 2011. At the end of 2010 there remained significant
    concerns about the pace of national economic recovery from the
    recession, high unemployment, real estate valuations, high
    levels of consumer indebtedness, volatile energy prices and
    state and local government budget deficits. Those factors are
    expected to act as a significant drag on the national economy in
    2011.

The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss
    components together comprise the total base level or
    “allocated” allowance for credit losses. Such
    allocated portion of the allowance represents management’s
    assessment of losses existing in specific larger balance loans
    that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other
    loans that are not individually analyzed. In addition, the



Company has always provided an inherent unallocated portion of
    the allowance that is intended to recognize probable losses that
    are not otherwise identifiable. The inherent unallocated
    allowance includes management’s subjective determination of
    amounts necessary for such things as the possible use of
    imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the
    allowance and other risks associated with the Company’s
    loan portfolio which may not be specifically allocable.

A comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for
    each of the past five year-ends is presented in table 14.
    Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on
    information available to management at the time of each year-end
    assessment and using the methodology described herein.
    Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category
    as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in
    management’s estimate of specific loss components and
    inherent base level loss components, including the impact of
    delinquencies and nonaccrual loans. As described in note 5
    of Notes to Financial Statements, loans considered impaired were
    $1.3 billion at each of December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009. The allocated portion of the allowance
    for credit losses related to impaired loans totaled
    $214 million at December 31, 2010 and
    $244 million at December 31, 2009. The unallocated
    portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to .13% of
    gross loans outstanding at each of December 31, 2010 and
    2009. The declines in the unallocated portion of the allowance
    since 2007 reflect management’s continued refinement of its
    loss estimation techniques, which has increased the precision of
    its calculation of the allocated portion of the allowance for
    credit losses. However, given the inherent imprecision in the
    many estimates used in the determination of the allocated
    portion of the allowance, management deliberately remained
    cautious and conservative in establishing the overall allowance
    for credit losses. Given the Company’s high concentration
    of real estate loans and considering the other factors already
    discussed herein, management considers the allocated and
    unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be
    prudent and reasonable. Furthermore, the Company’s
    allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses
    from any loan or lease category. Additional information about
    the allowance for credit losses is included in note 5 of
    Notes to Financial Statements.

Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at
    December 31, 2010 was adequate to absorb credit losses
    inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for
    credit losses was $903 million or 1.74% of total loans and
    leases at December 31, 2010, compared with
    $878 million or 1.69% at December 31, 2009 and
    $788 million or 1.61% at December 31, 2008. The ratio
    of the allowance to total loans and leases at December 31,
    2010 reflects the impact of loans obtained in 2010 associated
    with the K Bank transaction and in 2009 from the Provident and
    Bradford acquisition transactions that have been recorded at
    estimated fair value based on estimated future cash flows
    expected to be received on those loans. Those cash flows reflect
    the impact of expected defaults on customer repayment
    performance. As a result, and as required by GAAP, there was no
    carry-over of the allowance for credit losses recorded by K
    Bank, Provident or Bradford. The allowance for credit losses at



December 31, 2010 related to the Company’s legacy
    loans (that is, total loans excluding loans acquired during 2010
    in the K Bank transaction and during 2009 in the Provident and
    Bradford transactions) expressed as a percentage of such legacy
    loans was 1.82%, compared with 1.83% at December 31, 2009.
    The level of the allowance reflects management’s evaluation
    of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and
    considering the factors as described herein and the
    Company’s loan charge-off policies. Should the various
    credit factors considered by management in establishing the
    allowance for credit losses change and should management’s
    assessment of losses inherent in the loan portfolios also
    change, the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans
    could increase or decrease in future periods. The ratio of the
    allowance to nonaccrual loans at the end of 2010, 2009 and 2008
    was 73%, 66% and 104%, respectively. Given the Company’s
    position as a secured lender and its practice of charging off
    loan balances when collection is deemed doubtful, that ratio and
    changes in that ratio are generally not an indicative measure of
    the adequacy of the Company’s allowance for credit losses,
    nor does management rely upon that ratio in assessing the
    adequacy of the allowance. The level of the allowance reflects
    management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as
    of each respective date.

In establishing the allowance for credit losses, management
    follows the methodology described herein, including taking a
    conservative view of borrowers’ abilities to repay loans.
    The establishment of the allowance is extremely subjective and
    requires management to make many judgments about borrower,
    industry, regional and national economic health and performance.
    In order to present examples of the possible impact on the
    allowance from certain changes in credit quality factors, the
    Company assumed the following scenarios for possible
    deterioration of credit quality:

•

For consumer loans and leases considered smaller balance
    homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 20 basis
    point increase in loss factors;

•

For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and
    lines of credit, also considered smaller balance homogenous
    loans and evaluated collectively, a 15% increase in estimated
    inherent losses; and

•

For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, which are
    not similar in nature, a migration of loans to lower-ranked risk
    grades resulting in a 20% increase in the balance of classified
    credits in each risk grade.

For possible improvement in credit quality factors, the
    scenarios assumed were:

•

For consumer loans and leases, a 10 basis point decrease in
    loss factors;

•

For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and
    lines of credit, a 5% decrease in estimated inherent
    losses; and

•

For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, a
    migration of loans to higher-ranked risk grades resulting in a
    5% decrease in the balance of classified credits in each risk
    grade.

The scenario analyses resulted in an additional $79 million
    that could be identifiable under the assumptions for credit
    deterioration, whereas under the assumptions for credit
    improvement a $24 million reduction could occur. These
    examples are only a few of numerous reasonably possible
    scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of
    the allowance for credit losses based on changes in assumptions
    and other factors.

Investor-owned commercial real estate loans secured by retail
    properties in the New York City metropolitan area represented 4%
    of loans outstanding at December 31, 2010. The Company had
    no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry
    that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2010.
    Outstanding loans to foreign borrowers were $107 million at
    December 31, 2010, or .2% of total loans and leases.

Real estate and other foreclosed assets totaled to
    $220 million at December 31, 2010, compared with
    $95 million at December 31, 2009 and $100 million
    at December 31, 2008. The increase in 2010 resulted from
    the second quarter addition of $98 million of the
    previously discussed commercial real estate property located in
    New York City, and from higher residential real estate loan
    defaults and additions from residential real estate development
    projects. At December 31, 2010, exclusive of that
    $98 million commercial real estate property, 74% of the
    remaining $122 million of foreclosed assets were comprised
    of residential real estate-related properties.



Other
    Income

Other income totaled $1.11 billion in 2010, compared with
    $1.05 billion in 2009. Reflected in such income were net
    losses on investment securities (including

other-than-temporary

impairment losses), which totaled to $84 million in 2010
    and $137 million in 2009. During 2010,

other-than-temporary

impairment charges of $86 million were recognized related
    to certain of the Company’s privately issued CMOs, CDOs and
    AIB ADSs. Similar charges of $138 million were recognized
    in 2009 related to certain of the Company’s privately
    issued CMOs and CDOs. Also, reflected in noninterest income were
    the $28 million gain recognized on the K Bank acquisition
    transaction in 2010 and the $29 million gain recognized on
    the Bradford acquisition transaction in 2009. Excluding gains
    and losses from bank investment securities and those
    acquisition-related gains, noninterest income was
    $1.16 billion in each of 2010 and 2009. Higher revenues in
    2010 related to commercial mortgage banking, service charges on
    deposit accounts, credit-related fees and other revenues from
    operations were offset by lower revenues from residential
    mortgage banking, brokerage services and M&T’s trust
    business.

Other income in 2009 was 12% higher than the $939 million
    earned in 2008. As noted above, reflected in other income in
    2009 were net losses from bank investment securities of
    $137 million, compared with net losses of $148 million
    in 2008 (including $182 million of

other-than-temporary

impairment losses). The impairment charges recognized in 2008
    related to certain of the Company’s CMOs, CDOs and
    preferred stock holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
    Excluding the impact of securities gains and losses from both
    years and the $29 million gain associated with the Bradford
    acquisition transaction in 2009, other income of
    $1.16 billion in 2009 was 6% higher than $1.09 billion
    in 2008. Contributing to that improvement were higher mortgage
    banking revenues, service charges on deposit accounts obtained
    in the 2009 acquisition transactions and a smaller loss related
    to M&T’s equity in the operations of BLG. Partially
    offsetting those factors were declines in trust and brokerage
    services income.

Mortgage banking revenues were $185 million in 2010,
    $208 million in 2009 and $156 million in 2008.
    Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both residential and
    commercial mortgage banking activities. The Company’s
    involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities includes
    the origination, sales and servicing of loans under the
    multi-family loan programs of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the
    U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Residential mortgage banking revenues, consisting of realized
    gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan
    servicing rights, unrealized gains and losses on residential
    mortgage loans held for sale and related commitments,
    residential mortgage loan servicing fees, and other residential
    mortgage loan-related fees and income, were $127 million in
    2010, $166 million in 2009 and $117 million in 2008.
    The decline in such revenues in 2010 from 2009 reflects the
    impact of lower origination volumes, the Company’s decision
    to retain for portfolio a higher proportion of originated loans
    rather than selling them, and increased costs associated with
    obligations to repurchase certain mortgage loans previously
    sold. The higher revenues in 2009 as compared with 2008 were
    attributable to significantly higher origination activity, due
    largely to refinancing of loans by consumers in response to
    relatively low interest rates, and wider margins associated with
    that activity.

New commitments to originate residential mortgage loans to be
    sold were approximately $4.1 billion in 2010, compared with
    $6.1 billion in 2009 and $4.8 billion in 2008.
    Similarly, closed residential mortgage loans originated for sale
    to other investors totaled approximately $4.2 billion in
    2010, $6.2 billion in 2009 and $4.4 billion in 2008.
    Realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan
    servicing rights (net of the impact of costs associated with
    obligations to repurchase mortgage loans originated for sale)
    and recognized net unrealized gains or losses attributable to
    residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to
    originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans totaled
    to a gain of $43 million in 2010, compared with gains of
    $79 million in 2009 and $31 million in 2008.

The Company is contractually obligated to repurchase previously
    sold loans that do not ultimately meet investor sale criteria
    related to underwriting procedures or loan documentation. When
    required to do so, the Company may reimburse loan purchasers for
    losses incurred or may repurchase certain loans. Since early
    2007 when the Company recognized a $6 million charge
    related to declines in market values of previously sold
    residential real estate loans that the Company could have been
    required to repurchase,



the Company has regularly reduced residential mortgage banking
    revenues by an estimate for losses related to its obligations to
    loan purchasers. The amount of those charges varies based on the
    volume of loans sold, the level of reimbursement requests
    received from loan purchasers and estimates of losses that may
    be associated with previously sold loans. During 2010 the
    Company received increased requests from loan purchasers for
    reimbursement. The Company has considered those requests in
    assessing the estimated impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements. Residential mortgage banking
    revenues during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were reduced by
    approximately $30 million, $10 million and
    $4 million, respectively, related to the actual or
    anticipated settlement of repurchase obligations from loan
    purchasers.

Loans held for sale that are secured by residential real estate
    totaled $341 million and $530 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Commitments to
    sell residential mortgage loans and commitments to originate
    residential mortgage loans for sale at pre-determined rates were
    $458 million and $162 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2010, $936 million and $631 million,
    respectively, at December 31, 2009 and $898 million
    and $871 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008.
    Net unrealized gains on residential mortgage loans held for
    sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate
    loans for sale were $11 million and $15 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and
    $6 million at December 31, 2008. Changes in such net
    unrealized gains and losses are recorded in mortgage banking
    revenues and resulted in a net decrease in revenue of
    $5 million in 2010 and net increases in revenue of
    $9 million and $13 million in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Late in the third quarter of 2010, the Company began to
    originate certain residential real estate loans to be held in
    its loan portfolio, rather than continuing to sell such loans.
    The loans conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting
    guidelines. Retaining these residential real estate loans is
    expected to largely offset the impact of the declining
    investment securities portfolio resulting from maturities and
    pay-downs of residential mortgage-backed securities while
    providing high quality assets earning a reasonable yield. That
    decision resulted in a reduction of residential mortgage banking
    revenues of approximately $11 million in 2010.

Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others
    were $80 million in 2010, compared with $82 million in
    2009 and $81 million in 2008. Included in such servicing
    revenues were amounts related to purchased servicing rights
    associated with small balance commercial mortgage loans totaling
    $27 million in 2010 and $29 million in each of 2009
    and 2008. Residential mortgage loans serviced for others
    aggregated $21.1 billion at December 31, 2010,
    $21.4 billion a year earlier and $21.3 billion at
    December 31, 2008, including the small balance commercial
    mortgage loans noted above of approximately $5.2 billion,
    $5.5 billion and $5.9 billion at December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capitalized residential
    mortgage loan servicing assets, net of any applicable valuation
    allowance for possible impairment, totaled $118 million at
    December 31, 2010, compared with $141 million and
    $143 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The valuation allowance for possible impairment of
    capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets totaled $50
    thousand and $22 million at the 2009 and
    2008 year-ends, respectively. There was no similar
    valuation allowance at December 31, 2010. Included in
    capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets were purchased
    servicing rights associated with the small balance commercial
    mortgage loans noted above of $26 million, $40 million
    and $58 million at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Servicing rights for the small balance commercial
    mortgage loans were purchased from BLG or its affiliates. In
    addition, at December 31, 2010 capitalized servicing rights
    included $9 million of servicing rights for
    $3.6 billion of residential real estate loans that were
    purchased from affiliates of BLG. Additional information about
    the Company’s relationship with BLG and its affiliates is
    provided in note 25 of Notes to Financial Statements.
    Additional information about the Company’s capitalized
    residential mortgage loan servicing assets, including
    information about the calculation of estimated fair value, is
    presented in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $58 million in
    2010, $42 million in 2009 and $39 million in 2008.
    Revenues from loan origination and sales activities were
    $40 million in 2010 and $27 million in each of 2009
    and 2008. The higher revenues in 2010 reflected higher loan
    origination volumes. As compared with 2008, improved margins in
    2009 were offset by a decline in loan origination volume.
    Commercial mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors
    totaled approximately



$1.6 billion in 2010, compared with $1.1 billion in
    2009 and $1.4 billion in 2008. Loan servicing revenues
    totaled $18 million in 2010, $15 million in 2009 and
    $12 million in 2008. Capitalized commercial mortgage loan
    servicing assets aggregated $43 million at
    December 31, 2010, $33 million at December 31,
    2009 and $26 million at December 31, 2008. Commercial
    mortgage loans serviced for other investors totaled
    $8.1 billion, $7.1 billion and $6.4 billion at
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and
    included $1.6 billion, $1.3 billion and
    $1.2 billion, respectively, of loan balances for which
    investors had recourse to the Company if such balances are
    ultimately uncollectible. Commitments to sell commercial
    mortgage loans and commitments to originate commercial mortgage
    loans for sale were $276 million and $73 million,
    respectively, at December 31, 2010, $303 million and
    $180 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009 and
    $408 million and $252 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2008. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale
    totaled $204 million, $123 million and
    $156 million at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Service charges on deposit accounts rose 2% to $478 million
    in 2010 from $469 million in 2009. That improvement
    resulted largely from the full-year impact of 2009 acquisition
    transactions and increased debit card fees resulting from higher
    transaction volumes. Those positive factors were partially
    offset by the impact of new regulations that went into effect
    during the third quarter of 2010. The Federal Reserve and other
    bank regulators have adopted regulations requiring expanded
    disclosure of overdraft and other fees assessed to consumers and
    have issued guidance that requires consumers to elect to be
    subject to fees for certain deposit account transactions which
    began on July 1, 2010 for new customers and on
    August 15, 2010 for pre-existing customers. The Company
    engaged in an outreach program to customers, particularly those
    who are frequent users of overdraft services, to ensure they
    understood such services and to allow them the opportunity to
    continue to receive those services. Nevertheless, the Company
    estimates that these regulations resulted in a reduction of
    service charges on deposit accounts in 2010 of approximately
    $35 million and expects that the full-year 2011 impact of
    the regulations on such revenues will be approximately
    $65 million to $80 million. Deposit account service
    charges in 2008 were $431 million. The 9% increase in those
    revenues in 2009 as compared with 2008 was predominately due to
    the impact of the Provident acquisition in May 2009. As part of
    the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has proposed new
    regulations related to debit card interchange rates that would
    also have a significant negative impact on revenues earned by
    financial institutions on debit card transactions. It is
    difficult to know what the final regulations will require and
    when they will become effective and, accordingly, the Company
    cannot estimate the impact that such regulations will have on
    its results of operations.

Trust income includes fees for trust and custody services
    provided to personal, corporate and institutional customers, and
    investment management and advisory fees that are often based on
    a percentage of the market value of assets under management.
    Trust income declined 5% to $123 million in 2010 from
    $129 million in 2009. During 2008, trust income totaled
    $156 million. Contributing to the lower levels of such
    income in 2010 and 2009 as compared with 2008 were the impact of
    lower balances in proprietary mutual funds and the impact of fee
    waivers by the Company in order to pay customers a yield on
    their investments in proprietary money-market mutual funds.
    Those waived fees were approximately $18 million in 2010
    and $10 million in 2009. Waived fees in 2008 were not
    significant. Total trust assets, which include assets under
    management and assets under administration, aggregated
    $113.4 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with
    $111.6 billion at December 31, 2009. Trust assets
    under management were $13.2 billion and $13.8 billion
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
    Company’s proprietary mutual funds, the MTB Group of Funds,
    had assets of $7.7 billion and $7.9 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale
    of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees,
    aggregated $50 million in 2010, $58 million in 2009
    and $64 million in 2008. The decline in such revenues in
    2010 as compared with 2009 was attributable to lower sales of
    annuity products. The decrease in revenues in 2009 as compared
    with the previous year was largely attributable to lower sales
    of mutual fund and annuity products. Trading account and foreign
    exchange activity resulted in gains of $27 million in 2010,
    $23 million in 2009 and $18 million in 2008. The rise
    in gains from 2009 to 2010 was due to higher new volumes of
    interest rate swap agreement transactions



executed on behalf of commercial customers. The higher revenues
    in 2009 as compared with 2008 were due to increases in market
    values of trading assets held in connection with deferred
    compensation plans. The Company enters into interest rate and
    foreign exchange contracts with customers who need such services
    and concomitantly enters into offsetting trading positions with
    third parties to minimize the risks involved with these types of
    transactions. Information about the notional amount of interest
    rate, foreign exchange and other contracts entered into by the
    Company for trading account purposes is included in note 18
    of Notes to Financial Statements and herein under the heading
    “Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate
    Sensitivity.” Trading account revenues related to interest
    rate and foreign exchange contracts totaled $16 million in
    2010, compared with $10 million in 2009 and
    $21 million in 2008. Those fluctuations related
    predominantly to changes in new volumes of interest rate swap
    agreement transactions executed on behalf of commercial
    customers. Trading account assets held in connection with
    deferred compensation plans were $35 million and
    $36 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. Trading account revenues resulting from net
    increases or decreases in the market values of such assets were
    $3 million and $4 million in 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, compared with losses of $12 million in 2008.
    A largely offsetting impact on expenses resulting from
    corresponding increases or decreases in liabilities related to
    deferred compensation is included in “other costs of
    operations.”

Including

other-than-temporary

impairment losses, the Company recognized net losses on
    investment securities of $84 million during 2010, compared
    with $137 million and $148 million in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Other-than-temporary

impairment charges of $86 million, $138 million and
    $182 million were recorded in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The Company recognized impairment charges during
    2010 of $68 million related to certain privately issued
    CMOs backed by residential and commercial real estate loans,
    $6 million related to CDOs backed by trust preferred
    securities issued by financial institutions and other entities,
    and a $12 million write-down of AIB ADSs. The AIB ADSs were
    obtained in a prior acquisition of a subsidiary of AIB and are
    held to satisfy options to purchase such shares granted by that
    subsidiary to certain of its employees. During 2009, the Company
    recognized impairment charges on certain privately issued CMOs
    backed by residential real estate loans of $128 million and
    CDOs backed by trust preferred securities of $10 million.
    The impairment charges recognized in 2008 included write-downs
    of $153 million related to preferred stock issuances of
    Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and $29 million related to CMOs
    and CDOs in the investment securities portfolio, and were
    partially offset by a gain of $33 million related to the
    mandatory redemption of common shares of Visa during the first
    quarter of that year. Each reporting period the Company reviews
    its impaired investment securities for

other-than-temporary

impairment. For equity securities, such as the Company’s
    holding of AIB ADSs and its investment in the preferred stock of
    Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Company considers various
    factors to determine if the decline in value is other than
    temporary, including the duration and extent of the decline in
    value, the factors contributing to the decline in fair value,
    including the financial condition of the issuer as well as the
    conditions of the industry in which it operates, and the
    prospects for a recovery in fair value of the equity security.
    For debt securities, the Company analyzes the creditworthiness
    of the issuer or reviews the credit performance of the
    underlying collateral supporting the bond. For debt securities
    backed by pools of loans, such as privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities, the Company estimates the cash flows
    of the underlying loan collateral using forward-looking
    assumptions of default rates, loss severities and prepayment
    speeds. Estimated collateral cash flows are then utilized to
    estimate bond-specific cash flows to determine the ultimate
    collectibility of the bond. If the present value of the cash
    flows indicates that the Company should not expect to recover
    the entire amortized cost basis of a bond or if the Company
    intends to sell the bond or it more likely than not will be
    required to sell the bond before recovery of its amortized cost
    basis, an

other-than-temporary

impairment loss is recognized. If an

other-than-temporary

impairment loss is deemed to have occurred, the investment
    security’s cost basis is adjusted, as appropriate for the
    circumstances. Additional information about

other-than-temporary

impairment losses is included herein under the heading
    “Capital”.

M&T’s share of the operating losses of BLG was
    $26 million in each of 2010 and 2009, compared with
    $37 million in 2008. The operating losses of BLG in those
    years resulted from the disruptions in the privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities market and higher provisions for
    losses associated with securitized loans and other loans held by
    BLG, and costs associated with severance and certain lease



terminations incurred by BLG as it downsized its operations.
    Despite the credit and liquidity disruptions that began in 2007,
    BLG had been successfully securitizing and selling significant
    volumes of small-balance commercial real estate loans until the
    first quarter of 2008. In response to the illiquidity in the
    marketplace since that time, BLG reduced its originations
    activities, scaled back its workforce and made use of its
    contingent liquidity sources. As a result of past securitization
    activities, BLG is entitled to cash flows from mortgage assets
    that it owns or that are owned by its affiliates and is also
    entitled to receive distributions from affiliates that provide
    asset management and other services. Accordingly, the Company
    believes that BLG is capable of realizing positive cash flows
    that could be available for distribution to its owners,
    including M&T, despite a lack of positive GAAP-earnings. In
    assessing M&T’s investment in BLG for

other-than-temporary

impairment at December 31, 2010, the Company projected no
    further commercial mortgage origination and securitization
    activities by BLG. With respect to mortgage assets held by BLG
    and its affiliates, M&T estimated future cash flows from
    those assets using various assumptions for future defaults and
    loss severities to arrive at an expected amount of cash flows
    that could be available to distribute to M&T. As of
    December 31, 2010, the weighted-average assumption of
    projected default percentage on the underlying mortgage loan
    collateral supporting those mortgage assets was 31% and the
    weighted-average loss severity assumption was 66%. Lastly,
    M&T considered different scenarios of projected cash flows
    that could be generated by the asset management and servicing
    operations of BLG’s affiliates. M&T is contractually
    entitled to participate in distributions from those affiliates.
    Such estimates were derived from company-provided forecasts of
    financial results and through discussions with their senior
    management with respect to longer-term projections of growth in
    assets under management and asset servicing portfolios. M&T
    then discounted the various projections using discount rates
    that ranged from 8% to 17%. Upon evaluation of those results,
    management concluded that M&T’s investment in BLG was
    not

other-than-temporarily

impaired at December 31, 2010. Nevertheless, if BLG is not
    able to realize sufficient cash flows for the benefit of
    M&T, the Company may be required to recognize an

other-than-temporary

impairment charge in a future period for some portion of the
    $220 million book value of its investment in BLG.
    Information about the Company’s relationship with BLG and
    its affiliates is included in note 25 of Notes to Financial
    Statements.

Other revenues from operations totaled $355 million in
    2010, compared with $325 million in 2009 and
    $300 million in 2008. Contributing to the 9% improvement
    from 2009 to 2010 were a $12 million rise in letter of
    credit and other credit-related fees and increases in merchant
    discount and credit card fees, underwriting and investment
    advisory fees, and other miscellaneous fees and revenues.
    Reflected in other revenues from operations in 2010 and 2009
    were merger-related gains of $28 million and
    $29 million, respectively, related to the K Bank and
    Bradford transactions. The improvement from 2008 to 2009
    reflects the $29 million Bradford-related gain recognized
    in 2009 offset, in part, by modest declines in other
    miscellaneous fees and revenues.

Included in other revenues from operations were the following
    significant components. Letter of credit and other
    credit-related fees totaled $112 million, $100 million
    and $97 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    rise in such fees from 2009 to 2010 was due largely to higher
    income from providing letter of credit and loan syndication
    services. Tax-exempt income earned from bank owned life
    insurance aggregated $50 million in 2010 and
    $49 million in each of 2009 and 2008. Such income includes
    increases in cash surrender value of life insurance policies and
    benefits received. Revenues from merchant discount and credit
    card fees were $46 million in 2010 and $40 million in each
    of 2009 and 2008. The increased revenues in 2010 were largely
    attributable to higher transaction volumes related to merchant
    activity and usage of the Company’s commercial credit card
    product. Insurance-related sales commissions and other revenues
    totaled $40 million in 2010, $42 million in 2009 and
    $31 million in 2008. Automated teller machine usage fees
    aggregated $18 million in 2010, $19 million in 2009
    and $17 million in 2008.

Other
    Expense

Other expense aggregated $1.91 billion in 2010, compared
    with $1.98 billion in 2009 and $1.73 billion in 2008.
    Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be
    “nonoperating” in nature consisting of amortization of
    core deposit and other intangible assets of $58 million,
    $64 million and $67 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, and merger-related expenses of $771 thousand in
    2010, $89 million in



2009 and $4 million in 2008. Exclusive of those
    nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were
    $1.86 billion in 2010, up 2% from $1.83 billion in
    2009. That increase was largely attributable to higher costs for
    professional services, advertising and promotion, occupancy
    expenses related to the acquired operations of Provident, and a
    $22 million reduction of the allowance for impairment of
    capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights in 2009. There
    was no change to that impairment allowance for the year ended
    December 31, 2010. Reflected in noninterest operating
    expenses in 2010 was the full-year impact of the acquired
    operations of Provident and Bradford. Partially offsetting the
    higher costs in 2010 were declines in expenses related to
    foreclosed real estate properties and FDIC assessments.
    Noninterest operating expenses were $1.66 billion in 2008.
    The most significant factors for the rise in operating expenses
    from 2008 to 2009 were costs associated with the acquired
    operations of Provident and Bradford, a $90 million
    increase in FDIC assessments (including approximately
    $9 million relating to deposits from Provident and
    Bradford) and higher foreclosure-related expenses. The impact of
    those increases was mitigated by a reversal of the valuation
    allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights
    of $22 million in 2009, as compared with an addition to
    that valuation allowance of $16 million in 2008.

Salaries and employee benefits expense totaled
    $1.00 billion in each of 2010 and 2009, compared with
    $957 million in 2008. Increased incentive compensation
    costs and the full-year impact of the 2009 acquisition
    transactions in 2010 were largely offset by a $10 million
    decline in merger-related salaries and employee benefits
    expenses that consisted predominantly of severance expense for
    Provident employees. The higher expense levels in 2009 as
    compared with 2008 reflect the impact of the 2009 acquisition
    transactions. Also contributing to the increased expenses in
    2009 were higher costs for providing medical and pension
    benefits. Stock-based compensation totaled $54 million in
    each of 2010 and 2009, and $50 million in 2008. The number
    of full-time equivalent employees was 12,802 at
    December 31, 2010, compared with 13,639 and 12,978 at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The Company provides pension and other postretirement benefits
    (including a retirement savings plan) for its employees.
    Expenses related to such benefits totaled $66 million in
    2010, $60 million in 2009 and $52 million in 2008. The
    Company sponsors both defined benefit and defined contribution
    pension plans. Pension benefit expense for those plans was
    $38 million in 2010, $32 million in 2009 and
    $23 million in 2008. Included in those amounts are
    $14 million in 2010, $11 million in 2009 and
    $10 million in 2008 for a defined contribution pension plan
    that the Company began on January 1, 2006. The
    determination of pension expense and the recognition of net
    pension assets and liabilities for defined benefit pension plans
    requires management to make various assumptions that can
    significantly impact the actuarial calculations related thereto.
    Those assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return
    on plan assets, the rate of increase in future compensation
    levels and the discount rate. Changes in any of those
    assumptions will impact the Company’s pension expense. The
    expected long-term rate of return assumption is determined by
    taking into consideration asset allocations, historical returns
    on the types of assets held and current economic factors.
    Returns on invested assets are periodically compared with target
    market indices for each asset type to aid management in
    evaluating such returns. The discount rate used by the Company
    to determine the present value of the Company’s future
    benefit obligations reflects specific market yields for a
    hypothetical portfolio of highly rated corporate bonds that
    would produce cash flows similar to the Company’s benefit
    plan obligations and the level of market interest rates in
    general as of the year-end. Other factors used to estimate the
    projected benefit obligations include actuarial assumptions for
    mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate and disability
    rate. Those other factors do not tend to change significantly
    over time. The Company reviews its pension plan assumptions
    annually to ensure that such assumptions are reasonable and
    adjusts those assumptions, as necessary, to reflect changes in
    future expectations. The Company utilizes actuaries and others
    to aid in that assessment.

The Company’s 2010 pension expense for its defined benefit
    plans was determined using the following assumptions: a
    long-term rate of return on assets of 6.50%; a rate of future
    compensation increase of 4.50%; and a discount rate of 5.75%. To
    demonstrate the sensitivity of pension expense to changes in the
    Company’s pension plan assumptions, 25 basis point
    increases in: the rate of return on plan assets would have
    resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $2 million;
    the rate of increase in compensation would have resulted in an
    increase in pension expense of $.3 million; and the
    discount rate



would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of
    $3 million. Decreases of 25 basis points in those
    assumptions would have resulted in similar changes in amount,
    but in the opposite direction from the changes presented in the
    preceding sentence. The accounting guidance for defined benefit
    pension plans reflects the long-term nature of benefit
    obligations and the investment horizon of plan assets, and has
    the effect of reducing expense volatility related to short-term
    changes in interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains
    and losses include the impact of plan amendments, in addition to
    various gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions
    and investment returns which are different from that which was
    assumed. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had
    cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of approximately
    $233 million that could result in an increase in the
    Company’s future pension expense depending on several
    factors, including whether such losses at each measurement date
    exceed ten percent of the greater of the projected benefit
    obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. In
    accordance with GAAP, net unrecognized gains or losses that
    exceed that threshold are required to be amortized over the
    expected service period of active employees, and are included as
    a component of net pension cost. Amortization of these net
    unrealized losses had the effect of increasing the
    Company’s pension expense by approximately $14 million
    in 2010, $10 million in 2009 and $4 million in 2008.

GAAP requires an employer to recognize in its balance sheet as
    an asset or liability the overfunded or underfunded status of a
    defined benefit postretirement plan, measured as the difference
    between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit
    obligation. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the
    projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement
    benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit
    obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.
    Gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise
    during the period, but are not included as components of net
    periodic benefit cost, are to be recognized as a component of
    other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2010, the
    combined benefit obligations of the Company’s defined
    benefit postretirement plans exceeded the fair value of the
    assets of such plans by approximately $171 million. Of that
    amount, $43 million was related to qualified defined
    benefit plans that are periodically funded by the Company and
    $128 million related to non-qualified pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans that are generally not funded until
    benefits are paid. The Company was required to have a net
    pension and postretirement benefit liability for those plans
    that was at least equal to $171 million at December 31,
    2010. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2010 the Company
    recorded an additional postretirement benefit liability of
    $199 million. After applicable tax effect, that liability
    reduced accumulated other comprehensive income (and thereby
    shareholders’ equity) by $121 million. The result of
    this was a

year-over-year

increase of $6 million to the required minimum
    postretirement benefit liability from the $193 million
    recorded at December 31, 2009. After applicable tax effect,
    the $6 million increase in the minimum required liability
    decreased accumulated other comprehensive income in 2010 by
    $4 million from the prior year-end amount of
    $117 million. The $6 million increase to the liability
    was the result of losses that occurred during 2010 resulting
    from actual experience differing from actuarial assumptions and
    from changes in those assumptions. Those losses reflect a
    reduction in the discount rate used to measure the benefit
    obligations of the defined benefit plans at December 31,
    2010 as compared with a year earlier, offset by actual
    investment returns in the qualified defined benefit pension plan
    that exceeded expected returns. In determining the benefit
    obligation for defined benefit postretirement plans the Company
    used a discount rate of 5.25% at December 31, 2010 and
    5.75% at December 31, 2009. A 25 basis point decrease
    in the assumed discount rate as of December 31, 2010 to
    5.0% would have resulted in increases in the combined benefit
    obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans
    (including pension and other plans) of $35 million. Under
    that scenario, the minimum postretirement liability adjustment
    at December 31, 2010 would have been $234 million,
    rather than the $199 million that was actually recorded,
    and the corresponding after tax-effect charge to accumulated
    other comprehensive income at December 31, 2010 would have
    been $142 million, rather than the $121 million that
    was actually recorded. A 25 basis point increase in the
    assumed discount rate to 5.50% would have decreased the combined
    benefit obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans
    by $33 million. Under this latter scenario, the aggregate
    minimum liability adjustment at December 31, 2010 would
    have been $166 million rather than the $199 million
    actually recorded and the corresponding after tax-effect charge
    to accumulated other comprehensive income would have been
    $101 million rather than $121 million. The Company was
    not required to and did not make any contributions to its
    qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2010. During the
    second quarter



of 2009, the Company elected to contribute 900,000 shares
    of common stock of M&T having a fair value of
    $44 million to its qualified defined benefit pension plan.
    During 2008, the Company made cash contributions to its
    qualified defined benefit pension plan totaling
    $140 million. Information about the Company’s pension
    plans, including significant assumptions utilized in completing
    actuarial calculations for the plans, is included in
    note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company also provides a retirement savings plan
    (“RSP”) that is a defined contribution plan in which
    eligible employees of the Company may defer up to 50% of
    qualified compensation via contributions to the plan. The
    Company makes an employer matching contribution in an amount
    equal to 75% of an employee’s contribution, up to 4.5% of
    the employee’s qualified compensation. RSP expense totaled
    $25 million in 2010, $24 million in 2009 and
    $23 million in 2008.

Expenses associated with the defined benefit and defined
    contribution pension plans and the RSP totaled $62 million
    in 2010, $56 million in 2009 and $47 million in 2008.
    Expense associated with providing medical and other
    postretirement benefits was $4 million in each of 2010 and
    2009 and $5 million in 2008.

Excluding the nonoperating expense items already noted,
    nonpersonnel operating expenses totaled $856 million in
    2010, up 3% from $835 million in 2009. Contributing to that
    increase were higher costs for professional services,
    advertising and promotion, occupancy expenses related to the
    full-year impact of the acquired operations of Provident, and a
    $22 million reduction of the allowance for impairment of
    capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights in 2009. There
    was no change in such impairment allowance in 2010. Partially
    offsetting the factors described above were decreased costs
    related to foreclosed real estate properties and FDIC
    assessments in 2010. Nonpersonnel operating expenses were
    $700 million in 2008. Higher FDIC deposit assessments were
    a significant contributor to the rise in those expenses from
    2008 to 2009. In total, FDIC assessments in 2009 were
    $97 million, including a $33 million special
    assessment in the second quarter, compared with $7 million
    in 2008. Also contributing to the higher level of operating
    expenses in 2009 as compared with 2008 were costs associated
    with the acquired operations of Provident and Bradford and
    expenses related to the foreclosure process for residential real
    estate properties. A $15 million reversal in the first
    quarter of 2008 of an accrual established in the fourth quarter
    of 2007 for estimated losses stemming from certain litigation
    involving Visa also contributed to the

year-over-year

variance. Partially offsetting those factors was the impact of
    partial reversals of the valuation allowance for impairment of
    residential mortgage servicing rights in 2009 of
    $22 million, compared with additions to the valuation
    allowance of $16 million in 2008.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $357 million in 2010,
    compared with $139 million in 2009 and $184 million in
    2008. The effective tax rates were 32.6%, 26.8% and 24.9% in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Income taxes in 2008 reflect
    the resolution in that year of previously uncertain tax
    positions related to the Company’s activities in various
    jurisdictions during the years

1999-2007

that allowed the Company to reduce its accrual for income taxes
    in the third quarter of 2008 by $40 million. The effective
    tax rate is affected by the level of income earned that is
    exempt from tax relative to the overall level of pre-tax income,
    the level of income allocated to the various state and local
    jurisdictions where the Company operates, because tax rates
    differ among such jurisdictions, and the impact of any large but
    infrequently occurring items. For example, although the
    merger-related expenses incurred during 2009 are predominantly
    deductible for purposes of computing income tax expense, those
    charges had an impact on the effective tax rate because they
    lowered pre-tax income relative to the amounts of tax-exempt
    income and other permanent differences that impact the effective
    tax rate. Excluding the impact of

(i) other-than-temporary

impairment charges in 2010, 2009 and 2008; (ii) net
    merger-related gains of $27 million in 2010 and net
    merger-related expenses of $60 million in 2009 and
    $4 million in 2008; and (iii) the credit to income tax
    expense noted above of $40 million in 2008, the
    Company’s effective tax rates for 2010, 2009 and 2008 would
    have been 33.0%, 30.3%, and 32.1%, respectively.

The Company’s effective tax rate in future periods will be
    affected by the results of operations allocated to the various
    tax jurisdictions within which the Company operates, any change
    in income tax laws or regulations within those jurisdictions,
    and interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from
    the Company’s interpretations by any of various tax
    authorities that may examine tax returns filed



by M&T or any of its subsidiaries. Information about
    amounts accrued for uncertain tax positions and a reconciliation
    of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the
    statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income is provided
    in note 13 of Notes to Financial Statements.

International
    Activities

The Company’s net investment in international assets
    totaled $113 million at December 31, 2010 and
    $62 million at December 31, 2009. Such assets included
    $107 million and $55 million, respectively, of loans
    to foreign borrowers. Deposits in the Company’s branch in
    the Cayman Islands totaled $1.6 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and $1.1 billion at
    December 31, 2009. The Company uses such deposits to
    facilitate customer demand and as an alternative to short-term
    borrowings when the costs of such deposits seem reasonable.
    M&T Bank opened a full-service commercial branch in
    Ontario, Canada during the second quarter of 2010. Loans and
    deposits at that branch as of December 31, 2010 were
    $63 million and $4 million, respectively.

Liquidity,
    Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity

As a financial intermediary, the Company is exposed to various
    risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to
    the Company’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow
    and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future
    obligations, including demands for loans and deposit
    withdrawals, funding operating costs, and other corporate
    purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of
    financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.

Core deposits have historically been the most significant
    funding source for the Company and are generated from a large
    base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. That
    customer base has, over the past several years, become more
    geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion
    of the Company’s businesses. Nevertheless, the Company
    faces competition in offering products and services from a large
    array of financial market participants, including banks,
    thrifts, mutual funds, securities dealers and others. Core
    deposits financed 77% of the Company’s earning assets at
    December 31, 2010, compared with 72% and 60% at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The substantial
    increases in the amount of earning assets financed by core
    deposits at the 2010 and 2009 year-ends as compared with
    December 31, 2008 were the result of significantly higher
    levels of core deposits, largely due to higher
    noninterest-bearing deposits. Additionally, as of
    December 31, 2010 the Company changed it definition of core
    deposits to include time deposits below $250,000, as already
    noted, to reflect a provision in the Dodd-Frank Act which
    permanently increased the maximum amount of FDIC insurance for
    financial institutions to $250,000 per depositor. That maximum
    had been $100,000 per depositor until 2009, when it was
    temporarily raised to $250,000 through 2013. The impact of
    including time deposits with balances of $100,000 to $250,000
    added $1.0 billion to the Company’s core deposits
    total at December 31, 2010.

The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits
    with various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings,
    including federal funds purchased and securities sold under
    agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit,
    Cayman Islands branch deposits and borrowings from the FHLBs and
    others. At December 31, 2010, M&T Bank had short-term
    and long-term credit facilities with the FHLBs aggregating
    $6.0 billion. Outstanding borrowings under FHLB credit
    facilities totaled $2.9 billion and $5.4 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Such borrowings
    were secured by loans and investment securities. M&T Bank
    and M&T Bank, N.A. had available lines of credit with the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York that totaled approximately
    $9.9 billion at December 31, 2010. The amounts of
    those lines are dependent upon the balances of loans and
    securities pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings
    outstanding under such lines of credit at December 31, 2010
    or December 31, 2009.

The Company has, from time to time, issued subordinated capital
    notes and junior subordinated debentures associated with
    preferred capital securities to provide liquidity and enhance
    regulatory capital ratios. Such notes qualify for inclusion in
    the Company’s capital as defined by Federal regulators.
    Information about the Company’s borrowings is included in
    note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company has informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of
    funding available through various arrangements for unsecured
    short-term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other
    financial



institutions. Short-term federal funds borrowings were
    $826 million and $2.1 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. In general, those borrowings were
    unsecured and matured on the next business day. As already
    noted, Cayman Islands branch deposits and brokered certificates
    of deposit have been used by the Company as an alternative to
    short-term borrowings. Cayman Islands branch deposits also
    generally mature on the next business day and totaled
    $1.6 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. Outstanding brokered time deposits
    at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 were
    $485 million and $868 million, respectively. At
    December 31, 2010, the weighted-average remaining term to
    maturity of brokered time deposits was 20 months. Certain
    of these brokered deposits have provisions that allow for early
    redemption. The Company also had brokered NOW and brokered
    money-market deposit accounts which aggregated $1.3 billion
    and $618 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. The higher level of such deposits at the
    2010 year-end resulted from higher demand for these
    deposits due to the unsettled economy and the need for brokerage
    firms to ensure that customer deposits are fully insured while
    earning a yield on such deposits.

The Company’s ability to obtain funding from these or other
    sources could be negatively impacted should the Company
    experience a substantial deterioration in its financial
    condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of
    short-term funding become restricted due to a disruption in the
    financial markets. The Company attempts to quantify such
    credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the
    liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade
    over various grading levels. Such impact is estimated by
    attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of
    credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and
    securitizable assets. Information about the credit ratings of
    M&T and M&T Bank is presented in table 15. Additional
    information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the
    Company’s short-term and long-term borrowings is provided
    in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to
    deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include
    maturities of investment securities and other earning assets,
    repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash
    generated from operations, such as fees collected for services.

Certain customers of the Company obtain financing through the
    issuance of variable rate demand bonds (“VRDBs”). The
    VRDBs are generally enhanced by direct-pay letters of credit
    provided by M&T Bank. M&T Bank oftentimes acts as
    remarketing agent for the VRDBs and, at its discretion, may from

time-to-time

own some of the VRDBs while such instruments are remarketed.
    When this occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading assets in
    the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Nevertheless,
    M&T Bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the
    VRDBs. The value of VRDBs in the Company’s trading account
    totaled $107 million and $19 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the VRDBs outstanding backed by
    M&T Bank letters of credit totaled $2.0 billion and
    $1.9 billion, respectively. M&T Bank also serves as
    remarketing agent for most of those bonds.

The data do not include
    nonaccrual loans.

The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal
    course of business which require future cash payments. The
    contractual amounts and timing of those payments as of
    December 31, 2010 are summarized in table 17. Off-balance
    sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity, including
    commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit,
    commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and
    indemnification contracts, and commitments to sell real estate
    loans. Because many of these commitments or contracts expire
    without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts
    are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further
    discussion of these commitments is provided in note 21 of
    Notes to Financial Statements. Table 17 summarizes the
    Company’s other commitments as of December 31, 2010
    and the timing of the expiration of such commitments.

M&T’s primary source of funds to pay for operating
    expenses, shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases
    has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking
    subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory
    limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T
    are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary
    in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of
    the test, approximately $1.4 billion at December 31,
    2010 was available for payment of dividends to M&T from
    banking subsidiaries. These historic sources of cash flow have
    been augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred
    securities and senior notes payable. Information regarding trust
    preferred securities and the related junior subordinated
    debentures are included in note 9 of Notes to Financial
    Statements. M&T also maintains a $30 million line of
    credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank, of which there were
    no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2010. A similar
    $30 million line of credit was entirely available for
    borrowing at December 31, 2009.

Management closely monitors the Company’s liquidity
    position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal
    policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are
    adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the normal course
    of business. Management does not anticipate engaging in any
    activities, either currently or in the long-term, for which
    adequate funding would not be available and would therefore
    result in a significant strain on liquidity at either M&T
    or its subsidiary banks.

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the
    market prices

and/or

interest rates of the Company’s financial instruments. The
    primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate
    risk. Interest rate risk arises from the Company’s core
    banking activities of lending and deposit-taking, because assets
    and liabilities reprice at different times and by different
    amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest
    income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of
    changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk
    by calculating the variability of net interest income in future
    periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected
    balances for earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and
    derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Management’s
    philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the
    variability of net interest income. The balances of financial
    instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth
    from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments
    of loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of
    investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a
    “value of equity” model to supplement the modeling
    technique described above. Those supplemental analyses are based
    on discounted cash flows associated with on- and off-balance
    sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to
    reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a
    long-term interest rate risk metric. The Company has entered
    into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to
    interest rate risk. At December 31, 2010, the aggregate
    notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into
    for interest rate risk management purposes was
    $900 million. Information about interest rate swap
    agreements entered into for interest rate risk management
    purposes is included herein under the heading “Net Interest
    Income/Lending and Funding Activities” and in note 18
    of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company’s Risk Management Committee, which includes
    members of senior management, monitors the sensitivity of the
    Company’s net interest income to changes in interest rates
    with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest
    income under different interest rate scenarios. In modeling
    changing interest rates, the Company considers different yield
    curve shapes that consider both parallel (that is, simultaneous
    changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve) and
    non-parallel (that is, allowing interest rates at points on the
    yield curve to vary by different amounts) shifts in the yield
    curve. In utilizing the model, market implied forward interest
    rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to
    determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest
    income simulation. That calculated base net interest income is
    then compared to the income calculated under the varying
    interest rate scenarios. The model considers the impact of
    ongoing lending and deposit-gathering activities, as well as
    interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing
    of financial instruments, including the effect of changing
    interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When
    deemed prudent, management has taken actions to mitigate
    exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on-or
    off-balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in
    the future. Possible actions include, but are



not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit
    products, modifying the composition of earning assets and
    interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or
    terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other
    financial instruments used for interest rate risk management
    purposes.

Table 20 displays as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 the
    estimated impact on net interest income from non-trading
    financial instruments in the base scenario described above
    resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across
    repricing categories during the first modeling year.

The Company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact
    that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income.
    The more significant of those assumptions included the rate of
    prepayments of mortgage-related assets, cash flows from
    derivative and other financial instruments held for non-trading
    purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit
    maturities. In the scenarios presented, the Company also assumed
    gradual changes in rates during a twelve-month period of 100 and
    200 basis points, as compared with the assumed base
    scenario. In the event that a 100 or 200 basis point rate
    change cannot be achieved, the applicable rate changes are
    limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates cannot be
    less than zero. The assumptions used in interest rate
    sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and, as a result,
    the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in
    interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ
    significantly from those presented due to the timing, magnitude
    and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market
    conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between
    maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as
    those previously described, which management may take to counter
    such changes. In light of the uncertainties and assumptions
    associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table
    are not considered significant to the Company’s past or
    projected net interest income.

Table 21 presents cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities)
    repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time
    frames, as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap
    agreements entered into for interest rate risk management
    purposes. Management believes that this measure does not
    appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in
    interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of
    earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities equally nor, as
    assumed in the table, on the contractual maturity or repricing
    date. Furthermore, this static presentation of interest rate
    risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit
    gathering activities, projected changes in balance sheet
    composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management
    activities the Company is likely to implement.

Changes in fair value of the Company’s financial
    instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for
    similar instruments in the financial markets. That impact is
    most notable on the values assigned to the Company’s
    investment securities. Information about the fair valuation of
    such securities is presented herein under the heading
    “Capital” and in notes 3 and 20 of Notes to
    Financial Statements.

The Company engages in trading activities to meet the financial
    needs of customers, to fund the Company’s obligations under
    certain deferred compensation plans and, to a limited extent, to
    profit from perceived market opportunities. Financial
    instruments utilized in trading activities consist predominantly
    of interest rate contracts, such as swap agreements, and forward
    and futures contracts related to foreign currencies, but have
    also included forward and futures contracts related to
    mortgage-backed securities and investments in U.S. Treasury
    and other government securities, mortgage-backed securities and
    mutual funds and, as previously described, a limited number of
    VRDBs. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and
    interest rate risk associated with trading activities by
    entering into offsetting trading positions. The fair values of
    the offsetting trading positions associated with interest rate
    contracts and foreign currency and other option and futures
    contracts is presented in note 18 of Notes to Financial
    Statements. The amounts of gross and net trading positions, as
    well as the type of trading activities conducted by the Company,
    are subject to a well-defined series of potential loss exposure
    limits established by management and approved by M&T’s
    Board of Directors. However, as with any non-government
    guaranteed financial instrument, the Company is exposed to
    credit risk associated with counterparties to the Company’s
    trading activities.

The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for
    trading purposes aggregated $12.8 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and $13.9 billion at
    December 31, 2009. The notional amounts of foreign currency
    and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading
    purposes totaled $769 million and $608 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Although the
    notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in
    the consolidated balance sheet, the fair values of all financial
    instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the
    consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of trading account
    assets and liabilities were $524 million and
    $333 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010 and
    $387 million and $302 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2009. Included in



trading account assets at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were
    $35 million and $36 million, respectively, of assets
    related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the fair
    value of such assets are recorded as “trading account and
    foreign exchange gains” in the consolidated statement of
    income. Included in “other liabilities” in the
    consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010 and 2009
    were $36 million and $38 million, respectively, of
    liabilities related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in
    the balances of such liabilities due to the valuation of
    allocated investment options to which the liabilities are
    indexed are recorded in “other costs of operations” in
    the consolidated statement of income.

Given the Company’s policies, limits and positions,
    management believes that the potential loss exposure to the
    Company resulting from market risk associated with trading

Capital

Shareholders’ equity was $8.4 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and represented 12.29% of total assets,
    compared with $7.8 billion or 11.26% at December 31,
    2009 and $6.8 billion or 10.31% at December 31, 2008.
    Included in shareholders’ equity at each of those dates was
    $600 million of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred
    Stock, Series A, and warrants to purchase M&T common
    stock issued on December 23, 2008 as part of the
    U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program. The financial
    statement value of that preferred stock was $579 million at
    December 31, 2010, $573 million at December 31,
    2009 and $567 million at December 31, 2008. Provident
    also participated in that program on November 14, 2008. As
    a result, Provident’s $151.5 million of preferred
    stock related thereto was converted to M&T Fixed Rate
    Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C, with
    warrants to purchase M&T common stock. The estimated fair
    value ascribed to the Series C Preferred Stock was
    $129 million on the May 23, 2009 acquisition date. The
    financial statement value of the Series C Preferred Stock
    was $135 million and $131 million at December 31,
    2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. The holder of the
    Series A and Series C preferred stock is entitled to
    cumulative cash dividends of 5% per annum for five years after
    the date of initial issuance and 9% per annum thereafter,
    payable quarterly in arrears. That preferred stock is redeemable
    at the option of M&T, subject to regulatory approval.
    M&T also obtained another series of preferred stock as part
    of the Provident acquisition that was converted to
    $26.5 million of M&T Series B Mandatory
    Convertible Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, liquidation
    preference of $1,000 per share. The 26,500 shares of the
    Series B Preferred Stock will automatically convert into
    433,148 shares of M&T common stock on April 1,
    2011. The Series B Preferred Stock pays dividends at a rate
    of 10% per annum on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per
    share, payable quarterly in arrears. The estimated acquisition
    date fair value of the Series B Preferred Stock was
    approximately equal to that stock’s $26.5 million
    redemption value. Further information concerning M&T’s
    preferred stock can be found in note 10 of Notes to
    Financial Statements.

Common shareholders’ equity was $7.6 billion, or
    $63.54 per share, at December 31, 2010, compared with
    $7.0 billion, or $59.31 per share, at December 31,
    2009 and $6.2 billion, or $56.29 per share, at
    December 31, 2008. Tangible equity per common share, which
    excludes goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets
    and applicable deferred tax balances, was $33.26 at
    December 31, 2010, compared with $28.27 and $25.94 at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    Company’s ratio of tangible common equity to tangible
    assets was 6.19% at December 31, 2010, compared with 5.13%
    and 4.59% at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
    respectively. Reconciliations of total common shareholders’
    equity and tangible common equity as of December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008 are presented in table 2. During 2010, 2009 and
    2008, the ratio of average total shareholders’ equity to
    average total assets was 11.85%, 10.79% and 9.88%, respectively.
    The ratio of average common shareholders’ equity to average
    total assets was 10.77%, 9.81% and 9.86% in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Shareholders’ equity reflects accumulated other
    comprehensive income or loss, which includes the net after-tax
    impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities
    classified as available for sale, gains or losses associated
    with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow
    hedges, and



adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit
    pension and other postretirement plans. Net unrealized losses on

available-for-sale

investment securities, net of applicable tax effect, were
    $85 million, or $.71 per common share, at December 31,
    2010, compared with net unrealized losses of $220 million,
    or $1.86 per common share, at December 31, 2009, and
    $557 million, or $5.04 per common share, at
    December 31, 2008. Such unrealized losses represent the
    difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the
    estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities
    classified as available for sale, including the remaining
    unamortized unrealized losses on investment securities that have
    been transferred to

held-to-maturity

classification. Information about unrealized gains and losses as
    of December 31, 2010 and 2009 is included in note 3 of
    Notes to Financial Statements.

Reflected in net unrealized losses at December 31, 2010
    were pre tax-effect unrealized losses of $312 million on

available-for-sale

investment securities with an amortized cost of
    $1.7 billion and pre-tax effect unrealized gains of
    $231 million on securities with an amortized cost of
    $3.8 billion. The pre-tax effect unrealized losses reflect
    $252 million of losses on privately issued mortgage-backed
    securities with an amortized cost of $1.4 billion and an
    estimated fair value of $1.1 billion (considered
    Level 3 valuations) and $38 million of losses on trust
    preferred securities issued by financial institutions having an
    amortized cost of $127 million and an estimated fair value
    of $89 million (generally considered Level 2
    valuations).

The Company’s privately issued residential mortgage-backed
    securities classified as available for sale are generally
    collateralized by prime and Alt-A residential mortgage loans as
    depicted in table 22. Information in the table is as of
    December 31, 2010. As with any accounting estimate or other
    data, changes in fair values and investment ratings may occur at
    any time.

All information is as of
    December 31, 2010.

Reflecting the credit stress associated with residential
    mortgage loans, trading activity for privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities has been dramatically reduced. In
    estimating values for such securities, the Company was
    significantly restricted in the level of market observable
    assumptions used in the valuation of its privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Because of the relative
    inactivity and lack of observable valuation inputs, the Company
    considers the estimated fair value associated with its holdings
    of privately issued mortgage-backed securities to be
    Level 3 valuations. To assist in the determination of fair
    value for its privately issued mortgage-backed securities, the
    Company engaged two independent pricing sources at
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. In April
    2009, guidance was provided by the FASB for estimating fair
    value when the volume and level of trading activity for an asset



or liability have significantly decreased. In consideration of
    that guidance, the Company performed internal modeling to
    estimate the cash flows and fair value of privately issued
    residential mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost
    basis of $1.5 billion at December 31, 2010 and
    $1.9 billion at December 31, 2009. The Company’s
    internal modeling techniques included discounting estimated
    bond-specific cash flows using assumptions about cash flows
    associated with loans underlying each of the bonds. In
    estimating those cash flows, the Company used conservative
    assumptions as to future delinquency, default and loss rates in
    order to mitigate exposure that might be attributable to the
    risk that actual future credit losses could exceed assumed
    credit losses. Differences between internal model valuations and
    external pricing indications were generally considered to be
    reflective of the lack of liquidity in the market for privately
    issued mortgage-backed securities. To determine the most
    representative fair value for those bonds under current market
    conditions, the Company computed values based on judgmentally
    applied weightings of the internal model valuations and the
    indications obtained from the average of the two independent
    pricing sources. Weightings applied to internal model valuations
    were generally dependent on bond structure and collateral type,
    with prices for bonds in non-senior tranches generally receiving
    lower weightings on the internal model results and greater
    weightings of the valuation data provided by the independent
    pricing sources. As a result, certain valuations of privately
    issued residential mortgage-backed securities were determined by
    reference to independent pricing sources without adjustment. The
    average weight placed on internal model valuations at
    December 31, 2010 was 34%, compared with a 66% weighting on
    valuations provided by the independent sources. Generally, the
    range of weights placed on internal valuations was between 0%
    and 40%. Further information concerning the Company’s
    valuations of privately issued mortgage-backed securities can be
    found in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.

During 2010 the Company recognized $86 million (pre-tax) of

other-than-temporary

impairment losses including $63 million related to
    privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities with an
    amortized cost basis (before impairment charge) of
    $585 million, $6 million related to securities backed
    largely by trust preferred securities issued by financial
    institutions with an amortized cost basis (before impairment
    charge) of $13 million, $5 million related to
    commercial mortgage-backed CMOs with an amortized cost basis
    (before impairment charge) of $9 million, and
    $12 million related to AIB ADSs with an amortized cost
    basis (before impairment charge) of $13 million. In
    assessing impairment losses for debt securities, the Company
    performed internal modeling to estimate bond-specific cash
    flows, which considered the placement of the bond in the overall
    securitization structure and the remaining levels of
    subordination. For privately issued residential mortgage-backed
    securities, the model utilized assumptions about the underlying
    performance of the mortgage loan collateral considering recent
    collateral performance and future assumptions regarding default
    and loss severity. At December 31, 2010, projected model
    default percentages on the underlying mortgage loan collateral
    ranged from 1% to 43% and loss severities ranged from 10% to
    71%. For bonds in which the Company has recognized an

other-than-temporary

impairment charge, the weighted-average percentage of defaulted
    collateral was 25% and the weighted-average loss severity was
    49%. For bonds without

other-than-temporary

impairment losses, the weighted-average default percentage and
    loss severity were 11% and 39%, respectively. Underlying
    mortgage loan collateral cash flows, after considering the
    impact of estimated credit losses, were distributed by the model
    to the various securities within the securitization structure to
    determine the timing and extent of losses at the bond-level, if
    any. Despite continuing high levels of delinquencies and losses
    in the underlying residential mortgage loan collateral, given
    credit enhancements resulting from the structures of individual
    bonds, the Company has concluded that as of December 31,
    2010 its remaining privately issued mortgage-backed securities
    were not

other-than-temporarily

impaired. Nevertheless, given recent market conditions, it is
    possible that adverse changes in repayment performance and fair
    value could occur in 2011 and later years that could impact the
    Company’s conclusions. Management has modeled cash flows
    from privately issued mortgage-backed securities under various
    scenarios and has concluded that even if home price depreciation
    and current delinquency trends persist for an extended period of
    time, the Company’s principal losses on its privately
    issued mortgage-backed securities would be substantially less
    than their current fair valuation losses. Information comparing
    the amortized cost and fair value of investment securities is
    included in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.



At December 31, 2010, the Company also had net pre-tax
    unrealized gains of $5 million on $410 million of
    trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions,
    securities backed by trust preferred securities issued by
    financial institutions and other entities, and other debt
    securities (including $16 million of net unrealized gains
    on $111 million of securities using a Level 3
    valuation and $11 million of net unrealized losses on
    $299 million of securities classified as Level 2
    valuations). Pre-tax unrealized losses of $29 million
    existed on $384 million of such securities at
    December 31, 2009. After evaluating the expected repayment
    performance of financial institutions where trust preferred
    securities were held directly by the Company or were within CDOs
    backed by trust preferred securities obtained in acquisitions,
    the Company, during 2010 and 2009, recognized pre-tax

other-than-temporary

impairment losses of $6 million and $8 million,
    respectively, related to those securities.

The Company also holds municipal bonds, mortgage-backed
    securities guaranteed by government agencies and certain CMOs
    securitized by Bayview Financial Holdings, L.P. (together with
    its affiliates, “Bayview Financial”), a privately-held
    specialty mortgage finance company and the majority investor of
    BLG, in its

held-to-maturity

investment securities portfolio. The Company purchased certain
    private placement CMOs during 2008 that had been securitized by
    Bayview Financial. Given the Company’s relationship with
    Bayview Financial and related entities at that time, the Company
    reconsidered its intention to hold other CMOs securitized by
    Bayview Financial with a cost basis of $385 million and a
    fair value of $298 million and transferred such securities
    from its

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio to its

held-to-maturity

investment securities portfolio. During 2010, the Company
    recognized a $5 million (pre-tax)

other-than-temporary

impairment loss related to CMOs in the

held-to-maturity

portfolio having an amortized cost (before impairment charge) of
    $9 million. Similar to its evaluation of privately issued
    residential mortgage-backed securities, the Company assessed
    impairment losses on these CMOs by performing internal modeling
    to estimate bond-specific cash flows, which considered the
    placement of the bond in the overall securitization structure
    and the remaining subordination levels. In total, at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had in its

held-to-maturity

portfolio CMOs with an amortized cost basis of $313 million
    (after impairment charge) and $352 million, respectively,
    and a fair value of $198 million and $201 million,
    respectively. At December 31, 2010, the amortized cost and
    fair value of CMOs securitized by Bayview Financial in the
    Company’s

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio were $25 million and
    $22 million, respectively, and at December 31, 2009
    were $33 million and $25 million, respectively. Given
    the credit enhancements within each of the individual bond
    structures, the Company has determined that the remaining
    private CMOs securitized by Bayview Financial were not

other-than-temporarily

impaired at December 31, 2010.

The AIB ADSs were obtained in a 2003 acquisition and are held to
    satisfy options to purchase such shares granted by the acquired
    entity to certain employees. Factors contributing to the
    $12 million

other-than-temporary

impairment charge in 2010 related to the AIB ADSs included
    mounting credit and other losses incurred by AIB, the issuance
    of AIB common stock in lieu of dividend payments on certain
    preferred stock issuances held by the Irish government resulting
    in significant dilution of AIB common shareholders, and public
    announcements by Irish government officials suggesting that
    increased government support, which could further dilute AIB
    common shareholders, may be necessary.

During 2009 the Company recognized $138 million (pre-tax)
    of

other-than-temporary

losses, including $128 million related to CMOs backed by
    privately issued mortgage-backed securities with an amortized
    cost basis (before impairment charge) of $486 million and
    $10 million related to CDOs backed largely by trust
    preferred securities issued by financial institutions with an
    amortized cost basis (before impairment charge) of
    $18 million. During 2008 the Company recognized
    $182 million (pre-tax) of

other-than-temporary

losses, $18 million of which related to privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost basis (before
    impairment charge) of $20 million and $11 million
    related to securities backed by trust preferred securities
    issued by financial institutions with an amortized cost basis
    (before impairment charge) of $12 million. The remaining
    $153 million of

other-than-temporary

impairment in 2008 related to the Company’s holdings of
    preferred stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with an amortized
    cost basis (before impairment charge) of $162 million.

As of December 31, 2010, based on a review of each of the
    remaining securities in the investment securities portfolio, the
    Company concluded that the declines in the values of those
    securities were temporary and that any additional

other-than-temporary

impairment charges were not appropriate. As of



that date, the Company did not intend to sell nor is it
    anticipated that it would be required to sell any of its
    impaired securities, that is, where fair value is less than the
    cost basis of the security. The Company intends to continue to
    closely monitor the performance of the privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities and other securities because changes
    in their underlying credit performance or other events could
    cause the cost basis of those securities to become

other-than-temporarily

impaired. However, because the unrealized losses on

available-for-sale

investment securities have generally already been reflected in
    the financial statement values for investment securities and
    shareholders’ equity, any recognition of an

other-than-temporary

decline in value of those investment securities would not have a
    material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    condition. Any additional

other-than-temporary

impairment charge related to

held-to-maturity

securities would result in reductions in the financial statement
    values for investment securities and shareholders’ equity.
    Additional information concerning fair value measurements and
    the Company’s approach to the classification of such
    measurements is included in note 20 of the Notes to
    Financial Statements.

Adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit
    pension and other postretirement plans, net of applicable tax
    effect, reduced accumulated other comprehensive income by
    $121 million, or $1.01 per common share, at
    December 31, 2010, $117 million, or $.99 per common
    share, at December 31, 2009, and $174 million, or
    $1.58 per common share, at December 31, 2008. The decrease
    in such adjustment at December 31, 2009 as compared with
    December 31, 2008 was predominantly the result of actual
    investment performance of assets held by the Company’s
    qualified pension plans being significantly better than assumed
    for actuarial purposes. During the second quarter of 2009, the
    Company contributed 900,000 shares of M&T common stock
    having a then fair value of $44 million to the
    Company’s qualified defined benefit pension plan. Those
    shares were issued from previously held treasury stock.
    Information about the funded status of the Company’s
    pension and other postretirement benefit plans is included in
    note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Cash dividends declared on M&T’s common stock totaled
    $336 million in 2010, compared with $327 million and
    $309 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Dividends per
    common share totaled $2.80 in each of 2010, 2009 and 2008.
    During 2010, cash dividends of $38 million, or $50.00 per
    share, were declared and paid to the U.S. Treasury on
    M&T’s Series A ($30 million) and
    Series C ($8 million) Preferred Stock. Similar
    dividends of $31 million were declared and paid in 2009.
    Cash dividends of $3 million and $1 million ($100.00
    per share and $50.00 per share) were declared and paid during
    2010 and 2009, respectively, on M&T’s Series B
    Preferred Stock. The Series B and Series C Preferred
    Stock were created in connection with the Provident transaction.
    The Company did not repurchase any of its common stock in 2010,
    2009 or 2008.

Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to
    maintain “Tier 1 capital” and “total
    capital” ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of
    risk-adjusted total assets. In addition to the risk-based
    measures, Federal bank regulators have also implemented a
    minimum “leverage” ratio guideline of 3% of the
    quarterly average of total assets. At December 31, 2010,
    Tier 1 capital included $1.1 billion of trust
    preferred securities as described in note 9 of Notes to
    Financial Statements and total capital further included
    $1.5 billion of subordinated capital notes. Pursuant to the
    Dodd-Frank Act, trust preferred securities will be phased-out of
    the definition of Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies.
    The capital ratios of the Company and its banking subsidiaries
    as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 are presented in
    note 23 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Fourth
    Quarter Results

Net income during the fourth quarter of 2010 rose 49% to
    $204 million from $137 million in the year-earlier
    quarter. Diluted and basic earnings per common share were each
    $1.59 in the final 2010 quarter, 53% and 51% higher than $1.04
    and $1.05 of diluted and basic earnings per common share,
    respectively, in the corresponding quarter of 2009. The
    annualized rates of return on average assets and average common
    shareholders’ equity for the recently completed quarter
    were 1.18% and 10.03%, respectively, compared with .79% and
    7.09%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2009.

Net operating income totaled $196 million in the recent
    quarter, compared with $151 million in the fourth quarter
    of 2009. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were
    $1.52 in the final 2010 quarter, compared with $1.16 in the
    year-earlier quarter. The annualized net operating returns on



average tangible assets and average tangible common equity in
    the fourth quarter of 2010 were 1.20% and 18.43%, respectively,
    compared with .92% and 16.73%, respectively, in the similar 2009
    quarter. Core deposit and other intangible asset amortization,
    after tax effect, totaled $8 million and $10 million
    in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009 ($.07 and $.09 per
    diluted common share, respectively). The after-tax impact of
    merger-related expenses and the gain associated with the K Bank
    acquisition transaction totaled to a net gain of
    $16 million ($27 million pre-tax) or $.14 of diluted
    earnings per common share in the fourth quarter of 2010. The
    after-tax impact of merger-related expenses related to the
    Provident and Bradford acquisition transactions was
    $4 million ($6 million pre-tax) or $.03 of diluted
    earnings per common share in the final quarter of 2009.
    Reconciliations of GAAP results with non-GAAP results for the
    quarterly periods of 2010 and 2009 are provided in table 24.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 3% to
    $580 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 from
    $565 million in the year-earlier quarter. That growth
    reflects a 14 basis point widening of the Company’s
    net interest margin. The yield on earning assets was 4.58% in
    each of the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009. The rate paid on
    interest-bearing liabilities declined 16 basis points to
    .97% in the final quarter of 2010 from 1.13% in the
    corresponding quarter of 2009. The resulting net interest spread
    was 3.61% in the recent quarter, up 16 basis points from
    3.45% in the fourth quarter of 2009. That improvement was
    largely due to lower interest rates paid on deposits. The
    contribution of net interest-free funds to the Company’s
    net interest margin was .24% in the recent quarter, down
    slightly from .26% in the year-earlier quarter. That decline
    reflects the impact of lower interest rates on interest-bearing
    liabilities used to value such contribution. As a result, the
    Company’s net interest margin widened to 3.85% in the final
    2010 quarter from 3.71% in the similar quarter of 2009. Average
    earning assets in the fourth quarter of 2010 totaled
    $59.7 billion, down 1% from $60.5 billion in the
    year-earlier quarter. That decline resulted from lower average
    loans and leases, which decreased 2% to $51.1 billion in
    the recent quarter from $52.1 billion in 2009’s final
    quarter. Average commercial loan and lease balances were
    $13.0 billion in the recent quarter, down $514 million
    or 4% from $13.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009.
    That decline was the result of generally lower demand for
    commercial loans throughout most of 2010. Commercial real estate
    loans averaged $20.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010,
    down $326 million from $21.0 billion in the
    year-earlier quarter. Average residential real estate loans
    outstanding rose 8% or $453 million to $5.9 billion in
    the recent quarter from $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter
    of 2009. That increase was predominantly the result of the
    impact of adopting the already discussed new accounting rules on
    January 1, 2010 related to non-recourse securitization
    transactions using qualified special-purpose trusts. Included in
    the residential real estate loan portfolio were loans held for
    sale, which averaged $556 million and $497 million in
    the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Consumer
    loans averaged $11.6 billion in the recent quarter, down
    $558 million, or 5%, from $12.1 billion in the final
    2009 quarter. That decline was largely due to lower outstanding
    automobile and home equity loan balances. Despite sluggish loan
    demand throughout much of 2010, total loans increased
    $1.2 billion to $52.0 billion at December 31,
    2010 from $50.8 billion at September 30, 2010. That
    growth was largely attributable to December increases in
    commercial loans and commercial real estate loans.

The provision for credit losses was $85 million in the
    three-month period ended December 31, 2010, compared with
    $145 million in the year-earlier period. Net charge-offs of
    loans were $77 million in the final quarter of 2010,
    representing an annualized .60% of average loans and leases
    outstanding, compared with $135 million or 1.03% during the
    year-earlier quarter. Net charge-offs included: residential real
    estate loans of $15 million in the recently completed
    quarter, compared with $21 million a year earlier; loans to
    builders and developers of residential real estate properties of
    $22 million, compared with $40 million in the fourth
    quarter of 2009; other commercial real estate loans of
    $13 million, compared with $11 million a year earlier;
    commercial loans of $5 million, compared with
    $31 million in 2009; and consumer loans of
    $22 million, compared with $32 million in the prior
    year’s fourth quarter.

Other income totaled $287 million in the recent quarter, up
    8% from $266 million in the year-earlier quarter. Net
    losses on investment securities (including

other-than-temporary

impairment charges) were $27 million during the fourth
    quarter of 2010, compared with $34 million in the
    year-earlier quarter. The losses were predominantly due to

other-than-temporary

impairment charges related to certain of the Company’s
    privately issued CMOs. Reflected in other income for the fourth
    quarter of 2010 was the $28 million gain recorded on the K
    Bank acquisition transaction. Excluding net losses on



investment securities and the merger-related gain, other income
    was $286 million, down 5% from $300 million in the
    year-earlier quarter. The most significant contributors to that
    decline were lower residential mortgage banking revenues and
    service charges on deposit accounts, partially offset by higher
    trading account and foreign exchange gains and letter of credit
    and other credit-related fees. The decline in residential
    mortgage banking revenues in the recent quarter reflects lower
    origination volumes, the Company’s decision to retain for
    portfolio a higher proportion of originated loans rather than
    selling them, and increased settlements related to obligations
    to repurchase previously sold loans. Charges against mortgage
    banking revenues related to such repurchase obligations were
    $14 million in the recent quarter and $6 million in
    the fourth quarter of 2009. The lower service charges on deposit
    accounts reflect the new regulations that went into effect in
    the third quarter of 2010. The Federal Reserve and other
    regulators have adopted regulations requiring expanded
    disclosure of overdraft and other fees assessed to consumers and
    issued guidance that requires consumers to elect to be subject
    to fees for certain deposit account transactions that began
    July 1, 2010 for new customers and August 15, 2010 for
    pre-existing customers. The Company estimates that these new
    regulations resulted in a decrease in deposit account service
    charges of approximately $16 million in the fourth quarter
    of 2010.

Other expense in the fourth quarter of 2010 totaled
    $469 million, compared with $478 million in the
    year-earlier quarter. Included in such amounts are expenses
    considered to be “nonoperating” in nature consisting
    of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of
    $13 million and $17 million in the final quarters of
    2010 and 2009, respectively, and merger-related expenses of $771
    thousand and $6 million in the fourth quarters of 2010 and
    2009, respectively. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses,
    noninterest operating expenses were $455 million in each of
    the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009. As compared with the
    fourth quarter of 2009, higher costs for professional services
    and advertising and promotion in the recent quarter were offset
    by lower expenses for salaries and employee benefits, equipment
    and occupancy, and other operating costs. The Company’s
    efficiency ratio during the fourth quarter of 2010 and 2009 was
    52.5% and 52.7%, respectively. Table 24 includes a
    reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense
    for each of the quarters of 2010 and 2009.

Segment
    Information

In accordance with GAAP, the Company’s reportable segments
    have been determined based upon its internal profitability
    reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit.
    Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment
    information reporting purposes where the nature of the products
    and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of
    those products and services are similar. The reportable segments
    are Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real
    Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking
    and Retail Banking.

The financial information of the Company’s segments was
    compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in
    note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management
    accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment
    financial information are highly subjective and, unlike
    financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance
    similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the
    financial information of the reported segments are not
    necessarily comparable with similar information reported by
    other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management
    structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result
    in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial
    information about the Company’s segments is presented in
    note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Business Banking segment provides a wide range of services
    to small businesses and professionals through the Company’s
    branch network, business banking centers and other delivery
    channels such as telephone banking, Internet banking and
    automated teller machines within markets served by the Company.
    Services and products offered by this segment include various
    business loans and leases, including loans guaranteed by the
    Small Business Administration, business credit cards, deposit
    products, and financial services such as cash management,
    payroll and direct deposit, merchant credit card and letters of
    credit. The Business Banking segment contributed net income of
    $99 million in 2010, 21% lower than the $124 million
    recorded in 2009. That decline was predominately due to a
    $33 million increase in the provision for credit losses,
    the result of increased net charge-offs of loans. Net income
    earned in 2008 totaled $120 million. The favorable
    performance in 2009 as compared with 2008 was due



to higher net interest income of $33 million, largely
    attributable to higher average deposit and loan balances of
    $869 million and $416 million, respectively, partially
    offset by a $20 million increase in total noninterest
    expenses, reflecting higher FDIC assessments of
    $10 million, and an $8 million increase in the
    provision for credit losses, the result of higher net
    charge-offs of loans. Approximately three-fourths of the higher
    net interest income was due to the Provident transaction.

The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit
    products and banking services for middle-market and large
    commercial customers, mainly within the markets served by the
    Company. Services provided by this segment include commercial
    lending and leasing, letters of credit, deposit products, and
    cash management services. The Commercial Banking segment earned
    $314 million in 2010, up 31% from $239 million in
    2009. The increase in net income in 2010 as compared with 2009
    reflects a $60 million decline in the provision for credit
    losses, due to lower net loan charge-offs, as well as a
    $51 million rise in net interest income, due to a
    $2.0 billion increase in average deposit balances and a
    26 basis point widening of the net interest margin on
    loans. Net income contributed by this segment in 2008 was
    $213 million. The higher net income in 2009 as compared
    with 2008 reflects a $98 million increase in net interest
    income, primarily due to a $3.0 billion increase in average
    deposit balances. Approximately 15% of the increase in net
    interest income was due to the Provident acquisition. Partially
    offsetting that increase were a $31 million increase in the
    provision for credit losses, predominately due to higher net
    charge-offs of loans, and a $15 million rise in FDIC
    assessments.

The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit
    services to its customers. Real estate securing loans in this
    segment is generally located in the New York City metropolitan
    area, upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of
    Columbia, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and the
    northwestern portion of the United States. Commercial real
    estate loans may be secured by apartment/multifamily buildings;
    office, retail and industrial space; or other types of
    collateral. Activities of this segment also include the
    origination, sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans
    through the Fannie Mae DUS program and other programs. Net
    income for the Commercial Real Estate segment improved 31% to
    $203 million in 2010 from $155 million in 2009.
    Factors contributing to the significant rise in net income
    include: a $39 million decline in the provision for credit
    losses, mainly due to lower net charge-offs of loans; a
    $38 million increase in net interest income; and higher
    revenues from mortgage banking activities of $13 million,
    the result of increased loan origination and sales activities.
    The rise in net interest income was attributable to a
    28 basis point expansion of the net interest margin on
    loans and increases in average deposit and loan balances of
    $430 million and $249 million, respectively, partially
    offset by a 57 basis point narrowing of the net interest
    margin on deposits. Partially offsetting the favorable factors
    were higher noninterest expenses, which include increased
    personnel-related costs and foreclosure-related expenses of
    $8 million and $5 million, respectively. In 2008, net
    income for the Commercial Real Estate segment was
    $164 million. Factors contributing to the 5% decline in net
    income in 2009 when compared with 2008 were a $69 million
    increase in the provision for credit losses, primarily due to
    higher net charge-offs of loans, and higher noninterest expenses
    of $15 million, including increased FDIC assessments of
    $4 million. Those increased costs were partially offset by
    higher net interest income of $59 million, largely
    attributable to higher average loan and deposit balances of
    $1.4 billion and $489 million, respectively, and an
    18 basis point widening of the net interest margin on
    loans. Approximately one-half of the increase in net interest
    income was due to the Provident acquisition.

The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and
    trading securities, residential mortgage loans and other assets;
    short-term and long-term borrowed funds; brokered certificates
    of deposit and interest rate swap agreements related thereto;
    and Cayman Islands branch deposits. This segment also provides
    foreign exchange services to customers. Included in the assets
    of the Discretionary Portfolio segment are most of the
    investment securities for which the Company has recognized

other-than-temporary

impairment charges in each of the last three years and the
    portfolio of Alt-A mortgage loans. The Discretionary Portfolio
    segment incurred net losses of $39 million,
    $28 million and $48 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Included in this segment’s results were

other-than-temporary

impairment charges of $74 million in 2010,
    $138 million in 2009 and $182 million in 2008. The
    impairment charges recorded in 2010 and 2009 predominately
    related to privately issued CMOs, while the 2008 impairment



charges were largely from the Company’s holdings of
    preferred stock issuances of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In
    addition to the impact of impairment charges, the higher net
    loss incurred in 2010 as compared with 2009 reflects a decrease
    in net interest income of $114 million, resulting from a
    42 basis point narrowing of this segment’s net
    interest margin, offset, in part, by a $27 million
    reduction in the provision for credit losses, due to lower net
    charge-offs of loans. Factors contributing to this
    segment’s lower net loss in 2009 as compared with 2008 were
    a $44 million decline in

other-than-temporary

impairment charges, the impact of a partial reversal of the
    valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage
    servicing rights of $6 million in 2009, compared with an
    addition to the valuation allowance of $6 million in 2008,
    and lower foreclosure-related costs of $10 million.
    Partially offsetting those favorable factors were a
    $14 million increase in the provision for credit losses,
    driven by higher net charge-offs, and a $7 million decline
    in net interest income, reflecting lower average balances of
    investment securities and loans of $529 million and
    $290 million, respectively.

The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services
    residential mortgage loans and sells substantially all of those
    loans in the secondary market to investors or to the
    Discretionary Portfolio segment. This segment also originates
    and services loans to developers of residential real estate
    properties, although that origination activity has been
    significantly curtailed. In addition to the geographic regions
    served by or contiguous with the Company’s branch network,
    the Company maintains mortgage loan origination offices in
    several states throughout the western United States. The Company
    also periodically purchases the rights to service mortgage
    loans. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are included in
    this segment. This segment recorded net income of
    $11 million in 2010, compared with net losses of
    $13 million and $48 million in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The net losses incurred in 2009 and 2008 reflect
    significant net charge-offs of loans to builders and developers
    of residential real estate. The improvement of this
    segment’s results in 2010 as compared with 2009 was
    attributable to the following: a $49 million reduction in
    the provision for credit losses, including a decline in net
    charge-offs of loans to builders and developers of residential
    real estate; lower foreclosure-related expenses of
    $20 million, the result of updated appraised values on
    certain previously

foreclosed-upon

residential real estate development projects in 2009; and an
    $8 million decrease in personnel-related expenses.
    Partially offsetting those favorable factors were a
    $16 million partial reversal of the capitalized mortgage
    servicing rights valuation allowance in 2009 (as compared with
    no change in such allowance in 2010) and a decline in
    revenues relating to residential mortgage origination and sales
    activities of $19 million. The lower residential mortgage
    revenues in 2010 reflect lower origination volumes and increased
    settlements related to the Company’s obligation to
    repurchase previously sold loans. The lower net loss in 2009 as
    compared with 2008 was due to: a $55 million rise in
    noninterest revenues from residential mortgage loan origination
    activities, due to increased volume and wider margins; the
    impact of a partial reversal of the capitalized mortgage
    servicing rights valuation allowance of $16 million in
    2009, compared with a $10 million addition to such
    allowance in 2008; and a $13 million increase in net
    interest income, partly due to a 68 basis point widening of
    the net interest margin on loans. A rise in total noninterest
    expenses of $43 million (excluding the capitalized mortgage
    servicing rights valuation allowance reversal), reflecting
    higher foreclosure-related costs of $23 million, partially
    offset those favorable factors.

The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of services to
    consumers through several delivery channels which include branch
    offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and
    Internet banking. The Company has branch offices in New York
    State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the District of
    Columbia, West Virginia, Delaware and New Jersey. The Retail
    Banking segment also offers certain deposit products on a
    nationwide basis through the delivery channels of M&T Bank,
    N.A. Credit services offered by this segment include consumer
    installment loans, automobile loans (originated both directly
    and indirectly through dealers), home equity loans and lines of
    credit and credit cards. The segment also offers to its
    customers deposit products, including demand, savings and time
    accounts; investment products, including mutual funds and
    annuities; and other services. Net income contributed by the
    Retail Banking segment aggregated $225 million in 2010,
    down from $237 million in 2009. Lower net interest income
    of $39 million, the result of a 25 basis point
    narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits, and an
    $8 million rise in net occupancy expenses contributed to
    the decline in net income. Those factors were partially offset
    by a decrease in the provision for credit losses of
    $21 million (due to lower net charge-offs of loans), a
    decline in FDIC assessments of $7 million, and higher fees
    earned for



providing deposit account services of $5 million. Net
    income for this segment decreased 5% in 2009 from the
    $250 million earned in 2008. Factors contributing to that
    decline included: a $42 million increase in FDIC
    assessments; a rise in the provision for credit losses of
    $32 million, resulting from higher net charge-offs of
    consumer loans; and increases in personnel and net occupancy
    costs of $17 million and $16 million, respectively,
    related to the operations added with the Provident acquisition.
    Partially offsetting those unfavorable factors were a
    $48 million increase in net interest income and a
    $34 million rise in fees earned for providing deposit
    account services to Provident customers. The higher net interest
    income was due to a $2.4 billion increase in average
    deposit balances (approximately 60 percent of which was due
    to the impact of the Provident acquisition) and a 26 basis
    point widening of the net interest margin on loans, offset, in
    part, by a 26 basis point narrowing of the deposit net
    interest margin.

The “All Other” category reflects other activities of
    the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported
    segments. Reflected in this category are the amortization of
    core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from the
    acquisitions of financial institutions, M&T’s share of
    the operating losses of BLG, merger-related gains and expenses
    resulting from acquisitions and the net impact of the
    Company’s allocation methodologies for internal transfers
    for funding charges and credits associated with the earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Company’s
    reportable segments and the provision for credit losses. The
    various components of the “All Other” category
    resulted in net losses of $78 million, $335 million
    and $95 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    improved performance in 2010 as compared with 2009 was largely
    due to the favorable impact from the Company’s allocation
    methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and
    credits associated with the earning assets and interest-bearing
    liabilities of the Company’s reportable segments and the
    provision for credit losses and a net merger-related gain in
    2010 of $27 million, compared with net merger-related
    expenses in 2009 totaling $60 million. The following
    unfavorable factors contributed to the higher net loss in 2009
    as compared with 2008: the impact from the Company’s
    allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding
    charges and credits associated with the earning assets and
    interest-bearing liabilities of the Company’s reportable
    segments and the provision for credit losses; $60 million
    of net merger-related expenses associated with the Provident and
    Bradford acquisitions recorded in 2009, compared with
    $4 million of merger-related expenses in 2008 related to
    acquisition transactions completed in the fourth quarter of
    2007; Visa-related transactions that were recorded in the first
    quarter of 2008, including a $33 million gain realized from
    the mandatory partial redemption of Visa stock owned by M&T
    Bank and $15 million related to the reversal of Visa
    litigation-related accruals initially recorded in 2007’s
    fourth quarter; increased personnel costs associated with the
    business and support units included in the “All Other”
    category of $35 million, including higher costs for
    medical, pension and post-retirement benefits; the impact of a
    $40 million reduction of income tax expense recorded in
    2008’s third quarter relating to M&T’s resolution
    of certain tax issues from its activities in various
    jurisdictions during the years

1999-2007;

lower trust income of $28 million; a $16 million
    increase in FDIC assessments; and a $6 million increase in
    charitable contributions made to the M&T Charitable
    Foundation. A $13 million (pre-tax) improvement from
    M&T’s share of the operating results of BLG (inclusive
    of interest expense to fund that investment) partially offset
    the favorable factors.

Recent
    Accounting Developments

In June 2009, the FASB amended accounting guidance relating to
    the consolidation of variable interest entities to eliminate the
    quantitative approach previously required for determining the
    primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. The amended
    guidance instead requires a reporting entity to qualitatively
    assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a
    variable interest entity based on whether the reporting entity
    has the power to direct the activities that most significantly
    impact the variable interest entity’s economic performance
    and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive
    benefits of the variable interest entity that could potentially
    be significant to the variable interest entity. The amended
    guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether the reporting
    entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity.
    The amended guidance became effective as of January 1, 2010.



Also in June 2009, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance
    relating to accounting for transfers of financial assets to
    eliminate the exceptions for qualifying special-purpose entities
    from the consolidation guidance and the exception that permitted
    sale accounting for certain mortgage securitizations when a
    transferor has not surrendered control over the transferred
    assets. The amended guidance became effective as of
    January 1, 2010. The recognition and measurement provisions
    of the amended guidance were applied to transfers that occur on
    or after the effective date. Additionally, beginning
    January 1, 2010, the concept of a qualifying
    special-purpose entity is no longer relevant for accounting
    purposes. Therefore, formerly qualifying special-purpose
    entities must now be evaluated for consolidation in accordance
    with applicable consolidation guidance, including the new
    accounting guidance relating to the consolidation of variable
    interest entities discussed in the previous paragraph.

Effective January 1, 2010, the Company included in its
    consolidated financial statements

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans that were included in two
    separate non-recourse securitization transactions using
    qualified special-purpose trusts. The effect of that
    consolidation was to increase loans receivable by
    $424 million, decrease the amortized cost of

available-for-sale

investment securities by $360 million (fair value of
    $355 million), and increase borrowings by $65 million
    as of January 1, 2010. Information concerning these
    securitization transactions is included in note 19 of Notes
    to Financial Statements.

In January 2010, the FASB amended fair value measurement and
    disclosure guidance to require disclosure of significant
    transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value
    measurements and the reasons for the transfers and to require
    separate presentation of information about purchases, sales,
    issuances and settlements in the rollforward of activity in
    Level 3 fair value measurements. The amended guidance also
    clarifies existing requirements that (i) fair value
    measurement disclosures should be disaggregated for each class
    of asset and liability and (ii) disclosures about valuation
    techniques and inputs for both recurring and nonrecurring
    Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements should be
    provided. The guidance is effective for interim and annual
    periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the
    disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in
    the rollforward of activity in Level 3 fair value
    measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2010 and for interim periods within
    those years. The adoption of this guidance did not impact the
    Company’s financial position or results of operations.

In March 2010, the FASB amended accounting guidance relating to
    a scope exception for derivative accounting to clarify that only
    embedded credit derivative features related to the transfer of
    credit risk in the form of subordination of one financial
    instrument to another should not be analyzed for potential
    bifurcation from the host contract and separate accounting as a
    derivative. Embedded credit derivative features in a form other
    than subordination do not qualify for the scope exception, even
    if their effects are allocated according to subordination
    provisions. The guidance was effective at the beginning of the
    first quarter beginning after June 15, 2010. The adoption
    of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the
    reporting of the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations.

In April 2010, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance
    relating to the effect of a loan modification when the loan is
    part of a pool that is accounted for as a single asset under the
    guidance for loans and debt securities acquired with
    deteriorated credit quality. The amended guidance requires
    modifications of loans that are accounted for within a pool to
    remain in the pool even if the modification would be considered
    a troubled debt restructuring. Companies are required to
    continue to review the pool of assets in which the modified loan
    is included to determine whether the pool is impaired if the
    expected cash flows for the pool change. The guidance was
    effective for prospective modifications of loans accounted for
    within pools occurring in the first interim or annual period
    ending on or after July 15, 2010. The adoption of this
    guidance did not have a significant impact on the reporting of
    the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

In July 2010, the FASB issued amended disclosure guidance
    relating to credit risk inherent in an entity’s portfolio
    of financing receivables and the related allowance for credit
    losses. The amended disclosures are required at two
    disaggregated levels. One level of disaggregation is the
    portfolio segment which represents the level at which an entity
    develops and documents a systematic method for determining its
    allowance for credit losses. The second level of disaggregation
    is the class of financing receivables which generally represents
    a disaggregation of a portfolio segment. The amended disclosures



include a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses by
    portfolio segment with the ending balance further disaggregated
    on the basis of the impairment method, the related recorded
    investment in each portfolio segment, the nonaccrual status of
    financing receivables by class, the impaired financing
    receivables by class, the credit quality indicators of financing
    receivables at the end of the reporting period by class, the
    aging of past due financing receivables at the end of the
    reporting period by class, the nature and extent of troubled
    debt restructurings that occurred during the period by class and
    their effect on the allowance for credit losses, the nature and
    extent of financing receivables modified as troubled debt
    restructurings within the previous twelve months that defaulted
    during the reporting period by class and their effect on the
    allowance for credit losses, and the significant purchases and
    sales of financing receivables during the reporting period by
    portfolio segment. The disclosures as of the end of a reporting
    period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods
    ending on or after December 15, 2010 and the disclosures
    about activity that occurs during a reporting period are
    effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on
    or after December 15, 2010. Upon initial application, the
    disclosures are not required for earlier periods that are
    presented for comparative purposes. The Company has complied
    with the disclosures required as of December 31, 2010 and
    intends to comply with the remaining disclosure requirements
    when they become effective.

In October 2010, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance
    relating to the goodwill impairment test for reporting units
    with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting
    units with zero or negative carrying amounts, an entity is
    required to perform “Step Two” of the goodwill
    impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill
    impairment exists. In determining whether it is more likely than
    not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider
    whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating
    that an impairment may exist. The guidance is effective for
    fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning
    after December 15, 2010. The Company does not anticipate
    that the adoption of this guidance will have a significant
    impact on the reporting of its financial position or results of
    its operations.

In December 2010, the FASB issued amended disclosure guidance
    relating to the pro forma information for business combinations
    that occurred in the current reporting period. The amended
    disclosure states that if an entity presents comparative
    financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and
    earnings of the combined entity as though the business
    combination(s) that occurred during the current year had
    occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual
    reporting period. The guidance is effective prospectively for
    business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
    after the beginning of the first annual reporting period
    beginning on or after December 15, 2010. The Company
    intends to comply with the disclosure requirements when they
    become effective.

Forward-Looking
    Statements

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations and other sections of this Annual
    Report contain forward-looking statements that are based on
    current expectations, estimates and projections about the
    Company’s business, management’s beliefs and
    assumptions made by management. These statements are not
    guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks,
    uncertainties and assumptions (“Future Factors”) which
    are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results
    may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in
    such forward-looking statements.

Future Factors include changes in interest rates, spreads on
    earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and interest
    rate sensitivity; prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit
    losses and market values on loans, collateral securing loans and
    other assets; sources of liquidity; common shares outstanding;
    common stock price volatility; fair value of and number of
    stock-based compensation awards to be issued in future periods;
    legislation affecting the financial services industry as a
    whole, and M&T and its subsidiaries individually or
    collectively, including tax legislation; regulatory supervision
    and oversight, including monetary policy and capital
    requirements; changes in accounting policies or procedures as
    may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies;
    increasing price and product/service competition by competitors,
    including new entrants; rapid technological developments and
    changes; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new
    products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis; the mix
    of products/services; containing costs and expenses;
    governmental and public policy changes; protection and



validity of intellectual property rights; reliance on large
    customers; technological, implementation and cost/financial
    risks in large, multi-year contracts; the outcome of pending and
    future litigation and governmental proceedings, including
    tax-related examinations and other matters; continued
    availability of financing; financial resources in the amounts,
    at the times and on the terms required to support M&T and
    its subsidiaries’ future businesses; and material
    differences in the actual financial results of merger,
    acquisition and investment activities compared with
    M&T’s initial expectations, including the full
    realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements.

These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect
    the outcome of the forward-looking statements. In addition, such
    statements could be affected by general industry and market
    conditions and growth rates, general economic and political
    conditions, either nationally or in the states in which M&T
    and its subsidiaries do business, including interest rate and
    currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes and trends in the
    securities markets, and other Future Factors.

Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting at M&T
    Bank Corporation and subsidiaries (“the Company”).
    Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010 based on criteria described in
    “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, management
    concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, that was engaged to express an opinion
    as to the fairness of presentation of such financial statements.
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was also engaged to assess the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting. The report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
    follows this report.

    G. Wilmers

René
    F. Jones

Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and
    Shareholders of

M&T Bank Corporation

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of M&T Bank Corporation and its
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
    opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for these financial statements, for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting, included in the accompanying Report on Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
    express opinions on these financial statements and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements

1.

Significant
    accounting policies

M&T Bank Corporation (“M&T”) is a bank
    holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York. Through
    subsidiaries, M&T provides individuals, corporations and
    other businesses, and institutions with commercial and retail
    banking services, including loans and deposits, trust, mortgage
    banking, asset management, insurance and other financial
    services. Banking activities are largely focused on consumers
    residing in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and
    the District of Columbia and on small and medium-size businesses
    based in those areas. Banking services are also provided in
    Delaware, West Virginia and New Jersey, while certain
    subsidiaries also conduct activities in other areas.

The accounting and reporting policies of M&T and
    subsidiaries (“the Company”) conform to generally
    accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and to general
    practices within the banking industry. The preparation of
    financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates. The more significant accounting policies are as
    follows:

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include M&T and all
    of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
    transactions of consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated
    in consolidation. The financial statements of M&T included
    in note 26 report investments in subsidiaries under the
    equity method. Information about some limited purpose entities
    that are affiliates of the Company but are not included in the
    consolidated financial statements appears in note 19.

Consolidated
    Statement of Cash Flows

For purposes of this statement, cash and due from banks and
    federal funds sold are considered cash and cash equivalents.

Securities
    purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under
    agreements to repurchase

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities
    sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as
    collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at
    amounts equal to the cash or other consideration exchanged. It
    is generally the Company’s policy to take possession of
    collateral pledged to secure agreements to resell.

Trading
    account

Financial instruments used for trading purposes are stated at
    fair value. Realized gains and losses and unrealized changes in
    fair value of financial instruments utilized in trading
    activities are included in “trading account and foreign
    exchange gains” in the consolidated statement of income.

Investment
    securities

Investments in debt securities are classified as held to
    maturity and stated at amortized cost when management has the
    positive intent and ability to hold such securities to maturity.
    Investments in other debt securities and equity securities
    having readily determinable fair values are classified as
    available for sale and stated at estimated fair value.
    Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts for
    investment securities available for sale and held to maturity
    are included in interest income. Except for investment
    securities for which the Company has entered into a related fair
    value hedge, unrealized gains or losses on investment securities
    available for sale are reflected in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable income taxes.

Other securities are stated at cost and include stock of the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank
    (“FHLB”) of New York.

The cost basis of individual securities is written down through
    a charge to earnings when declines in value below amortized cost
    are considered to be other than temporary. In cases where fair
    value is less than amortized cost and the Company intends to
    sell a debt security, it is more likely than not to be required
    to sell a debt security before recovery of its amortized cost
    basis, or the Company does not



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements — (Continued)

expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a debt
    security, an

other-than-temporary

impairment is considered to have occurred. If the Company
    intends to sell the debt security or more likely than not will
    be required to sell the security before recovery of its
    amortized cost basis, the

other-than-temporary

impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire
    difference between the debt security’s amortized cost basis
    and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If the Company
    does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of
    the security, the Company does not intend to sell the security
    and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be
    required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized
    cost basis, the

other-than-temporary

impairment is separated into (a) the amount representing
    the credit loss and (b) the amount related to all other
    factors. The amount of the

other-than-temporary

impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings
    while the amount related to other factors is recognized in other
    comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Subsequently, the
    Company accounts for the

other-than-temporarily

impaired debt security as if the security had been purchased on
    the measurement date of the

other-than-temporary

impairment at an amortized cost basis equal to the previous
    amortized cost basis less the

other-than-temporary

impairment recognized in earnings. The cost basis of individual
    equity securities is written down to estimated fair value
    through a charge to earnings when declines in value below cost
    are considered to be other than temporary. Realized gains and
    losses on the sales of investment securities are determined
    using the specific identification method.

Loans
    and leases

Interest income on loans is accrued on a level yield method.
    Loans are placed on nonaccrual status and previously accrued
    interest thereon is charged against income when principal or
    interest is delinquent 90 days, unless management
    determines that the loan status clearly warrants other
    treatment. Loan balances are charged off when it becomes evident
    that such balances are not fully collectible. For loans secured
    by residential real estate, the excess of the loan balances over
    the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the
    loan is charged-off when the loan becomes 150 days
    delinquent. Loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs
    are deferred and recognized as an interest yield adjustment over
    the life of the loan. Net deferred fees have been included in
    unearned discount as a reduction of loans outstanding.
    Commitments to sell real estate loans are utilized by the
    Company to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of real
    estate loans held for sale. The carrying value of hedged real
    estate loans held for sale recorded in the consolidated balance
    sheet includes changes in estimated fair market value during the
    hedge period, typically from the date of close through the sale
    date. Valuation adjustments made on these loans and commitments
    are included in “mortgage banking revenues.”

Except for consumer and residential mortgage loans that are
    considered smaller balance homogenous loans and are evaluated
    collectively and purchased-impaired loans, the Company considers
    a loan to be impaired for purposes of applying GAAP when, based
    on current information and events, it is probable that the
    Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the
    contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is
    delinquent 90 days. Purchased-impaired loans are considered
    impaired under GAAP when it is probable that the Company will be
    unable to collect all cash flows expected at acquisition plus
    additional cash flows expected to be collected arising from
    changes in estimates after acquisition. Regardless of loan type,
    the Company considers a loan to be impaired if it qualifies as a
    troubled debt restructuring. Impaired loans are classified as
    either nonaccrual or as loans renegotiated at below market
    rates, with the exception of purchased-impaired loans which
    continue to accrete income in accordance with GAAP. Certain
    loans greater than 90 days delinquent are not considered
    impaired if they are both well-secured and in the process of
    collection. Loans less than 90 days delinquent are deemed
    to have an insignificant delay in payment and are generally not
    considered impaired. Impairment of a loan is measured based on
    the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at
    the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s
    observable market price, or the fair value of collateral if the
    loan is collateral-dependent. Interest received on impaired
    loans placed on nonaccrual status is generally applied to reduce
    the carrying value of the loan or, if principal is considered
    fully collectible, recognized as interest income.

Due to changes in GAAP for loans acquired in a business
    combination subsequent to December 31, 2008, the excess of
    cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value
    is recognized as interest income over the remaining lives of the
    loans. Because those loans are recorded at fair value, no
    carry-over of an acquired entity’s previously established
    allowance for credit losses may be recorded.



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements — (Continued)

Subsequent decreases in the expected cash flows require the
    Company to evaluate the need for additions to the Company’s
    allowance for credit losses. Subsequent improvements in expected
    cash flows result in the recognition of additional interest
    income over the then remaining lives of the loans.

Residual value estimates for commercial leases are generally
    determined through internal or external reviews of the leased
    property. The Company reviews commercial lease residual values
    at least annually and recognizes residual value impairments
    deemed to be other than temporary.

Allowance
    for credit losses

The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in
    management’s judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit
    losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the
    balance sheet date. The adequacy of the allowance is determined
    by management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio
    based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated
    with each loan category, the current financial condition of
    specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers
    operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any
    collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any
    guarantees or indemnifications.

Assets
    taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans

Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans are primarily
    comprised of commercial and residential real property and are
    included in “other assets” in the consolidated balance
    sheet. Upon acquisition of assets taken in satisfaction of a
    defaulted loan, the excess of the remaining loan balance over
    the asset’s estimated fair value less costs to sell is
    charged off against the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent
    declines in value of the assets are recognized as “other
    expense” in the consolidated statement of income.

Premises
    and equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation expense is computed principally using
    the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets.

Capitalized
    servicing rights

Capitalized servicing assets are included in “other
    assets” in the consolidated balance sheet. Separately
    recognized servicing assets are initially measured at fair
    value. The Company uses the amortization method to subsequently
    measure servicing assets. Under that method, capitalized
    servicing assets are charged to expense in proportion to and
    over the period of estimated net servicing income.

To estimate the fair value of servicing rights, the Company
    considers market prices for similar assets and the present value
    of expected future cash flows associated with the servicing
    rights calculated using assumptions that market participants
    would use in estimating future servicing income and expense.
    Such assumptions include estimates of the cost of servicing
    loans, loan default rates, an appropriate discount rate, and
    prepayment speeds. For purposes of evaluating and measuring
    impairment of capitalized servicing rights, the Company
    stratifies such assets based on the predominant risk
    characteristics of the underlying financial instruments that are
    expected to have the most impact on projected prepayments, cost
    of servicing and other factors affecting future cash flows
    associated with the servicing rights. Such factors may include
    financial asset or loan type, note rate and term. The amount of
    impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value
    of the capitalized servicing rights for a stratum exceeds
    estimated fair value. Impairment is recognized through a
    valuation allowance.

Sales
    and securitizations of financial assets

Due to changes in GAAP, transfers of financial assets that occur
    on or after January 1, 2010 for which the Company has
    surrendered control of the financial assets are accounted for as
    sales. Interests in a sale of financial assets that continue to
    be held by the Company, including servicing rights, are measured
    at fair value. Prior to January 1, 2010, transfers of
    financial assets for which the Company had surrendered control
    of the financial assets were accounted for as sales to the
    extent that consideration other than beneficial interests in the
    transferred assets was received in exchange. Interests in a sale
    or securitization of financial assets that continued to be held
    by the Company, other than servicing rights which were initially
    measured at fair value, were measured at the date of transfer by
    allocating the previous carrying



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements — (Continued)

amount between the assets transferred and the retained interests
    based on their relative estimated fair values. The fair values
    of retained debt securities are generally determined through
    reference to independent pricing information. The fair values of
    retained servicing rights and any other retained interests are
    determined based on the present value of expected future cash
    flows associated with those interests and by reference to market
    prices for similar assets.

Also due to changes in GAAP, for transfers of financial assets
    that occur on or after January 1, 2010 the exception that
    permitted sale accounting for certain mortgage securitizations
    when a transferor has not surrendered control over the
    transferred assets was eliminated. The change in GAAP also
    eliminated the concept of qualifying special-purpose entities.
    As a result, beginning January 1, 2010, all formerly
    qualifying special-purpose entities had to be re-evaluated in
    accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance.
    Additional information on the effects of this accounting change
    and changes in the accounting guidance relating to the
    consolidation of variable interest entities is included in
    note 19.

Goodwill
    and core deposit and other intangible assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity
    over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
    Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment
    at least annually at the reporting unit level, which is either
    at the same level or one level below an operating segment. Other
    acquired intangible assets with finite lives, such as core
    deposit intangibles, are initially recorded at estimated value
    and are amortized over their estimated lives. Core deposit and
    other intangible assets are generally amortized using
    accelerated methods over estimated useful lives of five to ten
    years. The Company periodically assesses whether events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of
    core deposit and other intangible assets may be impaired.

Derivative
    financial instruments

The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments at
    fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be
    specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to
    changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or
    an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the
    exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction or
    (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net
    investment in a foreign operation, an unrecognized firm
    commitment, an available for sale security, or a foreign
    currency denominated forecasted transaction.

The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of
    the management of interest rate risk to modify the repricing
    characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities. For such agreements,
    amounts receivable or payable are recognized as accrued under
    the terms of the agreement and the net differential is recorded
    as an adjustment to interest income or expense of the related
    asset or liability. Interest rate swap agreements may be
    designated as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. In a
    fair value hedge, the fair values of the interest rate swap
    agreements and changes in the fair values of the hedged items
    are recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet
    with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current
    earnings. The difference between changes in the fair values of
    interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents
    hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in “other revenues
    from operations” in the consolidated statement of income.
    In a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the
    derivative’s unrealized gain or loss is initially recorded
    as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently
    reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction
    affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gain
    or loss is reported in “other revenues from
    operations” immediately.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to
    hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of real estate
    loans held for sale. Commitments to originate real estate loans
    to be held for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans
    are generally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at
    estimated fair market value.

Derivative instruments not related to mortgage banking
    activities, including financial futures commitments and interest
    rate swap agreements, that do not satisfy the hedge accounting
    requirements are recorded at fair value and are generally
    classified as trading account assets or liabilities with
    resultant changes in fair value being recognized in
    “trading account and foreign exchange gains” in the
    consolidated statement of income.

Stock-based
    compensation

Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the vesting
    period of the stock-based grant based on the estimated grant
    date value of the stock-based compensation that is expected to
    vest, except that the recognition of compensation costs is
    accelerated for stock-based awards granted to
    retirement-eligible employees and employees who will become
    retirement-eligible prior to full vesting of the award because
    the Company’s incentive compensation plan allows for
    vesting at the time an employee retires. Information on the
    determination of the estimated value of stock-based awards used
    to calculate stock-based compensation expense is included in
    note 11.

Income
    taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
    future tax effects attributable to differences between the
    financial statement value of existing assets and liabilities and
    their respective tax bases and carryforwards. Deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and
    laws.

The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions using the two-step
    process required by GAAP. The first step requires a
    determination of whether it is more likely than not that a tax
    position will be sustained upon examination, including
    resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based
    on the technical merits of the position. Under the second step,
    a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition
    threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is
    greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon
    ultimate settlement. Information related to uncertain tax
    positions is provided in note 13.

Earnings
    per common share

Basic earnings per common share exclude dilution and are
    computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by
    the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
    (exclusive of shares represented by the unvested portion of
    restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants) and common
    shares issuable under deferred compensation arrangements during
    the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflect shares
    represented by the unvested portion of restricted stock and
    restricted stock unit grants and the potential dilution that
    could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common
    stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted
    in the issuance of common stock that then shared in earnings.
    Proceeds assumed to have been received on such exercise or
    conversion are assumed to be used to purchase shares of M&T
    common stock at the average market price during the period, as
    required by the “treasury stock method” of accounting.

GAAP requires that for financial statements issued for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods
    within those years, unvested share-based payment awards that
    contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend
    equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) shall be considered
    participating securities and shall be included in the
    computation of earnings per common share pursuant to the
    two-class method. In 2009 and 2010, the Company issued
    stock-based compensation awards in the form of restricted stock
    and restricted stock units that contain such rights and,
    accordingly, beginning in 2009 the Company’s earnings per
    common share are calculated using the two-class method. The
    effects of the application of the two-class method to earnings
    per common share amounts for prior years were immaterial.

Treasury
    stock

Repurchases of shares of M&T common stock are recorded at
    cost as a reduction of shareholders’ equity. Reissuances of
    shares of treasury stock are recorded at average cost.

Acquisitions

On November 5, 2010, M&T Bank, M&T’s
    principal banking subsidiary, entered into a purchase and
    assumption agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation (“FDIC”) to assume all of the deposits,
    except certain brokered deposits, and acquire certain assets of
    K Bank, based in Randallstown, Maryland. As part of the
    transaction, M&T Bank entered into a loss-share arrangement
    with the FDIC whereby M&T Bank will be reimbursed by the
    FDIC for most losses it incurs on the acquired loan portfolio.
    The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method
    of accounting and,



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements — (Continued)

accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were
    recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Assets
    acquired in the transaction totaled approximately
    $556 million, including $154 million of loans and
    $186 million in cash, and liabilities assumed aggregated
    $528 million, including $491 million of deposits. In
    accordance with GAAP, M&T Bank recorded an after-tax gain
    on the transaction of $17 million ($28 million before
    taxes). The gain reflects the amount of financial support and
    indemnification against loan losses that M&T Bank obtained
    from the FDIC. There was no goodwill or other intangible assets
    recorded in connection with this transaction. The operations
    obtained in the K Bank acquisition transaction did not have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    position or results of operations.

On November 1, 2010, M&T entered into a definitive
    agreement with Wilmington Trust Corporation
    (“Wilmington Trust”), headquartered in Wilmington,
    Delaware, under which Wilmington Trust will be acquired by
    M&T. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Wilmington
    Trust common shareholders will receive .051372 shares of
    M&T common stock in exchange for each share of Wilmington
    Trust common stock in a

stock-for-stock

transaction valued at $351 million (with the price based on
    M&T’s closing price of $74.75 per share as of
    October 29, 2010), plus the assumption of $330 million
    in preferred stock issued by Wilmington Trust as part of the
    Troubled Asset Relief Program — Capital Purchase
    Program of the U.S. Department of Treasury
    (“U.S. Treasury”).

At December 31, 2010, Wilmington Trust had approximately
    $10.9 billion of assets, including $7.5 billion of
    loans, $10.1 billion of liabilities, including
    $9.0 billion of deposits, and $60.1 billion of
    combined assets under management, including $43.6 billion
    managed by Wilmington Trust and $16.5 billion managed by
    affiliates. The merger is subject to a number of conditions,
    including the approval of various state and Federal regulators
    and Wilmington Trust’s common shareholders, and is expected
    to be completed by mid-year 2011.

On August 28, 2009, M&T Bank entered into a purchase
    and assumption agreement with the FDIC to assume all of the
    deposits and acquire certain assets of Bradford Bank
    (“Bradford”), Baltimore, Maryland. As part of the
    transaction, M&T Bank entered into a loss-share arrangement
    with the FDIC whereby M&T Bank will be reimbursed by the
    FDIC for most losses it incurs on the acquired loan portfolio.
    The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method
    of accounting and, accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed were recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition
    date. Assets acquired totaled approximately $469 million,
    including $302 million of loans, and liabilities assumed
    aggregated $440 million, including $361 million of
    deposits. In accordance with GAAP, M&T Bank recorded an
    after-tax gain on the transaction of $18 million
    ($29 million before taxes). There was no goodwill or other
    intangible assets recorded in connection with this transaction.
    The operations obtained in the Bradford acquisition transaction
    did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position or results of operations.

On May 23, 2009, M&T acquired all of the outstanding
    common stock of Provident Bankshares Corporation
    (“Provident”), a bank holding company based in
    Baltimore, Maryland, in a

stock-for-stock

transaction. Provident Bank, Provident’s banking
    subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank on that date. The
    results of operations acquired in the Provident transaction have
    been included in the Company’s financial results since
    May 23, 2009. Provident common shareholders received
    .171625 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for
    each share of Provident common stock, resulting in M&T
    issuing a total of 5,838,308 common shares with an acquisition
    date fair value of $273 million. In addition, based on the
    merger agreement, outstanding and unexercised options to
    purchase Provident common stock were converted into options to
    purchase the common stock of M&T. Those options had an
    estimated fair value of $1 million. In total, the purchase
    price was approximately $274 million based on the fair
    value on the acquisition date of M&T common stock exchanged
    and the options to purchase M&T common stock. Holders of
    Provident’s preferred stock were issued shares of new
    Series B and Series C Preferred Stock of M&T
    having substantially identical terms. That preferred stock and
    warrants to purchase common stock associated with the
    Series C Preferred Stock added $162 million to
    M&T’s shareholders’ equity.

The Provident transaction was accounted for using the
    acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets
    acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration exchanged were
    recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Assets
    acquired totaled $6.3 billion, including $4.0 billion
    of loans and

leases (including approximately $1.7 billion of commercial
    real estate loans, $1.4 billion of consumer loans,
    $700 million of commercial loans and leases and
    $300 million of residential real estate loans) and
    $1.0 billion of investment securities. Liabilities assumed
    were $5.9 billion, including $5.1 billion of deposits.
    The transaction added $436 million to M&T’s
    shareholders’ equity, including $280 million of common
    equity and $156 million of preferred equity. In connection
    with the acquisition, the Company recorded $332 million of
    goodwill and $63 million of core deposit intangible. The
    core deposit intangible is being amortized over seven years
    using an accelerated method. The acquisition of Provident
    expanded the Company’s presence in the Mid-Atlantic area,
    gave the Company the second largest deposit share in Maryland,
    and tripled the Company’s presence in Virginia.

In many cases, determining the fair value of the acquired assets
    and assumed liabilities required the Company to estimate cash
    flows expected to result from those assets and liabilities and
    to discount those cash flows at appropriate rates of interest.
    The most significant of those determinations related to the fair
    valuation of acquired loans. For such loans, the excess of cash
    flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is
    recognized as interest income over the remaining lives of the
    loans. The difference between contractually required payments at
    acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at
    acquisition reflects the impact of estimated credit losses and
    other factors, such as prepayments. In accordance with GAAP,
    there was no carry-over of Provident’s previously
    established allowance for credit losses.

In conjunction with the Provident acquisition, the acquired loan
    portfolio was accounted for at fair value as follows:

    the period from the date of acquisition to December 31,
    2009, interest income on such loans was approximately
    $105 million.

    .25% of the Company’s assets and, accordingly, are not
    considered material.

The following table discloses the impact of Provident (excluding
    the impact of merger-related expenses) since the acquisition on
    May 23, 2009 through the end of 2009. The table also
    presents certain pro forma information for 2009 as if Provident
    had been acquired on January 1, 2009 and for 2008 as if
    Provident had been acquired on January 1, 2008. These
    results combine the historical results of Provident into the
    Company’s consolidated statement of income and, while
    certain adjustments were made for the estimated impact of
    certain fair valuation adjustments and other acquisition-related
    activity, they are not indicative of what would have occurred
    had the acquisition taken place on the indicated dates. In
    particular, no adjustments have been made to eliminate the
    amount of Provident’s provision for credit losses of
    $42 million in 2009 and $38 million in 2008 or the
    impact of

other-than-temporary

    Furthermore, expenses related to systems conversions and other
    costs of integration are included in the 2009 periods in which
    such costs were incurred. Additionally, the Company expects to
    achieve further operating cost savings and other business
    synergies as a result of the acquisition which are not reflected

The Company incurred merger-related expenses related to systems

    acquired operations with and into the Company of approximately
    $771 thousand ($469 thousand net of applicable income taxes)
    during 2010, $89 million ($54 million net of
    applicable income taxes) during 2009 and $4 million
    ($2 million net of applicable income taxes) during 2008.
    Those expenses consisted largely of professional services and
    other temporary help fees associated with the conversion of
    systems

and/or

integration of operations; costs related to branch and office
    consolidations; costs related to termination of existing
    contractual arrangements for various services; initial marketing
    and promotion expenses designed to introduce M&T Bank to
    its new customers; severance (for former Provident employees)
    and incentive compensation costs; travel costs; and printing,

Gross realized gains on investment securities were $3,549,000 in
    2010, $1,629,000 in 2009 and $34,730,000 in 2008. Gross realized
    losses on investment securities were $779,000 in 2010, $464,000
    in 2009 and $259,000 in 2008. Effective January 1, 2009,
    the Company adopted new GAAP related to the recognition and
    presentation of

other-than-temporary

impairments of investment securities. In accordance with GAAP,
    the Company recognized $68 million and $128 million of
    pre-tax

other-than-temporary

impairment losses related to privately issued mortgage-backed
    securities in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The impairment
    charges were recognized in light of deterioration of real estate
    values and a rise in delinquencies and charge-offs of underlying
    mortgage loans collateralizing those securities. Approximately
    $6 million and $10 million of the impairment charges
    recognized in 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to
    collateralized debt obligations backed largely by trust
    preferred securities issued by financial institutions. Also
    reflected in 2010’s impairment charges was a
    $12 million charge related to American Depositary Shares
    (“ADSs”) of Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c.
    (“AIB”) obtained in M&T’s 2003 acquisition
    of a former subsidiary of AIB. The

other-than-temporary

impairment losses recognized were net of $30 million and
    $126 million of unrealized losses classified in accumulated
    other comprehensive income related to those securities for the
    years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The

other-than-temporary

impairment losses represent management’s estimate of credit
    losses inherent in the securities considering projected cash
    flows using assumptions of delinquency rates, loss severities,
    and other estimates of future collateral performance. The effect
    of the adoption of the new accounting requirements on debt
    securities previously reported as

other-than-temporarily

impaired was not material and, therefore, the Company did not
    record a transition adjustment as of January 1, 2009.
    During 2008, the Company recognized $182 million of

other-than-temporary

impairment losses, mainly attributable to a $153 million
    impairment charge recognized on its preferred stock holdings of
    The Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie
    Mae”) and The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
    (“Freddie

    placement of those government-sponsored entities into

Other-than-temporary

charges of $18 million and $11 million were also
    recognized during 2008 on privately issued mortgage-backed
    securities and securities backed by trust preferred securities
    issued by financial institutions, respectively.

The Company owned 542 individual investment securities with
    aggregate gross unrealized losses of $427 million at
    December 31, 2010. Approximately $366 million of the
    unrealized losses pertain to privately issued mortgage-backed
    securities with a cost basis of $1.7 billion. The Company
    also had $47 million of unrealized losses on trust
    preferred securities issued by financial institutions,
    securities

backed by trust preferred securities issued by financial
    institutions and other entities, and other debt securities
    having a cost basis of $157 million. Based on a review of
    each of the remaining securities in the investment securities
    portfolio at December 31, 2010, with the exception of the
    aforementioned securities for which

other-than-temporary

impairment losses were recognized, the Company concluded that it
    expected to recover the amortized cost basis of its investment.
    As of December 31, 2010, the Company does not intend to
    sell nor is it anticipated that it would be required to sell any
    of its impaired investment securities. At December 31,
    2010, the Company has not identified events or changes in
    circumstances which may have a significant adverse effect on the
    fair value of the $413 million of cost method investment
    securities.

At December 31, 2010, investment securities with a carrying
    value of $4,762,579,000, including $3,500,392,000 of investment
    securities available for sale, were pledged to secure demand
    notes issued to the U.S. Treasury, borrowings from various
    FHLBs, repurchase agreements, governmental deposits, interest
    rate swap agreements and available lines of credit as described
    in note 9.

Investment securities pledged by the Company to secure
    obligations whereby the secured party is permitted by contract
    or custom to sell or repledge such collateral totaled
    $1,937,817,000 at December 31, 2010. The pledged securities
    included securities of the U.S. Treasury and federal
    agencies and mortgage-backed securities.

family residential mortgage loans held for sale were

    $530 million at December 31, 2009. Commercial mortgage
    loans held for sale were $204 million at December 31,
    2010 and $123 million at December 31, 2009.

As of December 31, 2010, approximately $13 million of

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans serviced for others had been
    sold with credit recourse. As of December 31, 2010,
    approximately $1.6 billion of commercial mortgage loan
    balances serviced for others had been sold with recourse in
    conjunction with the Company’s participation in the Fannie
    Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (“DUS”)
    program. At December 31, 2010, the Company estimated that
    the recourse obligations described above were not material to
    the Company’s consolidated financial position. There have
    been no material losses incurred as a result of those credit
    recourse arrangements.

In addition to recourse obligations, as described in
    note 21, the Company is contractually obligated to
    repurchase previously sold residential real estate loans that do
    not ultimately meet investor sale criteria related to
    underwriting procedures or loan documentation. When required to
    do so, the Company may reimburse loan purchasers for losses
    incurred or may repurchase certain loans. Charges

incurred for such obligation, which are recorded as a reduction
    of mortgage banking revenues, were $30 million,

Nonaccrual loans totaled $1,331,702,000 at December 31,
    2009. Renegotiated loans (loans which had been renegotiated at
    below-market interest rates or for which other concessions were
    granted, but are accruing interest) were $233,342,000 and
    $212,548,000 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    To assist borrowers the Company modified the terms of select
    loans secured by residential real estate, largely from the
    Company’s portfolio of Alt-A loans. At December 31,
    2010, outstanding balances of those modified loans totaled
    approximately $308 million. Of that total,
    $117 million were included in nonaccrual loans at
    December 31, 2010. The remaining $191 million of such
    modified loans have demonstrated payment capability consistent
    with the modified terms and accordingly, were classified as
    renegotiated loans and were accruing interest at the
    2010 year-end. If nonaccrual and renegotiated loans had
    been accruing interest at their originally contracted terms,
    interest income on such loans would have amounted to $90,351,000
    in 2010 and $99,618,000 in 2009. The actual amounts included in
    interest income during 2010 and 2009 on such loans were
    $40,139,000 and $43,920,000, respectively.

Borrowings by directors and certain officers of M&T and its
    banking subsidiaries, and by associates of such persons,
    exclusive of loans aggregating less than $120,000 amounted to
    $105,540,000 and $106,845,000 at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively. During 2010, new borrowings by such persons
    amounted to $2,711,000 (including any borrowings of new
    directors or officers that were outstanding at the time of their
    election) and repayments and other reductions (including
    reductions resulting from retirements) were $4,016,000.

At December 31, 2010, approximately $6.0 billion of
    commercial loans and leases, $6.7 billion of commercial
    mortgage loans, $3.0 billion of

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans, $4.4 billion of home
    equity loans and lines of credit and $3.2 billion of other
    consumer loans were pledged to secure outstanding borrowings
    from the FHLB of New York and available lines of credit as
    described in note 9.

In ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses,
    the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled
    credits identified through both normal and detailed or
    intensified credit review processes and also estimates losses
    inherent in other loans and leases on a collective basis. For
    purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit
    losses, the Company evaluates its loan and lease portfolio by
    loan type. The amounts of loss components in the Company’s
    loan and lease portfolios are determined through a loan by loan
    analysis of larger balance commercial and commercial real estate
    loans that are in nonaccrual status and by applying loss factors
    to groups of loan balances based on loan type and
    management’s classification of such loans under the
    Company’s loan grading system. Measurement of the specific
    loss components is typically based on expected future cash
    flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the
    borrower’s ability to pay. In determining the allowance for
    credit losses the Company utilizes an extensive loan grading
    system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real
    estate credits. Loan officers are responsible for continually
    assigning grades to loans based on standards outlined in the
    Company’s Credit Policy. Internal loan grades are also
    extensively monitored by the Company’s loan review
    department to ensure consistency and strict adherence to the
    prescribed standards. Loan grades are assigned loss component
    factors that reflect the Company’s loss estimate for each
    group of loans and leases. Factors considered in assigning loan
    grades and loss component factors include borrower-specific
    information related to expected future cash flows and operating
    results, collateral values, financial condition, payment status,
    and other information; levels of and trends in portfolio
    charge-offs and recoveries; levels of and trends in portfolio
    delinquencies and impaired loans; changes in the risk profile of
    specific portfolios; trends in volume and terms of loans;

effects of changes in credit concentrations; and observed trends
    and practices in the banking industry. Modified loans, including
    smaller balance homogenous loans, that are considered to be
    troubled debt restructurings are evaluated for impairment giving
    consideration to the impact of the modified loan terms on the
    present value of the loan’s expected cash flows.

In assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses,
    residential real estate loans and consumer loans are generally
    evaluated collectively after considering such factors as payment
    performance (see note 4), collateral values and trends
    related thereto. However, residential real estate loans and
    outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit
    that are more than 150 days past due are generally evaluated for
    collectibility on a

loan-by-loan

basis giving consideration to estimated collateral values.

The Company also measures additional losses for purchased
    impaired loans when it is probable that the Company will be
    unable to collect all cash flows expected at acquisition plus
    additional cash flows expected to be collected arising from
    changes in estimates after acquisition. In addition, the Company
    also provides an inherent unallocated portion of the allowance
    that is intended to recognize probable losses that are not
    otherwise identifiable and includes management’s subjective
    determination of amounts necessary to provide for the possible
    use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion
    of the allowance.

Residential mortgage loans serviced for others were
    $15.9 billion at each of December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009 and $15.4 billion at
    December 31, 2008. Small-balance commercial mortgage loans
    serviced for others were $5.2 billion, $5.5 billion
    and $5.9 billion at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Commercial mortgage loans serviced for others were
    $8.1 billion, $7.1 billion and $6.4 billion at
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

During 2010 and 2009, $50,000 and $21,950,000, respectively, of
    the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage
    loan servicing assets was reversed because of increases in the
    market value of certain strata of servicing assets relative to
    the amortized cost basis of the servicing assets in such strata.
    During 2008, a provision for impairment of $16,000,000 was added
    to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage
    loan servicing assets because the carrying value of certain
    strata of capitalized servicing assets exceeded estimated fair
    value. The estimated fair value of capitalized residential
    mortgage loan servicing assets was approximately
    $162 million at December 31, 2010 and
    $158 million at December 31, 2009. The fair value of
    capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets was
    estimated using weighted-average discount rates of 13.2% and
    13.3% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and
    contemporaneous prepayment assumptions that vary by loan type.
    At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the discount rate
    represented a weighted-average option-adjusted spread
    (“OAS”) of 748 basis points (hundredths of one
    percent) and 775 basis points, respectively, over market
    implied forward London Interbank Offered Rates. The estimated
    fair value of capitalized small-balance commercial mortgage loan
    servicing assets was approximately $58 million at
    December 31, 2010 and $64 million at December 31,
    2009. The fair value of capitalized small-balance commercial
    loan servicing assets was estimated using weighted-average
    discount rates of 19.7% and 20.3% at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively, and contemporaneous prepayment assumptions
    that vary by loan type. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
    discount rate represented a weighted-average OAS of
    1,778 basis points and 1,779 basis points,
    respectively, over market implied forward London Interbank
    Offered Rates. The estimated fair value of capitalized
    residential and small-balance commercial mortgage loan servicing
    rights may vary significantly in subsequent periods due to
    changing interest rates and the effect thereof on prepayment
    speeds. The estimated fair value of capitalized commercial
    mortgage loan servicing assets was approximately
    $50 million and $39 million at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively. An 18% discount rate was used to
    estimate the fair value of capitalized commercial mortgage loan
    servicing rights at December 31, 2010 and 2009 with no
    prepayment assumptions because, in general, the servicing
    agreements allow the Company to share in customer loan
    prepayment fees and thereby recover the remaining carrying value
    of the capitalized servicing rights associated with such loan.
    The Company’s ability to realize the carrying value of
    capitalized commercial mortgage servicing rights is more
    dependent on the borrowers’ abilities to repay the
    underlying loans than on prepayments or changes in interest
    rates.

The key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of
    capitalized servicing rights at December 31, 2010 and the
    sensitivity of such value to changes in those assumptions are
    summarized in



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements — (Continued)

the table that follows. Those calculated sensitivities are
    hypothetical and actual changes in the fair value of capitalized
    servicing rights may differ significantly from the amounts
    presented herein. The effect of a variation in a particular
    assumption on the fair value of the servicing rights is
    calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality,
    changes in one factor may result in changes in another which may
    magnify or counteract the sensitivities. The changes in
    assumptions are presumed to be instantaneous.

    amortization periods of five to ten years. The weighted-average
    original amortization period was approximately eight years. The
    remaining weighted-average amortization period as of
    December 31, 2010 was approximately five years.
    Amortization expense for core deposit and other intangible
    assets was $58,103,000, $64,255,000 and $66,646,000 for the

In accordance with GAAP, the Company completed annual goodwill
    impairment tests as of October 1, 2010, 2009 and 2008. For
    purposes of testing for impairment, the Company assigned all
    recorded goodwill to the reporting units originally intended to
    benefit from past business combinations, which has historically
    been the Company’s core relationship business reporting
    units. Goodwill was generally assigned based on the implied fair
    value of the acquired goodwill applicable to the benefited
    reporting units at the time of each respective acquisition. The
    implied fair value of the goodwill was determined as the
    difference between the estimated incremental overall fair value
    of the reporting unit and the estimated fair value of the net
    assets assigned to the reporting unit as of each respective
    acquisition date. To test for goodwill impairment at each
    evaluation date, the Company compared the estimated fair value
    of each of its reporting units to their respective carrying
    amounts and certain other assets and liabilities assigned to the
    reporting unit, including goodwill and core deposit and other
    intangible assets. The methodologies used to estimate fair
    values of reporting units as of the acquisition dates and as of
    the evaluation dates were similar. For the Company’s core
    customer relationship business reporting units, fair value was
    estimated as the present value of the expected future cash flows
    of the reporting unit. Based on the results of the goodwill
    impairment tests, the Company concluded that the amount of
    recorded goodwill was not impaired at the respective testing
    dates.

A summary of goodwill assigned to each of the Company’s
    reportable segments as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 for
    purposes of testing for impairment is as follows.

    maturities of the underlying investment securities extend beyond
    such repurchase dates.



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements — (Continued)

The subordinated notes of M&T Bank are unsecured and are
    subordinate to the claims of depositors and other creditors of
    M&T Bank. The subordinated notes of M&T Bank due 2013
    had a fixed rate of interest of 3.85% through March 2008 and
    bear a floating rate of interest thereafter until maturity in
    April 2013, at a rate equal to the three-month London Interbank
    Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.50%. That variable rate
    was 1.79% at each of December 31, 2010 and 2009.

The fixed and floating rate junior subordinated deferrable
    interest debentures (“Junior Subordinated Debentures”)
    are held by various trusts and were issued in connection with
    the issuance by those trusts of preferred capital securities
    (“Capital Securities”) and common securities
    (“Common Securities”). The proceeds from the issuances
    of the Capital Securities and the Common Securities were used by
    the trusts to purchase the Junior Subordinated Debentures. The
    Common Securities of each of those trusts are wholly owned by
    M&T and are the only class of each trust’s securities
    possessing general voting powers. The Capital Securities
    represent preferred undivided interests in the assets of the
    corresponding trust. Under the Federal Reserve Board’s
    current risk-based capital guidelines, the Capital Securities
    are includable in M&T’s Tier 1 capital. However,
    the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
    that was signed into law on July 21, 2010 provides for a
    three-year phase-in related to the exclusion of trust preferred
    capital securities from Tier 1 capital for large financial
    institutions, including M&T. That phase-in period begins on
    January 1, 2013. The variable rate Junior Subordinated
    Debentures pay interest quarterly at rates that are indexed to
    the three-month LIBOR. Those rates ranged from 1.14% to 3.64% at
    December 31, 2010 and from 1.13% to 3.63% at
    December 31, 2009. The weighted-average variable rates
    payable on those Junior Subordinated Debentures were 1.72% and
    1.70% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Holders of the Capital Securities receive preferential
    cumulative cash distributions unless M&T exercises its
    right to extend the payment of interest on the Junior
    Subordinated Debentures as allowed by the terms of each such
    debenture, in which case payment of distributions on the
    respective Capital Securities will be deferred for comparable
    periods. During an extended interest period, M&T may not
    pay dividends or distributions on, or repurchase, redeem or
    acquire any shares of its capital stock. In the event of an
    extended interest period exceeding twenty quarterly periods for
    $350 million of Junior Subordinated Debentures due
    January 31, 2068, M&T must fund the payment of accrued
    and unpaid interest through an alternative payment mechanism,
    which requires M&T to issue common stock, non-cumulative
    perpetual preferred stock or warrants to purchase common stock
    until M&T has raised an amount of eligible proceeds at
    least equal to the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid
    deferred interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures due
    January 31, 2068. In general, the agreements governing the
    Capital Securities, in the aggregate, provide a full,
    irrevocable and unconditional guarantee by M&T of the
    payment of distributions on, the redemption of, and any
    liquidation distribution with respect to the Capital Securities.
    The obligations under such guarantee and the Capital Securities
    are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all senior
    indebtedness of M&T.

The Capital Securities will remain outstanding until the Junior
    Subordinated Debentures are repaid at maturity, are redeemed
    prior to maturity or are distributed in liquidation to the
    Trusts. The Capital Securities are mandatorily redeemable in
    whole, but not in part, upon repayment at the stated maturity
    dates (ranging from 2027 to 2068) of the Junior
    Subordinated Debentures or the earlier redemption of the Junior
    Subordinated Debentures in whole upon the occurrence of one or
    more events set forth in the indentures relating to the Capital
    Securities, and in whole or in part at any time after an
    optional redemption prior to contractual maturity
    contemporaneously with the optional redemption of the related
    Junior Subordinated Debentures in whole or in part, subject to
    possible regulatory approval. In connection with the issuance of
    8.50% Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities associated with
    $350 million of Junior Subordinated Debentures maturing in
    2068, M&T entered into a replacement capital covenant that
    provides that neither M&T nor any of its subsidiaries will
    repay, redeem or purchase any of the Junior Subordinated
    Debentures due January 31, 2068 or the 8.50% Enhanced
    Trust Preferred Securities prior to January 31, 2048,
    with certain limited exceptions, except to the extent that,
    during the 180 days prior to the date of that repayment,
    redemption or purchase, M&T and its subsidiaries have
    received proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities that
    (i) have equity-like characteristics that are the same as,
    or more equity-like than, the applicable characteristics of the
    8.50% Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities or the Junior
    Subordinated Debentures due January 31, 2068, as

    common stock (Series A — 1,218,522 common shares
    at $73.86 per share, Series C — 407,542 common
    shares at $55.76 per share). Dividends, if declared, will accrue
    and be paid quarterly at a rate of 5% per year for the first
    five years following the original 2008 issuance dates and
    thereafter at a rate of 9% per year. The agreement with the U.S.
    Treasury contains limitations on certain actions of M&T,
    including the payment of quarterly cash dividends on
    M&T’s common stock in excess of $.70 per share, the
    repurchase of its common stock during the first three years of
    the agreement, and the amount and nature of compensation
    arrangements for certain of the Company’s

Stock-based
    compensation plans

Stock-based compensation expense was $54 million in each of
    2010 and 2009 and $50 million in 2008. The Company
    recognized income tax benefits related to stock-based
    compensation of $17 million in each of 2010 and 2009 and
    $11 million in 2008.

The Company’s equity incentive compensation plan allows for
    the issuance of various forms of stock-based compensation,
    including stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
    units and performance-based awards. Through December 31,
    2010, only stock-based compensation awards, including stock
    options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, that vest
    with the passage of time as service is provided have been
    issued. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, there
    were 5,959,828 and 6,134,264 shares available for future
    grant under the Company’s equity incentive compensation
    plan.

Restricted
    stock awards

Restricted stock awards are comprised of restricted stock and
    restricted stock units. Restricted stock awards generally vest
    over four years. Unrecognized compensation expense associated
    with restricted stock was $23 million as of
    December 31, 2010 and is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 1.5 years. The Company generally
    will issue restricted shares from treasury stock to the extent
    available, but may also issue new shares. During 2010, 2009 and
    2008, the number of restricted shares issued was 423,002,
    709,415 and 37,747, respectively, with a weighted-average grant
    date fair value of $31,880,000, $27,932,000 and $3,446,000,
    respectively. Unrecognized compensation expense associated with
    restricted stock units was $7 million as of
    December 31, 2010 and is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 1.2 years. During 2010 and 2009,
    the number of restricted stock units issued was 231,037 and
    578,131, respectively, with a weighted-average grant date fair
    value of $17,039,000 and $22,663,000, respectively. There were
    no restricted stock units issued in 2008.

Stock
    option awards

Stock options issued generally vest over four years and are
    exercisable over terms not exceeding ten years and one day. The
    Company used an option pricing model to estimate the grant date
    present value of stock options granted. Stock options granted in
    2010 and 2009 were not significant. For 2008 the
    weighted-average estimated grant date value per option was
    $15.85. The value was calculated using the following
    weighted-average assumptions: an option term of 6.5 years
    (representing the estimated period between grant date and
    exercise date based on historical data); a risk-free interest
    rate of 3.21% (representing the yield on a U.S. Treasury
    security with a remaining term equal to the expected option
    term); expected volatility of 21% (based on historical
    volatility of M&T’s common stock price); and an
    estimated dividend yield of 3.07% (representing the approximate
    annualized cash dividend rate paid with respect to a share of
    common stock at or near the grant date). Based on historical
    data and projected employee turnover rates, the Company reduced
    the estimated value of stock options for purposes of recognizing
    stock-based compensation expense by 7% to reflect the
    probability of forfeiture prior to vesting. Aggregate fair value
    of options expected to vest that were granted in 2008 were
    $46 million.

For 2010, 2009 and 2008, M&T received $55 million,
    $15 million and $25 million, respectively, in cash and
    realized tax benefits from the exercise of stock options of
    $7 million, $3 million and $4 million,
    respectively. The intrinsic value of stock options exercised
    during those periods was $21 million, $6 million and
    $13 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010,
    there was $4 million of total unrecognized compensation
    cost related to non-vested stock options. That cost is expected
    to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1 year.
    The total grant date fair value of stock options vested during
    2010, 2009 and 2008 was $38 million, $37 million and
    $36 million, respectively. Upon the exercise of stock
    options, the Company generally issues shares from treasury stock
    to the extent available, but may also issue new shares.

Stock
    purchase plan

The stock purchase plan provides eligible employees of the
    Company with the right to purchase shares of M&T common
    stock through accumulated payroll deductions. Shares of M&T
    common stock will be issued at the end of an option period,
    typically one year or six months. In connection with the
    employee stock purchase plan, 1,000,000 shares of M&T
    common stock were authorized for issuance, of which
    568,886 shares have been issued. There were
    170,405 shares issued in 2010, 3,149 shares issued in
    2009 and 2,377 shares issued in 2008. For 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively, M&T received $8,998,000, $100,000 and
    $173,000 in cash for shares purchased through the employee stock
    purchase plan.

The Company used an option pricing model to estimate the grant
    date present value of purchase rights under the stock purchase
    plan. The estimated weighted-average grant date value per right
    was $14.33 in 2010, $16.39 in 2009 and $12.79 in 2008. Such
    values were calculated using the following weighted-average
    assumptions: a term of six months to one year (representing the
    period between grant date and exercise date); a risk-free
    interest rate of 0.29% in 2010, 0.45% in 2009 and 2.05% in 2008
    (representing the yield on a U.S. Treasury security with a
    like term); expected volatility of 34% in 2010 and 2008 and 69%
    in 2009 (based on historical volatility of M&T’s
    common stock price); and an estimated dividend yield of 3.20% in
    2010, 4.77% in 2009 and 3.84% in 2008 (representing the
    approximate annualized cash dividend rate paid with respect to a
    share of common stock at or near the grant date).

Deferred
    bonus plan

The Company provided a deferred bonus plan pursuant to which
    eligible employees could elect to defer all or a portion of
    their annual incentive compensation awards and allocate such
    awards to several investment options, including M&T common
    stock. Participants could elect the timing of distributions from
    the plan. Such distributions are payable in cash with the
    exception of balances allocated to M&T common stock which
    are distributable in the form of M&T common stock. Shares
    of M&T common stock distributable pursuant to the terms of
    the deferred bonus plan were 51,439 and 54,386 at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The obligation to
    issue shares is included in “common stock issuable” in
    the consolidated balance sheet. Through December 31, 2010,
    117,117 shares have been issued in connection with the
    deferred bonus plan.

Directors’
    stock plan

The Company maintains a compensation plan for non-employee
    members of the Company’s boards of directors and directors
    advisory councils that allows such members to receive all or a
    portion of their compensation in shares of M&T common
    stock. Through December 31, 2010, 148,534 shares had
    been issued in connection with the directors’ stock plan.

Through an acquisition, the Company assumed an obligation to
    issue shares of M&T common stock related to a deferred
    directors compensation plan. Shares of common stock issuable
    under such plan were 19,906 and 20,784 at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively. The obligation to issue shares is
    included in “common stock issuable” in the
    consolidated balance sheet.

Management
    stock ownership program

Through an acquisition, M&T obtained loans that were
    secured by M&T common stock purchased by former executives
    of the acquired entity. At December 31, 2009, the loan
    amounts owed M&T were less than the fair value of the
    financed stock purchased and totaled approximately
    $4 million. Such loans were classified as a reduction of
    “additional paid-in capital” in the consolidated
    balance sheet at that date. The amounts due to M&T were
    repaid in full during 2010.

The Company has an unfunded supplemental pension plan for
    certain key executives. The projected benefit obligation and
    accumulated benefit obligation included in the preceding data
    related to such plan were $66,254,000 and $66,208,000
    respectively, as of December 31, 2010 and $63,705,000 and
    $63,640,000, respectively, as of December 31, 2009.
    Included in the amounts for 2009 was approximately
    $15 million assumed in the Provident acquisition.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit
    pension plans was $929,775,000 and $843,279,000 at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2010, the accumulated benefit obligation for
    those defined benefit pension plans in which such obligation
    exceeded plan assets totaled $884,269,000 (including $66,208,000
    related to the unfunded supplemental pension plan). As of
    December 31, 2009, the accumulated benefit obligation for
    those defined benefit pension plans in which



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements — (Continued)

such obligation exceeded plan assets totaled $797,101,000
    (including $63,640,000 related to the unfunded supplemental
    pension plan).

GAAP requires an employer to recognize in its balance sheet as
    an asset or liability the overfunded or underfunded status of a
    defined benefit postretirement plan, measured as the difference
    between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit
    obligation. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the
    projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement
    benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit
    obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.
    Gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise
    during the period, but are not included as components of net
    periodic benefit expense, are recognized as a component of other
    comprehensive income. As indicated in the preceding table, as of
    December 31, 2010 the Company recorded a minimum liability
    adjustment of $198,999,000 ($196,153,000 related to pension
    plans and $2,846,000 related to other postretirement benefits)
    with a corresponding reduction of shareholders’ equity, net
    of applicable deferred taxes, of $120,892,000. Of the
    $196,153,000 related to pension plans, $11,995,000 was related
    to unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans. In aggregate,
    the benefit plans incurred a net loss during 2010 that resulted
    from actual experience differing from the plan assumptions
    utilized and from changes in actuarial assumptions. The main
    factor contributing to those losses was a reduction in the
    discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations at
    December 31, 2010 to 5.25% from the 5.75% rate used at
    December 31, 2009. For the qualified defined benefit
    pension plans, the losses associated with that change in
    assumption were largely mitigated by gains associated with a
    positive return on assets of approximately $108 million as
    compared with an expected gain of approximately
    $51 million. As a result, the Company increased its minimum
    liability adjustment from that which was recorded at
    December 31, 2009 by $6,331,000 with a corresponding
    decrease to shareholders’ equity that, net of applicable
    deferred taxes, was $3,846,000.

The
    table below reflects the changes in plan assets and benefit
    obligations recognized in other comprehensive income related to
    the Company’s postretirement benefit plans.

The Company also provides a qualified defined contribution
    pension plan to eligible employees who were not participants in
    the defined benefit pension plan as of December 31, 2005
    and to other employees who have elected to participate in the
    defined contribution plan. The Company makes contributions to
    the defined contribution plan each year in an amount that is
    based on an individual participant’s total compensation
    (generally defined as total wages, incentive compensation,
    commissions

and bonuses) and years of service. Participants do not
    contribute to the defined contribution pension plan. Pension
    expense recorded in 2010, 2009 and 2008 associated with the
    defined contribution pension plan was approximately
    $14 million, $11 million and $10 million,
    respectively.

On May 23, 2009, pension and other obligations were assumed
    as a result of the acquisition of Provident. Initial liabilities
    were determined using a 7.00% discount rate. All future benefit
    accruals related to the former Provident qualified pension plan
    were frozen.

The expected long-term rate of return assumption as of each
    measurement date was developed through analysis of historical
    market returns, current market conditions, anticipated future
    asset allocations, the funds’ past experience, and
    expectations on potential future market returns. The expected
    rate of return assumption represents a long-term average view of
    the performance of the plan assets, a return that may or may not
    be achieved during any one calendar year.

For measurement of other postretirement benefits, an 8.0% annual
    rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care
    benefits was assumed for 2011. The rate was assumed to decrease
    to 5% over 30 years. Assumed health care cost trend rates
    have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health
    care plans.

A
    one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend
    rates would have had the following effects:

Plan
    Assets

The Company’s policy is to invest the pension plan assets
    in a prudent manner for the purpose of providing benefit
    payments to participants and mitigating reasonable expenses of
    administration. The Company’s investment strategy is
    designed to provide a total return that, over the long-term,
    places a strong emphasis on the preservation of capital. The
    strategy attempts to maximize investment returns on assets at a
    level of risk deemed appropriate by the Company while complying
    with applicable regulations and laws. The investment strategy
    utilizes asset allocation as a principal determinant for
    establishing an appropriate risk profile. The target allocations
    for plan assets are generally 55 to 70 percent equity
    securities, 25 to 40 percent debt securities, and 3 to
    10 percent money-market funds or other short-term
    investments. Equity securities include investments in large-cap
    and mid-cap companies located in the United States, equity
    mutual funds with international investments, and, to a lesser
    extent, direct



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements — (Continued)

investments in foreign-based companies. Debt securities include
    corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries,
    mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by government agencies,
    U.S. Treasury securities, and mutual funds that invest in
    debt securities. Returns on invested assets are periodically
    compared with target market indices for each asset type to aid
    management in evaluating such returns. Furthermore, management
    regularly reviews the investment policy and may, if deemed
    appropriate, make changes to the target allocations noted above.

Pension plan assets included common stock of M&T with a
    fair value of $106,891,000 (12.7% of total plan assets) at
    December 31, 2010 and $82,136,000 (10.7% of total plan
    assets) at December 31, 2009. No other investment in
    securities of a

non-U.S. Government

or government agency issuer exceeded ten percent of plan assets
    at December 31, 2010.

The Company makes contributions to its funded qualified defined
    benefit pension plans as required by government regulation or as
    deemed appropriate by management after considering factors such
    as the fair value of plan assets, expected returns on such
    assets, and the present value of benefit obligations of the
    plans. Subject to the impact of actual events and circumstances
    that may occur in 2011, the Company may make contributions to
    the qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2011, but the
    amount of any such contribution has not yet been determined. No
    minimum contribution is required in 2011 under government
    regulations for the qualified defined benefit pension plans. The
    Company’s contributions to the qualified defined benefit
    pension plans totaled $44 million in 2009 in the form of
    common stock of M&T. The Company did not make any
    contributions to those plans in 2010. The

Company regularly funds the payment of benefit obligations for
    the supplemental defined benefit pension and postretirement
    benefit plans because such plans do not hold assets for
    investment. Payments made by the Company for supplemental
    pension benefits were $4,504,000 and $4,239,000 in 2010 and
    2009, respectively. Payments made by the Company for
    postretirement benefits were $4,846,000 and $5,164,000 in 2010
    and 2009, respectively. Payments for supplemental pension and
    other postretirement benefits for 2011 are not expected to
    differ from those made in 2010 by an amount that will be
    material to the Company’s consolidated financial position.

Estimated benefits expected to be paid in future years related

The Company has a retirement savings plan (“RSP”) that
    is a defined contribution plan in which eligible employees of
    the Company may defer up to 50% of qualified compensation via
    contributions to the plan. The Company makes an employer
    matching contribution in an amount equal to 75% of an
    employee’s contribution, up to 4.5% of the employee’s
    qualified compensation. Employees’ accounts, including
    employee contributions, employer matching contributions and
    accumulated earnings thereon, are at all times fully vested and
    nonforfeitable. Employee benefits expense resulting from the
    Company’s contributions to the RSP totaled $24,683,000,
    $23,719,000 and $23,311,000 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return

    years, applicable federal tax law allowed certain financial
    institutions the option



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements — (Continued)

of deducting as bad debt expense for tax purposes amounts in
    excess of actual losses. In accordance with GAAP, such financial
    institutions were not required to provide deferred income taxes
    on such excess. Recapture of the excess tax bad debt reserve
    established under the previously allowed method will result in
    taxable income if M&T Bank fails to maintain bank status as
    defined in the Internal Revenue Code or charges are made to the
    reserve for other than bad debt losses. At December 31,
    2010, M&T Bank’s tax bad debt reserve for which no
    federal income taxes have been provided was $79,121,000. No
    actions are planned that would cause this reserve to become
    wholly or partially taxable.

Income taxes attributable to gains or losses on bank investment
    securities were benefits of $32,778,000, $53,824,000 and
    $57,859,000 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. No alternative
    minimum tax expense was recognized in 2010, 2009 or 2008.

The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and
    penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in
    income taxes in the consolidated statement of income. The
    balance of accrued interest at December 31, 2010 is
    included in the table above. The Company’s federal, state
    and local income tax returns are routinely subject to
    examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such
    examinations may result in challenges to the tax return
    treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions.
    Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to
    record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate.
    Should determinations rendered by tax authorities ultimately
    indicate that management’s assumptions were inappropriate,
    the result and adjustments required could have a material effect
    on the Company’s results of operations. Under statute, the
    Company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2007 and
    2008 could be adjusted by the Internal Revenue Service, although
    examinations for those tax years have been concluded. The
    federal income tax return for 2009 is currently under
    examination, although no issues have been raised that would
    materially impact the effective tax rate. The Company also files
    income tax returns in over forty state and local jurisdictions.
    Substantially all material state and local matters have been
    concluded for years through 2001. Some tax returns for years
    after 2001 are presently under examination. It is not reasonably
    possible to estimate when any of those examinations will be
    completed or if others will be commenced.

GAAP requires that for financial statements issued for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008, unvested
    share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to
    dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are
    participating securities and shall be included in the
    computation of earnings per common share pursuant to the
    two-class method. In 2009 and 2010, the Company issued
    stock-based compensation awards in the form of restricted stock
    and restricted stock units, which, in accordance with GAAP, are
    considered participating securities. Beginning in 2009, the
    Company’s earnings per common share are calculated using
    the two-class method. The effects of the application of the
    two-class method to previously reported earnings per common
    share amounts were immaterial.

Stock-based compensation awards, warrants to purchase common
    stock of M&T and preferred stock convertible into shares of
    M&T common stock representing approximately 11,231,000,
    15,040,000 and 10,082,000 common shares during 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively, were not included in the computations of
    diluted earnings per common share because the effect on those
    years would be antidilutive.

International

The Company engages in certain international activities
    consisting largely of collecting Eurodollar deposits, engaging
    in foreign currency trading, providing credit to support the
    international activities of domestic companies and holding
    certain loans to foreign borrowers. Net assets identified with
    international activities amounted to $112,851,000 and
    $61,849,000 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    Such assets included $107,310,000 and $55,336,000, respectively,
    of loans to foreign borrowers. Deposits at M&T Bank’s
    Cayman Islands office were $1,605,916,000 and $1,050,438,000 at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company uses
    such deposits to facilitate customer demand and as an
    alternative to short-term borrowings when the costs of such
    deposits seem reasonable.

18.

Derivative
    financial instruments

As part of managing interest rate risk, the Company enters into
    interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing
    characteristics of certain portions of the Company’s
    portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
    The Company designates interest rate swap agreements utilized in
    the management of interest rate risk as either fair value hedges
    or cash flow hedges. Interest rate swap agreements are generally
    entered into with counterparties that meet established credit
    standards and most contain master netting and collateral
    provisions protecting the at-risk party. Based on adherence to
    the Company’s credit standards and the presence of the
    netting and collateral provisions, the Company believes that the
    credit risk inherent in these contracts is not significant as of
    December 31, 2010.

The net effect of interest rate swap agreements was to increase
    net interest income by $42 million in 2010,
    $38 million in 2009 and $16 million in 2008. The
    average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements
    impacting net interest income that were entered into for
    interest rate risk management purposes were $1.01 billion
    in 2010, $1.08 billion in 2009 and $1.27 billion in
    2008.

Under the terms of these
    agreements, the Company receives settlement amounts at a fixed
    rate and pays at a variable rate.

In response to changes in its interest rate risk profile, during
    2008 the Company terminated interest rate swap agreements with a
    notional amount of $1.5 billion that had originally been
    entered into as cash flow hedges of variable rate long-term
    borrowings. The Company recognized a $37 million loss as a
    result of the termination. Amounts pertaining to these interest
    rate swap agreements that were reclassified from accumulated
    other comprehensive income to increase interest expense were
    $11 million and $26 million for 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered
    into for risk management purposes that were outstanding at
    December 31, 2010 mature in 2016 and 2017.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell residential and
    commercial real estate loans to hedge the exposure to changes in
    the fair value of real estate loans held for sale. Such
    commitments have generally been designated as fair value hedges.
    The Company also utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans
    to offset the exposure to changes in fair value of certain
    commitments to originate real estate loans for sale.

Derivative financial instruments used for trading purposes
    included interest rate contracts, foreign exchange and other
    option contracts, foreign exchange forward and spot contracts,
    and financial futures. Interest rate contracts entered into for
    trading purposes had notional values of $12.8 billion and
    $13.9 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. The notional amounts of foreign currency and other
    option and futures contracts entered into for trading purposes
    aggregated $769 million and $608 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

In addition, the Company also has commitments to sell and
    commitments to originate residential and commercial real estate
    loans, which are considered derivatives. The Company designates
    certain of the commitments to sell real estate loans as fair
    value hedges of real estate loans held for sale. The Company
    also utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to offset
    the exposure to changes in the fair value of certain commitments
    to originate real estate loans for sale. As a result of these
    activities, net unrealized pre-tax gains related to hedged loans
    held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and
    commitments to sell loans were approximately $17 million
    and $20 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. Changes in unrealized gains and losses are
    included in mortgage banking revenues and, in general, are
    realized in subsequent periods as the related loans are sold and
    commitments satisfied.

The aggregate fair value of derivative financial instruments in
    a net liability position at December 31, 2010 for which the
    Company was required to post collateral was $223 million.
    The fair value of collateral posted for such instruments was
    $210 million.

The Company’s credit exposure with respect to the estimated
    fair value as of December 31, 2010 of interest rate swap
    agreements used for managing interest rate risk has been
    substantially mitigated through master netting arrangements with
    trading account interest rate contracts with the same
    counterparties as well as counterparty postings of
    $55 million of collateral with the Company. Trading account
    interest rate swap agreements entered into with customers are
    subject to the Company’s credit standards and often contain
    collateral provisions.

19.

Variable
    interest entities and asset securitizations

Effective January 1, 2010, the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) amended accounting guidance
    related to the consolidation of variable interest entities to
    eliminate the quantitative approach previously required for
    determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest
    entity. The amended guidance instead requires a reporting entity
    to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary
    beneficiary of a variable interest entity based on whether the
    reporting entity has the power to direct the activities that
    most significantly impact the variable interest entity’s
    economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or
    the right to receive benefits of the variable interest entity
    that could potentially be significant to the variable interest
    entity. The amended guidance requires ongoing reassessments of
    whether the reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a
    variable interest entity.

Also effective January 1, 2010, the FASB amended accounting
    guidance related to accounting for transfers of financial assets
    to eliminate the exceptions for qualifying special-purpose
    entities from the consolidation guidance and the exception that
    permitted sale accounting for certain mortgage securitizations
    when a transferor has not surrendered control over the
    transferred assets. The recognition and measurement provisions
    of the amended guidance were required to be applied
    prospectively. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2010, the
    concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity is no longer
    relevant for accounting purposes. Therefore, formerly qualifying
    special-purpose entities had to be re-evaluated for
    consolidation in accordance with applicable consolidation
    guidance, including the new accounting guidance relating to the
    consolidation of variable interest entities discussed in the
    previous paragraph.

In 2002 and 2003, the Company transferred approximately
    $1.9 billion of

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans to qualified special-purpose
    trusts in two non-recourse securitization transactions. In
    exchange for the loans, the Company received cash, no more than
    88% of the resulting securities, and the servicing rights to the
    loans. Through December 31, 2009, all of the retained
    securities were classified as investment securities available
    for sale as the qualified special-purpose trusts were not
    included in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. Effective January 1, 2010, the Company
    determined that it was the primary beneficiary of both
    securitization trusts under the amended consolidation rules
    considering its role as servicer and its retained subordinated
    interests in the trusts. As a result, beginning January 1,
    2010, the Company included the

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans that were included in the two
    non-recourse securitization transactions in its consolidated
    financial statements. The effect of that consolidation on
    January 1, 2010 was to increase loans receivable by
    $424 million, decrease the amortized cost of

available-for-sale

investment securities by $360 million (fair value of
    $355 million), and increase borrowings by $65 million.
    The transition adjustment at January 1, 2010 as a result of
    the Company’s adoption of the new accounting requirements
    was not significant. In

    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements — (Continued)

the second quarter of 2010, the 2002 securitization trust was
    terminated as the Company exercised its right to purchase the
    underlying mortgage loans pursuant to the

clean-up

call provisions of the qualified special-purpose trust. At
    December 31, 2010, the carrying value of the loans in the
    remaining securitization trust and the outstanding principal
    amount of mortgage-backed securities issued by the qualified
    special-purpose trust were each $265 million. The principal
    amount of such securities held by the Company was
    $225 million. The remainder of the outstanding
    mortgage-backed securities were held by parties unrelated to
    M&T. Because the transaction was non-recourse, the
    Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its
    association with the trust at December 31, 2010 is limited
    to realizing the carrying value of the loans less the
    $40 million carrying value of the mortgage-backed
    securities outstanding to third parties.

In 2009 and 2008, the Company securitized approximately
    $141 million and $875 million, respectively, of

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans in guaranteed mortgage
    securitizations with Fannie Mae. There were no such
    securitizations in 2010. The Company recognized no gain or loss
    on the transactions as it retained all of the resulting
    securities. Such securities were classified as investment
    securities available for sale. The Company expects no material
    credit-related losses on the retained securities as a result of
    the guarantees by Fannie Mae.

Other variable interest entities in which the Company holds a
    significant variable interest are described below.

As described in note 9, M&T has issued junior
    subordinated debentures payable to various trusts that have
    issued Capital Securities. M&T owns the common securities
    of those trust entities. The Company is not considered to be the
    primary beneficiary of those entities and, accordingly, the
    trusts are not included in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
    Company included the Junior Subordinated Debentures as
    “long-term borrowings” in its consolidated balance
    sheet. The Company has recognized $34 million in other
    assets for its “investment” in the common securities
    of the trusts that will be concomitantly repaid to M&T by
    the respective trust from the proceeds of M&T’s
    repayment of the junior subordinated debentures associated with
    preferred capital securities described in note 9.

The Company has invested as a limited partner in various real
    estate partnerships that collectively had total assets of
    approximately $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Those
    partnerships generally construct or acquire properties for which
    the investing partners are eligible to receive certain federal
    income tax credits in accordance with government guidelines.
    Such investments may also provide tax deductible losses to the
    partners. The partnership investments also assist the Company in
    achieving its community reinvestment initiatives. As a limited
    partner, there is no recourse to the Company by creditors of the
    partnerships. However, the tax credits that result from the
    Company’s investments in such partnerships are generally
    subject to recapture should a partnership fail to comply with
    the respective government regulations. The Company’s
    maximum exposure to loss of its investments in such partnerships
    was $258 million, including $81 million of unfunded
    commitments, at December 31, 2010 and $246 million,
    including $89 million of unfunded commitments, at
    December 31, 2009. The Company has not provided financial
    or other support to the partnerships that was not contractually
    required. Management currently estimates that no material losses
    are probable as a result of the Company’s involvement with
    such entities. In accordance with the accounting provisions for
    variable interest entities, the Company, in its position as
    limited partner, does not direct the activities that most
    significantly impact the economic performance of the
    partnerships and, therefore, the partnership entities are not
    included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Fair
    value measurements

GAAP permits an entity to choose to measure eligible financial
    instruments and other items at fair value. The Company has not
    made any fair value elections at December 31, 2010.

Pursuant to GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would
    be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
    an orderly transaction between market participants at the
    measurement date. A three-level hierarchy exists in GAAP for
    fair value measurements based upon the inputs to the valuation
    of an asset or liability.

•

Level 1 — Valuation is based on quoted prices in
    active markets for identical assets and liabilities.



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements — (Continued)

•

Level 2 — Valuation is determined from quoted
    prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,
    quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets
    that are not active or by model-based techniques in which all
    significant inputs are observable in the market.

•

Level 3 — Valuation is derived from model-based
    and other techniques in which at least one significant input is
    unobservable and which may be based on the Company’s own
    estimates about the assumptions that market participants would
    use to value the asset or liability.

When available, the Company attempts to use quoted market prices
    in active markets to determine fair value and classifies such
    items as Level 1 or Level 2. If quoted market prices
    in active markets are not available, fair value is often
    determined using model-based techniques incorporating various
    assumptions including interest rates, prepayment speeds and
    credit losses. Assets and liabilities valued using model-based
    techniques are classified as either Level 2 or
    Level 3, depending on the lowest level classification of an
    input that is considered significant to the overall valuation.
    The following is a description of the valuation methodologies
    used for the Company’s assets and liabilities that are
    measured on a recurring basis at estimated fair value.

Trading
    account assets and liabilities

Trading account assets and liabilities consist primarily of
    interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts
    with customers who require such services with offsetting
    positions with third parties to minimize the Company’s risk
    with respect to such transactions. The Company generally
    determines the fair value of its derivative trading account
    assets and liabilities using externally developed pricing models
    based on market observable inputs and therefore classifies such
    valuations as Level 2. Mutual funds held in connection with
    deferred compensation arrangements have been classified as
    Level 1 valuations. Valuations of investments in municipal
    and other bonds can generally be obtained through reference to
    quoted prices in less active markets for the same or similar
    securities or through model-based techniques in which all
    significant inputs are observable and, therefore, such
    valuations have been classified as Level 2.

Investment
    securities available for sale

The majority of the Company’s

available-for-sale

investment securities have been valued by reference to prices
    for similar securities or through model-based techniques in
    which all significant inputs are observable and, therefore, such
    valuations have been classified as Level 2. Certain
    investments in mutual funds and equity securities are actively
    traded and therefore have been classified as Level 1
    valuations.

Trading activity in privately issued mortgage-backed securities
    has been limited. The markets for such securities were generally
    characterized by a sharp reduction of non-agency mortgage-backed
    securities issuances, a significant reduction in trading volumes
    and wide bid-ask spreads, all driven by the lack of market
    participants. Although estimated prices were generally obtained
    for such securities, the Company was significantly restricted in
    the level of market observable assumptions used in the valuation
    of its privately issued mortgage-backed securities portfolio.
    Specifically, market assumptions regarding credit adjusted cash
    flows and liquidity influences on discount rates were difficult
    to observe at the individual bond level. Because of the
    inactivity in the markets and the lack of observable valuation
    inputs, the Company has classified the valuation of privately
    issued mortgage-backed securities as Level 3.

In April 2009, the FASB issued new accounting rules that
    provided guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and
    level of trading activity for an asset or liability have
    significantly decreased. The Company has concluded that there
    has been a significant decline in the volume and level of
    activity in the market for privately issued mortgage-backed
    securities. Therefore, the Company supplemented its
    determination of fair value for many of its privately issued
    mortgage-backed securities by obtaining pricing indications from
    two independent sources at December 31, 2010 and 2009.
    However, the Company could not readily ascertain that the basis
    of such valuations could be ascribed to orderly and observable
    trades in the market for privately issued residential
    mortgage-backed securities. As a result, the Company also
    performed internal modeling to estimate the cash flows and fair
    value of privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities
    with an amortized cost basis of $1.5 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and $1.9 billion at
    December 31, 2009. The Company’s internal modeling
    techniques included



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements — (Continued)

discounting estimated bond-specific cash flows using assumptions
    about cash flows associated with loans underlying each of the
    bonds, including estimates about the timing and amount of credit
    losses and prepayments. In estimating those cash flows, the
    Company used assumptions as to future delinquency, defaults and
    loss rates, including assumptions for further home price
    depreciation. Differences between internal model valuations and
    external pricing indications were generally considered to be
    reflective of the lack of liquidity in the market for privately
    issued mortgage-backed securities given the nature of the cash
    flow modeling performed in the Company’s assessment of
    value. To determine the point within the range of potential
    values that was most representative of fair value under current
    market conditions for each of the bonds, the Company computed
    values based on judgmentally applied weightings of the internal
    model valuations and the indications obtained from the average
    of the two independent pricing sources. Weightings applied to
    internal model valuations generally ranged from zero to 40%
    depending on bond structure and collateral type, with prices for
    bonds in non-senior tranches generally receiving lower
    weightings on the internal model results and senior bonds
    receiving a higher model weighting. At December 31, 2010,
    weighted-average reliance on internal model pricing for the
    bonds modeled was 34% with a 66% average weighting placed on the
    values provided by the independent sources. The Company
    concluded its estimate of fair value for the $1.5 billion
    of privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities to
    approximate $1.3 billion, which implies a weighted-average
    market yield based on reasonably likely cash flows of 8.2%.
    Other valuations of privately issued residential mortgage-backed
    securities were determined by reference to independent pricing
    sources without adjustment.

Included in collateralized debt obligations are securities
    backed by trust preferred securities issued by financial
    institutions and other entities. Given the severe disruption in
    the credit markets and lack of observable trade information, the
    Company could not obtain pricing indications for many of these
    securities from its two primary independent pricing sources. The
    Company, therefore, performed internal modeling to estimate the
    cash flows and fair value of its portfolio of securities backed
    by trust preferred securities at December 31, 2010 and
    2009. The modeling techniques included discounting estimated
    cash flows using bond-specific assumptions about defaults,
    deferrals and prepayments of the trust preferred securities
    underlying each bond. The estimation of cash flows included
    assumptions as to future collateral defaults and related loss
    severities. The resulting cash flows were then discounted by
    reference to market yields observed in the single-name trust
    preferred securities market. At December 31, 2010, the
    total amortized cost and fair value of securities backed by
    trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions and
    other entities were $95 million and $111 million,
    respectively, and at December 31, 2009 were
    $103 million and $115 million, respectively. Privately
    issued mortgage-backed securities and securities backed by trust
    preferred securities issued by financial institutions and other
    entities constituted all of the

available-for-sale

investment securities classified as Level 3 valuations as
    of December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Real
    estate loans held for sale

The Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to
    hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of real estate loans
    held for sale. The carrying value of hedged real estate loans
    held for sale includes changes in estimated fair value during
    the hedge period. Typically, the Company attempts to hedge real
    estate loans held for sale from the date of close through the
    sale date. The fair value of hedged real estate loans held for
    sale is generally calculated by reference to quoted prices in
    secondary markets for commitments to sell real estate loans with
    similar characteristics and, accordingly, such loans have been
    classified as a Level 2 valuation.

Commitments
    to originate real estate loans for sale and commitments to sell
    real estate loans

The Company enters into various commitments to originate real
    estate loans for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans.
    Such commitments are considered to be derivative financial
    instruments and, therefore, are carried at estimated fair value
    on the consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair values of
    such commitments were generally calculated by reference to
    quoted prices in secondary markets for commitments to sell real
    estate loans to certain government-sponsored entities and other
    parties. The fair valuations of commitments to sell real estate
    loans generally result in a Level 2 classification. The
    estimated fair value of commitments to originate real estate
    loans for sale are adjusted to reflect the



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements — (Continued)

Company’s anticipated commitment expirations. Estimated
    commitment expirations are considered a significant unobservable
    input, which results in a Level 3 classification. The
    Company includes the expected net future cash flows related to
    the associated servicing of the loan in the fair value
    measurement of a derivative loan commitment. The estimated value
    ascribed to the expected net future servicing cash flows is also
    considered a significant unobservable input contributing to the
    Level 3 classification of commitments to originate real
    estate loans for sale.

Interest
    rate swap agreements used for interest rate risk
    management

The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of
    the management of interest rate risk to modify the repricing
    characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Company generally
    determines the fair value of its interest rate swap agreements
    using externally developed pricing models based on market
    observable inputs and therefore classifies such valuations as
    Level 2. The Company has considered counterparty credit
    risk in the valuation of its interest rate swap assets and has
    considered its own credit risk in the valuation of its interest
    rate swap liabilities.

The following tables present assets and liabilities at
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 measured at

The Company is required, on a nonrecurring basis, to adjust the
    carrying value of certain assets or provide valuation allowances
    related to certain assets using fair value measurements. The
    more significant of those assets follow.

Loans

Loans are generally not recorded at fair value on a recurring
    basis. Periodically, the Company records nonrecurring
    adjustments to the carrying value of loans based on fair value
    measurements for partial charge-offs of the uncollectible
    portions of those loans. Nonrecurring adjustments also include
    certain impairment amounts for collateral-dependent loans when
    establishing the allowance for credit losses. Such amounts are
    generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral
    supporting the loan and, as a result, the carrying value of the
    loan less the calculated valuation amount does not necessarily
    represent the fair value of the loan. Real estate collateral is
    typically valued using appraisals or other indications of value
    based on recent comparable sales of similar properties or
    assumptions generally observable in the marketplace and the
    related nonrecurring fair value measurement adjustments have



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements — (Continued)

generally been classified as Level 2, unless significant
    adjustments have been made to the valuation that are not readily
    observable by market participants. Estimates of fair value used
    for other collateral supporting commercial loans generally are
    based on assumptions not observable in the marketplace and
    therefore such valuations have been classified as Level 3.
    Loans subject to nonrecurring fair value measurement were
    $746 million at December 31, 2010, ($476 million
    and $270 million of which were classified as Level 2
    and Level 3, respectively) and $901 million at
    December 31, 2009 ($547 million and $354 million
    of which were classified as Level 2 and Level 3,
    respectively). Changes in fair value recognized for partial
    charge-offs of loans and loan impairment reserves on loans held
    by the Company on December 31, 2010 were decreases of
    $224 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, and
    on loans held by the Company on December 31, 2009 were
    decreases of $343 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009

Capitalized
    servicing rights

Capitalized servicing rights are initially measured at fair
    value in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The
    Company utilizes the amortization method to subsequently measure
    its capitalized servicing assets. In accordance with GAAP, the
    Company must record impairment charges, on a nonrecurring basis,
    when the carrying value of certain strata exceed their estimated
    fair value. To estimate the fair value of servicing rights, the
    Company considers market prices for similar assets, if
    available, and the present value of expected future cash flows
    associated with the servicing rights calculated using
    assumptions that market participants would use in estimating
    future servicing income and expense. Such assumptions include
    estimates of the cost of servicing loans, loan default rates, an
    appropriate discount rate, and prepayment speeds. For purposes
    of evaluating and measuring impairment of capitalized servicing
    rights, the Company stratifies such assets based on the
    predominant risk characteristics of the underlying financial
    instruments that are expected to have the most impact on
    projected prepayments, cost of servicing and other factors
    affecting future cash flows associated with the servicing
    rights. Such factors may include financial asset or loan type,
    note rate and term. The amount of impairment recognized is the
    amount by which the carrying value of the capitalized servicing
    rights for a stratum exceed estimated fair value. Impairment is
    recognized through a valuation allowance. The determination of
    fair value of capitalized servicing rights is considered a
    Level 3 valuation. There were no changes in the fair value
    of capitalized servicing rights recognized for the year ended
    December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010 and

December 31, 2009, no stratum of capitalized servicing
    rights had a carrying value equal to its fair value. Changes in
    fair value of capitalized servicing rights recognized for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 reflected increases in fair
    value of $22 million.

Assets
    taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans

Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans are primarily
    comprised of commercial and residential real property and are
    generally measured at the lower of cost or fair value less costs
    to sell. The fair value of the real property is generally
    determined using appraisals or other indications of value based
    on recent comparable sales of similar properties or assumptions
    generally observable in the marketplace, and the related
    nonrecurring fair value measurement adjustments have generally
    been classified as Level 2. Assets taken in foreclosure of
    defaulted loans subject to nonrecurring fair value measurement
    were $176 million and $43 million at December 31,
    2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. Changes in fair
    value recognized for those foreclosed assets held by the Company
    at December 31, 2010 were $37 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2010. Changes in fair value recognized
    for those foreclosed assets held by the Company at
    December 31, 2009 were $24 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Disclosures
    of fair value of financial instruments

With the exception of marketable securities, certain off-balance
    sheet financial instruments and

one-to-four

family residential mortgage loans originated for sale, the
    Company’s financial instruments are not readily marketable
    and market prices do not exist. The Company, in attempting to
    comply with the provisions of GAAP that require disclosures of
    fair value of financial instruments, has not attempted to market
    its financial instruments to potential buyers, if any exist.
    Since negotiated prices in illiquid markets depend greatly upon
    the then present motivations of the buyer and seller, it is
    reasonable to



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements — (Continued)

assume that actual sales prices could vary widely from any
    estimate of fair value made without the benefit of negotiations.
    Additionally, changes in market interest rates can dramatically
    impact the value of financial instruments in a short period of
    time. Additional information about the assumptions and
    calculations utilized follows.

The carrying amounts and estimated fair value for financial
    instrument assets (liabilities) are presented in the following

The following assumptions, methods and calculations were used in
    determining the estimated fair value of financial instruments
    not measured at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet.

Cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits at
    banks, short-term borrowings, accrued interest receivable and
    accrued interest payable

Due to the nature of cash and cash equivalents and the near
    maturity of interest-bearing deposits at banks, short-term
    borrowings, accrued interest receivable and accrued interest
    payable, the Company estimated that the carrying amount of such
    instruments approximated estimated fair value.



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements — (Continued)

Investment
    securities

Estimated fair values of investments in readily marketable
    securities were generally based on quoted market prices.
    Investment securities that were not readily marketable were
    assigned amounts based on estimates provided by outside parties
    or modeling techniques that relied upon discounted calculations
    of projected cash flows or, in the case of other investment
    securities, which include capital stock of the Federal Reserve
    Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, at
    an amount equal to the carrying amount.

Loans
    and leases

In general, discount rates used to calculate values for loan
    products were based on the Company’s pricing at the
    respective period end. A higher discount rate was assumed with
    respect to estimated cash flows associated with nonaccrual
    loans. Projected loan cash flows were adjusted for estimated
    credit losses. However, such estimates made by the Company may
    not be indicative of assumptions and adjustments that a
    purchaser of the Company’s loans and leases would seek.

Deposits

Pursuant to GAAP, the estimated fair value ascribed to
    noninterest-bearing deposits, savings deposits and NOW accounts
    must be established at carrying value because of the
    customers’ ability to withdraw funds immediately. Time
    deposit accounts are required to be revalued based upon
    prevailing market interest rates for similar maturity
    instruments. As a result, amounts assigned to time deposits were
    based on discounted cash flow calculations using prevailing
    market interest rates based on the Company’s pricing at the
    respective date for deposits with comparable remaining terms to
    maturity.

The Company believes that deposit accounts have a value greater
    than that prescribed by GAAP. The Company feels, however, that
    the value associated with these deposits is greatly influenced
    by characteristics of the buyer, such as the ability to reduce
    the costs of servicing the deposits and deposit attrition which
    often occurs following an acquisition.

Long-term
    borrowings

The amounts assigned to long-term borrowings were based on
    quoted market prices, when available, or were based on
    discounted cash flow calculations using prevailing market
    interest rates for borrowings of similar terms and credit risk.

Commitments
    to originate real estate loans for sale and commitments to sell
    real estate loans

The Company enters into various commitments to originate real
    estate loans for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans.
    Such commitments are considered to be derivative financial
    instruments and, therefore, are carried at estimated fair value
    on the consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair values of
    such commitments were generally calculated by reference to
    quoted market prices for commitments to sell real estate loans
    to certain government-sponsored entities and other parties.

Interest
    rate swap agreements used for interest rate risk
    management

The estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements used
    for interest rate risk management represents the amount the
    Company would have expected to receive or pay to terminate such
    agreements.

Other
    commitments and contingencies

As described in note 21, in the normal course of business,
    various commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding,
    such as loan commitments, credit guarantees and letters of
    credit. The Company’s pricing of such financial instruments
    is based largely on credit quality and relationship, probability
    of funding and other requirements. Loan commitments often have
    fixed expiration dates and contain termination and other clauses
    which provide for relief from funding in the event of
    significant deterioration in the credit quality of the customer.
    The rates and terms of the Company’s loan commitments,
    credit guarantees and letters of credit are competitive with
    other financial institutions



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements — (Continued)

operating in markets served by the Company. The Company believes
    that the carrying amounts, which are included in other
    liabilities, are reasonable estimates of the fair value of these
    financial instruments.

The Company does not believe that the estimated information
    presented herein is representative of the earnings power or
    value of the Company. The preceding analysis, which is
    inherently limited in depicting fair value, also does not
    consider any value associated with existing customer
    relationships nor the ability of the Company to create value
    through loan origination, deposit gathering or fee generating
    activities.

Many of the estimates presented herein are based upon the use of
    highly subjective information and assumptions and, accordingly,
    the results may not be precise. Management believes that fair
    value estimates may not be comparable between financial
    institutions due to the wide range of permitted valuation
    techniques and numerous estimates which must be made.
    Furthermore, because the disclosed fair value amounts were
    estimated as of the balance sheet date, the amounts actually
    realized or paid upon maturity or settlement of the various
    financial instruments could be significantly different.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to
    customers, generally having fixed expiration dates or other
    termination clauses that may require payment of a fee. Standby
    and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments
    issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third
    party. Standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon
    the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of
    the underlying contract with the third party, whereas commercial
    letters of credit are issued to facilitate commerce and
    typically result in the commitment being funded when the
    underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and
    third party. The credit risk associated with commitments to
    extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit is
    essentially the same as that involved with extending loans to
    customers and is subject to normal credit policies. Collateral
    may be obtained based on management’s assessment of the
    customer’s creditworthiness.

Financial guarantees and indemnification contracts are
    oftentimes similar to standby letters of credit and include
    mandatory purchase agreements issued to ensure that customer
    obligations are fulfilled, recourse obligations associated with
    sold loans, and other guarantees of customer performance or
    compliance with designated rules and regulations. Included in
    financial guarantees and indemnification contracts are loan
    principal amounts sold with recourse in conjunction with the
    Company’s involvement in the Fannie Mae DUS program. The
    Company’s maximum credit risk for recourse associated with
    loans sold under this program totaled approximately
    $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively.



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements — (Continued)

Since many loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and
    guarantees and indemnification contracts expire without being
    funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not
    necessarily indicative of future cash flows.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to
    hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of real estate loans
    held for sale. Such commitments are considered derivatives and
    along with commitments to originate real estate loans to be held
    for sale are generally recorded in the consolidated balance
    sheet at estimated fair market value.

The Company occupies certain banking offices and uses certain
    equipment under noncancellable operating lease agreements
    expiring at various dates over the next 29 years.

Minimum
    lease payments under noncancellable operating leases are

The Company has an agreement with the Baltimore Ravens of the
    National Football League whereby the Company obtained the naming
    rights to a football stadium in Baltimore, Maryland. Under the
    agreement, the Company is obligated to pay $5 million per
    year through 2013 and $6 million per year from 2014 through
    2017.

The Company reinsures credit life and accident and health
    insurance purchased by consumer loan customers. The Company also
    enters into reinsurance contracts with third party insurance
    companies who insure against the risk of a mortgage
    borrower’s payment default in connection with certain
    mortgage loans originated by the Company. When providing
    reinsurance coverage, the Company receives a premium in exchange
    for accepting a portion of the insurer’s risk of loss. The
    outstanding loan principal balances reinsured by the Company
    were approximately $85 million at December 31, 2010.
    Assets of subsidiaries providing reinsurance that are available
    to satisfy claims totaled approximately $71 million at
    December 31, 2010. The amounts noted above are not
    necessarily indicative of losses which may ultimately be
    incurred. Such losses are expected to be substantially less
    because most loans are repaid by borrowers in accordance with
    the original loan terms. Management believes that any
    reinsurance losses that may be payable by the Company will not
    be material to the Company’s consolidated financial
    position.

The Company is contractually obligated to repurchase previously
    sold residential real estate loans that do not ultimately meet
    investor sale criteria related to underwriting procedures or
    loan documentation. When required to do so, the Company may
    reimburse loan purchasers for losses incurred or may repurchase
    certain loans. The Company reduces residential mortgage banking
    revenues by an estimate for losses related to its obligations to
    loan purchasers. The amount of those charges is based on the
    volume of loans sold, the level of reimbursement requests
    received from loan purchasers and estimates of losses that may
    be associated with previously sold loans. At December 31,
    2010, management believes that any remaining liability arising
    out of the Company’s obligation to loan purchasers is not
    material to the Company’s consolidated financial position.

M&T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course
    of business to various pending and threatened legal proceedings
    in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. Management,
    after consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that
    the aggregate ultimate liability arising out of litigation
    pending against M&T or its subsidiaries will be material to
    the Company’s consolidated financial position, but at the
    present time is not in a position to determine whether such
    litigation will have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s consolidated results of operations in any future
    reporting period.

Segment
    information

Reportable segments have been determined based upon the
    Company’s internal profitability reporting system, which is
    organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business
    units have been combined for segment information reporting
    purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type
    of customer and the distribution of those products and services
    are similar. The reportable segments are Business Banking,
    Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary
    Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking.

The financial information of the Company’s segments has
    been compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in
    note 1 with certain exceptions. The more significant of
    these exceptions are described herein. The Company allocates
    interest income or interest expense using a methodology that
    charges users of funds (assets) interest expense and credits
    providers of funds (liabilities) with income based on the
    maturity, prepayment

and/or

repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities. The net
    effect of this allocation is recorded in the “All
    Other” category. A provision for credit losses is allocated
    to segments in an amount based largely on actual net charge-offs
    incurred by the segment during the period plus or minus an
    amount necessary to adjust the segment’s allowance for
    credit losses due to changes in loan balances. In contrast, the
    level of the consolidated provision for credit losses is
    determined using the methodologies described in note 1 to
    assess the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.
    Indirect fixed and variable expenses incurred by certain
    centralized support areas are allocated to segments based on
    actual usage (for example, volume measurements) and other
    criteria. Certain types of administrative expenses and bankwide
    expense accruals (including amortization of core deposit and
    other intangible assets associated with acquisitions of
    financial institutions) are generally not allocated to segments.
    Income taxes are allocated to segments based on the
    Company’s marginal statutory tax rate adjusted for any
    tax-exempt income or non-deductible expenses. Equity is
    allocated to the segments based on regulatory capital
    requirements and in proportion to an assessment of the inherent
    risks associated with the business of the segment (including
    interest, credit and operating risk).

The management accounting policies and processes utilized in
    compiling segment financial information are highly subjective
    and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative
    guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segment results
    are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported
    by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in
    management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures
    may result in changes in reported segment financial data.

Information
    about the Company’s segments is presented in the
    accompanying table. Income statement amounts are in thousands of
    dollars. Balance sheet amounts are in millions of dollars.

(a)

Net interest income is the
    difference between actual taxable-equivalent interest earned on
    assets and interest paid on liabilities by a segment and a
    funding charge (credit) based on the Company’s internal
    funds transfer pricing methodology. Segments are charged a cost
    to fund any assets (e.g. loans) and are paid a funding credit
    for any funds provided (e.g. deposits). The taxable-equivalent
    adjustment aggregated $24,023,000 in 2010, $21,829,000 in 2009
    and $21,861,000 in 2008 and is eliminated in “All
    Other” net interest income and income tax expense
    (benefit).

The Business Banking segment provides deposit, lending, cash
    management and other financial services to small businesses and
    professionals through the Company’s banking office network
    and several other delivery channels, including business banking
    centers, telephone banking, Internet banking and automated
    teller machines. The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide
    range of credit products and banking services to middle-market
    and large commercial customers, mainly within the markets the
    Company serves. Among the services provided by this segment are
    commercial lending and leasing, letters of credit, deposit
    products and cash management services. The Commercial Real
    Estate segment provides credit services which are secured by
    various types of multifamily residential and commercial real
    estate and deposit services to its customers. Activities of this
    segment include the origination, sales and servicing of
    commercial real estate loans. The Discretionary Portfolio
    segment includes securities, residential mortgage loans and
    other assets; short-term and long-term borrowed funds; brokered
    certificates of deposit and interest rate swap agreements
    related thereto; and Cayman Islands branch deposits. This
    segment also provides foreign exchange services to customers.
    The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services
    residential mortgage loans for consumers and sells substantially
    all of those loans in the secondary market to investors or to
    the Discretionary Portfolio segment. The segment periodically
    purchases servicing rights to loans that have been originated by
    other entities. This segment also originated loans to developers
    of residential real estate properties. Residential mortgage
    loans held for sale are included in the Residential Mortgage
    Banking segment. The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of
    services to consumers through several delivery channels that
    include banking offices, automated teller machines, telephone
    banking and Internet banking. The “All Other” category
    includes other operating activities of the Company that are not
    directly attributable to the reported segments; the difference
    between the provision for credit losses and the calculated
    provision allocated to the reportable segments; goodwill and
    core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from
    acquisitions of financial institutions; merger-related gains and
    expenses resulting from acquisitions; the net impact of the
    Company’s internal funds transfer pricing methodology;
    eliminations of transactions between reportable segments;
    certain nonrecurring transactions; the residual effects of
    unallocated support systems and general and administrative
    expenses; and the impact of interest rate risk management
    strategies.

    of consolidated total revenues.

Regulatory
    matters

Payment of dividends by M&T’s banking subsidiaries is
    restricted by various legal and regulatory limitations.
    Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T are limited by
    the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current
    year and the preceding two years. For purposes of this test, at
    December 31, 2010, approximately $1.4 billion was
    available for payment of dividends to M&T from banking
    subsidiaries.

Banking regulations prohibit extensions of credit by the
    subsidiary banks to M&T unless appropriately secured by
    assets. Securities of affiliates are not eligible as collateral
    for this purpose.

The bank subsidiaries are required to maintain
    noninterest-earning reserves against certain deposit
    liabilities. During the maintenance periods that included
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, cash and due from banks
    included a daily average of $196,402,000 and $162,952,000,
    respectively, for such purpose.

Federal regulators have adopted capital adequacy guidelines for
    bank holding companies and banks. Failure to meet minimum
    capital requirements can result in certain mandatory, and
    possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that,
    if undertaken, could have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial statements. Under the capital adequacy
    guidelines, the so-called “Tier 1 capital” and
    “Total capital” as a percentage of risk-weighted
    assets and certain off-balance sheet financial instruments must
    be at least 4% and 8%, respectively. In addition to these
    risk-based measures, regulators also require banking
    institutions that meet certain qualitative criteria to maintain
    a minimum “leverage” ratio of “Tier 1
    capital” to average total assets, adjusted for goodwill and
    certain other items, of at least 3% to be considered adequately
    capitalized. As of December 31, 2010, M&T and each of
    its banking subsidiaries exceeded all applicable capital
    adequacy requirements. To be considered “well
    capitalized,” under the regulatory framework for prompt
    corrective action, a banking institution must maintain
    Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and
    leverage ratios of at least 6%, 10% and 5%, respectively.

Relationship
    of M&T and AIB

AIB received 26,700,000 shares of M&T common stock on
    April 1, 2003 as a result of M&T’s acquisition of
    a subsidiary of AIB on that date. In an effort to raise its
    capital position to meet new Irish government-mandated capital
    requirements, AIB sold those shares on November 4, 2010
    and, as a result, the provisions of the Agreement and Plan of
    Reorganization between M&T and AIB related to AIB’s
    rights as a substantial shareholder in the corporate governance
    of M&T became inoperative as of that date.

25.

Relationship
    with Bayview Lending Group LLC and Bayview Financial Holdings,
    L.P.

In 2007, M&T invested $300 million to acquire a 20%
    minority interest in Bayview Lending Group LLC
    (“BLG”), a privately-held commercial mortgage lender.
    M&T recognizes income or loss from BLG using the equity
    method of accounting. The carrying value of that investment was
    $220 million at December 31, 2010.



M&T
    BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Financial Statements — (Continued)

Bayview Financial Holdings, L.P. (together with its affiliates,
    “Bayview Financial”), a privately-held specialty
    mortgage finance company, is BLG’s majority investor. In
    addition to their common investment in BLG, the Company and
    Bayview Financial conduct other business activities with each
    other. The Company has purchased loan servicing rights for
    small-balance commercial mortgage loans from BLG and Bayview
    Financial having outstanding principal balances of
    $5.2 billion and $5.5 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. Amounts recorded as capitalized
    servicing assets for such loans totaled $26 million at
    December 31, 2010 and $40 million at December 31,
    2009. Capitalized servicing rights at December 31, 2010 and
    2009 also included $9 million and $17 million,
    respectively, for servicing rights that were purchased from
    Bayview Financial related to residential mortgage loans with
    outstanding principal balances of $3.6 billion and
    $4.1 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. Revenues from servicing residential and
    small-balance commercial mortgage loans purchased from BLG and
    Bayview Financial were $46 million, $50 million and
    $54 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    M&T Bank provided $34 million of credit facilities to
    Bayview Financial at December 31, 2009, of which
    $24 million was outstanding at that date. That credit
    facility expired and was repaid in full during 2010. There was
    no similar credit facility provided as of December 31,
    2010. The Company held $22 million and $25 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, of collateralized
    mortgage obligations in its

available-for-sale

investment securities portfolio that were securitized by Bayview
    Financial. In addition, the Company held $313 million and
    $352 million of similar investment securities in its

held-to-maturity

portfolio at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009,
    respectively.
