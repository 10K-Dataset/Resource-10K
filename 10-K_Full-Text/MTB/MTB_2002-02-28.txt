Item 1.

Business.

M&T Bank Corporation (“Registrant” or “M&T”) is a New York business corporation
which is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”) and under Article III-A of the New York
Banking Law (“Banking Law”). The principal executive offices of the Registrant
are located at One M&T Plaza, Buffalo, New York 14203. The Registrant was
incorporated in November 1969. The Registrant and its direct and indirect
subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the “Company.” As of
December 31, 2001 the Company had consolidated total assets of $31.5 billion,
deposits of $21.6 billion and stockholders’ equity of
$2.9 billion. The Company had 8,139 full-time and 1,152 part-time employees as
of December 31, 2001.

At December 31, 2001, the Registrant had two wholly owned bank subsidiaries:
Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T Bank”) and M&T Bank, National
Association (“M&T Bank, N.A.”). The banks collectively offer a wide range of
commercial banking, trust and investment services to their customers. At
December 31, 2001, M&T Bank represented 98% of consolidated assets of the
Company.

On February 9, 2001, M&T completed the merger of Premier National Bancorp, Inc.
(“Premier”), a bank holding company headquartered in Lagrangeville, New York,
with and into Olympia Financial Corp. (“Olympia”), a wholly owned subsidiary of
M&T. Following the merger, Premier National Bank, Premier’s bank subsidiary,
was merged into M&T Bank. Premier National Bank operated
34 banking offices in the mid-Hudson Valley region of New York State. As of
February 9, 2001, assets acquired totaled approximately $1.8 billion,
including $1.0 billion of loans, and liabilities assumed totaled approximately
$1.5 billion, including $1.4 billion of deposits. The transaction was
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the
operations acquired from Premier have been included in M&T’s financial results
subsequent to the acquisition date. Premier’s stockholders received
approximately $171 million in cash and 2,440,812 shares of M&T common stock in
exchange for the Premier shares outstanding at the time of the acquisition.

The Company from time to time considers acquiring banks, thrift institutions,
branch offices or other businesses within markets currently served by the
Company or in other locations that would complement the Company’s business or
its geographic reach. The Company has pursued acquisition opportunities in the
past, continues to review different opportunities, including the possibility of
major acquisitions, and intends to continue this practice.

I and Trust II and Olympia in the case of Trust III. The junior subordinated

represented, individually and collectively, an insignificant portion of the
Company’s
consolidated assets, net income and stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2001.

Segment Information, Principal Products/Services

and Foreign Operations

Information about the Registrant’s business segments is included in note 19 of
Notes to Financial Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data” and is further discussed in Part II, Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations”. The Company’s international activities are discussed in note 15 of
Notes to Financial Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data.”

-8-


The Registrant’s reportable segments have been determined based upon its
internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic
business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment
information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services,
the type of customer and the distribution of those products and services are
similar. The reportable segments are Commercial Banking,
Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking
and Retail Banking.

The only activities that, as a class, contributed 10% or more of the sum of
consolidated interest income and other income in each of the last three years
were lending and investment securities transactions. The amount of income from
such sources during those years is set forth on the Company’s Consolidated
Statement of Income filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data.”

Supervision and Regulation of the Company

The banking industry is subject to extensive state and federal regulation and
continues to undergo significant change. The following discussion summarizes
certain aspects of the banking laws and regulations that affect the Company.
Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are
frequently raised in Congress, in state legislatures, and before the various
bank regulatory agencies. The likelihood and timing of any changes and the
impact such changes might have on the Company are impossible to determine with
any certainty. A change in applicable laws or regulations, or a change in the
way such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts,
may have a material impact on the business, operations and earnings of the
Company. To the extent that the following information describes statutory or
regulatory provisions, it is qualified entirely by reference to the particular
statutory or regulatory provision.

Financial Services Modernization

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“Gramm-Leach”) enables combinations among
banks, securities firms and insurance companies. Under Gramm-Leach, bank
holding companies are permitted to offer their customers virtually any type of
financial service that is financial in nature or incidental thereto,
including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both underwriting and
agency), and merchant banking.

In order to engage in these new financial activities, a bank holding company
must qualify and register with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (“Federal Reserve Board”) as a “financial holding company” by
demonstrating that each of its bank subsidiaries is “well capitalized,” “well
managed,” and has at least a “satisfactory” rating under the Community
Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”). M&T currently satisfies the qualifications
for registering as a financial holding company, but has not elected to do so to
date.

The financial activities authorized by Gramm-Leach may also be engaged in by a
“financial subsidiary” of a national or state bank, except for insurance or
annuity underwriting, insurance company portfolio investments, real estate
investment and development, and merchant banking, which must be conducted in a
financial holding company. In order for these financial activities to be
engaged in by a financial subsidiary of a national or state bank, Gramm-Leach
requires each of the parent bank (and its sister-bank affiliates) to be well
capitalized and well managed; the aggregate consolidated assets of all of that
bank’s financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of its
consolidated total assets or $50 billion; the bank must have at least a
satisfactory CRA rating; and, if that bank is one of the 100 largest national
banks, it must meet certain financial rating or other comparable requirements.
M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. currently satisfy the
qualifications for engaging in financial activities through financial

-9-


subsidiaries, but neither has elected to do so to date.

Gramm-Leach also establishes a system of functional regulation, under which the
federal banking agencies will regulate the banking activities of financial
holding companies and banks’ financial subsidiaries, the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission will regulate their securities activities, and state
insurance regulators will regulate their insurance activities. Gramm-Leach
also provides new protections against the transfer and use by financial
institutions of consumers’ nonpublic, personal information.
The foregoing discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
statutory provisions of Gramm-Leach and the implementing regulations which have
been or will be adopted by various government agencies pursuant to Gramm-Leach.

Bank Holding Company Regulation

As a registered bank holding company, the Registrant and its nonbank
subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation under the BHCA by the
Federal Reserve Board and the New York State Banking Superintendent (“Banking
Superintendent”). The Federal Reserve Board requires regular reports from the
Registrant and is authorized by the BHCA to make regular examinations of the
Registrant and its subsidiaries.

The Registrant may not acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more
than 5% of the voting shares of any company, including a bank, without the
prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, except as specifically authorized
under the BHCA. The Registrant is also subject to regulation under the Banking
Law with respect to certain acquisitions of domestic banks. Under the BHCA,
the Registrant, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, may
acquire shares of non-banking corporations the activities of which are deemed
by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or
controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.

The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement powers over bank holding companies
and their non-banking subsidiaries, among other things, to interdict activities
that represent unsafe or unsound practices or constitute violations of law,
rule, regulation, administrative orders or written agreements with a federal
bank regulator. These powers may be exercised
through the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, civil money penalties or other
actions.

Under the Federal Reserve Board’s statement of policy with respect to bank
holding company operations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a
source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to
commit all available resources to support such institutions in circumstances
where it might not do so absent such policy. Although this “source of
strength” policy has been challenged in litigation, the Federal Reserve Board
continues to take the position that it has authority to enforce it. For a
discussion of circumstances under which a bank holding company may be required
to guarantee the capital levels or performance of its subsidiary
banks,

see

“Capital Adequacy,” below. The Federal Reserve also has the authority to
terminate any activity of a bank holding company that constitutes a serious
risk to the financial soundness or stability of any
subsidiary depository institution or to terminate its control of any bank or
nonbank subsidiaries.

The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as
amended (the “Interstate Banking Act”) generally permits bank holding companies
to acquire banks in any state, and preempts all state laws restricting the
ownership by a bank holding company of banks in more than one state. The
Interstate Banking Act also permits a bank to merge with an out-of-state bank
and convert any offices into branches of the resulting bank if

-10-


both states have not opted out of interstate
branching; permits a bank to acquire branches from an out-of-state bank if the law of the state where the
branches are located permits the interstate branch acquisition; and permits
banks to establish and operate

de novo

interstate branches whenever the host
state opts-in to

de novo

branching. Bank holding companies and banks seeking
to engage in transactions authorized by the Interstate Banking Act must be
adequately capitalized and managed.

The Banking Law authorizes interstate branching by merger or acquisition on a
reciprocal basis, and permits the acquisition of a single branch without
restriction, but does not provide for

de novo

interstate branching.

Bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks are also subject to the
provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of the CRA, the Federal Reserve Board
(or other appropriate bank regulatory agency) is required, in connection with
its examination of a bank, to assess such bank’s record in meeting the credit
needs of the communities served by that bank, including low- and
moderate-income neighborhoods. Furthermore, such assessment is also required
of any bank that has applied, among other things, to merge or consolidate with
or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of a federally-regulated
financial institution, or to open or relocate a branch office. In the case of
a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or bank holding
company, the Federal Reserve Board will assess the record of each subsidiary
bank of the applicant bank holding company in considering the application. The
Banking Law contains provisions similar to the CRA which are applicable to New
York-chartered banks.

Supervision and Regulation of Bank Subsidiaries

The Registrant’s bank subsidiaries are subject to supervision and
regulation, and are examined regularly, by various bank regulatory agencies:
M&T Bank by the Federal Reserve Board and the Banking Superintendent; and M&T
Bank, N.A. by the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). The Registrant and its
direct non-banking subsidiaries are affiliates, within the meaning of the
Federal Reserve Act, of the Registrant’s subsidiary banks and their
subsidiaries. As a result, the Registrant’s subsidiary banks and their
subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on loans or extensions of credit to,
purchases of assets from, investments in, and transactions with the Registrant
and its direct non-banking subsidiaries and on certain other transactions with
them or involving their securities. Gramm-Leach places similar restrictions on
the Registrant’s subsidiary banks making loans or extending credit to,
purchasing assets from, investing in, or entering into transactions with, their
financial subsidiaries.

Under the “cross-guarantee” provisions of the FDI Act, insured depository
institutions under common control are required to reimburse the FDIC for any
loss suffered by either the BIF or SAIF of the FDIC as a result of the default
of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or for any assistance
provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in
danger of default. Thus, any insured depository institution subsidiary of M&T
could incur liability to the FDIC in the event of a default of another insured
depository institution owned or controlled by M&T. The FDIC’s claim under the
cross-guarantee provisions is superior to claims of stockholders of the insured
depository institution or its holding company and to most claims arising out of
obligations or liabilities owed to affiliates of the institution, but is
subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and holders of
subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured
depository institution. The FDIC may decline
to enforce the cross-guarantee provisions if it determines that a waiver is in
the best interest of the BIF or SAIF or both.

Dividends from Bank Subsidiaries

M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. are subject, under one or more of the banking laws,
to restrictions on the amount and frequency (no more often than quarterly) of
dividend declarations. Future dividend payments to the Registrant by its
subsidiary banks will be dependent on a number of factors, including the
earnings and financial condition of each such bank, and are subject to the
limitations referred to in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements filed
herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data,” and to other statutory powers of bank regulatory agencies.

An insured depository institution is prohibited from making any capital
distribution to its owner, including any dividend, if, after making such
distribution, the depository institution fails to meet the required minimum
level for any relevant capital measure, including the risk-based capital
adequacy and leverage standards discussed below.

Capital Adequacy

The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC have adopted risk-based capital
adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies and banks under their
supervision. Under these guidelines, the so-called “Tier 1 capital” and “Total
capital” as a percentage of risk-weighted assets and certain off-balance sheet
instruments must be at least 4% and 8%, respectively.

The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC have also imposed a leverage
standard to supplement their risk-based ratios. This leverage standard focuses
on a banking institution’s ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets,
adjusted for goodwill and certain other items. Under these guidelines, banking
institutions that meet certain criteria, including excellent asset quality,
high liquidity, low interest rate exposure and good earnings, and that have
received the highest regulatory rating must maintain a ratio of Tier 1 capital
to total adjusted average assets of at least 3%. Institutions not meeting
these criteria, as well as institutions with supervisory, financial or
operational weaknesses, along with those experiencing or anticipating
significant growth are expected to maintain a
Tier 1 capital to total adjusted average assets ratio equal to at least 4%
to 5%.

As reflected in the following table, the risk-based capital ratios and leverage
ratios of the Registrant, Olympia, M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. as of December 31, 2001
exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as “well
capitalized,” the highest classification under the regulatory capital
guidelines.

The federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC,
maintain risk-based capital standards in order to ensure that those standards
take adequate account of interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk, the
risk of nontraditional activities and equity investments in nonfinancial
companies, as well as reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss
on certain multifamily housing loans. Bank regulators periodically propose
amendments to the risk-based capital guidelines and related regulatory
framework, and consider changes to the risk-based capital standards that could
significantly increase the amount of capital needed to meet the requirements
for the capital tiers described below. While the Company’s management studies
such proposals, the timing of adoption, ultimate form and effect of any such
proposed amendments on the Company’s capital requirements and operations cannot
be predicted.

The federal banking agencies are required to take “prompt corrective action” in
respect of depository institutions and their bank holding companies that do not
meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA established five capital tiers:
“well capitalized”, “adequately capitalized”, “undercapitalized”,
“significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized”. A
depository institution’s capital tier, or that of its bank holding company,
depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant
capital measures, including a risk-based capital measure and a leverage ratio
capital measure, and certain other factors.

Under the implementing regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies, a
bank holding company or bank is considered “well capitalized” if it has (i) a
total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based
capital ratio of 6% or greater, (iii) a leverage ratio of 5% or greater and
(iv) is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a
specific capital level for any capital measure. An “adequately capitalized”
bank holding company or bank is defined as one that has (i) a total risk-based
capital ratio of 8% or greater, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4% or
greater and (iii) a leverage ratio of 4% or greater (or 3% or greater in the
case of a bank with a composite CAMELS rating of 1). A bank holding company or
bank is considered (A) “undercapitalized” if it has (i) a total risk-based
capital ratio of less than 8%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less
than 4% or (iii) a leverage ratio of less than 4% (or 3% in the case of a bank
with a composite CAMELS rating of 1);
(B) “significantly undercapitalized” if the bank has (i) a total risk-based
capital ratio of less than 6%, or (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of
less than 3% or (iii) a leverage ratio of less than 3% and (C)“critically
undercapitalized” if the bank has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets
equal to or less than 2%. The Federal Reserve Board may reclassify a “well
capitalized” bank holding company or bank as “adequately capitalized” or
subject an “adequately capitalized” or “undercapitalized” institution to the
supervisory actions applicable to the next lower capital category if it
determines that the bank holding company or bank is in an unsafe or unsound
condition or deems the bank holding company or bank to be engaged in an unsafe
or unsound practice and not to have corrected the deficiency. M&T, Olympia,
M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. currently meet the definition of “well capitalized”
institutions.

“Undercapitalized” depository institutions, among other things, are subject to
growth limitations, are prohibited, with certain exceptions, from making
capital distributions, are limited in their ability to obtain funding from a
Federal Reserve Bank and are required to submit a capital restoration plan.
The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining,
among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is
likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. In
addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository
institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will
comply with such capital restoration plan

-13-


and provide appropriate assurances of performance. If a depository institution
fails to submit an acceptable plan, including if the holding company refuses or
is unable to make the guarantee described in the previous sentence, it is
treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized”. Failure to submit or
implement an acceptable capital plan also is grounds for the appointment of a
conservator or a receiver. “Significantly undercapitalized” depository
institutions may be subject to a number of additional requirements and
restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become
adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of
receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Moreover, the parent holding
company of a “significantly undercapitalized” depository institution may be
ordered to divest itself of the institution or of nonbank subsidiaries of the
holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions, among other
things, are prohibited from making any payments of principal and interest on
subordinated debt, and are subject to the appointment of a receiver or
conservator.

Each federal banking agency prescribes standards for depository institutions
and depository institution holding companies relating to internal controls,
information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit
underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, a maximum
ratio of classified assets to capital, minimum earnings sufficient to absorb
losses, a minimum ratio of market value to book value for publicly traded
shares and other standards as they deem appropriate. The Federal Reserve Board
and OCC have adopted such standards.

Depository institutions that are not “well capitalized” or “adequately
capitalized” and have not received a waiver from the FDIC are prohibited from
accepting or renewing brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2001, M&T Bank and
M&T Bank, N.A. had approximately $1.8 billion and $1 million of brokered
deposits, respectively.

Although M&T has issued shares of common stock in connection with acquisitions
or at other times, the Company has generally maintained capital ratios in
excess of minimum regulatory guidelines largely through internal capital
generation (i.e., net income less dividends paid). Historically, M&T’s
dividend payout ratio and dividend yield, when compared with other bank holding
companies, has been relatively low, thereby allowing for capital retention to
support growth or to facilitate purchases of M&T’s common stock to be held as
treasury stock. Management’s policy of reinvestment of earnings and repurchase
of shares of common stock is intended to enhance M&T’s earnings per share
prospects and thereby reward stockholders over time with capital gains in the
form of increased stock price rather than high dividend income.

FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments

As institutions with deposits insured by the BIF and the SAIF, M&T Bank and M&T
Bank, N.A. are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. Under current
law the regular insurance assessments to be paid by BIF-insured and
SAIF-insured institutions are specified in schedules issued by the FDIC that
specify, at semiannual intervals, target reserve ratios designed to maintain
the reserve ratios of each of those insurance funds at 1.25% of their
estimated insured deposits. The FDIC is also authorized to impose one or more
special assessments.

The FDIC has implemented a risk-based deposit premium assessment system under
which each depository institution is placed in one of nine assessment
categories based on the institution’s capital classification under the prompt
corrective action provisions described above, and whether such institution is
considered by its supervisory agency to be financially sound or to have
supervisory concerns. The adjusted assessment rates for both BIF-insured and
SAIF-insured institutions under the current system range from .00% to .27%

-14-


depending upon the assessment category into which the insured institution is
placed. Neither of the Company’s bank subsidiaries paid regular insurance
assessments to the FDIC in 2001. However, the FDIC retains the ability to
increase regular BIF and SAIF assessments and to levy special additional
assessments.

In addition to deposit insurance fund assessments, beginning in 1997 the FDIC
assessed BIF-assessable and SAIF-assessable deposits to fund the repayment of
debt obligations of the Financing Corporation (“FICO”). FICO is a government
agency-sponsored entity that was formed to borrow the money necessary to carry
out the closing and ultimate disposition of failed thrift institutions by the
Resolution Trust Corporation. The current annualized rates established by the
FDIC for both BIF-assessable and SAIF-assessable deposits are 1.82 basis points
(hundredths of one percent).

Deposit insurance reform legislation has recently been introduced in the United
States Congress which, if enacted into law, would merge the BIF and the SAIF;
substantially increase current levels of FDIC insurance coverage; allow the
FDIC to charge premiums using a new risk-based formula; replace the target
reserve ratio of 1.25% with a reserve ratio range of 1.0 — 1.5% of insured
deposits; and provide for assessment credits, based on past contributions to
the BIF and SAIF, and a limited rebate authority for the FDIC. Any significant
increases in assessment rates or additional special assessments by the FDIC
could have an adverse impact on the results of operations and capital of M&T
Bank or M&T Bank, N.A.

Governmental Policies

The earnings of the Company are significantly affected by the monetary and
fiscal policies of governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve
Board. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve
Board to implement these objectives are open-market operations in U.S.
Government securities and Federal funds, changes in the discount rate on member
bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank
deposits. These instruments of monetary policy are used in varying
combinations to influence the overall level of bank loans, investments and
deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits. The
Federal Reserve Board frequently uses these instruments of monetary policy,
especially its open-market operations and the discount rate, to influence the
level of interest rates and to affect the strength of the economy, the level of
inflation or the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The monetary
policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the
operating results of banking institutions in the past and are expected to
continue to do so in the future. It is not possible to predict the nature of
future changes in monetary and fiscal policies, or the effect which they may
have on the Company’s business and earnings.

Competition

The Company competes in offering commercial and personal financial services
with other banking institutions and with firms in a number of other industries,
such as thrift institutions, credit unions, personal loan companies, sales
finance companies, leasing companies, securities firms and insurance
companies. Furthermore, diversified financial services companies are able to
offer a combination of these services to their customers on a nationwide basis.
The Company’s operations are significantly impacted by state and federal
regulations applicable to the banking industry. Moreover, the provisions of
Gramm-Leach may increase competition among diversified financial services
providers, and the Interstate Banking Act and the Banking Law may further ease
entry into New York State by out-of-state banking institutions. As a result,
the number of financial services providers and banking institutions with which
the Company competes may grow in the future.

-15-


Other Legislative Initiatives

Proposals may be introduced in the United States Congress and in the New York
State Legislature and before various bank regulatory authorities which would
alter the powers of, and restrictions on, different types of banking
organizations and which would restructure part or all of the existing
regulatory framework for banks, bank holding companies and other providers of
financial services. Moreover, other bills may be introduced in Congress which
would further regulate, deregulate or restructure the financial services
industry. It is not possible to predict whether these or any other proposals
will be enacted into law or, even if enacted, the effect which they may have on
the Company’s business and earnings.

Properties.

Both M&T and M&T Bank maintain their executive offices at One M&T Plaza in
Buffalo, New York. This twenty-one story headquarters building, containing
approximately 277,000 rentable square feet of space, is owned in fee by M&T
Bank, and was completed in 1967. M&T, M&T Bank and their subsidiaries occupy
approximately 73% of the building and the remainder is leased to non-affiliated
tenants. At December 31, 2001, the cost of this property (including
improvements subsequent to the initial construction), net of accumulated
depreciation, was $8.1 million.

In September 1992, M&T Bank acquired an additional facility in Buffalo, New
York with approximately 365,000 rentable square feet of space at a cost of
approximately $12 million. Approximately 88% of this facility, known as M&T
Center, is occupied by M&T Bank and its subsidiaries, with the remainder leased
to non-affiliated tenants. At December 31, 2001, the cost of this building
(including improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of accumulated
depreciation, was $13.9 million.

M&T Bank also owns and occupies two separate facilities in the Buffalo area
which support certain back-office and operations functions of the Company. The
total square footage of these facilities approximates 213,000 square feet and
their combined cost (including improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of
accumulated depreciation, was $11.9 million at December 31, 2001.

M&T Bank also owns a facility in Syracuse, New York with approximately 123,000
rentable square feet of space. Approximately 47% of this facility is occupied
by M&T Bank, with the remainder leased to non-affiliated tenants. At December
31, 2001, the cost of this building, net of accumulated depreciation, was $7.1
million.

No other properties owned by M&T Bank have more than 65,000 square feet of
space. The cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, of the
Company’s premises and equipment is detailed in note 6 of Notes to Financial
Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data”. Of the 470 domestic banking offices of the Registrant’s
subsidiary banks at December 31, 2001, 223 are owned in fee and 247 are leased.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

M&T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course of business to
various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary
damages are asserted. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, does
not anticipate that the aggregate ultimate liability, if any, arising out of
litigation pending against M&T or its subsidiaries will be material to M&T’s
consolidated financial position, but at the present time is not in a position
to determine whether such litigation will have a material adverse effect on
M&T’s consolidated results of operations in any future reporting period.

Corporate Profile and Significant Developments

M&T Bank Corporation (“M&T”) is a bank holding company headquartered in
Buffalo, New York with consolidated assets of $31.5 billion at December 31,
2001. The consolidated financial information presented herein reflects M&T and
all of its subsidiaries, which are referred to collectively as “the Company.”
M&T’s wholly owned bank subsidiaries are Manufacturers and Traders Trust
Company (“M&T Bank”) and M&T Bank, National Association (“M&T Bank, N.A.”).

M&T Bank, with total assets of $30.8 billion at December 31, 2001, is a
New York-chartered commercial bank with 469 banking offices in New York State,
Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia, and an office in the Cayman Islands.
M&T Bank and its subsidiaries offer a broad range of financial services to a
diverse base of consumers, businesses, professional clients, governmental
entities and financial institutions located in its markets. Lending is largely
focused on consumers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, and on small
and medium size businesses based in those areas. Certain lending activities
are also conducted in other states through various subsidiaries. M&T Bank’s
subsidiaries include: M&T Credit Corporation, a consumer lending and
commercial leasing and lending company; M&T Financial Corporation, a commercial
leasing company; M&T Mortgage Corporation, a residential mortgage banking
company; M&T Real Estate, Inc., a commercial mortgage lender; M&T Securities,
Inc., a broker/dealer; Highland Lease Corporation, a consumer leasing company;
and Matthews, Bartlett & Dedecker, Inc., an insurance agency.

M&T Bank, N.A., with total assets of $810 million at December 31, 2001, is
a national bank with an office in Oakfield, New York. M&T Bank, N.A. offers
selected deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis, largely through
telephone and direct mail marketing techniques. Insurance products are offered
by M&T Bank, N.A. through banking offices of M&T Bank.

On February 9, 2001, M&T acquired Premier National Bancorp, Inc.
(“Premier”), a bank holding company headquartered in Lagrangeville, New York.
Premier National Bank, Premier’s bank subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank on
that date. Premier National Bank operated 34 banking offices in the mid-Hudson
Valley region of New York State. As of the merger date, assets acquired totaled
approximately $1.8 billion, including approximately $1.0 billion of loans and
leases, and liabilities assumed were approximately $1.5 billion, including
approximately $1.4 billion of deposits. The acquisition has been accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting and,

-24-


accordingly, the operations acquired from Premier have been included in M&T’s
financial results subsequent to the acquisition date. Premier’s stockholders
received $171 million in cash and 2,440,812 shares of M&T common stock in
exchange for the Premier shares outstanding at the time of the acquisition. In
connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $178
million of goodwill and $32 million of core deposit intangible.

On October 6, 2000, M&T completed the acquisition of Keystone Financial,
Inc. (“Keystone”), a bank holding company headquartered in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania. Keystone Financial Bank, N.A., Keystone’s bank subsidiary, was
merged into M&T Bank on that date. Keystone Financial Bank, N.A. operated
banking offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia. The acquisition
has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and,
accordingly, the operations acquired from Keystone have been included in M&T’s
financial results since the acquisition date. Keystone’s stockholders received
$375 million in cash and 15,900,292 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for
the Keystone shares outstanding at the time of acquisition. The Company
recorded approximately $475 million of goodwill and $121 million of core
deposit intangible as a result of the Keystone acquisition. Following the
completion of an actuarial review and merger of the pension and other
post-retirement benefits plans of M&T and Keystone, in 2001 the Company
adjusted the net prepaid benefit cost obtained in the acquisition of Keystone.
The effect of such adjustment was to increase net prepaid benefit costs by
approximately $28 million and, after applicable tax effect, to decrease
goodwill by approximately $18 million. Reflecting such adjustments, the
accompanying table provides a summary of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed by the Company on October 6, 2000 in the Keystone transaction.

In connection with the acquisitions described above, the Company incurred
nonrecurring expenses related to systems conversions and other costs of
integrating and conforming the acquired operations with and into the operations
of M&T Bank. Nonrecurring expenses associated with the Premier and Keystone
acquisitions totaled approximately $8 million ($5 million after-tax) and $26
million ($16 million after-tax) during the years ended December 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively. Such expenses consisted largely of expenses for
professional services and other temporary help fees associated with the
conversion of systems and/or integration of operations; recruiting and other
incentive compensation; initial marketing and promotion expenses designed to
introduce M&T Bank to customers; travel; and printing, supplies and other costs
of commencing operations in new markets and offices. In accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, included in the determination of
goodwill associated with the Premier merger were charges totaling $4 million,
net of applicable income taxes, for severance of former Premier

-25-


employees; legal and other professional fees; and termination of Premier
contracts for data processing and other services. As of December 31, 2001,
unpaid Premier merger-related expenses and charges included in the
determination of goodwill were insignificant. The resolution of any
preacquisition contingencies is not expected to have a material impact on the
allocation of the purchase price or the amount of goodwill recorded as part of
the Premier acquisition. Included in the determination of goodwill associated
with the Keystone merger were charges totaling $30 million, net of applicable
income taxes, for severance of former Keystone employees; investment banking,
legal and other professional fees; and termination of Keystone contracts for
data processing and other services. As of December 31, 2001, unpaid Keystone
merger-related expenses and charges included in the determination of goodwill
were insignificant. Unpaid Keystone merger-related expenses and goodwill
charges were $2 million and $7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2000.

In anticipation of the Keystone and Premier acquisitions, M&T Bank issued
$500 million of 8% fixed rate subordinated capital notes on October 5, 2000.
The subordinated notes are included in total regulatory capital of M&T and M&T
Bank. The notes pay interest semi-annually on April 1 and October 1, and will
mature on October 1, 2010. In addition to providing regulatory capital, the
proceeds were used to fund the cash portions of the Keystone and Premier merger
consideration.

In 1999, the Company completed acquisitions of FNB Rochester Corp.
(“FNB”), which through a subsidiary operated 17 banking offices in western and
central New York State, and 29 upstate New York banking offices from The Chase
Manhattan Bank (“Chase”). Loans and leases acquired in the merger with FNB
totaled $393 million on the June 1, 1999 acquisition date and deposit
liabilities assumed were $511 million. At the time of the September 1999
acquisition of the 29 banking offices from Chase, such offices had $634 million
of deposits and $44 million of loans. Chase also transferred trust accounts
associated with customers of the acquired offices to the Company. Such
accounts had transfer-date balances of approximately $433 million. Such
balances represent customer assets in investment management and custody
accounts and, accordingly, are not recorded in the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet.

In connection with the acquisitions described in the preceding paragraph,
the Company recorded $116 million of goodwill and $36 million of core deposit
intangible and incurred $5 million ($3 million after-tax) of nonrecurring
expenses similar in nature to those previously described as having been
incurred in connection with the Keystone and Premier mergers.

Overview

M&T reported net income in 2001 of $378 million or $3.82 of diluted earnings
per common share, increases of 32% and 11%, respectively, from $286 million or
$3.44 per diluted share in 2000. Basic earnings per common share rose 11% to
$3.95 in 2001 from $3.55 in 2000. Net income in 1999 totaled $266 million,
while diluted and basic earnings per share were $3.28 and $3.41, respectively.
The after-tax impact of nonrecurring expenses associated with the previously
described acquisitions was $5 million ($8 million pre-tax) or $.05 of diluted
and basic earnings per share in 2001, $16 million ($26 million pre-tax) or $.20
of diluted and basic earnings per share in 2000, and $3 million ($5 million
pre-tax) or $.03 of diluted earnings per share and $.04 of basic earnings per
share in 1999.

Net income represented a return on average assets in 2001 of 1.23%,
compared with 1.21% in 2000 and 1.26% in 1999. The return on average common
stockholders’ equity was 12.78% in 2001, 14.07% in 2000 and 15.30% in 1999.

-26-


Excluding the impact of merger-related expenses, the rates of return on average
assets and average common equity in 2001 were 1.24% and 12.94%, respectively,
compared with 1.28% and 14.88%, respectively, in 2000 and 1.28% and 15.47%,
respectively, in 1999.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose 36% to $1.176 billion in 2001
from $865 million in 2000, largely due to a $6.3 billion or 29% increase in
average earning assets to $27.8 billion in 2001 from $21.5 billion in 2000 and
a widening of the Company’s net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net
interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. Including
the impact of the loans obtained at the time of the acquisitions of Keystone
and Premier, average loans and leases increased $5.9 billion or 32%, to $24.4
billion in 2001 from $18.5 billion in 2000. Net interest margin improved by 21
basis points (hundredths of one percent) to 4.23% in 2001 from 4.02% a year
earlier, due largely to the declining interest rate environment throughout
2001. A 13% increase in average earning assets in 2000 was the most
significant factor contributing to the rise in that year’s net interest income
from $767 million in 1999. The increase in average earning assets resulted
primarily from growth in average loans and leases. Despite the impact of the
securitization of approximately $1.0 billion of residential mortgage loans
during the second quarter of 2000, average loans and leases during 2000 rose
$2.1 billion or 13% from $16.4 billion in 1999. Excluding the impact of the
securitization, average loans and leases grew approximately $2.7 billion in
2000, approximately half of which was due to new originations, net of
repayments. The remaining increase was largely the result of the $4.8 billion
of loans and leases obtained in the October 2000 acquisition of Keystone.

Reflecting the weakened economy, nationally and in the markets directly
served by the Company, the provision for credit losses increased to $104
million in 2001 from $38 million in 2000 and $45 million in 1999. Net
charge-offs totaled $75 million in 2001, up significantly from $29 million in
2000 and $40 million in 1999. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans
and leases outstanding rose to .31% in 2001 from .16% and .25% in 2000 and
1999, respectively.

On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” as amended. SFAS No. 133 established accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. It requires
that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the
balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain
conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge
of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability
or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable
cash flows of a forecasted transaction or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency
exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, an unrecognized firm
commitment, an available for sale security, or a foreign currency denominated
forecasted transaction.

Pursuant to SFAS No. 133, the accounting for changes in the fair value of
a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting
designation. An entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to
establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use for assessing
the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for
determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge. Those methods must be
consistent with the entity’s approach to managing risk.

The January 1, 2001 transition adjustment prescribed by SFAS No. 133 was
not material to the Company’s consolidated financial position or its results of
operations. As a result of adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 133, hedged
residential real estate loans held for sale, commitments to

-27-


originate loans for sale, and commitments to sell loans are now generally
recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair market value,
rather than at the lower of aggregate cost or fair market value, which was the
Company’s policy prior to January 1, 2001. As a result of recording such items
at estimated fair market value, the Company recognized approximately $8 million
of additional mortgage banking revenues in 2001. If not for the required
adoption of SFAS No. 133, such revenues would have generally been recognized in
2002 as the residential mortgage loans to which they related were sold. The
impact on the Company’s results of operations resulting from the adoption of
SFAS No. 133 as related to the Company’s use of interest rate swaps to manage
interest rate risk associated with other earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities was not significant.

Noninterest income totaled $477 million in 2001, 47% above the $325
million in 2000. Noninterest income was $282 million in 1999. Approximately
55% of the increase from 2000 to 2001 was attributable to revenues related to
operations in market areas associated with the Keystone and Premier
acquisitions. Growth in mortgage banking revenues, including the impact of
adopting SFAS No. 133 described in the preceding paragraph, and higher service
charges on deposit accounts also contributed to the increase in noninterest
income. Contributing to the higher noninterest income in 2000 as compared with
1999 were increases in service charges on deposit accounts, income from leasing
activities and brokerage services income, partially offset by lower mortgage
banking revenues and losses from sales of bank investment securities.
Approximately 40% of the increase in 2000’s noninterest income from 1999 was
attributable to revenues related to operations and/or market areas associated
with the Keystone acquisition.

Noninterest operating expenses, which exclude amortization of goodwill and
core deposit intangible and nonrecurring merger-related expenses, were $819
million in 2001, 37% higher than $599 million in 2000. Nonrecurring
merger-related expenses excluded from noninterest operating expenses were
$8 million and $26 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Charges for
goodwill and core deposit intangible amortization excluded from noninterest
operating expenses were $69 million and $53 million, respectively, in 2001 and
$44 million and $26 million, respectively, in 2000. Expenses related to the
acquired operations of Keystone and Premier significantly contributed to the
higher operating expense levels in 2001 compared with 2000. Also contributing
to such higher expense levels were increased expenses for salaries and employee
benefits, including incentive-based compensation arrangements, advertising,
professional and other services, and amortization of capitalized servicing
rights. Noninterest operating expenses were 14% higher in 2000 than 1999’s
total of $525 million. Excluded from M&T’s operating expenses in 1999 were $5
million of nonrecurring merger-related expenses, $36 million of amortization of
goodwill and $14 million of amortization of core deposit intangible. Higher
salaries and employee benefits expenses, including merit salary increases,
incentive-based compensation arrangements, and increased staffing levels as a
result of acquisitions in 2000 and 1999, contributed to 2000’s increase in
noninterest operating expenses.

The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum
of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income measures how
much of a company’s revenue is consumed by operating expenses. The Company’s
efficiency ratio, calculated using the operating expense totals noted above and
excluding gains or losses from sales of bank investment securities from
noninterest income, was 49.6% in 2001, improved from 50.2% in 2000 and 50.1% in
1999.

Cash Operating Results

M&T has accounted for substantially all of its business combinations using the
purchase method of accounting, unlike many other banking companies. As a
result, the Company had recorded intangible assets consisting predominately of
goodwill and core deposit intangible totaling $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and
$648 million at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Included in
such intangible assets at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was goodwill of $1.1
billion, $1.0 billion and $572 million, respectively. Charges for amortization
of goodwill and core deposit intangible, after tax effect, were $66 million
($.67 per diluted share) and $33 million ($.33 per diluted share),
respectively, during 2001. Comparable after-tax amortization charges in 2000
were $40 million ($.48 per diluted share) for goodwill and $16 million ($.19
per diluted share) for core deposit intangible, and in 1999 were $34 million
($.43 per diluted share) for goodwill and $8 million ($.10 per diluted share)
for core deposit intangible. Since the amortization of these acquired
intangible assets does not result in a cash expense, M&T believes that
supplemental reporting of its operating results on a “cash,” or “tangible,”
basis (which excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of goodwill and core
deposit intangible and the related asset balances) represents a relevant
measure of financial performance. The supplemental cash basis data presented
herein do not exclude the effect of other non-cash operating expenses such as
depreciation, provision for credit losses, or deferred income taxes associated
with the results of operations. Unless noted otherwise, cash basis data do,
however, exclude the after-tax impact of nonrecurring merger-related expenses
associated with acquisitions.

Cash net income increased 34% to $482 million in 2001 from $359 million in
2000. Diluted and basic cash earnings per share in 2001 both increased by 13%
to $4.87 and $5.04, respectively, from $4.31 and $4.45, respectively, in 2000.
In 1999, cash net income totaled $311 million, while diluted and basic cash
earnings per share were $3.84 and $3.99, respectively.

Expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets, cash net income
was 1.63% in 2001, compared with 1.56% in 2000 and 1.52% in 1999. Cash return
on average tangible common equity was 28.50% in 2001, compared with 27.65% and
26.71% in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Including the effect of merger-related
expenses, the cash return on average tangible assets for 2001, 2000 and 1999
was 1.62%, 1.49% and 1.50%, respectively, and the cash return on average
tangible common equity was 28.22%, 26.38% and 26.45%, respectively.

As further discussed under the heading “Recently Issued Accounting
Standards,” effective January 1, 2002 the Company adopted SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” As a result, goodwill associated with
corporate acquisitions will no longer be amortized, but rather it will be
tested for impairment no less frequently than annually. However, goodwill
associated with most branch acquisitions, core deposit intangibles and other
intangible assets will continue to be amortized subsequent to January 1, 2002.
Amortization expense relating to such assets is expected to approximate $51
million ($33 million after-tax) in 2002.

Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities

Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose 36% to $1.176 billion in 2001 from
$865 million in 2000, largely the result of growth in average earning assets
and a widening of the Company’s net interest margin. 2000’s taxable-equivalent
net interest income represented a 13% increase from $767 million in 1999. That
increase was also largely due to higher balances of average earning assets.
The Company’s average earning assets were $27.8 billion,
$21.5 billion and $19.1 billion in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The

-29-


growth in such assets in 2001 and 2000 was largely attributable to higher
average loans and leases outstanding, which totaled $24.4 billion in 2001,
up 32% from $18.5 billion in 2000 and 49% higher than $16.4 billion in 1999.
The higher levels of loans and leases in 2001 reflect the impact of loans
obtained in the Keystone and Premier mergers as well as growth from new loan
originations, net of customer repayments. On the October 6, 2000 acquisition
date, Keystone’s loans totaled $4.8 billion and included approximately $1.2
billion of commercial loans, $1.3 billion of commercial real estate loans, $1.1
billion of residential real estate loans and $1.2 billion of consumer loans and
leases. Loans obtained in the Premier acquisition on February 9, 2001 totaled
$994 million and included $127 million of commercial loans, $317 million of
commercial real estate loans, $356 million of residential real estate loans,
and $194 million of consumer loans. Approximately one-fourth of the increase
in average loans and leases during 2001 was attributable to net loan
origination activities. Of such increase, approximately $450 million was
attributable to higher average balances of residential mortgage loans held for
sale. Growth in average loans and leases in 2000 resulting from origination
and acquisition activities was partially offset by the impact of the
securitization of approximately $1.0 billion of residential mortgage loans
during 2000’s second quarter. The resulting mortgage-backed securities, which
are fully guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association, are included
in the Company’s portfolio of available-for-sale investment securities.
Excluding the impact of the securitization, average loans and leases grew by
approximately $2.7 billion, or 17%, from 1999 to 2000. Approximately half of
such growth was attributable to new originations, net of the impact of
repayments. The remaining increase was largely the result of the $4.8 billion
of loans obtained in the October 2000 acquisition of Keystone. The
accompanying table 4 summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in 2001
and percentage changes in the major components of the portfolio over the past
two years.

Loans secured by real estate, including outstanding balances of home
equity lines of credit which the Company classifies as consumer loans,
represented approximately 64% of the loan and lease portfolio during 2001,
compared with 65% in 2000 and 66% in 1999. At December 31, 2001, the Company
held approximately $9.4 billion of commercial real estate loans, $5.4 billion
of consumer real estate mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family
residential properties and $1.5 billion of outstanding balances of home equity
lines of credit, compared with $8.7 billion, $4.8 billion and $1.1 billion,
respectively, at December 31, 2000.

Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company are largely secured
by properties in the New York City metropolitan area, including areas in
neighboring states generally considered to be within commuting distance of New
York City, and other areas of New York State where the Company operates,
including the Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany, Hudson Valley and Southern
Tier regions. Commercial real estate loans are also originated through the
Company’s offices in central Pennsylvania, Maryland, Oregon and West Virginia.
Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company include fixed-rate
instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining unpaid
principal at maturity, in many cases five years after origination. For
borrowers in good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the
customer for an additional five years at the then-current market rate of
interest. In response to customer needs, in recent years the Company has also
originated fixed-rate commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater
than five years, generally having original maturity terms of approximately ten
years. The Company also originates adjustable-rate commercial real estate
loans, which represented approximately 38% of the commercial real estate loan
portfolio as of December 31, 2001. The accompanying table 6 presents
commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of collateral and size of
the loans outstanding at December 31, 2001. Of the $3.9 billion of commercial
real estate loans in the New York

-30-


City metropolitan area, approximately 41% were secured by multifamily
residential properties, 23% by retail space and 14% by office space. The
Company’s experience has been that office space and retail properties tend to
demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and
changing economic conditions than do multifamily residential properties.
Approximately 49% of the aggregate dollar amount of New York City-area loans
were for $5 million or less, while loans of more than $10 million made up
approximately 34% of the total. Less than 7% of loans secured by commercial
real estate properties in the New York City metropolitan area at December 31,
2001 were secured by properties located in lower Manhattan. The Company did
not experience any significant losses or delinquencies in its loan portfolios
as a direct result of the events of September 11, 2001. Commercial real estate
loans secured by properties elsewhere in New York State and in Pennsylvania
tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant
amount of lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or
business. Approximately 76% of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial real
estate loans in New York State secured by properties located outside of the
metropolitan New York City area were for $5 million or less, while
approximately 83% of the outstanding balance of commercial real estate loans in
Pennsylvania were for $5 million or less.

Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of New
York State and Pennsylvania, and outside of areas of neighboring states
considered to be part of the New York City metropolitan area, comprised 10% of
total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2001.

Of the $539 million of commercial construction loans presented in the
accompanying table, $289 million represent loans for which the Company has also
committed to provide permanent financing. Commercial construction loans
represented 2% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2001.

Real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties
totaled $5.4 billion at December 31, 2001, including approximately 48% secured
by properties located in New York State and 24% secured by properties located
in Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2001, $1.0 billion of residential real estate
loans were held for sale by M&T Mortgage Corporation, the Company’s residential
mortgage banking subsidiary, compared with $525 million at December 31, 2000.
Loans to finance the construction of one-to-four family residential properties
totaled $491 million at December 31, 2001, or approximately 2% of total loans
and leases.

Consumer loans and leases represented approximately 19% of the average
loan portfolio during 2001, up from 18% during 2000 and 1999. Automobile loans
and leases and outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit represent
the largest components of the consumer loan portfolio. Approximately 83% of
home equity lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2001 were secured by
properties in New York State and 14% were secured by properties in
Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2001, 33% and 43% of the automobile loan and
lease portfolio were to customers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania,
respectively. Automobile loans and leases are generally originated through
dealers, however, all applications submitted through dealers are subject to the
Company’s normal underwriting and loan approval procedures. Automobile loans
and leases represented approximately 9% of the Company’s average loan portfolio
during 2001, while no other consumer loan product represented more than 6%.
The average outstanding balance of automobile leases was approximately $587
million in 2001, and $375 million in both 2000 and 1999. Automobile leases
acquired in the Keystone transaction totaled $231 million on October 6, 2000.

The investment securities portfolio averaged $3.3 billion in 2001, up from
$2.8 billion in 2000 and $2.1 billion in 1999. Investment securities obtained
in the acquisition of Keystone added approximately $359 and $185

-31-


million to the average balances in 2001 and 2000, respectively, while
investment securities obtained in the Premier acquisition added approximately
$300 million to the average balance in 2001. The remaining increase in 2000
from 1999 was generally the result of the previously described securitization
of approximately $1.0 billion of residential mortgage loans during the second
quarter of 2000. The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of
residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations,
commercial real estate mortgage-backed securities, and shorter-term U.S.
Treasury notes. The Company has also invested in debt securities issued by
municipalities and debt and preferred equity securities issued by
government-sponsored agencies and certain financial institutions. When
purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its overall
interest-rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative
to risks assumed, including prepayments. In managing its investment securities
portfolio, the Company occasionally sells investment securities as a result of
changes in interest rates and spreads, actual or anticipated prepayments, or
credit risk associated with a particular security, or following completion of a
business combination. Investment securities obtained in the Keystone
transaction totaled approximately $1.2 billion on October 6, 2000 and in the
Premier transaction totaled $453 million on February 9, 2001. Money-market
assets, which are comprised of interest-earning deposits at banks,
interest-earning trading account assets, Federal funds sold and agreements to
resell securities, averaged $80 million in 2001, compared with $239 million in
2000 and $517 million in 1999.
The size of the investment securities and money-market assets portfolios are
influenced by such factors as demand for loans, which generally yield more than
investment securities, ongoing repayments, the level of deposits, and
management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios.

The most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits,
which consist of noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction
accounts, savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under
$100,000. The Company’s branch network is its principal source of core
deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of
comparable maturities. Certificates of deposit under $100,000 generated on a
nationwide basis by M&T Bank, N.A. are also included in core deposits. Average
core deposits were $17.6 billion in 2001, up from $13.6 billion in 2000 and
$11.9 billion in 1999. The increase in average core deposits in 2001 was
largely due to the full-year impact of the $4.7 billion of core deposits
obtained on October 6, 2000 in connection with the Keystone transaction, as
well as the $1.2 billion of core deposits obtained on February 9, 2001 in
connection with the Premier acquisition. The Company experienced a shift in
the composition of core deposits throughout 2001, largely as a result of the
lower interest rate environment. Reflecting a change in customer saving
trends, average savings deposits rose to $8.0 billion during the fourth quarter
of 2001 from $6.8 billion in the year’s first quarter. In contrast, average
time deposits under $100,000 decreased to $5.3 billion in the final 2001
quarter from $6.8 billion in the first quarter of 2001. Average core deposits
of M&T Bank, N.A. were $521 million in 2001, $643 million in 2000 and $429
million in 1999. Funding provided by core deposits totaled 63% of average
earning assets in 2001 and 2000, compared with 62% in 1999. The accompanying 7
table summarizes average core deposits in 2001 and percentage changes in the
components of such deposits over the past two years.

The Company also obtains funding through domestic time deposits of
$100,000 or more, deposits originated through the Company’s offshore branch
office, and brokered certificates of deposit. Domestic time deposits over
$100,000, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, averaged $2.0 billion in
2001, compared with $1.8 billion in 2000 and $1.6 billion in 1999. Offshore
branch deposits, comprised primarily of accounts with balances of $100,000 or
more, averaged $327 million in 2001, compared with $250 million

-32-


and $254 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Brokered deposits, which have
been used as an alternative to short-term borrowings, averaged $794 million in
2001, $696 million in 2000 and $1.1 billion in 1999, and totaled $1.8 billion
at December 31, 2001. The weighted-average remaining term to maturity of
brokered deposits at December 31, 2001 was .5 years. Certain of the brokered
deposits have provisions that allow early redemption. In connection with the
Company’s management of interest rate risk, interest rate swaps have been
entered into under which the Company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays
a variable rate and that have notional amounts and terms similar to the amounts
and terms of $334 million of brokered deposits. Additional amounts of brokered
deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions and the
cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time.

The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers, the
Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh
(together, the “FHLB”), and others as sources of funding. Short-term
borrowings averaged $3.3 billion in 2001, $2.7 billion in 2000 and $2.1 billion
in 1999. Amounts borrowed from the FHLB and included in short-term borrowings
averaged $814 million in 2001, $574 million in 2000 and $356 million in 1999.
The average balance of long-term borrowings was $3.5 billion in 2001, $2.1
billion in 2000 and $1.7 billion in 1999. Included in average long-term
borrowings were amounts borrowed from the FHLB of $2.4 billion in 2001, $1.4
billion in 2000 and $1.2 billion in 1999 and subordinated capital notes issued
by M&T Bank of $674 million in 2001, $295 million in 2000 and $175 million in
1999. As previously noted, M&T Bank issued $500 million of 8% subordinated
capital notes on October 5, 2000 in anticipation of the Keystone and Premier
acquisitions. Trust preferred securities with a carrying value of $318 million
that were issued in 1997 are also included in average long-term borrowings.
Information regarding trust preferred securities, as well as information
regarding contractual maturities of long-term borrowings, is provided in note 8
of Notes to Financial Statements. Certain interest rate swap agreements have
been entered into by the Company as part of its management of interest rate
risk relating to long-term FHLB borrowings. Further information on such
interest rate swaps is provided in note 16 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Changes in the composition of the Company’s earning assets and
interest-bearing liabilities, as described herein, as well as changes in
interest rates and spreads, can impact net interest income. Throughout 2001,
the Federal Reserve took numerous actions to lower the level of interest rates
by reducing its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate by 475 basis
points. In general, such actions resulted in a greater and more rapid decline
in short-term rates as compared with the decline in longer-term rates. The
decline in short-term interest rates and the general steepening of the yield
curve had a positive effect on the Company’s net interest spread, or the
difference between the taxable-equivalent yield on earning assets and the rate
paid on interest-bearing liabilities, in 2001. The yield on the Company’s
earning assets decreased 68 basis points to 7.62% in 2001 from 8.30% in 2000,
while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities in 2001 was 3.91%, down 100
basis points from 4.91% in 2000. The impact of the more rapid repricing of
interest-bearing liabilities than earning assets combined with the magnitude of
the interest rate reductions led to a 32 basis point increase in the Company’s
net interest spread, from 3.39% in 2000 to 3.71% in 2001. In 1999, the net
interest spread was 3.48%, the yield on earning assets was 7.79% and the rate
paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 4.31%. The yield on earning assets
increased 51 basis points in 2000 from 7.79% in 1999 and the rate paid on
interest-bearing liabilities increased even further, rising 60 basis points
from 4.31% in 1999. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve in the second half of
1999 and the first five months of 2000 contributed to the rising level of
interest rates in 2000.

Net interest-free funds consist largely of noninterest-bearing demand
deposits and stockholders’ equity, partially offset by bank owned life
insurance and non-earning assets that include goodwill and core deposit
intangible. Average net interest-free funds totaled $3.7 billion in 2001, $2.8
billion in 2000 and $2.4 billion in 1999. The rise in average net
interest-free funds in 2001 as compared with 2000 was due largely to increases
in noninterest-bearing deposits and stockholders’ equity. Net interest-free
funds contributed .52% to net interest margin in 2001, compared with .63% in
2000 and .54% in 1999. The decline in the contribution to net interest margin
ascribed to net interest-free funds in 2001 from 2000 resulted largely from the
impact of lower interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities used to value
such contribution. The increase in the contribution in 2000 (as compared with
1999) resulted from the impact of that year’s higher interest rates on
interest-bearing liabilities and a $390 million increase in the average balance
of net interest-free funds, largely comprised of higher average balances in
noninterest-bearing deposits and retained earnings. Goodwill and core deposit
intangible assets averaged $1.3 billion in 2001, $766 million in 2000 and $594
million in 1999, while the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance
averaged $573 million in 2001, $458 million in 2000 and $379 million in 1999.
Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not
included in interest income, but rather are recorded in “other revenues from
operations.”

Future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in
the composition of the Company’s portfolios of earning assets and
interest-bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads, could
adversely impact the Company’s net interest margin and net interest income.
Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates
and spreads by projecting net interest income under several different interest
rate scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company utilizes interest
rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain
portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are generally
reflected in either the yields earned on assets or, as appropriate, the rates
paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate
swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes as of December
31, 2001 was approximately $576 million. In general, under the terms of these
swaps, the Company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount
of the swaps at fixed rates of interest and makes payments at variable rates.
However, under the terms of $117 million of swaps, the Company pays a fixed
rate of interest and receives a variable rate. In anticipation of the
previously noted issuance of $500 million of fixed-rate subordinated notes in
October 2000, the Company terminated certain interest rate swap agreements
during September 2000, including forward-starting swaps, with an aggregate
notional amount of approximately $421 million. Under the terms of the
terminated swaps, the Company would have made fixed-rate payments and received
variable-rate payments. The termination of these swaps, which had been entered
into to hedge interest rate risk associated with fixed-rate commercial real
estate loans, resulted in a net deferred gain of approximately $15.5 million
which is being recognized in income over the designated hedge period of the
swaps. The impact on the Company’s results of operations in 2001 and 2000 from
amortizing the net deferred gain was not significant. The amounts of net
deferred gain to be recognized in future years is included in note 16 of Notes
to Financial Statements. As previously discussed, the Company adopted SFAS No.
133 on January 1, 2001. As a result, $476 million of the Company’s interest
rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2001 had been designated as fair value
hedges and $100 million had been designated as cash flow hedges. In a fair
value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the interest rate swap) and
changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in
current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair

-34-


value of the interest rate swaps and the hedged items represents hedge
ineffectiveness and is recorded in “other revenues from operations” in the
Company’s consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, the
effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as
a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into
earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective
portion of the gain or loss is reported in “other revenues from operations”
immediately. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness of both fair value and cash
flow hedges recognized in 2001 was not material to the Company’s results of
operations. The estimated fair value of interest rate swaps designated as fair
value hedges was a gain of approximately $5 million at December 31, 2001. The
fair value of such swaps was substantially offset by unrealized losses on the
fair value of the hedged items. The estimated fair value of the interest rate
swaps designated as cash flow hedges was a loss of approximately $461 thousand
at December 31, 2001. Net of applicable income taxes, such loss was
approximately $298 thousand and has been included in “accumulated other
comprehensive income, net” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The
changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps and the hedged items
result from the effects of changing interest rates. Prior to the adoption of
SFAS No. 133, the fair value of interest rate swaps entered into for interest
rate risk management purposes was not recorded in the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet. The unrecognized fair value associated with such interest rate
swaps at December 31, 2000 and 1999 were pre-tax gains of approximately $1
million and $25 million, respectively. The average notional amounts of
interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes,
the related effect on net interest income and margin, and the weighted-average
rate paid or received on those swaps are presented in the accompanying table 8.

Provision For Credit Losses

A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the Company’s allowance for
credit losses to a level that is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan
and lease portfolio. The provision for credit losses was $104 million in 2001,
up from $38 million in 2000 and $45 million in 1999. Reflecting general
weakness in the U.S. economy and in markets directly served by the Company, net
loan charge-offs in 2001 were $75 million, significantly higher than $29
million in 2000 and $40 million in 1999. Net loan charge-offs as a percentage
of average loans outstanding increased to .31% in 2001 from .16% in
2000 and .25% in 1999. The Company did not experience any significant charge-offs or
delinquencies in its portfolio of commercial real estate loans secured by
properties in the New York City metropolitan area that were directly related to
the events of September 11, 2001

.

A summary of loan charge-offs, provision and
allowance for credit losses is presented in the accompanying table 9.

Nonperforming loans, consisting of nonaccrual and restructured loans,
totaled $190 million or .76% of loans and leases outstanding at December 31,
2001, compared with $111 million or .49% at December 31, 2000 and $72 million
or .41% at December 31, 1999. The higher level of nonperforming loans in 2001
reflects the weakened economy and its impact on the Company’s customers. The
recent year’s increase in nonperforming loans also reflects two larger-balance
commercial loans totaling $40 million at 2001’s year-end that were classified
as non-performing during the year. The increase in nonperforming loans at the
end of 2000 as compared with a year earlier reflects the impact of loans
obtained in the October 6, 2000 acquisition of Keystone. Nonperforming loans
obtained in such acquisition were $50 million at December 31, 2001 and $43
million at December 31, 2000. Nonperforming loans obtained in the February 9,
2001 acquisition of Premier were $7 million at December 31, 2001. No loans
were reported as nonperforming at December 31, 2001 as a direct result of the
events of September 11, 2001.

-35-


Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were $147 million or .58% of total
loans and leases at December 31, 2001, compared with $142 million or .62% at
December 31, 2000 and $31 million or .18% at December 31, 1999. In general,
such loans are either guaranteed by government agencies or well-secured by
collateral. The increases from 1999 resulted largely from the inclusion of
$108 million and $93 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of
one-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company and
repurchased from the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”). The
outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans are fully guaranteed by
government agencies. The loans were repurchased to reduce servicing costs
associated with the loans, including a requirement to advance to GNMA principal
and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors.

Several factors influence the Company’s credit loss experience, including
overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general,
and, due to the size of the Company’s commercial real estate loan portfolio,
real estate valuations, in particular. Commercial real estate valuations
include many assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective.
Commercial real estate values can be significantly affected over relatively
short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions,
interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and
other occupants of the real property.

Net charge-offs of commercial real estate loans in 2001 were $5 million.
During 2000 and 1999, the Company realized net recoveries of previously
charged-off commercial real estate loans of $383 thousand and $2 million,
respectively. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans totaled $39 million
at December 31, 2001, compared with $37 million and $13 million at December 31,
2000 and 1999, respectively. Commercial real estate loans obtained in the
Keystone acquisition that were classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2001
and 2000 were $20 million and $23 million, respectively. Similar loans
obtained in the Premier acquisition were $2 million at December 31, 2001.

During 2001, net charge-offs of commercial loans and leases totaled $32
million, compared with $6 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. The higher
level of charge-offs in 2001 compared with 2000 was mainly a function of 2001’s
economic downturn, while the higher level of charge-offs in 1999 compared with
2000 was largely the result of two commercial loans with partial charge-offs
aggregating $15 million. Reflecting the weakened economy and the two previously
noted loans totaling $40 million, nonperforming commercial loans and leases
totaled $85 million at December 31, 2001, up from $26 million and $21 million
at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Commercial loans acquired in the
Keystone acquisition that were classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2001
and 2000 were $10 million and $13 million, respectively. Similar loans
acquired in the Premier acquisition were $1 million at December 31, 2001.

Net charge-offs of residential real estate loans were $6 million in 2001,
compared with $5 million and $4 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Residential real estate loans classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2001
totaled $40 million, compared with $36 million and $26 million at December 31,
2000 and 1999, respectively. Residential real estate loans past due ninety
days or more and accruing interest totaled $135 million, $115 million and $14
million at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. As noted earlier,
the higher level of such loans in 2001 and 2000 as compared with 1999 resulted
largely from the inclusion at December 31, 2001 and 2000 of $108 million and
$93 million, respectively, of loans repurchased from GNMA. The repurchased
loans are fully guaranteed by government agencies. Residential real estate
loans obtained in the Keystone acquisition that were classified at December 31,
2001 as nonperforming and accruing loans past due

-36-


ninety days or more were $14 million and $12 million, respectively. Such loans
were $7 million and $8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2000. Similar
loans obtained in the Premier acquisition were $3 million and $2 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2001.

Net charge-offs of consumer loans and leases were $32 million in 2001,
representing .68% of average consumer loans and leases outstanding during the
year, compared with $19 million or .56% in 2000 and $22 million or .72% in
1999. Charge-offs of indirect automobile loans and leases represented the most
significant type of consumer loans charged off during the past three years.
Net indirect automobile loan and lease charge-offs during 2001 were $12
million, compared with $7 million in 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Nonperforming
consumer loans and leases totaled $26 million or .50% of outstanding consumer
loans at December 31, 2001, compared with $12 million or .29% at December 31,
2000 and $12 million or .37% at December 31, 1999. Accruing consumer loans and
leases past due 90 days or more were $5 million, $21 million and $16 million at
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. During the first quarter of
2001, the Company began classifying non-guaranteed consumer loans and leases
past due 90 days or more as nonaccrual. Previously, such loans accrued
interest until the loan balances were charged off. The change in
classification did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of
operations or its financial condition. Consumer loans and leases obtained in
the Keystone acquisition that were past due ninety days or more and accruing
interest were $1 million and $6 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Despite the existence of loan collateral in many cases,
management conservatively evaluated the collectability of delinquent consumer
loans and leases when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit
losses.

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which it believes is
adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the
balance sheet date. Management regularly assesses the adequacy of the
allowance by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio,
including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each
loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the
economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans
and the value of any collateral. Management cautiously evaluated the impact of
changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of
borrowers to meet repayment obligations when quantifying the Company’s exposure
to credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the Company’s allowance for such
losses as of each reporting date. In addition to the impact of loans obtained
in acquisitions and economic conditions in geographic areas entered through
acquisitions, factors considered by management when performing its assessment
included, but were not limited to: (i) the concentration of commercial real
estate loans in the Company’s loan portfolio, particularly the large
concentration of loans secured by properties in New York State, in general, and
in the New York City metropolitan area, in particular; (ii) the amount of
commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State
outside of the New York City metropolitan area that have historically
experienced significantly less economic growth than the vast majority of other
regions of the country; and (iii) significant growth in loans to individual
consumers. The level of the allowance for credit losses is adjusted based on
the results of management’s analysis.

In ascertaining the adequacy of the level of the allowance for credit
losses, the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits
and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases. The total
allowance for credit losses, therefore, includes both specific and inherent
base level loss components, as well as inherent unallocated loss components,
which are described in the following paragraphs.

-37-


The amount of
specific loss components in the loan and lease portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of all nonaccrual commercial and
commercial real estate loans. Specific loss components are also established
for certain classified commercial and commercial real estate loans greater than
$100,000 when it is determined that there is a differing risk of loss than
otherwise prescribed under the inherent base level loss component calculation.
Measurement of the specific loss components are typically based on expected
future cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the
borrower’s ability to pay. Impaired loans, as defined in SFAS No. 114,
“Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan,” as amended, are evaluated
for specific loss components. Except for consumer and residential mortgage
loans that are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated
collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based on
current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable
to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement
or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more.

The inherent base level loss components are generally determined by
applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and
management’s classification of such loans under the Company’s loan grading
system. The Company utilizes an extensive ten-point loan grading system which
is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers
are responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans based on
standards outlined in the Company’s Credit Policy. Internal loan grades are
also extensively monitored by the Company’s loan review department to ensure
consistency and strict adherence to the prescribed standards.

Loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component
computations exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are
maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss component factors that reflect the
Company’s loss estimate for each group of loans and leases. Items considered
in assigning loan grades and loss component factors include borrower-specific
information related to expected future cash flows and operating results,
collateral value, financial condition, payment status, and other factors;
levels of and trends in portfolio charge-offs and recoveries; levels of and
trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans; changes in the risk
profile of specific portfolios; trends in volume and terms of loans; national
and local economic conditions and trends; and observed trends and practices in
the banking industry.

The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss components
together comprise the total base level or “allocated” allowance for credit
losses. Such allocated portion of the allowance represents management’s
assessment of near-term charge-offs and losses existing in specific larger
balance loans that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other
loans that are not individually analyzed.

The inherent unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide
for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable. The inherent
unallocated allowance includes management’s subjective determination of amounts
necessary for such things as economic uncertainties; customer, industry and
geographic concentrations; and expansion into new products and market areas.
The unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable
losses that are not otherwise identifiable resulting from (i) comparatively
poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in many market
regions served by the Company, specifically New York State and central
Pennsylvania, that resulted in such regions not having experienced the same
degree of economic growth in previous years as experienced by much of the rest
of the country; (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding loan type, collateral
type and geographic location, in particular the large concentration of
commercial real estate loans secured by properties

-38-


in the New York City metropolitan area and other areas of New York State; (iii) the effect of expansion into new markets, including market areas entered
through acquisitions; (iv) the introduction of new loan product types,
including expansion of automobile loan and leasing activities in recent years;
and, (v) the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated
portion of the allowance.

Commercial real estate valuations include many assumptions and, as a
result, can be highly subjective. Commercial real estate values in the New
York City metropolitan area can be significantly affected over relatively short
periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions and
interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and
other occupants of the real property. The tragic events of September 11, 2001
further dampened the economic outlook for the United States, which is now
experiencing its first significant downturn in many years. The economies of
New York State, and New York City in particular, were specifically damaged by
the events of September 11. Economic growth outside of New York City,
especially in the industrialized upstate New York markets, continues to lag the
rest of the country. Furthermore, consistent with other regions of the
country, the unemployment rate in New York State grew significantly in 2001,
rising to 5.8% at year-end. Slower job growth, coupled with a declining
population base, has left the upstate New York region susceptible to credit
problems, particularly related to commercial customers. After a brief
stabilization in 2000, the central Pennsylvania economy again lagged the rest
of the United States in 2001. Employment in central Pennsylvania declined by
an average of .2% in 2001, compared with a .3% average increase nationally.

The accompanying table 10 presents a comparative allocation of the
allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year-ends. Amounts were
allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to
management at the time of each year-end assessment and using the methodology
described herein. Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan
category as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in management’s
estimate of specific loss components and inherent base level loss components.
Increased allocation percentages in the commercial loan and real estate loan
portfolios from December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2001 reflect weakened
economic conditions and an increased level of impaired and other classified
loans. As described in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements, loans
considered impaired pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 114 increased to
$140 million at December 31, 2001 from $81 million at December 31, 2000. The
allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses related to such loans was
$21 million and $12 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Increased allocation percentages in the commercial loan and real estate loan
portfolios from December 31, 1999 to 2000’s year end were largely attributable
to the acquired Keystone loans, which were conservatively assigned loan grades
based on facts known at the date of acquisition, pending more detailed analyses
of such loans by the Company’s loan review department. The increase in the
allowance allocated to consumer loans as a percentage of such loans at the end
of 2000 compared with December 31, 1999 was largely the result of a refinement
in loss estimation techniques relating to certain past due consumer loans. The
unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to
 .24% and .22% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Given the Company’s high concentration of commercial loans and commercial real
estate loans in New York State, including the upstate New York region, and
central Pennsylvania, and considering the other factors already discussed
herein, management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the
allowance for credit losses to be prudent and reasonable. Nevertheless, the
Company’s allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from
any loan or lease category.

Management believes that the aggregate allowance for credit losses at
December 31, 2001 was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the

-39-


portfolio as of that date. The allowance for credit
losses was $425 million or 1.69% of total loans at December 31, 2001, compared with $375 million or
1.65% at December 31, 2000 and $316 million or 1.82% at December 31, 1999. The
ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans at year-end 2001, 2000 and 1999
was 223%, 339% and 438%, respectively. The level of the allowance reflects
management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective
date. The increase in the allowance as a percentage of total loans at December
31, 2001 compared with the prior year-end also considered the weakened state of
the economy in 2001 as well as the other specific factors and conditions
described herein. The decline in the allowance as a percentage of total loans
at December 31, 2000 as compared with year-end 1999 also reflects management’s
evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each date, the relatively
favorable and/or stable economic environment for many commercial borrowers
during much of 2000, and other factors.

Commercial real estate loans secured by multifamily properties in the New
York City metropolitan area represented 7% of loans outstanding at December 31,
2001. The Company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific
industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2001. Furthermore,
the Company had no exposure to less developed countries and less than $2
million of outstanding foreign loans at December 31, 2001.

Assets acquired in settlement of defaulted loans totaled $16 million at
December 31, 2001, compared with $14 million a year earlier and $10 million at
the end of 1999.

Other Income

Other income grew 47% to $477 million in 2001 from $325 million in 2000.
Approximately 55% of the increase was attributable to the impact of the
Keystone and Premier acquisitions. Higher service charges on deposit accounts
and mortgage banking revenues also significantly contributed to the increase
from 2000. Other income totaled $282 million in 1999. 2000’s improvement
from 1999 resulted from increases in service charges on deposit accounts,
income from leasing activities, and brokerage services income, which were
partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenues and losses from sales of
bank investment securities. Approximately 40% of 2000’s increase was
attributable to revenues related to operations and/or market areas associated
with the Keystone acquisition.

Mortgage banking revenues, which consist of residential mortgage loan
servicing fees, gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan
servicing rights, and other residential mortgage loan-related fees, increased
63% to $103 million in 2001 from $63 million in 2000. The higher revenues in
2001 were due largely to the impact of lower interest rates that produced a
favorable environment for loan origination and refinancing activities by
consumers. Mortgage banking revenues in 2000 were 12% lower than $72 million
in 1999, largely the result of higher interest rates initiated by the Federal
Reserve in the second half of 1999 and first half of 2000 that negatively
impacted mortgage loan origination volume in 2000 and tighter pricing margins
that resulted from competitive pressures. Residential mortgage loans
originated for sale to other investors totaled approximately $5.0 billion in
2001, compared with $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion in 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The Company maintains residential mortgage loan origination
offices in New York State and Pennsylvania, as well as in Arizona, Colorado,
Idaho, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Utah and Washington. Realized
gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights and
unrealized gains from recording residential mortgage loans held for sale,
commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans at fair
market value aggregated $50 million in 2001. As noted earlier, the Company
adopted SFAS No. 133 as of January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133

-40-


requires that changes in the fair value of hedged residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate
residential mortgage loans for sale be recorded in the Company’s results of
operations. Such unrealized gains totaled approximately $8 million (pre-tax)
at December 31, 2001. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 133, residential
mortgage loans originated for sale and related commitments to sell loans and to
originate loans for sale were recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at the
lower of aggregate cost or fair market value. The previously noted favorable
interest rate environment for loan origination and refinancing activities was
the major contributor to the higher realized gains from sales of loans and loan
servicing rights in 2001. Realized gains from sales of residential mortgage
loans and loan servicing rights totaled $25 million in 2000 and $40 million in
1999. The tighter pricing margins and a lower volume of originations
contributed to the decrease in realized gains from 1999 to 2000. Revenues
from servicing residential mortgage loans for others were $44 million in 2001,
up from $32 million in 2000 and $27 million in 1999. Residential mortgage
loans serviced for others totaled $9.6 billion at December 31, 2001, $9.7
billion at December 31, 2000 and $7.2 billion at December 31, 1999.
Capitalized servicing assets were $107 million, $101 million and $61 million at
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase from December 31,
1999 to 2000 reflects the Keystone transaction, other purchased servicing
rights and the previously noted securitization of $1.0 billion of residential
mortgage loans which added approximately $15 million, $21 million and $14
million, respectively, to capitalized servicing assets in 2000. Additional
information about the Company’s capitalized servicing assets is presented in
note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Service charges on deposit accounts rose 56% to $144 million in 2001 from
$93 million in 2000, and 96% from $74 million in 1999. Fees for services
provided to customers in areas formerly served by Keystone and Premier
contributed approximately 60% of the increase from 2000 to 2001. Also
contributing to the higher level of service charges in 2001 were higher
balances in transactional deposit accounts which generate higher levels of
service charges than non-transactional accounts. The full-year effect in 2000
of a third quarter 1999 increase in fees and the impact of 1999 acquisitions
were significant factors contributing to the increase from 1999 to 2000.
Additionally, fees for services provided to customers in the areas formerly
served by Keystone contributed approximately 30% of the increase from 1999 to
2000.

Trust income increased 43% to $64 million in 2001 from $45 million in 2000
and 58% from $41 million in 1999. The increases were largely attributable to
the acquisition of Keystone. Brokerage services income, which includes
revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage
fees, totaled $39 million in 2001, up 20% from $33 million in 2000 and 45%
higher than $27 million in 1999. Trading account and foreign exchange activity
resulted in gains of $4 million in 2001, $2 million in 2000 and $315 thousand in
1999. In 1999, a loss of approximately $3 million was incurred as a result
of a counterparty defaulting on the settlement of outstanding foreign exchange
contracts. During both 2001 and 1999, the Company sold bank investment
securities resulting in gains of approximately $2 million. Losses from sales
of bank investment securities in 2000 reflect $3 million of net losses incurred
during the fourth quarter of 2000 from sales of investment securities
following the acquisition of Keystone and the combination of the investment
portfolios of Keystone and the Company. All sold securities had been previously
classified as available for sale for financial reporting purposes.

Other revenues from operations rose to $120 million in 2001 from $92
million in 2000 and $67 million in 1999. Approximately two-thirds of the
increase from 2000 to 2001 resulted from activities and/or market areas

-41-


associated with the Keystone and Premier
acquisitions, while approximately one-sixth of the increase from 1999 to 2000 resulted from operations related to
Keystone. Other revenues from operations included $35 million, $26 million and
$23 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, of tax-exempt income earned
from bank owned life insurance, which includes increases in cash surrender
value of life insurance policies and benefits received. Also included were
revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees of $13 million, $9 million
and $8 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Other items that
contributed to the increase in other revenues from operations in 2001 from 2000
and 1999 include higher letter of credit and other credit-related fees,
insurance-related revenues, and automated teller machine (“ATM”) usage fees.
Letter of credit and other credit-related fees were $24 million, $18 million
and $16 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Insurance-related
revenues totaled $13 million in 2001, compared with $7 million and $1 million
in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The impact of acquisitions was the leading
factor contributing to higher insurance-related revenues. The increases in ATM
usage fees, from $5 million in 1999 to $6 million in 2000 and to $11 million in
2001 were largely the result of the Keystone transaction. Income from leasing
activities in 2000 reflected a net gain of $9 million resulting from a
nonrecurring $13 million gain from the sale of equipment previously leased to a
commercial customer and an accrual of $4 million for losses associated with
selling automobiles and other vehicles leased to retail customers.

Other Expense

Operating expenses, which exclude amortization of goodwill and core deposit
intangible as well as nonrecurring merger-related expenses, were $819 million
in 2001, 37% higher than $599 million in 2000 and 56% higher than $525 million
in 1999. Expenses related to acquired operations significantly contributed to
the higher expense levels in 2001 and 2000. However, since the operating
systems and support operations related to Keystone, Premier and other
acquisitions completed in earlier years have been combined with those of the
Company, the Company’s operating expenses cannot be precisely divided between
or attributed directly to the acquired operations or to the Company as it
existed prior to each transaction. Components of other expense considered to
be nonoperating in nature and therefore excluded from the operating expense
totals noted above were amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible of
$122 million in 2001, $70 million in 2000 and $50 million in 1999; and
merger-related expenses of $8 million, $26 million and $5 million in 2001, 2000
and 1999, respectively.

Salaries and employee benefits expense was $435 million in 2001, an
increase of 32% from $329 million in 2000 and 53% higher than the $285 million
in 1999. Salaries and benefits related to acquired operations, merit salary
increases, and higher expenses for incentive compensation arrangements and
medical and other benefits were factors contributing to the increases in 2001
and 2000. The number of full-time equivalent employees was 8,803 at December
31, 2001, compared with 8,219 and 6,171 at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

Excluding the nonoperating expense items previously noted, nonpersonnel
expense totaled $384 million in 2001, 41% higher than $272 million in 2000 and
60% higher than $240 million in 1999. Higher expenses for equipment and
occupancy; advertising, promotion and travel; amortization of capitalized
servicing rights; and professional services and processing, all largely
attributable to the impact of acquisitions, were significant factors
contributing to the rise in nonpersonnel expenses from 2000 to 2001. Higher
equipment and occupancy expenses, largely related to acquired operations,
higher amortization of capitalized servicing rights and increased
foreclosure-related expenses contributed to the increase in expense from 1999
to 2000.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $206 million in 2001, compared with $160
million in 2000 and $153 million in 1999. The effective tax rates were 35.2% in
2001, 35.9% in 2000 and 36.5% in 1999. A reconciliation of income tax expense
to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to
pre-tax income is provided in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements.

International Activities

The Company’s net investment in international assets was $6 million and $7
million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Offshore deposits totaled
$778 million at December 31, 2001 and $245 million at December 31, 2000.

Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity

As a financial intermediary the Company is exposed to various risks, including
liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Company’s ability to ensure
that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy demands
for loans and deposit withdrawals, to fund operating costs, and to be used for
other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of
financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.

Historically, core deposits have been the most significant funding source
for the Company. Core deposits are generated from a large base of consumer,
corporate and institutional customers, which over the past several years has
become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of
the Company’s businesses. Nevertheless, in recent years the Company has faced
increased competition in offering services and products from a large array of
financial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds,
securities dealers and others. Core deposits financed 62% of the Company’s
earning assets at December 31, 2001, compared with 65% and 63% at December 31,
2000 and 1999, respectively.

The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits with
various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds
purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered
certificates of deposit, and borrowings from the FHLB and others. M&T Bank had
short-term and long-term credit facilities with the FHLB aggregating $5.0
billion at December 31, 2001. Outstanding borrowings under the FHLB credit
facilities totaled $3.1 billion at December 31, 2001 and $2.8 billion at
December 31, 2000. Such borrowings are secured by loans and investment
securities. M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. had available lines of credit with the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York at December 31, 2001 totaling approximately
$1.3 billion. The amounts of these lines are dependent upon the balance of
loans and securities pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings
outstanding under these lines at either December 31, 2001 or 2000. As
previously noted, M&T Bank issued $500 million of 8% fixed rate subordinated
capital notes in October 2000 that provided liquidity and facilitated the
acquisitions of Keystone and Premier. Informal and sometimes reciprocal
sources of funding are available to the Company through various arrangements
for unsecured short-term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other
financial institutions. Short-term federal funds borrowings aggregated $2.1
billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In
general, these borrowings were unsecured and matured within two business days.
Should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial
condition or its debt rating, or should the availability of

-43-


short-term funding become restricted, the Company’s ability to obtain funding
from these sources could be negatively impacted. Information regarding the
terms and maturities of all of the Company’s short-term and long-term
borrowings is provided in detail in note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements.
In addition to deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include
maturities of money-market assets and investment securities, repayments of
loans and investment securities, and cash generated from operations, such as
fees collected for services.

M&T’s primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, stockholder
dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of
dividends from its banking subsidiaries, which are subject to various
regulatory limitations. These historic sources of cash flow have been
augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred securities.
Information regarding trust preferred securities is included in note 8 of Notes
to Financial Statements. M&T also maintains a $30 million line of credit with
an unaffiliated commercial bank, of which there were no borrowings outstanding
at December 31, 2001. A similar $30 million line of credit that expired during
2001 was entirely available for borrowing at December 31, 2000.

Management closely monitors the Company’s liquidity position for
compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of
liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the normal course
of business. Management does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either
currently or in the long-term, which would cause a significant strain on
liquidity at either M&T or its subsidiary banks.

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices
and/or interest rates of the Company’s financial instruments. The primary
market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. The core banking
activities of lending and deposit-taking expose the Company to interest rate
risk, which occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times and
by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest
income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest
rates. The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability
of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios
using projected balances for earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and
derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Management’s philosophy toward
interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest
income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are
based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated
prepayments of mortgage-related assets and expected maturities of investment
securities, loans and deposits. Management supplements the modeling technique
described above with analyses of market values of the Company’s financial
instruments. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to
help manage exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2001, the
aggregate notional amount of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate
risk management purposes was approximately $576 million. Information about
interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is
included herein under “Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities” and
in note 16 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company’s Asset-Liability Committee, which includes members of senior
management, monitors interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a computer model
that considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit-gathering activities,
as well as statistically derived interrelationships in the magnitude and timing
of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing
interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent,
management has taken action, and intends to do so in the future, to mitigate
exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on- or

-44-


off-balance sheet financial instruments. Possible actions include, but are not
limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the
composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and modifying
or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or entering into
additional interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate risk management
financial instruments.

The accompanying table 14 as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 displays the
estimated impact on net interest income from non-trading financial instruments
resulting from changes in interest rates during the first modeling year.

Many assumptions were utilized by the Company to calculate the impact that
changes in interest rates may have on the Company’s net interest income. The
more significant assumptions related to the rate of prepayments of
mortgage-related assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial
instruments held for non-trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and
pricing, and deposit maturities. The Company also assumed gradual changes in
rates of 100 and 200 basis points up and down during a twelve-month period.
These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot
precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest
income. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to
timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market
conditions, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which
management may take to counter such changes.

In accordance with industry practice, the accompanying table 15 presents
cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a contractual basis
within the specified time frames, as adjusted for the impact of interest rate
swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes.
Management believes this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate
risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories
of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities equally nor, as assumed in
the table, on the contractual maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this
static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of
ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected changes in balance
sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities
the Company is likely to implement.

The Company engages in limited trading activities to meet the financial
needs of customers and to profit from perceived market opportunities. Trading
activities are conducted utilizing financial instruments that include forward
and futures contracts related to foreign currencies and mortgage-backed
securities, U.S. Treasury and other government securities, mortgage-backed
securities and interest rate contracts, such as swaps. The Company generally
mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading
activities by entering into offsetting trading positions. The amounts of gross
and net trading positions as well as the type of trading activities conducted
by the Company are subject to a well-defined series of potential loss exposure
limits established by the Asset-Liability Committee.

The notional amounts of interest rate and foreign currency and other
option and futures contracts entered into for trading account purposes totaled
$1.4 billion and $242 million, respectively, at December 31, 2001 and $769
million and $293 million, respectively, at December 31, 2000. The notional
amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance
sheet. However, the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading
activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of
all trading account assets and liabilities were $39 million and $27 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2001 and $37 million and $22 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2000.

-45-


Given the Company’s policies, limits and positions, management believes
that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk
associated with trading activities was not material as of December 31, 2001 and
2000. Additional information related to trading derivative contracts is
included in notes 16 and 17 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Capital

Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2001 was $2.9 billion and represented
9.35% of total assets, compared with $2.7 billion or 9.33% at December 31, 2000
and $1.8 billion or 8.02% at December 31, 1999. Stockholders’ equity per share
increased 8% to $31.33 at December 31, 2001 from $28.93 at December 31, 2000,
and was 35% higher than $23.24 at December 31, 1999. Tangible equity per
share, which excludes goodwill and core deposit intangible and applicable
deferred tax balances, was $18.34 at December 31, 2001, compared with $16.74 at
December 31, 2000 and $15.14 at December 31, 1999. The ratio of average total
stockholders’ equity to average total assets was 9.60%, 8.59% and 8.24% in
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

M&T issued shares of common stock in 2001, 2000 and 1999 to complete the
acquisitions of Premier, Keystone and FNB, respectively. On February 9, 2001,
M&T issued 2,440,812 shares of common stock to former holders of Premier common
stock and assumed employee stock options to purchase 224,734 shares of M&T
common stock, resulting in an addition to stockholders’ equity of $176 million.
To complete the acquisition of Keystone on October 6, 2000, M&T issued
15,900,292 shares of common stock to former holders of Keystone common stock and
assumed employee stock options to purchase 1,259,493 shares of M&T common
stock, resulting in an addition to stockholders’ equity of $664 million. On
June 1, 1999, M&T issued 1,225,160 shares (stated to give effect to a
ten-for-one stock split in 2000) of common stock to former holders of FNB
common stock resulting in an addition to stockholders’ equity of $59 million.

Included in stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2001 was accumulated
other comprehensive income, which reflected a gain of $23 million, or $.25 per
common share, for the net after-tax impact of unrealized gains on investment
securities classified as available for sale, compared with unrealized losses of
$432 thousand, or less than $.01 per share, at December 31, 2000, and $26
million, or $.34 per share, at December 31, 1999. Such unrealized gains or
losses are generally due to changes in interest rates and represent the
difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the estimated fair
value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as available for
sale. Accumulated other comprehensive income also reflects an unrealized loss
of $298 thousand, or less than $.01 per share, at December 31, 2001,
representing the after-tax effect of the estimated fair value of interest rate
swaps designated as cash flow hedges.

On September 19, 2000, M&T’s Board of Directors authorized a ten-for-one
split of M&T’s common stock in connection with the Keystone transaction. The
additional shares were payable to stockholders of record as of September 29 and
were distributed on October 5, 2000. The par value of each share of M&T’s
common stock was reduced from $5.00 to $.50 in conjunction with the stock
split. All per share data presented herein, including earnings, dividends and
the number of common shares authorized, issued, issuable or held in treasury,
have been adjusted to reflect the ten-for-one stock split. Also in connection
with the Keystone transaction, in the fourth quarter of 2000 M&T doubled the
quarterly cash dividend payable on its common stock to $.25 on each post-split
share.

-46-


Cash dividends paid in 2001 on M&T’s common stock were $96 million,
compared with $52 million and $35 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. As noted in the preceding paragraph, M&T increased its quarterly dividend on
common stock in the fourth quarter of 2000 to $.25 per share from $.125 per
share. In the third quarter of 1999, M&T’s quarterly common stock dividend
rate was increased to $.125 per share from $.10 per share. Dividends per
common share totaled $1.00 in 2001, up from $.625 in 2000 and $.45 in 1999.

M&T repurchased 4,396,303 shares of its common stock in 2001, 1,313,760
shares in 2000 and 1,678,330 shares in 1999, at a cost of $324 million, $55
million and $80 million, respectively. In November 2001, M&T announced that it
had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up to 5,000,000
shares of its common stock. Through December 31, 2001, M&T had repurchased
624,513 shares of common stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of
$71.70 per share. During 2001, M&T completed previously authorized repurchase
plans that had been announced in November 1999 and June 2001.

Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain
“core capital” and “total capital” ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively,
of risk-adjusted total assets. In addition to the risk-based measures, Federal
bank regulators have also implemented a minimum “leverage” ratio guideline of
3% of the quarterly average of total assets. Core capital includes the $318
million carrying value of trust preferred securities as described in note 8 of
Notes to Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2001, total capital further
included $559 million of subordinated notes issued by M&T Bank in prior years.
The capital ratios of the Company and its banking subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 are presented in note 20 of
Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company generates significant amounts of regulatory capital. The rate
of regulatory core capital generation, or cash net income (reduced by the
impact of nonrecurring merger-related expenses) less dividends paid expressed
as a percentage of regulatory “core capital” at the beginning of each year, was
20.96% in 2001, 19.48% in 2000 and 19.89% in 1999.

Fourth Quarter Results

Net income for the fourth quarter of 2001 was $102 million, up 41% from $72
million in the final quarter of 2000. Diluted and basic earnings per share in
the recent quarter were $1.05 and $1.08, respectively, compared with $.76 and
$.78, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2000. Nonrecurring
merger-related expenses lowered net income by $14 million, or $.15 per share
during 2000’s fourth quarter. There were no similar expenses incurred during
the last quarter of 2001. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average
assets, net income for the recent quarter rose to 1.29% from 1.01% in 2000’s
fourth quarter. The annualized rate of return on average common stockholders’
equity in the fourth quarter of 2001 was 13.70%, compared with 11.03% in the
corresponding quarter of 2000. Cash net income in the recent quarter increased
17% to $126 million from $108 million earned in the year-earlier quarter.
Diluted cash earnings per share rose 14% to $1.30 in 2001’s final quarter from
$1.14 in the fourth quarter of 2000. Cash return on average tangible assets
was an annualized 1.67% in the recent quarter, up from 1.57% in the comparable
2000 quarter. Cash return on average tangible common equity rose to an
annualized 29.43% in the fourth quarter of 2001 from 28.93% in the year-earlier
quarter.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased to $309 million in the
final quarter of 2001, up 18% from $262 million in the year-earlier period. A
10% increase in average earning assets and a widening of the Company’s net
interest margin were the most significant factors contributing to the
improvement in net interest income. Average earning assets were $28.2

-47-


billion and $25.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Average loans and leases for the recent quarter totaled $25.0 billion, an increase of 13% from $22.1 billion during the corresponding 2000
quarter. The impact of the previously described lower interest rate
environment contributed to a significant increase in the Company’s net interest
margin to 4.34% in the final quarter of 2001 from 4.05% in 2000’s fourth
quarter. The yield on earning assets was 6.97% in the recent quarter, down 150
basis points from 8.47% in the year-earlier period. The rate paid on
interest-bearing liabilities was 3.03% in the final quarter of 2001, down 209
basis points from 5.12% in the comparable period of 2000. The resulting net
interest spread was 3.94% in the recently completed quarter, compared with
3.35% in the final quarter of 2000.

The provision for credit losses rose to $33 million in the fourth quarter
of 2001 from $14 million in the year-earlier period. Reflecting 2001’s
weakened economic conditions, net charge-offs increased to $21 million in the
recent quarter, compared with $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2000. Net
charge-offs as an annualized percentage of average loans and leases were .33%
in the final 2001 quarter, compared with .22% in the comparable quarter of
2000.

Other income increased 24% to $128 million in the fourth quarter of 2001
from $103 million in the final quarter of 2000. Factors contributing to the
increase in fourth quarter 2001 income include higher mortgage banking
revenues, which rose 54% from the prior year’s fourth quarter, and increased
service charges on deposit accounts, which were up 31% from the fourth quarter
of 2000. As previously noted, a favorable environment for loan origination and
refinancing activities by consumers led to the higher mortgage banking
revenues. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts was the result
of higher transactional deposit account balances, which generate higher levels
of service charges than non-transactional accounts, and the Keystone and
Premier acquisitions. Additionally, there were no gains or losses from sales
of investment securities in the recent quarter, while the final 2000 quarter
reflected net losses of $3 million from sales of investment securities
following the acquisition of Keystone and the combination of the investment
portfolios of Keystone and the Company. Offsetting the impact of
2001’s increases was a net gain of $9 million during the fourth quarter of
2000 relating to leasing activities which resulted from a $13 million gain from
the sale of equipment previously leased to a commercial customer and an accrual
of $4 million for losses associated with selling automobiles and other vehicles
leased to retail customers.

Other expense increased 4% to $244 million in 2001’s final quarter from
$234 million in the comparable 2000 period. Nonrecurring merger-related
expenses totaled $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2000, while there were no
similar expenses in the recently completed quarter. Contributing to the higher
expenses in the fourth quarter of 2001 were salary costs, which rose $11
million or 11% from the final 2000 quarter. The higher salary expenses were
the result of increased costs relating to incentive compensation arrangements,
including commissions, merit salary increases and an increase in full-time
equivalent employees. Increased expenses for professional services and
amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible also contributed to the
higher expense level in the final quarter of 2001.

Segment information

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures About Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information,” the Company’s reportable segments
have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system,
which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business
units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes

-48-


where the nature of the products and services, the
type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable
segments are Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary
Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking.

The financial information of the Company’s segments was compiled utilizing
the accounting policies described in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.
The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment
financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting,
are not based on authoritative guidance similar to generally accepted
accounting principles. As a result, reported segments and the financial
results of such segments are not necessarily comparable with similar
information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in
management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in
changes in reported segment financial data. Financial information about the
Company’s segments is presented in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products
and banking services for middle-market and large commercial customers, largely
within the markets the Company serves. Among the services provided by this
segment are commercial lending and leasing, deposit products, and cash
management services. The Commercial Banking segment earned net income of $114
million in 2001, up 15% from $98 million in 2000. The rise in earnings in 2001
reflects a $45 million, or 23%, increase in net interest income, due largely to
a 25% increase in average loans and leases outstanding. Approximately one-half
of the increase in net interest income was attributable to operations in market
areas related to the Keystone acquisition. Partially offsetting the higher net
interest income was a $22 million increase in the provision for credit losses,
resulting from higher net charge-offs. Net income for this segment in 1999 was
$78 million. The higher net income in 2000 when compared with 1999 resulted
largely from an increase of $35 million, or 22%, in net interest income. Net
interest income from loans and leases increased $24 million, as a result of a
23% increase in average balances outstanding, while the contribution to net
interest income from deposits increased $8 million, due to a higher net
interest spread and a 9% increase in average balances outstanding. Growth in
most markets already served by the Company, as well as the impact of balances
obtained in acquisitions, contributed to the higher loan and deposit levels in
2000.

The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit services to
its customers. Loans are largely secured by properties in the New York City
metropolitan area and in western New York, however, loans are also originated
in the other regions in New York State, in Pennsylvania and, to a lesser
extent, in Maryland, West Virginia and the northwestern portion of the United
States. Commercial real estate loans may be secured by apartment/multifamily
buildings, office space, retail space, industrial space or other types of
collateral. The Commercial Real Estate segment’s earnings increased 15% to $83
million in 2001 from $72 million in 2000. Higher net interest income of $22
million, the result of a 16% increase in average loan balances outstanding, was
the major factor for the rise in net income. Approximately one-third of the
increase in net interest income was attributable to operations in market areas
associated with the Keystone acquisition. Net income for the Commercial Real
Estate segment was $64 million in 1999. The major factor for the rise in net
income from 1999 to 2000 was a 17% increase in average loan balances
outstanding which contributed to a $12 million, or 10%, increase in net
interest income. Loan growth in all markets served by the Company and the
impact of commercial real estate loans obtained in the Keystone acquisition
contributed to the increase in 2000’s outstanding balances.

The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes securities, residential

-49-


mortgage loans and other assets; short-term and
long-term borrowed funds; brokered certificates of deposit and interest rate swaps related thereto; and
offshore branch deposits. This segment also provides services to commercial
customers and consumers that include foreign exchange, securities trading and
municipal bond underwriting and sales. Net income for the Discretionary
Portfolio segment totaled $54 million in 2001, up from $34 million in 2000 and
$38 million in 1999. The increase in 2001 was due, in part, to a $10 million
increase in tax-exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance and a $14
million increase in net interest income, the result of increased balances of
loans and investment securities and a higher net interest margin. Factors
contributing to the decline in net income from 1999 to 2000 include an $11
million, or 23%, decrease in net interest income and losses from sales of bank
investment securities of $3 million, offset, in part, by a $3 million increase
in tax-exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance. The decline in net
interest income largely reflected a narrowing of the segment’s net interest
margin.

The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services
residential mortgage loans for consumers and sells substantially all of those
loans in the secondary market to investors or to bank subsidiaries of M&T.
The Company maintains mortgage loan origination offices in New York State and
Pennsylvania, as well as in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Massachusetts, New
Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Utah and Washington. The Company also periodically
purchases the rights to service residential mortgage loans. Residential
mortgage loans held for sale are included in this segment. Net income for this
segment was $44 million in 2001, up significantly from $6 million a year
earlier and $21 million in 1999. The higher level of earnings in 2001 when
compared with 2000 was largely due to the effects of substantially higher
residential mortgage loan origination volumes, which resulted from a generally
favorable interest rate environment for borrowers, and loan servicing fees.
The higher loan origination volume in 2001 contributed to a $48 million, or
118%, increase in realized and unrealized gains from sales of residential
mortgage loans, including sales to the Discretionary Portfolio segment of the
Company, and loan servicing rights. The previously described adoption of SFAS
No. 133 contributed approximately $8 million to such increase. Revenues from
servicing residential mortgage loans for others, including the Discretionary
Portfolio segment, increased by $15 million, or 34%, from 2000 to 2001. Net
interest income was $33 million higher in 2001, predominately the result of a
152% increase in the average balance of loans held for sale. Reflecting the
year’s higher revenues, operating expenses increased by 34%, from $106 million
in 2000 to $142 million in 2001. The significant decrease in net income from
1999 to 2000 was largely due to lower gains from sales of residential mortgage
loans and loan servicing rights, which decreased $15 million, and higher
noninterest expenses of $6 million resulting from increases in foreclosure
expenses and amortization of capitalized servicing rights. The decline in
revenue resulted from the impact that generally higher interest rates in 2000
had on loan origination volume and from tighter pricing margins resulting from
competitive pressures.

The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of consumer and small business
services through several delivery channels which include traditional and
“in-store” banking offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and
internet banking. The Company has banking offices in New York State,
Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia. The Retail Banking segment also
offers certain deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis through M&T
Bank, N.A. Credit services offered by this segment include consumer
installment loans, student loans, automobile loans and leases (both directly
and indirectly through dealers), home equity loans and lines of credit, and
loans and leases to small businesses. The segment also offers to its customers
deposit products, including demand, savings and time accounts; investment
products, including mutual funds and annuities; and other services. The Retail
Banking segment recorded net income of $201 million in

-50-


2001, up 23% from $164 million in 2000. Higher net interest income and deposit service charges of $158 million and $40 million, respectively, partially
offset by higher operating expenses of $137 million, were the leading factors
contributing to the improvement in net income from 2000. Such increases in
income and expenses were largely the result of the Keystone and Premier
acquisitions. In 1999, this segment’s net income was $112 million. The
increase from 1999 to 2000 was due largely to the impact of acquisitions
completed in 2000 and 1999 that resulted in higher net interest income and
service charges on deposit accounts, partially offset by increases in operating
expenses. The full-year impact in 2000 of a third quarter 1999 increase in
fees charged for deposit account services also contributed to the improvement.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS
Nos. 141 and 142. SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations,” revised accounting
standards and disclosure requirements for business combinations. All business
combinations are now required to be accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting; use of the pooling-of-interests (“pooling”) method of accounting is
prohibited. SFAS No. 141 requires that goodwill be initially recognized as an
asset in the financial statements and measured as the excess of the cost of an
acquired entity over the net difference between amounts assigned to assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. The statement also requires that an acquired
intangible asset be recognized apart from goodwill if that asset arises from
contractual or other legal rights. SFAS No. 141 stipulates that the pooling
method of accounting may not be used for business combinations initiated after
June 30, 2001. However, prior business combinations accounted for by the
pooling method are “grandfathered.” The provisions of SFAS No. 141 related to
the application of the purchase method of accounting (including the separate
recognition of identifiable intangible assets) were effective for any business
combination completed after June 30, 2001.

SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” revises accounting
standards for all purchased intangible assets but not the accounting for
internally developed intangible assets. SFAS No. 142, as amended, requires
that most goodwill not be amortized, but rather that it be tested for
impairment at the reporting unit level, which is either at the same level or
one level below an operating segment. All acquired goodwill should be assigned
to reporting units, then tested for impairment no less frequently than
annually. Acquired intangible assets (other than goodwill) should be amortized
over their useful economic lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”
However, an acquired intangible asset (other than goodwill) with an indefinite
useful economic life should not be amortized until its life is determined to be
finite. SFAS No. 142 also stipulates various disclosures and financial
statement presentation requirements relating to goodwill and intangible assets.
SFAS No. 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001,
and companies are required to perform the first impairment test on all goodwill
within six months of initially applying the provisions of the statement. The
useful economic life of previously recognized intangible assets should be
reassessed upon adoption of the statement, remaining amortization periods
should be adjusted accordingly, and intangible assets deemed to have an
indefinite life should no longer be amortized.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. Historically,
the Company has referred to certain unidentifiable intangible assets acquired
in branch acquisitions as goodwill. SFAS No. 142 does not change the
accounting for such unidentifiable intangible assets that was

-51-


prescribed by SFAS No. 72, “Accounting
for Certain Acquisitions of Banking or Thrift Institutions.” As a result, subsequent to December 31, 2001 the Company
will continue to amortize such intangible assets along with core deposit and
other acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense relating to core
deposit and other intangible assets is expected to approximate $33 million
(after-tax) in 2002. The after-tax impact of amortization of goodwill and core
deposit and other intangible assets in 2001 was $99 million. The Company is
still evaluating whether or not any of its recorded goodwill should be
considered impaired under the provisions of SFAS No. 142. Information about
the Company’s amortization of goodwill and other acquired
intangible assets during the three-years ended December 31, 2001 is presented
herein under the heading “Cash Operating Results.”

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations.” SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair
value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which
it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity
capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived
asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period,
and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related
asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the
obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon
settlement. SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2002, with earlier application encouraged.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” SFAS No. 144 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets and supercedes
SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of” and the provisions for the disposal of a
segment of a business in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, “Reporting
the Results of Operations — Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions.” SFAS No. 144 requires that long-lived assets to be disposed of
be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell,
whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations. As a
result, discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable
value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred. SFAS
No. 144 also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all
components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest
of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the
entity in a disposal transaction. The provisions of SFAS No. 144 are effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001 and, generally, are to be applied prospectively.

The provisions of SFAS Nos. 143 and 144 are not expected to have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Factors”) which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and
results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such
forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update
publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise.

-52-


Future Factors include changes in interest rates, spreads on earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity; credit
losses; sources of liquidity; legislation affecting the financial services
industry as a whole, and/or M&T and its subsidiaries individually; regulatory
supervision and oversight, including required capital levels; increasing price
and product/service competition by competitors, including new entrants; rapid
technological developments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce
competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis; the
mix of products/services; containing costs and expenses; governmental and
public policy changes, including environmental regulations; protection and
validity of intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers;
technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large, multi-year

and acquisition activities compared to the Company’s initial expectations,
including the full realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue
enhancements. These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect
the outcome of the forward-looking statements. In addition, such statements
could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates,
general economic conditions, including interest rate and currency exchange rate
fluctuations, and other Future Factors.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

M&T Bank Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of M&T Bank
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in stockholders’
equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of M&T Bank
Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

M&T BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant accounting policies

M&T Bank Corporation (“M&T”) is a bank holding company headquartered in
Buffalo, New York. Through subsidiaries, M&T provides individuals,
corporations and other businesses, and institutions with commercial and retail
banking services, including loans and deposits, trust, mortgage banking, asset
management, insurance and other financial services. Banking activities are
largely focused on consumers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, and
on small and medium-size businesses based in those areas. Banking services are
also provided in Maryland and West Virginia, while certain subsidiaries also
conduct activities in other states.

The accounting and reporting policies of M&T and subsidiaries (“the
Company”) conform to generally accepted accounting principles and to general
practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The more significant accounting policies are as follows:

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include M&T and all of its subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. The financial statements of M&T included in note 21 report
investments in subsidiaries under the equity method.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

For purposes of this statement, cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and
agreements to resell securities are considered cash and cash equivalents.

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under
agreements to repurchase

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under
agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing transactions
and are recorded at amounts equal to the cash or other consideration exchanged.
It is generally the Company’s policy to take possession of collateral pledged
to secure agreements to resell.

Trading account

Financial instruments used for trading purposes are stated at fair value.
Realized gains and losses and unrealized changes in fair value of financial
instruments utilized in trading activities are included in trading account and
foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income.

Investment securities

Investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and stated at
amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold such
securities to maturity. Investments in other debt securities and equity
securities having readily determinable fair values are classified as available
for sale and stated at estimated fair value. Except for investment securities

Investment securities, continued

for which the Company has entered into a related fair value hedge, unrealized
gains or losses on investment securities available for sale are reflected in
accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes.

Other securities are stated at cost and include stock of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.

Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts for investment
securities available for sale and held to maturity are included in interest
income. The cost basis of individual securities is written down to estimated
fair value through a charge to earnings when declines in value below
amortized cost are considered to be other than temporary. Realized gains and
losses on the sales of investment securities are determined using the specific
identification method.

Loans

Interest income on loans is accrued on a level yield method. Loans are placed
on nonaccrual status and previously accrued interest thereon is charged against
income when principal or interest is delinquent 90 days, unless management
determines that the loan status clearly warrants other treatment. Loan
balances are charged off when it becomes evident that such balances are not
fully collectible. Loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are
deferred and recognized as an interest yield adjustment over the life of the
loan. Net deferred fees have been included in unearned discount as a reduction
of loans outstanding. As discussed in the “Derivative financial instruments”
section of this note, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” as amended, effective January 1, 2001. Since commitments to sell
residential real estate loans are utilized by the Company to hedge the exposure
to changes in fair value of residential real estate loans held for sale,
effective January 1, 2001 hedged residential real estate loans held for sale
are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair market value.
Prior to 2001, loans held for sale and related commitments were carried at the
lower of aggregate cost or fair market value. Valuation adjustments made on
these loans are included in mortgage banking revenues.

Except for consumer and residential mortgage loans that are considered
smaller balance homogenous loans and are evaluated collectively, the Company
considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events,
it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts
according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is
delinquent 90 days. Impaired loans are classified as either nonaccrual or as
loans renegotiated at below market rates. Loans less than 90 days delinquent
are deemed to have an insignificant delay in payment and are generally not
considered impaired. Impairment of a loan is measured based on the present
value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest
rate, the loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of collateral if
the loan is collateral dependent. Interest received on impaired loans placed
on nonaccrual status is applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan or, if
principal is considered fully collectible, recognized as interest income.

Allowance for credit losses

The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in management’s
judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and
lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The adequacy of the allowance is
determined by management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on
such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan
category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic
environment in which borrowers operate, any delinquency in payments, and the
value of any collateral.

Premises and equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation expense is computed principally using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Capitalized servicing rights

Servicing rights retained in a sale or securitization of financial assets are
measured at the date of transfer by allocating the previous carrying amount
between the assets transferred and the servicing rights based on their relative
fair values. Servicing assets purchased or servicing liabilities assumed are
initially measured at fair value. Capitalized servicing assets are included in
other assets and amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated
net servicing income.

To estimate the fair value of servicing rights, the Company considers
market prices for similar assets and the present value of expected future
cash flows associated with the servicing rights calculated using assumptions
that market participants would use in estimating future servicing income and
expense. Such assumptions include estimates of the cost of servicing loans,
loan default rates, an appropriate discount rate, and prepayment speeds. For
purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment of capitalized servicing
rights, the Company stratifies such assets based on predominant risk
characteristics of underlying financial instruments that are expected to have
the most impact on projected prepayments, cost of servicing and other factors
affecting future cash flows associated with the servicing rights. Such factors
may include financial asset or loan type, note rate and term. The amount of
impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the
capitalized servicing rights for a stratum exceeds estimated fair value.
Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance.

Goodwill and core deposit intangible

The excess of the cost of acquired entities or operations over the fair value
of identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recorded as
goodwill. Through December 31, 2001, substantially all of the Company’s
goodwill was amortized using the straight-line method over twenty years. Core
deposit intangibles are amortized using an accelerated method over estimated
useful lives of seven to ten years. The Company periodically assesses whether
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of
goodwill and core deposit intangible may be impaired.

Derivative financial instruments

On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. SFAS No. 133
established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and
for hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as
either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments
at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically
designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair
value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment,
(b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction
or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a
foreign operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, an available for sale
security, or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. Pursuant
to SFAS No. 133, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative
depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.
An entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to establish at the
inception of the hedge the method it will use for assessing the effectiveness
of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the
ineffective aspect of the hedge. Those methods must be consistent with the
entity’s approach to managing risk.

The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of the
management of interest rate risk to modify the repricing characteristics of
certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities. For such agreements, amounts receivable or payable are recognized
as accrued under the terms of the agreement and the net differential is
recorded as an adjustment to interest income or expense of the related asset or
liability. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, effective January 1, 2001 such
agreements have been designated as either fair value hedges or cash flow
hedges. In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the interest rate swaps and
changes in the fair value of the hedged items are recorded in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss being
recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair
value of interest rate swaps and the hedged items represents hedge
ineffectiveness and is recorded in “other revenues from operations” in the
Company’s consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, the
effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially recorded as a
component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into
earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective
portion of the gain or loss is reported in “other revenues from operations”
immediately. Prior to January 1, 2001, interest rate swap agreements used to
manage interest rate risk were not recorded at fair value in the consolidated
balance sheet. Amounts receivable or payable under such agreements were
recognized as accrued under the terms of the agreement and the net
differential, including any amortization of premiums paid or accretion of
discounts received, was recorded as an adjustment to interest income or expense
of the related asset or liability. To qualify for such accounting treatment, an
interest rate swap must (i) have been designated as having been entered into
for interest rate risk management purposes and linked to a
specific financial instrument or pool of similar financial instruments in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet and (ii) have had interest rate and
repricing characteristics that had a sufficient degree of correlation with the
corresponding characteristics of the designated on-balance sheet financial
instrument. Gains and losses resulting from early termination of interest rate
swap agreements used to manage interest rate risk were amortized over the
shorter of the remaining term or estimated life of the agreement or the on-

balance sheet financial instrument to which the swap had been linked.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell residential real estate loans to
hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of residential real estate
loans held for sale. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 133, hedged residential
real estate loans held for sale, commitments to originate residential real
estate loans to be held for sale, and commitments to sell residential real
estate loans are now generally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at
estimated fair market value. Prior to January 1, 2001, residential real estate
loans held for sale and related commitments were carried at the lower of
aggregate cost or fair market value.

Derivative instruments, including financial futures commitments and
interest rate swap agreements, that do not satisfy the hedge accounting
requirements noted above are valued at fair value and classified as trading
account assets or liabilities with resultant changes in fair value being
recognized in trading account and foreign exchange gains in the Company’s
consolidated statement of income.

Stock-based compensation

Compensation expense is not recognized for stock option awards to employees
under the Company’s stock option plans since the exercise price of options is
equal to the market price of the underlying stock at the date of grant.
Compensation expense for stock appreciation rights issued separately from
stock options is recognized based upon changes in the quoted market value of
M&T’s common stock. The pro forma effects of stock-based compensation
arrangements are based on the estimated grant date fair value of stock options
that are expected to vest calculated pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No.
123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” Pro forma compensation
expense, net of applicable income tax effect, is recognized over the vesting
period.

Income taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects
attributable to differences between the financial statement value of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and
laws. Investment tax credits related to leveraged leasing property are
amortized into income tax expense over the life of the lease agreement.

Earnings per common share

Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income
available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding and common shares issuable under deferred compensation
arrangements during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue
common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the
issuance of common stock that then shared in earnings. Proceeds assumed to
have been received on such exercise or conversion are assumed to be used to
purchase shares of M&T common stock at the average market price during the
period, as required by the “treasury stock method” of accounting.

Treasury stock

Repurchases of shares of M&T common stock are recorded at cost as a reduction
of stockholders’ equity. Reissuances of shares of treasury stock are recorded
at average cost.

2. Acquisitions

On February 9, 2001, M&T completed the merger of Premier National Bancorp, Inc.
(“Premier”), a bank holding company headquartered in Lagrangeville, New York,
with and into Olympia Financial Corp. (“Olympia”), a wholly owned subsidiary of
M&T. Following the merger, Premier National Bank, Premier’s
bank subsidiary, was merged into Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T
Bank”), M&T’s principal bank subsidiary. Premier National Bank operated 34
banking offices in the mid-Hudson Valley region of New York State. After
application of the election, allocation, and proration procedures contained in
the merger agreement with Premier, M&T paid $171 million in cash and issued
2,440,812 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for the Premier shares
outstanding at the time of acquisition. In addition, based on the merger
agreement and the exchange ratio provided therein, M&T converted outstanding
and unexercised stock options granted by Premier into options to purchase
224,734 shares of M&T common stock. The purchase price was approximately $347
million based on the cash paid to Premier shareholders, the fair value of M&T
common stock exchanged, and the estimated fair value of Premier stock options
converted into M&T stock options.

Acquired assets, loans and deposits of Premier on February 9, 2001 totaled
approximately $1.8 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The
transaction has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and,
accordingly, operations acquired from Premier have been included in the
Company’s financial results since the acquisition date. In connection with the
acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $178 million of goodwill and
$32 million of core deposit intangible. The core deposit intangible is being
amortized over seven years using an accelerated method. Through December 31,
2001, the goodwill was being amortized over twenty years using the
straight-line method.

On October 6, 2000, M&T completed the merger of Keystone Financial, Inc.
(“Keystone”), a bank holding company headquartered in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,
with and into Olympia. Following the merger, Keystone Financial Bank, N.A.,
Keystone’s bank subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank. Keystone Financial
Bank,N.A. operated banking offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia.
After application of the election, allocation and proration procedures
contained in the merger agreement with Keystone, M&T paid $375 million in cash
and issued 15,900,292 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for the Keystone
shares outstanding at the time of acquisition. In addition, based on the
merger agreement and the exchange ratio provided therein, M&T converted
outstanding and unexercised stock options granted by Keystone into options to
purchase 1,259,493 shares of M&T common stock. The purchase price of the
transaction was approximately $1.0 billion based on the cash paid to Keystone
shareholders, the market price of M&T common shares on May 16, 2000 before the
terms of the merger were agreed to and announced by M&T and Keystone, and the
estimated fair value of Keystone stock options converted into M&T stock
options.

Acquired assets, loans and deposits of Keystone on October 6, 2000
totaled approximately $7.4 billion, $4.8 billion and $5.2 billion,
respectively. The transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of

accounting and, accordingly, operations acquired from Keystone have been
included in the Company’s financial results since the acquisition date. In
connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $475
million of goodwill and $121 million of core deposit intangible. Following the
completion of an actuarial review and merger of the pension and other
postretirement benefits plans of M&T and Keystone, in 2001 the Company adjusted
the net prepaid benefit cost obtained in the acquisition of Keystone. The
effect of such adjustment was to increase net prepaid benefit costs by
approximately $28 million and, after applicable tax effect, to decrease
goodwill by approximately $18 million. Such adjustment is reflected in the
$475 million of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition. The
adjustment did not result in a material effect on the Company’s results of
operations for either of the years ended December 31, 2001 or 2000. The core
deposit intangible is being amortized over seven years using an accelerated
method. Through December 31, 2001, the goodwill was being amortized over
twenty years using the straight-line method.

On March 1, 2000, M&T Bank completed the acquisition of Matthews, Bartlett
& Dedecker, Inc. (“MBD”), an insurance agency located in Buffalo, New York for
$4.5 million in cash. MBD provides insurance services principally to the
commercial market and operates as a subsidiary of M&T Bank. The acquisition
has not had a material impact on the Company’s financial position or its
results of operations.

On March 31, 2000, The Chase Manhattan Bank (“Chase”) transferred trust
and fiduciary accounts with assets of approximately $147 million to M&T Bank,
completing a transaction that began in September 1999 with M&T Bank’s
acquisition from Chase of 29 branch offices in upstate New York and the
investment management and custody accounts associated with those offices. At
the time of closing in September 1999, the branches had approximately $634
million of deposits and approximately $44 million of retail installment and
commercial loans, and the investment management and custody accounts had assets
of approximately $286 million. In connection with the transaction, the Company
recorded approximately $55 million of intangible assets that are being
amortized over periods ranging from five to seven years.

On June 1, 1999, M&T completed the merger of FNB Rochester Corp.(“FNB”), a
bank holding company headquartered in Rochester, New York, with and into
Olympia. Following the merger with FNB, First National Bank of Rochester, a
wholly owned subsidiary of FNB, was merged into M&T Bank. In accordance with
the terms of the merger agreements with FNB, M&T paid $76 million in cash and
issued 1,225,160 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for FNB shares
outstanding at the time of the acquisition. The purchase price of the
transaction was approximately $135 million based on the cash paid to FNB
stockholders and the market price of M&T common shares on December 8, 1998
before the terms of the merger were agreed to and announced by M&T and FNB.
Acquired assets, loans and deposits of FNB on June 1, 1999 totaled
approximately $676 million, $393 million and $511 million, respectively. The
transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and,
accordingly, operations acquired from FNB have been included in the Company’s
financial results since the acquisition date. In connection with the
acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $86 million of goodwill and $12
million of core deposit intangible. The core deposit intangible is being
amortized over eight years using an accelerated method. Through December 31,
2001, the goodwill was being amortized over twenty years using the straight-line method.

In connection with the transactions described herein, the Company incurred
expenses related to systems conversions and other costs of

integrating and conforming the acquired operations with and into the Company of
approximately $8.0 million ($4.8 million net of applicable income taxes) during
2001, approximately $26.0 million ($16.4 million net of applicable income
taxes) during 2000, and approximately $4.7 million ($3.0 million net of
applicable income taxes) during 1999. Expenses related to systems conversions
and other costs of integration are included in the consolidated statement of
income for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 as follows:

marketing and promotion expenses designed to introduce the Company to
customers of the acquired operations; travel; and printing, supplies and other
costs.

Presented herein is certain unaudited pro forma information for 2000 as if
Keystone and Premier had been acquired on January 1, 2000. These results
combine the historical results of Premier and Keystone into the Company’s
consolidated statement of income and, while certain adjustments were made for
the estimated impact of purchase accounting adjustments and other
acquisition-related activity, they are not necessarily indicative of what would
have occurred had the acquisitions taken place at that time. In particular,
expenses related to systems conversions and other costs of integration
associated with the acquisitions of Premier and Keystone are included in the
periods in which such costs were incurred and, additionally, the Company
expects to achieve further operating cost savings as a result of the mergers
which are not reflected in the pro forma amounts presented. Pro forma
information related to the acquisition of MBD is not presented since MBD’s
financial position and results of operations were not material to the Company’s
consolidated financial statements. Pro forma information for the year ended
December 31, 2001 as if Premier had been acquired on January 1, 2001 is not
presented since such pro forma results were not materially

At December 31, 2001, collateral accepted by the Company, which by
contract or custom can be sold or repledged, consisted of investment securities
with a fair value of $41,148,000 purchased under agreements to resell.

4. Loans and leases

Total gross loans and leases outstanding were comprised of the following:

One-to-four family residential mortgage loans held for sale were $1.0
billion at December 31, 2001 and $525.1 million at December 31, 2000.
One-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled
approximately $9.6 billion and $9.7 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $15 million of one-to-four
family residential mortgage loans serviced for others have been sold with
recourse. The total credit loss exposure resulting from residential mortgage
loans sold with recourse was considered negligible. Commercial mortgage loans
serviced for others totaled approximately $472 million and $458 million at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Included in the preceding table are nonperforming loans (loans on which
interest was not being accrued or had been renegotiated at below-market
interest rates) of $190,472,000 at December 31, 2001 and $110,639,000 at
December 31, 2000. If nonaccrual and renegotiated loans had been accruing
interest at their originally contracted terms, interest income on these loans
would have amounted to $18,054,000 in 2001 and $9,289,000 in 2000. The actual
amount included in interest income during 2001 and 2000 on these loans was
$5,741,000 and $2,108,000, respectively.

The recorded investment in loans considered impaired was $139,750,000 and
$80,773,000 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The recorded
investment in loans considered impaired for which there was a related valuation
allowance for impairment included in the allowance for credit losses and the
amount of such impairment allowance were $84,818,000 and $20,956,000,
respectively, at December 31, 2001 and $36,602,000 and $11,542,000,

Interest income recognized on impaired loans totaled $3,310,000, $2,947,000 and
$3,324,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Borrowings by directors and certain officers of M&T and its banking
subsidiaries, and by associates of such persons, exclusive of loans aggregating
less than $60,000, amounted to $198,114,000 and $132,356,000 at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. During 2001, new borrowings by such
persons amounted to $103,070,000 (including borrowings of new directors or
officers that were outstanding at the time of their election) and repayments
and other reductions were $37,312,000.

At December 31, 2001, approximately $2.4 billion of commercial mortgage
loans and one-to-four family residential mortgage loans were pledged to secure
outstanding borrowings.

loan portfolio. In connection with the securitization transaction, the Company
allocated $14.3 million of the carrying value of the loans to capitalized
servicing assets. Such amount is included above in capitalized servicing
assets from originations.

There was no provision for impairment added to the allowance for the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. During 1999, the valuation allowance
was reduced by $1,748,000 since for most strata the estimated fair value of
capitalized servicing assets exceeded carrying value. The estimated fair value
of capitalized servicing assets was approximately $163 million at December 31,
2001 and $147 million at December 31, 2000. Such amounts were estimated using
discount rates ranging from 10.8% to 11.9% at December 31, 2001 and 11.0% to
12.0% at December 31, 2000, and contemporaneous prepayment assumptions. The
estimated market value of capitalized servicing rights may vary significantly
in subsequent periods due to changing interest rates and the effect thereof on
prepayment speeds.

The key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of
capitalized servicing rights at December 31, 2001 and the sensitivity of such
value to changes in those assumptions are summarized in the table that follows.
These calculated sensitivities are hypothetical and actual changes in the fair
value of capitalized servicing rights may differ significantly from the amounts
presented herein. The effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the
fair value of the servicing rights is calculated without changing any other
assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another
which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities. The changes in assumptions
are presumed to be instantaneous.

The subordinated notes of M&T Bank are unsecured and are subordinate to
the claims of depositors and other creditors of M&T Bank. The senior medium
term notes were issued in 1997 and 1998 by Keystone Financial Mid-Atlantic
Funding Corp., previously a wholly owned subsidiary of Keystone, but now a
wholly owned subsidiary of Olympia. The notes provide for semi-annual interest
payments at fixed rates of interest and are guaranteed by Olympia.

Long-term variable rate advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks had
contractual interest rates that ranged from 1.89% to 2.42% at December 31, 2001
and from 6.56% to 6.83% at December 31, 2000. The weighted-average contractual
interest rates were 2.08% and 6.74% at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Long-term fixed-rate advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks
had contractual interest rates ranging from 4.05% to 8.29%. The
weighted-average contractual interest rates payable were 5.53% and 5.67% at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Advances from the Federal Home Loan
Banks mature at various dates through 2029 and are secured by residential real
estate loans, commercial real estate loans and investment securities.

In 1997, M&T Capital Trust I (“Trust I”), M&T Capital Trust II (“Trust
II”), and M&T Capital Trust III (“Trust III” and, together with Trust I and
Trust II, the “Trusts”), issued $310 million of preferred capital securities.
The financial statement carrying value of the preferred capital securities of
Trust III include the unamortized portion of a purchase accounting adjustment
to reflect estimated fair value at the April 1, 1998 acquisition of the common
securities of Trust III.

The common securities of Trust I and II are wholly owned by M&T and the
common securities of Trust III are wholly owned by Olympia. The common
securities of each trust (“Common Securities”) are the only class of each
trust’s securities possessing general voting powers. The Capital Securities
represent preferred undivided interests in the assets of the corresponding
trust and are classified in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as
long-term borrowings with accumulated distributions on such securities included
in
interest expense. Under the Federal Reserve Board’s current risk-based capital
guidelines, the Capital Securities are includable in M&T’s Tier 1 capital.

The proceeds from the issuances of the Capital Securities and Common
Securities were used by the Trusts to purchase junior subordinated deferrable
interest debentures (“Junior Subordinated Debentures”) of M&T in the case of
Trust I and Trust II and Olympia in the case of Trust III as follows:

The Junior Subordinated Debentures represent the sole assets of each Trust
and payments under the Junior Subordinated Debentures are the sole source of
cash flow for each Trust.

Holders of the Capital Securities receive preferential cumulative cash
distributions semi-annually on each distribution date at the stated
distribution rate unless M&T, in the case of Trust I or Trust II, or Olympia,
in the case of Trust III, exercise the right to extend the payment of interest
on the Junior Subordinated Debentures for up to ten semi-annual periods, in
which case payment of distributions on the Capital Securities will be deferred
for a comparable period. During an extended interest period, M&T and/or
Olympia may not pay dividends or distributions on, or repurchase, redeem or
acquire any shares of the respective company’s capital stock. The agreements
governing the Capital Securities, in the aggregate, provide a full,

irrevocable and unconditional guarantee by M&T in the case of Trust I or Trust
II, or Olympia, in the case of Trust III, of the payment of distributions on,
the redemption of, and any liquidation distribution with respect to the Capital
Securities. The obligations under such guarantee and the Capital Securities
are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all senior indebtedness of
M&T and Olympia.

The Capital Securities are mandatorily redeemable in whole, but not in
part, upon repayment at the stated maturity dates of the Junior Subordinated
Debentures or the earlier redemption of the Junior Subordinated Debentures in
whole upon the occurrence of one or more events (“Events”) set forth in the
indentures relating to the Capital Securities, and in whole or in part at any
time after the stated optional redemption dates (February 1, 2007 in the case
of Trust I and Trust III, and June 1, 2007 in the case of Trust II)
contemporaneously with the Company’s optional redemption of the related Junior
Subordinated Debentures in whole or in part. The Junior Subordinated
Debentures are redeemable prior to their stated maturity dates at M&T’s option
in the case of Trust I and Trust II and Olympia’s option in the case of Trust
III (i) on or after the stated optional redemption dates, in whole at any time
or in part from time to time, or (ii) in whole, but not in part, at any time
within 90 days following the occurrence and during the continuation of one or
more of the Events, in each case subject to possible regulatory approval. The
redemption price of the Capital Securities upon early redemption will be
expressed as a percentage of the liquidation amount plus accumulated but unpaid
distributions. In the case of Trust I, such percentage adjusts annually and
ranges from 104.117% at February 1, 2007 to 100.412% for the annual period
ending January 31, 2017, after which the percentage is 100%, subject to a
make-whole amount if the early redemption occurs prior to February 1, 2007. In
the case of Trust II, such percentage adjusts annually and ranges from 104.139%
at June 1, 2007 to 100.414% for the annual period
ending May 31, 2017, after which the percentage is 100%, subject to a
make-whole amount if the early redemption occurs prior to June 1, 2007. In the
case of Trust III, such percentage adjusts annually and ranges from 104.625% at
February 1, 2007 to 100.463% for the annual period ending January 31, 2017,
after which the percentage is 100%, subject to a make-whole amount if the early
redemption occurs prior to February 1, 2007.

Stock option plans

M&T had two stock option plans at December 31, 2001. The 1983 Stock Option
Plan (“1983 Plan”) allowed the grant of stock options and stock appreciation
rights (either in tandem with options or independently) at prices which could
not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of
grant. Except as described below, awards granted under the 1983 Plan generally
vest over four years and are exercisable over terms not exceeding ten years and
one day from the date of grant. When exercisable, the stock

-94-


M&T BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements, continued

9. Stock-based compensation plans, continued

Stock option plans, continued

appreciation rights issued in tandem with stock options entitle grantees to
receive cash, stock or a combination equal to the amount of stock appreciation
between the dates of grant and exercise. During 2001, the remaining shares
available for grant under the 1983 Plan were awarded. Stock appreciation rights
that had been issued independently of stock options pursuant to the 1983 Plan
contained similar terms as the stock options, although upon exercise the holder
was only entitled to receive cash instead of purchasing shares of M&T’s common
stock. In 1999, the Company granted options to substantially all employees who
had not previously received awards under the 1983 Plan. The options granted
under this award vest three years after the grant date and are exercisable for
a period of seven years thereafter.

In April 2001, stockholders approved the 2001 Stock Option Plan (“2001
Plan”). Options granted under the 2001 Plan contain similar terms as the 1983
Plan, other than the 2001 Plan does not permit the granting of stock
appreciation rights, either in tandem with options or as stand-alone grants.
Under the 2001 Plan, a maximum of 10,000,000 shares of stock may be issued upon
the exercise of options granted.

A summary of stock option and stock appreciation rights activity follows:

At December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, there were 9,877,747 and
1,901,700 shares available for future grant.

The Company used a binomial option pricing model to estimate the grant
date present value of stock options granted in 2001, 2000 and 1999. The
weighted-average estimated value per option was $20.62 in 2001, $13.37 in 2000
and $11.58 in 1999. The values were calculated using the following
weighted-average assumptions: an option term of 6.5 years (representing the
estimated period between grant date and exercise date based on historical
data); a risk-free interest rate of 5.17% in 2001, 6.80% in 2000 and 4.97% in
1999 (representing the yield on a U.S. Treasury security with a remaining term
equal to the expected option term); expected volatility of 29% in 2001, 22% in
2000 and 19% in 1999; and estimated dividend yields of 1.52% in 2001, 1.19% in
2000 and .85% in 1999 (representing the approximate annualized cash dividend
rate paid with respect to a share of common stock at or near the grant date).
The Company reduced the estimated value per option to reflect an estimate of
the probability of forfeiture prior to vesting. Based on historical data and
projected employee turnover rates, the weighted-average estimated forfeiture
rate was 10% in 2001 and 2000, and 21% in 1999.

The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations in
accounting for the stock option plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense
was recognized in 2001, 2000 and 1999 for stock option awards since the
exercise price of stock options granted under the stock option plans was not
less than the fair market value of the common stock at date of grant.
Compensation expense (benefit) recognized for cash-only stock appreciation
rights was $976,000 in 2000 and $(2,199,000) in 1999. Had compensation
expense for stock option awards been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123,

Deferred bonus plan

The Company provides a deferred bonus plan pursuant to which eligible employees
may elect to defer all or a portion of their current annual incentive
compensation awards and allocate such awards to several investment options,
including M&T common stock. Participants may elect the timing of distributions
from the plan. Such distributions are payable in cash with the exception of
balances allocated to M&T common stock which are distributable in the form of
M&T common stock. Shares of M&T common stock distributable pursuant to the
terms of the deferred bonus plan were 84,743 and 88,543 at December 31, 2001
and 2000, respectively. In connection with the deferred bonus plan, 150,000
shares of M&T common stock were authorized for issuance, of which 36,154 shares
have been issued. The obligation to issue such shares is included in common
stock issuable in the consolidated balance sheet.

Directors’ stock plan

The Company maintains a compensation plan for non-employee members of the
Company’s boards of directors and directors advisory councils that allows such
members to receive all or a portion of their compensation in shares of M&T
common stock. In connection with the directors’ stock plan, 100,000 shares of
M&T common stock were authorized for issuance, of which 26,828 shares have been
issued.

In connection with the Keystone acquisition, the Company assumed an
obligation to issue shares of M&T common stock related to a deferred
directors compensation plan. Shares of common stock issuable under such plan
were 45,685 at December 31, 2001. The obligation to issue such shares is
included in common stock issuable in the consolidated balance sheet.

Management stock ownership program

Keystone had a management stock ownership program which established stock
ownership goals for senior management of Keystone. In order to assist senior
management in attaining their goals, a related plan provided for nonrecourse,
noninterest-bearing loans to be used to purchase Keystone common stock at fair
market value. The Company acquired these loans as a result of the Keystone
transaction. The loans are secured by collateral having an initial value of
120% of the loan amount and consisting of M&T common stock (Keystone stock
purchased with the loan)plus additional shares of stock or other acceptable
collateral owned by the executive. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the amount
owed M&T for the financed stock purchased totaled $4,601,000 and $4,713,000,
respectively, and is classified as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in
the consolidated balance sheet. The amounts are due to M&T no later than
October 5, 2010.

Data relating to the funding position of the plans were as follows:

In 2001, following the completion of actuarial reviews and mergers of the
pension and other postretirement benefits plans of M&T and Keystone, the
Company increased the net prepaid benefit cost obtained in the acquisition of
Keystone by approximately $28 million.

The Company has an unfunded supplemental pension plan for certain key
executives. The projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit
obligation included in the preceding data related to such plans were

The Company has a retirement savings plan (“Savings Plan”) that is a
defined contribution plan in which eligible employees of the Company may defer
up to 15% of qualified compensation via contributions to the plan. The Company
makes an employer matching contribution in an amount equal to 75% of an
employee’s contribution, up to 4.5% of the employee’s qualified compensation.
Employees’ accounts, including employee contributions, employer
matching contributions and accumulated earnings thereon, are at all times fully
vested and nonforfeitable. The Company’s contributions to the Savings
Plan totaled $10,103,000, $7,699,000 and $6,935,000 in 2001, 2000 and 1999,

11. Income taxes, continued

The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return reflecting
taxable income earned by all subsidiaries. In prior years, applicable federal
tax law allowed certain financial institutions the option of deducting as bad
debt expense for tax purposes amounts in excess of actual losses. In
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, such financial
institutions were not required to provide deferred income taxes on such excess.
Recapture of the excess tax bad debt reserve established under the previously
allowed method will result in taxable income if M&T Bank fails to maintain bank
status as defined in the Internal Revenue Code or charges are made to the
reserve for other than bad debt losses. At December 31, 2001 M&T Bank’s tax
bad debt reserve for which no federal income taxes have been provided was
$74,021,000. No actions are planned that would cause this reserve to become
wholly or partially taxable.

The portion of income taxes attributable to gains or losses on sales of
bank investment securities was an expense of $724,000 and $639,000 in 2001 and
1999, respectively, and a benefit of $1,216,000 in 2000. No alternative
minimum tax expense was recognized in 2001, 2000 or 1999.

Deposits at M&T Bank’s offshore branch office were $777,895,000 and
$244,511,000 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

16. Derivative financial instruments

As described in note 1, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended, as of January 1,
2001. The January 1, 2001 transition adjustment prescribed by SFAS No. 133 was
not material to the Company’s consolidated financial position or its results of
operations.

As part of managing interest rate risk, the Company has entered into
several interest rate swap agreements. The agreements modify the repricing
characteristics of certain portions of the Company’s portfolios of earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate swap agreements are
generally entered into with counterparties that meet established credit
standards and most contain collateral provisions protecting the at-risk party.
The Company considers the credit risk inherent in these contracts to be
negligible.

-104-


M&T BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements, continued

16. Derivative financial instruments, continued

Beginning January 1, 2001, the Company has designated its interest rate
swap agreements utilized in the management of interest rate risk as either fair
value hedges or cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS No. 133. The Company
utilizes interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges to
protect its exposure to changes in the fair value of certain recognized assets
and liabilities. The Company also utilizes an interest rate swap agreement
designated as a cash flow hedge to protect against the variability in cash
flows of variable rate long-term borrowings.

Information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest
rate risk management purposes summarized by type of financial instrument the
swap agreements were intended to hedge or modify follows:

(a)

Under the terms of these agreements, the Company receives settlement
amounts at a variable rate and pays at a fixed rate.

(b)

Under the terms of these agreements, the Company receives settlement
amounts at a fixed rate and pays at a variable rate.

The estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements represents the
amount the Company would have expected to receive (pay) to terminate such
contracts. At December 31, 2001, the estimated fair value of interest rate swap
agreements designated as fair value hedges was substantially offset by
unrealized gains and losses on the changes in fair value of the hedged items.
The estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as cash
flow hedges, net of applicable income taxes, is included in “accumulated other
comprehensive income, net” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2001. For periods prior to January 1, 2001, the estimated fair
value of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk
management purposes was not recognized in the consolidated financial
statements, except for swap agreements that modified the repricing
characteristics of investment securities classified as available for sale.
Changes in the fair value of such swap agreements and investment securities
were included in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes.

At December 31, 2001 the notional amount of interest rate swaps
outstanding mature as follows:

The net effect of interest rate swap agreements was to increase net
interest income by $6,720,000 in 2001, $13,000 in 2000 and $26,100,000 in 1999.
The average notional amount of interest rate swap agreements impacting net
interest income which were entered into for interest rate risk management
purposes were $522,730,000 in 2001, $875,933,000 in 2000 and $1,944,813,000 in
1999.

In anticipation of M&T Bank’s issuance of $500 million of fixed rate
subordinated capital notes in October 2000, the Company terminated certain
interest rate swap agreements, including forward-starting agreements, with an
aggregate notional amount of $421 million. Under the terms of the terminated
agreements, the Company was required to make fixed-rate payments and receive
variable-rate payments. The termination of the agreements, which had been
entered into to hedge interest rate risk associated with fixed-rate commercial
real estate loans, resulted in a net deferred gain of $15,460,000 which is being
recognized in income over the designated hedge period of the agreements.
Income recognized in 2001 and 2000 related to the terminated swap agreements
totaled $1,834,000 and $311,000, respectively. The net increase in interest
income in future years from amortization of the deferred gain related to the
interest rate swap terminations is as follows:

The Company utilizes commitments to sell residential real estate loans to
hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of residential real estate
loans held for sale. Beginning January 1, 2001, such commitments have been
designated as fair value hedges and, as a result, the commitments and the
hedged loans are recorded at estimated fair value. The Company also utilizes
commitments to sell residential real estate loans to offset the exposure to
changes in the fair value of certain commitments to originate residential real
estate loans for sale. As a result of these activities, included in mortgage
banking revenues for 2001 were net unrealized pre-tax gains related to loans
held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale, and commitments to sell
loans of approximately $8 million. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 133,
residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments to sell
loans and to originate loans for sale were recorded at the lower of aggregate
cost or fair market value.

The amount of hedge ineffectiveness of both fair value and cash flow
hedges recognized in 2001 was not material to the Company’s results of
operations.

Derivative financial instruments used for trading purposes included
foreign exchange and other option contracts, foreign exchange forward and spot
contracts, interest rate swap contracts and financial futures. The

17. Disclosures about fair value of financial instruments

SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,” requires
disclosure of the estimated “fair value” of financial instruments. “Fair
value” is generally defined as the price a willing buyer and a willing seller
would exchange for a financial instrument in other than a distressed sale
situation. Disclosures related to fair value presented herein are as of
December 31, 2001 and 2000.

With the exception of marketable securities, certain off-balance sheet
financial instruments and one-to-four family residential mortgage loans
originated for sale, the Company’s financial instruments are not readily
marketable and market prices do not exist. The Company, in attempting to
comply with the provisions of SFAS No. 107, has not attempted to market its
financial instruments to potential buyers, if any exist. Since negotiated
prices in illiquid markets depend greatly upon the then present motivations of
the buyer and seller, it is reasonable to assume that actual sales prices
could vary widely from any estimate of fair value made without the benefit of
negotiations. Additionally, changes in market interest rates can dramatically
impact the value of financial instruments in a short period of time.

The estimated fair values of investments in readily marketable debt and
equity securities were based on quoted market prices at the respective
year-end. In arriving at estimated fair value of other financial instruments,
the
Company generally used calculations based upon discounted cash flows of the
related financial instruments. In general, discount rates used for loan
products were based on the Company’s pricing at the respective year-end. A
higher discount rate was assumed with respect to estimated cash flows
associated with nonaccrual loans.

As more fully described in note 3, the carrying value and estimated fair

the overall level of credit risk inherent in the portfolio and totaled
$425,008,000 and $374,703,000 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

As described in note 16, the Company enters into various commitments to
originate residential real estate loans for sale and commitments to sell
residential real estate loans. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, beginning
January 1, 2001 such commitments are considered to be derivative financial
instruments and therefore, are carried at estimated fair value on the
consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair values of such commitments were
generally calculated based on quoted market prices for commitments to sell
residential real estate loans to certain government sponsored entities
and other parties. The Company’s commitments to originate residential real
estate loans for sale represented aggregate fair value gains (losses) of
$(2,795,000) at December 31, 2001 and $2,740,000 at December 31, 2000. The
Company’s commitments to sell residential real estate loans represented
aggregate fair value gains (losses) of $8,862,000 at December 31, 2001 and
$(4,176,000) at December 31, 2000. Unrealized fair value gains and losses at
December 31, 2001 are included in other assets and other liabilities,
respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet. Unrealized fair value gains
and losses at December 31, 2000 were not recognized in the consolidated

balance sheet because the aggregate market value of residential real estate
loans held for sale and related commitments to sell loans and to originate
loans for sale exceeded the cost of such items.

As described in note 18, in the normal course of business, various
commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding, such as loan
commitments, credit guarantees and letters of credit. The Company’s pricing
of such financial instruments is based largely on credit quality and
relationship, probability of funding and other requirements. Commitments
generally have fixed expiration dates and contain termination and other clauses
which provide for relief from funding in the event of significant
deterioration in the credit quality of the customer. The rates and terms of
the Company’s loan commitments, credit guarantees and letters of credit are
competitive with other financial institutions operating in markets served by
the Company. The Company believes that the carrying amounts are reasonable
estimates of the fair value of these financial instruments. Other than
residential real estate loan-related commitments described above, such carrying
amounts, comprised principally of unamortized fee income, are included in other
liabilities and totaled $7,733,000 and $8,624,000 at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

SFAS No. 107 requires that the estimated fair value ascribed to
noninterest-bearing deposits, savings deposits and NOW accounts be established
at carrying value because of the customers’ ability to withdraw
funds immediately. Additionally, time deposit accounts are required to be
revalued based upon prevailing market interest rates for similar maturity
instruments.

The following summarizes the results of these calculations:

The Company believes that deposit accounts have a value greater than that
prescribed by SFAS No. 107. The Company feels, however, that the value
associated with these deposits is greatly influenced by characteristics of the
buyer, such as the ability to reduce the costs of servicing the deposits and
deposit attrition which often occurs following an acquisition. Accordingly,
estimating the fair value of deposits with any degree of certainty is not
practical.

As more fully described in note 16, the Company had entered into
interest rate swap agreements for purposes of managing the Company’s exposure
to changing interest rates. The estimated fair value of interest rate swap
agreements represents the amount the Company would have expected to receive or

As described in note 16, the Company also uses certain derivative
financial instruments as part of its trading activities. Interest rate
contracts entered into for trading purposes had notional values and estimated
fair value gains of $1.4 billion and $1,083,000, respectively, at December 31,
2001 and notional values and estimated fair value gains of $769 million and
$81,000, respectively, at December 31, 2000. The Company also entered into
foreign exchange and other option and futures contracts totaling approximately
$242 million and $293 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Such contracts were valued at losses of $185,000 and $444,000 at December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively. All trading account assets and liabilities are
recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair value. The fair
values of all trading account assets and liabilities were $39 million and $27
million, respectively, at December 31, 2001 and $37 million and $22 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2000.

Due to the near maturity of other money-market assets and short-term
borrowings, the Company estimates that the carrying value of such instruments
approximates estimated fair value. The carrying value and estimated fair value
of long-term borrowings were $3,461,769,000 and $3,505,520,000, respectively,
at December 31, 2001 and $3,414,516,000 and $3,392,049,000, respectively, at
December 31, 2000.

The Company does not believe that the estimated fair value information
presented herein is representative of the earnings power or value of the
Company. The preceding analysis, which is inherently limited in depicting fair
value, also does not consider any value associated with existing customer
relationships nor the ability of the Company to create value through
loan origination, deposit gathering or fee generating activities.

Many of the fair value estimates presented herein are based upon the use
of highly subjective information and assumptions and, accordingly, the results
may not be precise. Management believes that fair value estimates may not be
comparable between financial institutions due to the wide range of permitted
valuation techniques and numerous estimates which must be made. Furthermore,
since the disclosed fair value amounts were estimated as of the balance sheet
date, the amounts actually realized or paid upon maturity or settlement of the
various financial instruments could be significantly different.

18. Commitments and contingencies

In the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent
liabilities are outstanding, such as commitments to extend credit guarantees
and “standby” letters of credit (approximately $884,517,000 and $894,170,000 at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively) which are not reflected in the
consolidated financial statements. No material losses are expected as a

result of these transactions. Additionally, the Company had outstanding
commitments to originate loans of approximately $5.5 billion and $5.0 billion
at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Since many loan commitments,
credit guarantees and “standby” letters of credit expire without being funded
in whole or part, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of
future cash flows. Commitments to sell one-to-four family residential
mortgage loans totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2001 and $555 million at
December 31, 2000.

M&T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course of business to
various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary
damages are asserted. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, does
not anticipate that the aggregate ultimate liability, if any, arising out of
litigation pending against M&T or its subsidiaries will be material to the
Company’s consolidated financial position, but at the present time is not in a
position to determine whether such litigation will have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations in any future
reporting period.

19. Segment information

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures About Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information,” reportable segments have been
determined based upon the Company’s internal profitability reporting system,
which is organized by strategic business units. Certain strategic
business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes
where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer and the
distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable
segments are Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary
Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking.

The financial information of the Company’s segments has been compiled
utilizing the accounting policies described in note 1 with certain exceptions.
The more significant of these exceptions are described herein. The Company
allocates interest income or interest expense using a methodology
that charges users of funds (assets) interest expense and credits providers of
funds (liabilities) with income based on the maturity, prepayment and/or
repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities. The net effect of
this allocation is recorded in the “All Other” category. A provision for
credit losses is allocated to segments in an amount based largely on actual net
charge-offs incurred by the segment during the period plus or minus an amount
necessary to adjust the segment’s allowance for credit losses due to changes in
loan balances. In contrast, the level of the consolidated
provision for credit losses is determined using the methodologies described in
note 1 to assess the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.
Indirect fixed and variable expenses incurred by certain centralized support
areas are allocated to segments based on actual usage (for example, volume
measurements) and other criteria. Certain types of administrative expenses and
bankwide expense accruals (including amortization of goodwill and core deposit
intangible) are generally not allocated to segments. Income taxes are
allocated to segments based on the Company’s marginal statutory tax rate
adjusted for any tax-exempt income or non-deductible expenses. Equity is
allocated to the segments based on regulatory capital requirements and in
proportion to an assessment of the inherent risks associated with the business
of the segment (including interest, credit and operating risk).

The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling
segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial
accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to generally

accepted accounting principles. As a result, reported segment results are not
necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial
institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation
methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment
financial data. Information about the Company’s segments is presented in the
accompanying table.

The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products
and banking services for middle-market and large commercial customers, largely
within the markets the Company serves. Among the services provided by this
segment are commercial lending and leasing, deposit products and cash
management services. The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit
services which are secured by various types of multifamily residential and
commercial real estate and deposit services to its customers. The
Discretionary Portfolio segment includes securities, residential mortgage loans
and other assets; short-term and long-term borrowed funds; brokered
certificates of deposit and interest rate swap agreements related thereto; and
offshore branch deposits. This segment also provides services to commercial
customers and consumers which include foreign exchange, securities trading and
municipal bond underwriting and sales. The Residential Mortgage Banking
segment originates and services residential mortgage loans for consumers and
sells substantially all of those loans in the secondary market to investors or
to bank subsidiaries of M&T. Residential mortgage loans held for sale
are included in the Residential Mortgage Banking segment. The Retail Banking
segment offers a variety of consumer and small business services through
several delivery channels which include traditional and “in-store” banking
offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and internet banking.
The “All Other” category includes other operating activities of the Company
that are not directly attributable to the reported segments as determined in
accordance with SFAS No. 131, the difference between the provision for credit
losses and the calculated provision allocated to the reportable segments,
goodwill and core deposit intangible resulting from acquisitions of financial
institutions, the net impact of the Company’s internal funds transfer pricing
methodology, eliminations of transactions between reportable segments, certain
nonrecurring transactions, the residual effects of unallocated support systems
and general and administrative expenses, and the impact of interest rate risk
management strategies. The amount of intersegment activity eliminated in
arriving at consolidated totals was included in the “All Other” category as
follows:

(a)

Net interest income is the difference between actual taxable-equivalent
interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities owned by a
segment and a funding charge (credit) based on the Company’s internal
funds transfer pricing methodology. Segments are charged a cost to fund
any assets (e.g. loans) and are paid a funding credit for any funds
provided (e.g. deposits). The taxable-equivalent adjustment aggregated
$17,513,000 in 2001, $10,547,000 in 2000 and $7,710,000 in 1999 and is
eliminated in “All Other” net interest income and income tax expense

20. Regulatory matters

Payment of dividends by M&T’s banking subsidiaries is restricted by various
legal and regulatory limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T
are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current
year and the preceding two years. For purposes of this test, at December 31,
2001, approximately $443,435,000 was available for payment of dividends to M&T
from banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval.

Banking regulations prohibit extensions of credit by the subsidiary banks
to M&T unless appropriately secured by assets. Securities of affiliates are
not eligible as collateral for this purpose.

The bank subsidiaries are required to maintain noninterest-earning
reserves against certain deposit liabilities. During the maintenance periods
that included December 31, 2001 and 2000, cash and due from banks included a
daily average of $287,830,000 and $242,028,000, respectively, for such purpose.

Federal regulators have adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank
holding companies and banks. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by
regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on the Company’s
financial statements. Under the capital adequacy guidelines, the so-called
“Tier 1 capital” and “Total capital” as a percentage of risk-weighted assets
and certain off-balance sheet financial instruments must be at least 4% and 8%,
respectively. In addition to these risk-based measures, regulators also
require banking institutions that meet certain qualitative criteria to maintain
a minimum “leverage” ratio of “Tier 1 capital” to average total assets,
adjusted for goodwill and certain other items, of at least 3% to be considered
adequately capitalized. As of December 31, 2001, M&T and each of its banking
subsidiaries exceeded all applicable capital adequacy requirements.

As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the most recent notifications from
federal regulators categorized each of M&T’s bank subsidiaries as well
capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.
To be considered well capitalized, a banking institution must maintain Tier 1
risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and leverage ratios of at least
6%, 10% and 5%, respectively. Management is unaware of any conditions or
events since the latest notifications from federal regulators that have changed
the capital adequacy category of M&T’s bank subsidiaries.

22. Subsequent event

The Company adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” as of
January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 revises the accounting for purchased intangible
assets and, in general, requires that goodwill no longer be amortized, but
rather that it be tested for impairment. Other acquired intangible assets with
finite lives, such as core deposit intangibles, are required to be amortized
over their estimated useful economic lives and be reviewed for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets.” Effective January 1, 2002, the Company ceased amortization
of substantially all of its goodwill, which will have a material impact on
future results of operations. Had SFAS No. 142 been in effect prior to January
1, 2002, amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets would have
been approximately $60 million, $34 million and $18 million during the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Amortization of such
assets is expected to be approximately $51 million in 2002. SFAS No. 142
requires entities to complete a transitional test for impairment of goodwill
within six months of adoption. The Company has not yet completed such
transitional impairment test and, therefore, the full impact of adoption of
SFAS No. 142 is not yet estimable.
