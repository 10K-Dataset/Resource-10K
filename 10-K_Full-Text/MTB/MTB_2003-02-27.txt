M&T BANK CORPORATION

FORM 10-K

For the year ended

PART I

Item 1.

Business.

M&T Bank Corporation (“Registrant” or “M&T”) is a New York business corporation
which is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”) and under Article III-A of the New York
Banking Law (“Banking Law”). The principal executive offices of the Registrant
are located at One M&T Plaza, Buffalo, New York 14203. The Registrant was
incorporated in November 1969. The Registrant and its direct and indirect
subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the “Company.” As of
December 31, 2002 the Company had consolidated total assets of $33.2 billion,
deposits of $21.7 billion and stockholders’ equity of $3.2 billion. The
Company had 8,044 full-time and 1,153 part-time employees as of December 31,
2002.

At December 31, 2002, the Registrant had two wholly owned bank subsidiaries:
Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T Bank”) and M&T Bank, National
Association (“M&T Bank, N.A.”). The banks collectively offer a wide range of
commercial banking, trust and investment services to their customers. At
December 31, 2002, M&T Bank represented 98% of consolidated assets of the
Company.

The Company from time to time considers acquiring banks, thrift institutions,
branch offices or other businesses within markets currently served by the
Company or in other locations that would complement the Company’s business or
its geographic reach. The Company has pursued acquisition opportunities in the
past, continues to review different opportunities, including the possibility of
major acquisitions, and intends to continue this practice.

Pending Acquisition of Allfirst Financial Inc.

On September 26, 2002, M&T agreed to acquire Allfirst Financial Inc.
(“Allfirst”), a bank holding company headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. As
of December 31, 2002, Allfirst reported total assets of approximately $17.0
billion, total deposits of approximately $11.3 billion, total loans (net of
unearned portion) of approximately $10.4 billion, and total shareholders’
equity of approximately $1.7 billion. Allfirst has a strong banking presence
in Maryland and central Pennsylvania. Allfirst and its subsidiaries serve
customers through a network of 258 full service offices and approximately 600
ATMs in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Allied Irish Banks,
p.l.c. (“AIB”) currently controls 100% of the voting power of Allfirst’s
outstanding capital stock.

Allfirst’s primary subsidiary bank is Allfirst Bank, which operates in
Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Delaware and the District of Columbia.
Allfirst Bank’s bank and non-bank subsidiaries offer a variety of financial
services, including trust and asset management, leasing, discount brokerage
services, sales of mutual funds and annuities, investment advisory services,
reinsurance, brokerage, mortgage banking and community development. One of the
most notable Allfirst non-banking activities is its trust and asset management
business with $15.7 billion in assets under management. Allied Investment
Advisors, the main institutional advisory subsidiary of Allfirst, currently
manages $10.4 billion in assets from 175 institutions.

If and when the Allfirst acquisition is consummated, the combined company will
be a banking franchise with over 700 branches in six states and the District of
Columbia, and with a leading deposit market share in the combined area of
upstate New York, central Pennsylvania and Maryland. On a pro forma basis as
of December 31, 2002, the combined company would have approximately $50 billion
in total assets, making M&T one of the 20 largest bank holding companies in the
United States based on total assets.

Under the terms of the Agreement and
Plan of Reorganization dated September 26,
2002 by and among AIB, Allfirst and M&T (the
“Reorganization Agreement”), M&T will combine with Allfirst through the acquisition of all of the
issued and outstanding Allfirst stock in exchange for 26,700,000 shares of M&T
common

-5-


stock and $886,107,000 in cash to be
issued or paid to AIB. Immediately thereafter, and as part of the proposed transaction, Allfirst will
merge with and into M&T, with M&T being the surviving company. Allfirst Bank
will then merge with and into M&T Bank, with M&T Bank being the surviving bank.
On December 16, 2002, the shareholders of M&T approved the Allfirst
acquisition, which remains conditioned upon receipt of the required regulatory
approvals. The Allfirst acquisition is expected to be completed shortly after
the end of the first quarter of 2003.

As a result of the transaction, AIB will own approximately 22.5% of the issued
and outstanding shares of M&T common stock. Further, there are several M&T
corporate governance changes that will result from the transaction. After the
transaction, while it maintains a significant ownership in M&T, AIB will have
representation on the M&T board, the M&T Bank board and key M&T board
committees and will have certain protections of its rights as a substantial M&T
shareholder. In addition, AIB will have rights that will facilitate its
ability to maintain its proportionate ownership position in M&T. M&T will also
have representation on the AIB board after the transaction while AIB remains a
significant shareholder. The following is a description of the
ongoing relationship between M&T and AIB that will result from
the Allfirst acquisition. The following description is qualified in
its entirety by the terms of the Reorganization Agreement. The
Reorganization Agreement was filed with the Securities Exchange
Commission on October 3, 2002 as Exhibit 2 to the Current
Report on Form 8-K of M&T dated September 26, 2002.

Board of Directors; Management

After the Allfirst acquisition, AIB will hold approximately 22.5% of the issued
and outstanding shares of M&T common stock. In defining their relationship
after the acquisition, M&T and AIB have negotiated certain agreements regarding
share ownership and corporate governance issues such as board representation,
with the number of AIB’s representatives on the M&T and M&T Bank boards of
directors being dependent upon the amount of M&T common stock held by AIB. M&T
will have a right to nominate one member of the AIB board of directors,
reasonably acceptable to AIB, until AIB no longer holds at least 15% of the
outstanding shares of M&T common stock. Effective upon the date of the
consummation of the Allfirst acquisition (the “Closing Date”), the M&T board of
directors will include four members designated by AIB, each of whom must be
reasonably acceptable to M&T (collectively, the “AIB Designees”). Further, the
M&T board of directors will elect, as of the Closing Date, one of the AIB
Designees to each of the Executive Committee, Nomination and Compensation
Committee and Audit Committee (or any committee or committees performing
comparable functions) of the M&T board of directors. Any such AIB Designees
will meet the requisite independence and expertise requirements prescribed
under applicable law or stock exchange rules. In addition, the board of
directors of M&T Bank will include four members designated by AIB, each of whom
must be reasonably acceptable to M&T.

From and after the Closing Date, as long as AIB remains a significant
shareholder of M&T, AIB will have representation on the boards of directors of
both M&T and M&T Bank as follows:

•

As long as AIB holds at least 15% of the outstanding shares of M&T common
stock, AIB will be entitled to designate four persons on both the M&T and
M&T Bank boards of directors and representation on the committees of the
M&T board described above.

•

If AIB holds at least 10%, but less than 15%, of the outstanding shares of
M&T common stock, AIB will be entitled to designate at least two people on
both the M&T and M&T Bank boards of directors.

•

If AIB’s ownership interest in M&T is at least 5%, but less than 10%, of
the outstanding shares of M&T common stock, AIB will be entitled to

-6-


designate at least one person on both the M&T and M&T Bank boards of
directors.

•

As long as AIB holds at least 15% of the outstanding shares of M&T common
stock, neither M&T’s board of directors nor M&T Bank’s board of directors
will consist of more than twenty-eight directors without the consent of
the AIB Designees.

•

If AIB’s holdings of M&T common stock fall below 15%, but not lower than
12% of the outstanding shares of M&T common stock, AIB will continue to
have the same rights that it would have had if it owned 15% of the
outstanding shares of M&T common stock, as long as AIB restores its
ownership percentage to 15% within one year. Additionally, as described
in more detail below, M&T has agreed to repurchase shares of M&T common
stock in order to offset dilution to AIB’s ownership interests that may
otherwise be caused by issuances of M&T common stock under M&T employee
and director benefit or stock purchase plans. Dilution of AIB’s ownership
position caused by such issuances will not be counted in determining
whether the “Sunset Date” has occurred or whether any of AIB’s other
rights under the Reorganization Agreement have terminated. The “Sunset
Date” is the date on which AIB no longer holds at least 15% of the M&T
common stock, calculated as described in this paragraph.

The initial AIB Designees will be identified in M&T’s definitive Proxy
Statement for the 2003 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Robert G. Wilmers will
continue as Chairman, President and CEO of M&T and chairman and CEO of M&T
Bank. It is expected that Mr. Wilmers will also join the AIB board of
directors, as a non-executive director and M&T’s designee.

Amendments to M&T’s Bylaws

Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, M&T has agreed to amend and restate
its bylaws. The following is a description of the amended bylaws, which will
take effect on the Closing Date.

The amended bylaws will provide that, from and after the Closing Date until the
Sunset Date, the M&T board of directors may not take or make any recommendation
to M&T shareholders regarding the following actions without the approval of the
Executive Committee, including the approval of the AIB Designee serving on the
committee:

•

Any amendment of M&T’s Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws that would
be inconsistent with the rights described herein or that would otherwise
have an adverse effect on the board representation, committee
representation or other rights of AIB contemplated by the Reorganization
Agreement;

•

Any activity not permissible for a U.S. bank holding company;

•

The adoption of any shareholder rights plan or other measures having the
purpose or effect of preventing or materially delaying completion of any
transaction involving a change in control of M&T; and

•

Any public announcement disclosing M&T’s desire or intention to take any
of the foregoing actions.

The amended bylaws will also provide that, from and after the Closing Date
until the Sunset Date, the M&T board of directors may only take or make any
recommendation to M&T shareholders regarding the following actions if the
action has been approved by the Executive Committee (in the case of the first
four items and sixth item below) or Nomination and Compensation Committee (in
the case of the fifth item below) and the members of such committee not voting
in favor of the action do not include the AIB Designee serving on such
committee and at least one other member of the committee who is not an AIB
Designee:

-7-


The amended bylaws will also contain provisions reflecting the AIB
rights described above under the caption “Board of Directors;
Management.”

At the Special Meeting of M&T stockholders held on December 16, 2002, M&T’s
stockholders approved an amendment to M&T’s Certificate of Incorporation. This
amendment provides that the provisions of the bylaws described above may not be
amended or repealed without the unanimous approval of the entire M&T board of
directors or the approval of the holders of not less than 80% of the
outstanding shares of M&T common stock. The provisions of the bylaws described
above will automatically terminate when AIB holds less than 5% of the
outstanding shares of M&T common stock, as determined under the Reorganization
Agreement.

Investment Parameters

The Reorganization Agreement provides that, from the Closing Date through the
second anniversary of the Sunset Date, without prior written consent of the M&T
board of directors, AIB will not, directly or indirectly, acquire or offer to
acquire (except by way of stock dividends, offerings made available to M&T
shareholders generally, or pursuant to compensation plans) more than 25% of the
then outstanding shares of M&T common stock. Further, during this period, AIB
and AIB’s subsidiaries have agreed not to participate in any proxy solicitation
or to otherwise seek to influence any M&T shareholder with respect to the
voting of any shares of M&T common stock for the approval of any shareholder
proposals.

The Reorganization Agreement also provides that, during this period, AIB will
not make any public announcement with respect to any proposal or offer by AIB
or any AIB subsidiary with respect to certain transactions (such as mergers,
business combinations, tender or exchange offers, the sale or purchase of
securities or similar transactions) involving M&T or any of the M&T
subsidiaries. The Reorganization Agreement also provides that, during this
period, AIB may not subject any shares of M&T common stock to any voting trust
or voting arrangement or agreement and will not execute any written consent as
a shareholder with respect to the M&T common stock.

-8-


The Reorganization Agreement also provides that, during this period, AIB will
not seek to control or influence the management, the board of directors of M&T
or policies of M&T, including through communications with shareholders of M&T
or otherwise, except through non-public communications with the directors of
M&T, including the AIB Designees.

These restrictions on AIB will no longer apply if a third party commences or
announces its intention to commence a tender offer or an exchange offer and,
within a reasonable time, the M&T board of directors either does not recommend
that shareholders not accept the offer or fails to adopt a shareholders rights
plan, or if M&T or M&T Bank becomes subject to any regulatory capital directive
or becomes an institution in “troubled” condition under applicable banking
regulations. However, in the event the tender offer or exchange offer is not
commenced or consummated in accordance with its terms, the restrictions on AIB
described above will thereafter continue to apply.

Anti-Dilution Protections

M&T has agreed that, after the Closing Date and until the Sunset Date, in the
event M&T issues shares of M&T stock (other than certain issuances to employees
pursuant to option and benefit plans), subject to applicable law and regulatory
requirements, AIB will have the right to purchase at fair market value up to
the number of shares of M&T common stock required to increase or maintain its
equity interest in M&T to 22.5% of the then outstanding M&T common stock.

M&T has also agreed that following the Closing Date until the Sunset Date, in
connection with any issuance of M&T stock pursuant to employee option or
benefit plans, M&T will as soon as reasonably practicable, taking into account
applicable law, regulatory capital requirements, capital planning and risk
management, take such necessary actions so that AIB’s proportionate ownership
of M&T common stock is not reduced as a result of such issuances, including by
funding such issuances through purchases of M&T common stock in the open market
or by undertaking share repurchase programs. M&T has agreed that, subject to
applicable law, in the event that, as of the Closing Date, the stock that AIB
is entitled to receive in connection with the Allfirst acquisition represents
less than 22.5% of M&T’s outstanding common stock, M&T will repurchase prior to
December 31, 2003 a sufficient number of shares of outstanding M&T common stock
so that the amount of stock that AIB receives as of the Closing Date will equal
22.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of M&T common stock. If for any
reason M&T does not repurchase shares as required by the first sentence of this
paragraph within one year following the employee issuance or as required by the
second sentence of this paragraph by December 31, 2003, then the shares of M&T
common stock issued pursuant to such employee issuance will be deemed to be an
issuance occurring on the last day of the relevant period and will entitle AIB
to the anti-dilution purchase rights described in the immediately preceding
paragraph. No reduction in AIB’s percentage ownership of the outstanding M&T
common stock resulting from any issuance of shares that are subject to M&T’s
repurchase obligations as described in this paragraph will be taken into
account in determining whether the Sunset Date has occurred or whether any of
AIB’s other rights under the Reorganization Agreement have terminated.

Sale of M&T Common Stock; Right of First Refusal in Certain Circumstances

The M&T common stock to be issued to AIB in connection with the Allfirst
acquisition will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
“Securities Act”) and may only be disposed of by AIB pursuant to an effective
registration statement or pursuant to an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act and subject to the provisions of the Reorganization Agreement.
These shares of M&T common stock will be the subject of a registration rights
agreement to be entered into between AIB and M&T prior to the completion of the
Allfirst acquisition.

-9-


The form of registration rights agreement that has been agreed to by M&T and
AIB provides that upon AIB’s request, M&T will file a registration statement
relating to all or a portion of AIB’s shares of M&T common stock providing for
the sale of such shares by AIB from time to time on a continuous basis pursuant
to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, provided that M&T need only effect one
such “shelf registration” in any 12-month period. In addition, the form of
registration rights agreement provides that AIB is entitled to demand
registration under the Securities Act of all or part of its shares of M&T
stock, provided that M&T is not obligated to effect two such “demand
registrations” in any 12-month period. Any demand or shelf registration must
cover no less than one million shares.

The form of registration rights agreement further provides that in the event
M&T proposes to file a registration statement other than pursuant to a shelf
registration or demand registration or Forms S-8 or S-4, for an offering and
sale of shares by M&T in an underwritten offering or an offering and sale of
shares on behalf of one or more selling shareholders, M&T must give AIB notice
at least 15 days prior to the anticipated filing date, and AIB may request that
all or a portion of its M&T common shares be included in the registration
statement. M&T will honor the request, unless the managing underwriter advises
M&T in writing that in its opinion the inclusion of all shares requested to be
included by M&T, the other selling shareholders, if any, and AIB would
materially and adversely affect the offering, in which case M&T may limit the
number of shares included in the offering to a number that would not reasonably
be expected to have such an effect. In such event, the number of shares to be
included in the registration statement shall first include the number of shares
requested to be included by M&T and then the shares requested by other selling
shareholders, including AIB, on a pro rata basis according to the number of
shares requested to be included in the registration statement by each
shareholder.

As long as AIB holds 5% or more of the outstanding shares of M&T common stock,
AIB will not dispose of any of its shares of M&T common stock except, subject
to the terms and conditions of the Reorganization Agreement and applicable law,
in a widely dispersed public distribution; a private placement in which no one
party acquires the right to purchase more than 2% of the outstanding shares of
M&T common stock; an assignment to a single party (such as a broker or
investment banker) for the purpose of conducting a widely dispersed public
distribution on AIB’s behalf; pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act;
pursuant to a tender or exchange offer to M&T’s shareholders not opposed by
M&T’s board of directors, or open market purchase programs made by M&T; with
the consent of M&T, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, to a
controlled subsidiary of AIB; or pursuant to M&T’s right of first refusal as
described below.

The Reorganization Agreement provides that until AIB no longer holds at least
5% of the outstanding shares of M&T common stock, if AIB wishes to sell or
otherwise transfer any of its shares of M&T common stock other than as
described in the preceding paragraph, AIB must first submit an offer notice to
M&T identifying the proposed transferee and setting forth the proposed terms of
the transaction, which shall be limited to sales for cash, cash equivalents or
marketable securities. M&T will have the right, for 20 days following receipt
of an offer notice from AIB, to purchase all (but not less than all) of the
shares of M&T common stock that AIB wishes to sell, on the proposed terms
specified in the offer notice. If M&T declines or fails to respond to the
offer notice within 20 days, AIB may sell all or a portion of the M&T shares
specified in the offer notice to the proposed transferee at a purchase price
equal to or greater than the price specified in the offer notice, at any time
during the three months following the date of the offer notice, or, if prior
notification to or approval of the sale by the Federal Reserve Board or another
regulatory agency is required, AIB shall pursue regulatory approval
expeditiously and the sale may occur on the first date permitted under
applicable law.

Certain Post-Closing Bank Regulatory Matters

After the Allfirst acquisition, it is expected that the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve Board”) will deem AIB to be M&T’s
bank holding company for purposes of the BHCA. In addition, it is also
expected that the New York Banking Superintendent (“Banking Superintendent”)
will deem AIB to be M&T’s bank holding company for purposes of Article III-A of
the Banking Law. Among other things, this means that, should M&T propose to
make an acquisition or engage in a new type of activity that requires the
submission of an application or notice to the Federal Reserve Board or the
Banking Superintendent, AIB, as well as M&T, may also be required to file an
application or notice. The Reorganization Agreement provides that AIB will
make any applications, notices or filings that M&T determines to be necessary
or desirable, provided that AIB is not required to incur any expense or make
any commitment in connection with this obligation, nor is it required to submit
any application or give any notice with respect to any proposed acquisition by
M&T of a banking institution headquartered in Ireland or Poland. The
Reorganization Agreement also requires AIB not to take any action that would
have a material adverse effect on M&T and to advise M&T prior to entering into
any material transaction or activity. These provisions of the Reorganization
Agreement would no longer apply if AIB ceased to be M&T’s bank holding
company and also was not otherwise considered to control M&T for
purposes of the BHCA.

Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, if, as a result of any administrative
enforcement action under Section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the
“FDI Act”), memorandum of understanding, written agreement, supervisory letter
or any other action or determination of any regulatory agency relating to the
status of AIB (but not relating to the conduct of M&T or any subsidiary of
M&T), M&T or M&T Bank also becomes subject to such an action, memorandum,
agreement or letter that relates to M&T or any M&T subsidiary, or experiences
any fact, event or circumstance that affects M&T’s regulatory status or
compliance, and that in either case would be reasonably likely to create a
material burden on M&T or to cause any material adverse economic or operating
consequences to M&T or an M&T subsidiary (a “Material Regulatory Event”), then
M&T will notify AIB thereof in writing as promptly as practicable. Should AIB
fail to cure the Material Regulatory Event within 90 days following the receipt
of such notice, AIB will, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than
30 days from the end of the cure period, take any and all such actions (with
the reasonable cooperation of M&T as requested by AIB) as may be necessary or
advisable in order that it no longer has “control” of M&T for purposes of the
BHCA, including, if necessary, by selling some or all of its shares of M&T
common stock (subject to the right of first refusal provisions of the
Reorganization Agreement) and divesting itself as required of its board and
committee representation and governance rights as set forth in the
Reorganization Agreement. If, at the end of such 30-day period, the Material
Regulatory Event is continuing and AIB has not terminated its control of M&T,
then M&T will have the right to repurchase, at fair market value, such amount
of the M&T common stock owned by AIB as would result in AIB holding no less
than 4.9% of the outstanding shares of M&T common stock, pursuant to the
procedures detailed in the Reorganization Agreement.

As long as AIB is considered to “control” M&T for purposes of the BHCA or the
federal Change in Bank Control Act, if AIB acquires any insured depository
institution with total assets greater than 25% of the assets of M&T’s largest
insured depository institution subsidiary, then within two years AIB must
terminate its affiliation with the insured depository institution or take such
steps as may be necessary so that none of M&T’s bank subsidiaries would be
subject to “cross guarantee” liability for losses incurred if the institution
AIB acquired potentially were to fail. This liability applies under the FDI
Act to insured depository institutions that are commonly controlled. The
actions AIB would take could include disposing of shares of M&T common stock
and/or surrendering its representation or governance rights. Also, if such an
insured depository institution that is controlled by AIB and of the size
described in the first sentence of this paragraph that would be considered to

-11-


be commonly controlled with M&T’s insured depository institution subsidiaries
fails to meet applicable requirements to be “adequately capitalized” under
applicable U.S. banking laws, then AIB will have to take the actions described
in the previous sentence no later than 180 days after the date that the
institution failed to meet those requirements, unless the institution is sooner
returned to “adequately capitalized” status.

Segment Information, Principal Products/Services

and Foreign Operations

Information about the Registrant’s business segments is included in note 20 of
Notes to Financial Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data” and is further discussed in Part II, Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.” The Registrant’s reportable segments have been determined based
upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by
strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined
for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and
services, the type of customer and the distribution of those products and
services are similar. The reportable segments are Commercial Banking,
Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking
and Retail Banking. The Company’s international activities are discussed in
note 16 of Notes to Financial Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8,
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

The only activities that, as a class, contributed 10% or more of the sum of
consolidated interest income and other income in each of the last three years
were lending and investment securities transactions. The amount of income from
such sources during those years is set forth on the Company’s Consolidated
Statement of Income filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data.”

Supervision and Regulation of the Company

The banking industry is subject to extensive state and federal regulation and
continues to undergo significant change. The following discussion summarizes
certain aspects of the banking laws and regulations that affect the Company.
Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are
frequently raised in Congress, in state legislatures, and before the various
bank regulatory agencies. The likelihood and timing of any changes and the
impact such changes might have on the Company are impossible to
determine with any certainty. A change in applicable laws or regulations, or a
change in the way such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory
agencies or courts, may have a material impact on the business, operations and
earnings of the Company. To the extent that the following information
describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified entirely by
reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provision.

Financial Services Modernization

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“Gramm-Leach”) enables combinations among
banks, securities firms and insurance companies. Under Gramm-Leach, bank
holding companies are permitted to offer their customers virtually any type of
financial service that is financial in nature or incidental thereto,
including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both underwriting and
agency), and merchant banking.

-15-


In order to engage in these new financial activities, a bank holding company
must qualify and register with the Federal Reserve
Board as a “financial holding company” by
demonstrating that each of its bank subsidiaries is “well capitalized,” “well
managed,” and has at least a “satisfactory” rating under the Community
Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”). M&T currently satisfies the qualifications
for registering as a financial holding company, but has not elected to do so to
date. If the Allfirst acquisition is completed, then for as long as AIB owns at least
15% of M&T’s outstanding common stock M&T may not become a financial holding
company without the approval of the Executive Committee of the M&T board of
directors, which must also include the affirmative approval of the AIB Designee
on such committee, as described above under the caption “Amendments to M&T’s
Bylaws.”

The financial activities authorized by Gramm-Leach may also be engaged in by a
“financial subsidiary” of a national or state bank, except for insurance or
annuity underwriting, insurance company portfolio investments, real estate
investment and development, and merchant banking, which must be conducted in a
financial holding company. In order for these financial activities to be
engaged in by a financial subsidiary of a national or state bank, Gramm-Leach
requires each of the parent bank (and its sister-bank affiliates) to be well
capitalized and well managed; the aggregate consolidated assets of all of that
bank’s financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of its
consolidated total assets or $50 billion; the bank must have at least a
satisfactory CRA rating; and, if that bank is one of the 100 largest national
banks, it must meet certain financial rating or other comparable requirements.
M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. currently satisfy the qualifications for engaging
in financial activities through financial subsidiaries, but neither has elected
to do so to date. Gramm-Leach also establishes a system of functional regulation, under which the
federal banking agencies will regulate the banking activities of financial
holding companies and banks’ financial subsidiaries, the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission will regulate their securities activities, and state
insurance regulators will regulate their insurance activities. Rules developed by the federal financial institutions regulators under
Gramm-Leach require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some
circumstances, allow consumers to prevent the disclosure of certain personal
information to nonaffiliated third parties. The foregoing
discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutory
provisions of Gramm-Leach and the implementing regulations which have been or
will be adopted by various government agencies pursuant to Gramm-Leach.

Bank Holding Company Regulation

As a registered bank holding company, the Registrant and its nonbank
subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation under the BHCA by the
Federal Reserve Board and under the Banking Law by the Banking Superintendent. The Federal Reserve Board requires regular reports from the
Registrant and is authorized by the BHCA to make regular examinations of the
Registrant and its subsidiaries.

The Registrant may not acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more
than 5% of the voting shares of any company, including a bank, without the
prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, except as specifically authorized
under the BHCA. The Registrant is also subject to regulation under the Banking
Law with respect to certain acquisitions of domestic banks. Under the BHCA, the
Registrant, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, may acquire
shares of non-banking corporations the activities of which are deemed by the Federal
Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or
managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.

The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement powers over bank holding companies
and their non-banking subsidiaries, among other things, to interdict activities
that represent unsafe or unsound practices or constitute violations of law,
rule, regulation, administrative orders or written agreements with a federal
bank regulator. These powers may be exercised through the issuance of
cease-and-desist orders, civil money penalties or other actions.

-16-


Under the Federal Reserve Board’s statement of policy with respect to bank
holding company operations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a
source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to
commit all available resources to support such institutions in circumstances
where it might not do so absent such policy. Although this “source of
strength” policy has been challenged in litigation, the Federal Reserve Board
continues to take the position that it has authority to enforce it. For a
discussion of circumstances under which a bank holding company may be required
to guarantee the capital levels or performance of its subsidiary
banks,

see

“Capital Adequacy,” below. Consistent with this “source of
strength” policy, the Federal Reserve Board
takes the position that a bank holding company generally should not maintain a
rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders
has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of
earnings retention appears to be consistent with the company’s capital needs,
asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve also has the authority to
terminate any activity of a bank holding company that constitutes a serious
risk to the financial soundness or stability of any subsidiary depository
institution or to terminate its control of any bank or nonbank subsidiaries.

The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as
amended (the “Interstate Banking Act”) generally permits bank holding companies
to acquire banks in any state, and preempts all state laws restricting the
ownership by a bank holding company of banks in more than one state. The
Interstate Banking Act also permits a bank to merge with an out-of-state bank
and convert any offices into branches of the resulting bank if both states have
not opted out of interstate branching; permits a bank to acquire branches from
an out-of-state bank if the law of the state where the branches are located
permits the interstate branch acquisition; and permits banks to establish and
operate

de novo

interstate branches whenever the host state
opts-in to

de novo

branching. Bank holding companies and banks seeking to engage in transactions
authorized by the Interstate Banking Act must be adequately capitalized and
managed.

The Banking Law authorizes interstate branching by merger or acquisition on a
reciprocal basis, and permits the acquisition of a single branch without
restriction, but does not provide for

de novo

interstate branching.

Bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks are also subject to the
provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of the CRA, the Federal Reserve Board
(or other appropriate bank regulatory agency) is required, in connection with
its examination of a bank, to assess such bank’s record in meeting the credit
needs of the communities served by that bank, including low- and
moderate-income neighborhoods. Furthermore, such assessment is also required
of any bank that has applied, among other things, to merge or consolidate with
or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of a federally-regulated
financial institution, or to open or relocate a branch office. In the case of
a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or bank holding
company, the Federal Reserve Board will assess the record of each subsidiary
bank of the applicant bank holding company in considering the application. The
Banking Law contains provisions similar to the CRA which are applicable to New
York-chartered banks.

Supervision and Regulation of Bank Subsidiaries

The Registrant’s bank subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation,
and are examined regularly, by various bank regulatory agencies: M&T Bank by
the Federal Reserve Board and the Banking Superintendent; and M&T Bank, N.A. by
the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). The Registrant and its direct
non-banking subsidiaries are affiliates, within the meaning of the Federal
Reserve Act, of the Registrant’s subsidiary banks and their subsidiaries. As a
result, the Registrant’s subsidiary banks and their subsidiaries
are subject to restrictions on loans or extensions of credit to, purchases of assets from,
investments in, and transactions with the Registrant and its direct non-banking
subsidiaries and on certain other transactions with them or involving their
securities. Gramm-Leach places similar restrictions on the Registrant’s

-17-


subsidiary banks making loans or extending credit to, purchasing
assets from, investing in, or entering into transactions with, their financial
subsidiaries.

Under the “cross-guarantee” provisions of the FDI Act, insured depository
institutions under common control are required to reimburse the FDIC for any
loss suffered by either the BIF or SAIF of the FDIC as a result of the default
of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or for any assistance
provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in
danger of default. Thus, any insured depository institution subsidiary of M&T
could incur liability to the FDIC in the event of a default of another insured
depository institution owned or controlled by M&T. The FDIC’s claim under the
cross-guarantee provisions is superior to claims of stockholders of the insured
depository institution or its holding company and to most claims arising out of
obligations or liabilities owed to affiliates of the institution, but is
subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and holders of
subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured
depository institution. The FDIC may decline
to enforce the cross-guarantee provisions if it determines that a waiver is in
the best interest of the BIF or SAIF or both.

Dividends from Bank Subsidiaries

M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. are subject, under one or more of the banking laws,
to restrictions on the amount and frequency (no more often than quarterly) of
dividend declarations. Future dividend payments to the Registrant by its
subsidiary banks will be dependent on a number of factors, including the
earnings and financial condition of each such bank, and are subject to the
limitations referred to in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements filed
herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data,” and to other statutory powers of bank regulatory agencies.

An insured depository institution is prohibited from making any capital
distribution to its owner, including any dividend, if, after making such
distribution, the depository institution fails to meet the required minimum
level for any relevant capital measure, including the risk-based capital
adequacy and leverage standards discussed below.

Supervision and Regulation of M&T Bank’s Subsidiaries

M&T Bank has a number of subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are subject to
the laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states
in which they conduct business. For example, M&T Securities is regulated by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. and state securities regulators. M&T Mortgage also is subject to
state regulation in the states in which it operates.

Capital Adequacy

The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC have adopted risk-based capital
adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies and banks under their
supervision. Under these guidelines, the so-called “Tier 1 capital” and “Total
capital” as a percentage of risk-weighted assets and certain off-balance sheet
instruments must be at least 4% and 8%, respectively.

The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC have also imposed a leverage
standard to supplement their risk-based ratios. This leverage standard focuses
on a banking institution’s ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets,
adjusted for goodwill and certain other items. Under these guidelines, banking
institutions that meet certain criteria, including excellent asset quality,
high liquidity, low interest rate exposure and good earnings, and that have
received the highest regulatory rating must maintain a ratio of Tier 1 capital
to total adjusted average assets of at least 3%. Institutions not meeting
these criteria, as well as institutions with supervisory, financial or
operational weaknesses, along with those experiencing or

-18-


anticipating
significant growth are expected to maintain a
Tier 1 capital to total adjusted average assets ratio equal to at least 4%
to 5%.

As reflected in the following table, the risk-based capital ratios and leverage
ratios of the Registrant, Olympia, M&T Bank and M&T Bank,
N.A. as of December 31, 2002 exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as “well
capitalized,” the highest classification under the regulatory capital
guidelines.

The federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC,
maintain risk-based capital standards in order to ensure that those standards
take adequate account of interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk, the
risk of nontraditional activities and equity investments in nonfinancial
companies, as well as reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss
on certain multifamily housing loans. Bank regulators periodically propose
amendments to the risk-based capital guidelines and related regulatory
framework, and consider changes to the risk-based capital standards that could
significantly increase the amount of capital needed to meet the requirements
for the capital tiers described below. While the Company’s management studies
such proposals, the timing of adoption, ultimate form and effect of any such
proposed amendments on the Company’s capital requirements and operations cannot
be predicted.

In January 2001, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a
proposal for a “New Capital Accord.” The New Capital Accord incorporates a
three-part framework of minimum capital requirements, supervisory review of an
institution’s capital adequacy and internal assessment process, and market
discipline through effective disclosure to encourage safe and sound banking
practices. The New Capital Accord is scheduled for implementation by the end
of 2006.

The federal banking agencies are required to take “prompt corrective action” in
respect of depository institutions and their bank holding companies that do not
meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA established five capital tiers:
“well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,”
“undercapitalized,” “significantly
undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A
depository institution’s capital tier, or that of its bank holding company,
depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant
capital measures, including a risk-based capital measure and a leverage ratio
capital measure, and certain other factors.

Under the implementing regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies, a
bank holding company or bank is considered “well capitalized” if it has (i) a
total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based
capital ratio of 6% or greater, (iii) a leverage ratio of 5% or greater and
(iv) is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a
specific capital level for any capital measure. An “adequately capitalized”
bank holding company or bank is defined as one that has (i) a total risk-based
capital ratio of 8% or greater, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4%

-19-


or greater and (iii) a leverage ratio of 4% or greater (or 3% or
greater in the case of a bank with a composite CAMELS rating of 1). A bank holding company or
bank is considered (A) “undercapitalized” if it has (i) a total risk-based
capital ratio of less than 8%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less
than 4% or (iii) a leverage ratio of less than 4% (or 3% in the case of a bank
with a composite CAMELS rating of 1); (B) “significantly undercapitalized” if
the bank has (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, or (ii) a
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3% or (iii) a leverage ratio of
less than 3% and (C)“critically undercapitalized” if the bank has a ratio of
tangible equity to total assets equal to or less than 2%. The Federal Reserve
Board may reclassify a “well capitalized” bank holding company or bank as
“adequately capitalized” or subject an “adequately
capitalized” or “undercapitalized” institution to the supervisory actions
applicable to the next lower capital category if it determines that the bank
holding company or bank is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the bank
holding company or bank to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice and not
to have corrected the deficiency. M&T, Olympia, M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A.
currently meet the definition of “well capitalized” institutions.

“Undercapitalized” depository institutions, among other things, are subject to
growth limitations, are prohibited, with certain exceptions, from making
capital distributions, are limited in their ability to obtain funding from a
Federal Reserve Bank and are required to submit a capital restoration plan.
The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining,
among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is
likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. In
addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository
institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will
comply with such capital restoration plan and provide appropriate assurances of
performance. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan,
including if the holding company refuses or is unable to make the guarantee
described in the previous sentence, it is treated as if it is “significantly
undercapitalized”. Failure to submit or implement an acceptable capital plan
also is grounds for the appointment of a conservator or a receiver.
“Significantly undercapitalized” depository institutions may be subject to a
number of additional requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell
sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized,” requirements to
reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent
banks. Moreover, the parent holding company of a “significantly
undercapitalized” depository institution may be ordered to divest itself of the
institution or of nonbank subsidiaries of the holding company. “Critically
undercapitalized” institutions, among other things, are prohibited from making
any payments of principal and interest on subordinated debt, and are subject to
the appointment of a receiver or conservator.

Each federal banking agency prescribes standards for depository institutions
and depository institution holding companies relating to internal controls,
information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit
underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, a maximum
ratio of classified assets to capital, minimum earnings sufficient to absorb
losses, a minimum ratio of market value to book value for publicly traded
shares and other standards as they deem appropriate. The Federal Reserve Board
and OCC have adopted such standards.

Depository institutions that are not “well capitalized” or “adequately
capitalized” and have not received a waiver from the FDIC are prohibited from
accepting or renewing brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2002, M&T Bank and
M&T Bank, N.A. had approximately $1.6 billion and $149 thousand of brokered
deposits, respectively.

Although M&T has issued shares of common stock in connection with acquisitions
or at other times, the Company has generally maintained capital ratios in
excess of minimum regulatory guidelines largely through internal capital
generation (i.e., net income less dividends paid). Historically, M&T’s
dividend payout ratio and dividend yield, when compared with other bank holding
companies, has been relatively low, thereby allowing for capital

-20-


retention to
support growth or to facilitate purchases of M&T’s common stock to be held as
treasury stock. Management’s policy of reinvestment of earnings and repurchase
of shares of common stock is intended to enhance M&T’s earnings per share
prospects and thereby reward stockholders over time with capital gains in the
form of increased stock price rather than high dividend income.

FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments

As institutions with deposits insured by the BIF and the SAIF,
M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. Under current
law the regular insurance assessments to be paid by BIF-insured and SAIF-insured institutions
are specified in schedules issued by the FDIC that
specify, at semiannual intervals, target reserve ratios designed to maintain
the reserve ratios of each of those insurance funds at 1.25% of their
estimated insured deposits. The FDIC is also authorized to impose one or more
special assessments.

The FDIC has implemented a risk-based deposit premium assessment system under
which each depository institution is placed in one of nine assessment
categories based on the institution’s capital classification under the prompt
corrective action provisions described above, and whether such institution is
considered by its supervisory agency to be financially sound or to have
supervisory concerns. The adjusted assessment rates for both BIF-insured and
SAIF-insured institutions under the current system range from .00% to .27%
depending upon the assessment category into which the insured institution is
placed. Neither of the Company’s bank subsidiaries paid regular insurance
assessments to the FDIC in 2002. However, the FDIC retains the ability to
increase regular BIF and SAIF assessments and to levy special additional
assessments.

In addition to deposit insurance fund assessments, beginning in 1997 the FDIC
assessed BIF-assessable and SAIF-assessable deposits to fund the repayment of
debt obligations of the Financing Corporation (“FICO”). FICO is a government
agency-sponsored entity that was formed to borrow the money necessary to carry
out the closing and ultimate disposition of failed thrift institutions by the
Resolution Trust Corporation. The current annualized rates established by the
FDIC for both BIF-assessable and SAIF-assessable deposits are 1.68 basis points
(hundredths of one percent).

Any significant increases in assessment rates or additional special
assessments by the FDIC, could have an adverse impact on the results of
operations and capital of M&T Bank or M&T Bank, N.A.

USA Patriot Act

The USA Patriot Act imposes additional obligations on U.S. financial
institutions, including banks and broker dealer subsidiaries, to implement
policies, procedures and controls which are reasonably designed to detect and
report instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. In
addition, provisions of the USA Patriot Act require the federal financial
institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial
institution’s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and
bank holding company acquisitions.

Regulatory Impact of Allfirst Acquisition

As described above under the caption “Pending Acquisition of Allfirst Financial
Inc.,” if the Allfirst acquisition is consummated AIB will own approximately
22.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of M&T common stock and will have
representation on the M&T and M&T Bank boards of directors. As a result, AIB
will become M&T’s bank holding company under the BHCA and the Banking Law and
AIB’s relationship with M&T will be subject to the statutes and regulations
governing bank holding companies described above. Among other things, AIB will
have to join M&T in applications by M&T for acquisitions and new activities.
The Reorganization Agreement requires AIB to join in such applications at M&T’s
request, subject to certain limitations. In addition, because AIB is regulated
by the Central Bank of Ireland (the “CBI”), the CBI

-21-


may assert jurisdiction
over M&T as a company controlled by AIB. Additional discussion of the
regulatory implications of the Allfirst acquisition for M&T is set forth above
under the caption “Certain Post-Closing Bank Regulatory Matters.”

Governmental Policies

The earnings of the Company are significantly affected by the monetary and
fiscal policies of governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve
Board. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve
Board to implement these objectives are open-market operations in U.S.
Government securities and federal funds, changes in the discount rate on member
bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank
deposits. These instruments of monetary policy are used in varying
combinations to influence the overall level of bank loans, investments and
deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits. The
Federal Reserve Board frequently uses these instruments of monetary policy,
especially its open-market operations and the discount rate, to influence the
level of interest rates and to affect the strength of the economy, the level of
inflation or the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The monetary
policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the
operating results of banking institutions in the past and are expected to
continue to do so in the future. It is not possible to predict the nature of
future changes in monetary and fiscal policies, or the effect which they may
have on the Company’s business and earnings.

Competition

The Company competes in offering commercial and personal financial services
with other banking institutions and with firms in a number of other industries,
such as thrift institutions, credit unions, personal loan companies, sales
finance companies, leasing companies, securities firms and insurance
companies. Furthermore, diversified financial services companies are able to
offer a combination of these services to their customers on a nationwide basis.
The Company’s operations are significantly impacted by state and federal
regulations applicable to the banking industry. Moreover, the provisions of
Gramm-Leach may increase competition among diversified financial services
providers, and the Interstate Banking Act and the Banking Law may further ease
entry into New York State by out-of-state banking
institutions. As a result, the number of financial services providers and
banking institutions with which the Company competes may grow in the
future. In addition, consummation of the Allfirst acquisition will result in a
significant portion of M&T’s operations being located in the former Allfirst
markets. Portions of these markets, particularly the metropolitan Baltimore
and Washington, D.C. areas, are highly competitive and this could impact M&T’s
performance in those portions of the markets.

Other Legislative Initiatives

Proposals may be introduced in the United States Congress and in the New York
State Legislature and before various bank regulatory authorities which would
alter the powers of, and restrictions on, different types of banking
organizations and which would restructure part or all of the existing
regulatory framework for banks, bank holding companies and other providers of
financial services. Moreover, other bills may be introduced in Congress which
would further regulate, deregulate or restructure the financial services
industry. It is not possible to predict whether these or any other proposals
will be enacted into law or, even if enacted, the effect which they may have on
the Company’s business and earnings.

Item 2.

Properties.

Both M&T and M&T Bank maintain their executive offices at One M&T Plaza in
Buffalo, New York. This twenty-one story headquarters building, containing
approximately 278,000 rentable square feet of space, is owned in fee by M&T
Bank, and was completed in 1967. M&T, M&T Bank and their subsidiaries occupy
approximately 73% of the building and the remainder is leased to non-affiliated
tenants. At December 31, 2002, the cost of this property (including
improvements subsequent to the initial construction), net of accumulated
depreciation, was $7.7 million.

In September 1992, M&T Bank acquired an additional facility in Buffalo, New
York with approximately 365,000 rentable square feet of space at a cost of
approximately $12 million. Approximately 89% of this facility, known as M&T
Center, is occupied by M&T Bank and its subsidiaries, with the remainder leased
to non-affiliated tenants. At December 31, 2002, the cost of this building
(including improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of accumulated
depreciation, was $13.3 million.

M&T Bank also owns and occupies two separate facilities in the Buffalo area
which support certain back-office and operations functions of the Company. The
total square footage of these facilities approximates 213,000 square feet and
their combined cost (including improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of
accumulated depreciation, was $12.2 million at December 31, 2002.

M&T Bank also owns a facility in Syracuse, New York with approximately 151,000
rentable square feet of space. Approximately 46% of this facility is occupied
by M&T Bank, with the remainder leased to non-affiliated tenants. At December
31, 2002, the cost of this building, net of accumulated depreciation, was $6.7
million.

No other properties owned by M&T Bank have more than 65,000 square feet of
space. The cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, of the
Company’s premises and equipment is detailed in note 6 of Notes to Financial
Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.” Of the 450 domestic banking offices of the Registrant’s
subsidiary banks at December 31, 2002, 217 are owned in fee and 233 are leased.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

M&T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course of business to
various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary
damages are asserted. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, does
not anticipate that the aggregate ultimate liability, if any, arising out of
litigation pending against M&T or its subsidiaries will be material to M&T’s
consolidated financial position, but at the present time is not in a position
to determine whether such litigation will have a material adverse effect on
M&T’s consolidated results of operations in any future reporting period.

Item 4.

Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

A Special Meeting of Stockholders of M&T was held on December 16, 2002 in order
to consider: (i) a proposal to approve the issuance of 26,700,000 shares of M&T
common stock to AIB in connection with the Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization, dated as of September 26, 2002, by and among M&T, AIB and
Allfirst, pursuant to which M&T will acquire all of the issued and outstanding
shares of Allfirst and Allfirst will then merge with and into M&T (“Proposal
1”); (ii) a proposal to authorize a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate
of Incorporation of M&T, providing that certain bylaw provisions relating to
rights granted to AIB in connection with the issuance of M&T common stock to
AIB and the related transactions may only be amended by unanimous board consent
or a supermajority vote of M&T’s stockholders that will only be effective if
the issuance and related transactions are completed (“Proposal 2”); and (iii) a
proposal to authorize a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of
Incorporation of M&T providing for an increase in the

-28-


number of authorized shares of M&T common stock from 150,000,000 to 250,000,000
(“Proposal 3”). Each such proposal was approved by M&T’s stockholders.

Of 83,233,267 shares of M&T common stock present in person or by proxy at the
meeting, 72,860,174 shares were voted FOR the approval of Proposal 1 (614,018
shares were voted AGAINST, 246,986 shares ABSTAINED and 9,512,089 shares were
broker non-votes).

Of 83,233,267 shares of M&T common stock present in person or by proxy at the

(22,066,649 shares were voted AGAINST, 239,050 shares ABSTAINED and 9,599,890
shares were broker non-votes).

Of 83,233,267 shares of M&T common stock present in person or by proxy at the
meeting, 81,600,996 shares were voted FOR the approval of Proposal 3 (1,380,287
shares were voted AGAINST and 251,984 shares ABSTAINED).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Corporate Profile and Significant Developments

M&T Bank Corporation (“M&T”) is a bank holding company headquartered in
Buffalo, New York with consolidated assets of $33.2 billion at December 31,
2002. The consolidated financial information presented herein reflects M&T and
all of its subsidiaries, which are referred to collectively as “the Company.”
M&T’s wholly owned bank subsidiaries are Manufacturers and Traders Trust
Company (“M&T Bank”) and M&T Bank, National Association (“M&T Bank, N.A.”).

M&T Bank, with total assets of $32.7 billion at December 31, 2002, is a
New York-chartered commercial bank with 449 banking offices in New York State,
Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia, and an office in the Cayman Islands.
M&T Bank and its subsidiaries offer a broad range of financial services to a
diverse base of consumers, businesses, professional clients, governmental
entities and financial institutions located in its markets. Lending is largely
focused on consumers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, and on small
and medium size businesses based in those areas. Certain lending activities
are also conducted in other states through various subsidiaries. M&T Bank’s
subsidiaries include: M&T Credit Corporation, a consumer lending and
commercial leasing and lending company; M&T Financial Corporation, a commercial
leasing company; M&T Mortgage Corporation, a residential mortgage banking
company; M&T Real Estate, Inc., a commercial mortgage lender; M&T Securities,
Inc., a broker/dealer; Highland Lease Corporation, a consumer leasing company;
and Matthews, Bartlett & Dedecker, Inc., an insurance agency.

M&T Bank, N.A., with total assets of $626 million at December 31, 2002, is
a national bank with an office in Oakfield, New York. M&T Bank, N.A. offers
selected deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis, largely through
telephone and direct mail marketing techniques. Insurance products are offered
by M&T Bank, N.A. through banking offices of M&T Bank.

On September 26, 2002, M&T entered into a definitive agreement with Allied
Irish Banks, p.l.c. (“AIB”), Dublin, Ireland, to acquire Allfirst Financial
Inc. (“Allfirst”), a bank holding company headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland,
and to merge it into M&T. Upon completion of the merger, Allfirst Bank,
Allfirst’s primary banking subsidiary, will be merged into M&T Bank. Allfirst
Bank operates 258 banking offices in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Washington D.C.,
Virginia and Delaware. At December 31, 2002, Allfirst had $17.0 billion in
assets, including $10.4 billion of loans and leases and $2.6 billion of
investment securities, and $15.3 billion of liabilities, including $11.3
billion of deposits. The merger was approved by the stockholders of both M&T
and AIB in December 2002 and, assuming approval by various regulatory agencies,
is expected to be completed shortly after the end of the first quarter of 2003.
Under the terms of the agreement between AIB and M&T, AIB will receive 26.7
million shares of M&T common stock (representing approximately 22.5% of M&T’s
post-merger outstanding common shares) and $886 million in cash in exchange for
all outstanding Allfirst common shares. To fund a portion of the cash
consideration and to maintain appropriate regulatory capital ratios, M&T Bank
expects to issue up to $500 million of subordinated capital notes.
Merger-related expenses associated with the pending Allfirst acquisition
incurred during the year ended December 31, 2002 were not significant.

On February 9, 2001, M&T acquired Premier National Bancorp, Inc.
(“Premier”), a bank holding company headquartered in Lagrangeville, New York.
Premier National Bank, Premier’s bank subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank on
that date. Premier National Bank operated 34 banking offices in the mid-Hudson
Valley region of New York State. As of the merger date, assets acquired totaled
$1.8 billion, including $1.0 billion of loans and leases, and liabilities
assumed were $1.5 billion, including approximately $1.4 billion of deposits.
The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting
and, accordingly, the operations acquired from Premier have been

-32-


included in M&T’s financial results subsequent to the acquisition date.
Premier’s stockholders received $171 million in cash and 2,440,812 shares of
M&T common stock in exchange for the Premier shares outstanding at the time of
the acquisition. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded
approximately $178 million of goodwill and $32 million of core deposit
intangible.

On October 6, 2000, M&T completed the acquisition of Keystone Financial,
Inc. (“Keystone”), a bank holding company headquartered in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania. Keystone Financial Bank, N.A., Keystone’s bank subsidiary, was
merged into M&T Bank on that date. Keystone Financial Bank, N.A. operated
banking offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia. As of the merger
date, total assets acquired were $7.4 billion, including $4.8 billion of loans
and leases and $1.2 billion of investment securities, and liabilities assumed
were $6.4 billion, including $5.2 billion of deposits. The acquisition has
been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly,
the operations acquired from Keystone have been included in M&T’s financial
results since the acquisition date. Keystone’s stockholders received $375
million in cash and 15,900,292 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for the
Keystone shares outstanding at the time of acquisition. The Company recorded
approximately $475 million of goodwill and $121 million of core deposit
intangible as a result of the Keystone acquisition.

In connection with the acquisitions of Premier and Keystone, the Company
incurred expenses associated with systems conversions and other costs of
integrating and conforming the acquired operations with and into the operations
of M&T Bank. Such merger-related expenses associated with the Premier and
Keystone acquisitions totaled approximately $8 million ($5 million after-tax)
and $26 million ($16 million after-tax) during the years ended December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively. Those merger-related expenses consisted largely
of expenses for professional services and other temporary help fees associated
with the conversion of systems and/or integration of operations; recruiting and
other incentive compensation; initial marketing and promotion expenses designed
to introduce M&T Bank to customers; travel; and printing, supplies and other
costs of commencing operations in new markets and offices. In accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), included in the
determination of goodwill associated with the Premier and Keystone mergers were
charges totaling $4 million and $30 million, respectively, net of applicable
income taxes, for severance of former employees of the acquired entities;
investment banking, legal and other professional fees; and termination of
Premier and Keystone contracts for data processing and other services. As of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, unpaid merger-related expenses and charges included
in the determination of goodwill were insignificant.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of Notes
to Financial Statements. In applying those accounting policies, management of
the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the
methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized. Certain of the
critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some
cases may contribute to volatility in the Company’s reported financial
performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to
changes in circumstances. Some of the more significant areas in which
management of the Company applies critical assumptions and estimates include
the following:

•

Allowance for credit losses — The allowance for credit losses
represents the amount which, in management’s judgment, will be adequate
to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of
the balance sheet date. In estimating losses inherent in the loan and
lease portfolio, assumptions and judgment are applied to measure
expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to
determine the borrowers’ abilities to repay obligations. Historical
loss trends

-33-


are also considered, as are economic conditions, industry trends,
portfolio trends and borrower-specific financial data. Changes in the
circumstances considered when determining management’s estimates and
assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions,
which may result in adjustment of the allowance. A detailed discussion
of facts and circumstances considered by management in assessing the
adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the
heading “Provision for Credit Losses.”

•

Valuation methodologies — Management of the Company applies
various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often
involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid
markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted
market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain
assets, such as trading assets, most investment securities, and
residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments.
However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not
exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to
value such items. Examples of these items include capitalized
servicing assets, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets,
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, value ascribed to
stock-based compensation, estimated residual values of property
associated with commercial and consumer leases, and certain derivative
and other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of
various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of
return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of
servicing and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions
could produce significantly different results, which could have
material positive or negative effects on the Company’s results of
operations. Specific discussion of assumptions and estimates utilized
by management are discussed in detail in notes 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 17
and 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.

•

Commitments, contingencies and off-balance sheet arrangements —
Information regarding the Company’s commitments and contingencies,
including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation
and their potential effects on the Company’s results of operations, is
included in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition, the
Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental
taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the
tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions.
Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record
tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax
laws change or the tax authorities determine that management’s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required
could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations.
Information regarding permanent and temporary income tax differences is
presented in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. Information
relating to a qualified special purpose trust that is not included in
the Company’s consolidated financial statements is included in note 4
of Notes to Financial Statements.

Overview

The Company’s net income in 2002 totaled $485 million or $5.07 of diluted
earnings per common share, up 28% and 33%, respectively, from $378 million or
$3.82 per diluted share in 2001. Basic earnings per common share rose 33% to
$5.25 in 2002 from $3.95 in 2001. Net income in 2000 totaled $286 million,
while diluted and basic earnings per share were $3.44 and $3.55, respectively.
The after-tax impact of merger-related expenses associated with the Keystone
and Premier acquisitions was $5 million ($8 million pre-tax) or $.05 of diluted
and basic earnings per share in 2001 and $16 million ($26 million pre-tax) or
$.20 of diluted and basic earnings per share in 2000. There were no
significant similar expenses in 2002.

-34-


Net income represented a return on average assets in 2002 of 1.52%, up
from 1.23% in 2001 and 1.21% in 2000. The return on average common
stockholders’ equity was 16.15% in 2002, 12.78% in 2001 and 14.07% in 2000.
Excluding the impact of merger-related expenses, the rates of return on average
assets and average common equity were 1.24% and 12.94%, respectively, in 2001
and 1.28% and 14.88%, respectively, in 2000.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”
SFAS No. 142 revised accounting standards for all purchased intangible assets,
but not the accounting for internally developed intangible assets. SFAS No.
142, as amended, requires that most goodwill not be amortized, but rather that
it periodically be tested for impairment. Other intangible assets assumed to
have been acquired but with finite lives, such as core deposit intangible
assets, are required to be amortized over their assumed lives.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, effective January 1, 2002 the Company
ceased amortization of goodwill associated with corporate acquisitions.
Amortization of such goodwill in 2001 and 2000, none of which was tax
deductible, was $62 million ($.62 per diluted share) and $36 million ($.43 per
diluted share), respectively. The after-tax impact of amortization of core
deposit and other intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000 was $32 million ($.34 per diluted share), $38 million ($.38 per
diluted share) and $20 million ($.24 per diluted share), respectively. Pro
forma net income, diluted earnings per share and basic earnings per share for
2001 and 2000, computed as if SFAS No. 142 had been effective in 2001 and 2000,
were $440 million, $4.44 and $4.60 respectively, and $322 million, $3.87 and
$3.99, respectively, while pro forma annualized returns on average assets and
average common stockholders’ equity in 2001 were 1.43% and 14.87%,
respectively, and in 2000 were 1.36% and 15.83%, respectively.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, for purposes of testing for impairment of
goodwill the Company assigned all of its recorded goodwill to the reporting
units originally intended to benefit from past business combinations and
completed a transitional goodwill impairment test as of January 1, 2002. The
Company determined that, pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 142, impairment
of goodwill was not permitted or required as of January 1, 2002. During the
fourth quarter of 2002, the Company again performed an impairment test and
concluded that no adjustment of the carrying value of goodwill was permitted or
required as of that time. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had
goodwill of $1.1 billion recorded as assets. Core deposit and other intangible
assets at December 31, 2002 totaled $119 million, compared with $170 million a
year earlier.

On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. SFAS No. 133
established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and
for hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives
as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those
instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be
specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair
value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment,
(b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction
or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a
foreign operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, an available for sale
security, or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction.

Pursuant to SFAS No. 133, the accounting for changes in the fair value of
a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting
designation. An entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to
establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use for assessing
the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for
determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge. Those methods must be
consistent with the entity’s approach to managing risk.

The January 1, 2001 transition adjustment prescribed by SFAS No. 133 was
not material to the Company’s consolidated financial position or its
results

-35-


of operations. As a result of adopting the provisions of SFAS No.
133, effective January 1, 2001 hedged residential real estate loans held for
sale, commitments to originate loans for sale, and commitments to sell loans
are generally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair
market value, rather than at the lower of aggregate cost or fair market value,
which was the Company’s policy prior to January 1, 2001. As a result of
recording such items at estimated fair market value, the Company recognized
approximately $8 million of additional mortgage banking revenues in 2001. If
not for the required adoption of SFAS No. 133, such revenues would have
generally been recognized in 2002 as the residential mortgage loans to which
they related were sold. The impact on the Company’s results of operations
resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 133 as related to the Company’s use of
interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with
other earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities was not significant.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose 7% to $1.26 billion in 2002
from $1.18 billion in 2001, reflecting a widening of the Company’s net interest
margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of
average earning assets, and higher average earning assets, which increased 4%
to $28.9 billion in 2002 from $27.8 billion in 2001. As a result of growth in
the consumer loan portfolio, average loans and leases increased $1.1 billion or
4%, to $25.5 billion in 2002 from $24.4 billion in 2001. Net interest margin
improved by 13 basis points (hundredths of one percent) to 4.36% in 2002 from
4.23% a year earlier, due largely to the full-year impact of the declining
interest rate environment during 2001 and further changes in rates and spreads
in 2002. A 29% increase in average earning assets in 2001, due in great part
to the impact of loans obtained at the time of the acquisitions of Keystone and
Premier, was the most significant factor contributing to the rise in that
year’s net interest income from $865 million in 2000. Average loans and leases
during 2001 rose $5.9 billion or 32% from $18.5 billion in 2000. A 21 basis
point improvement in the net interest margin from 4.02% in 2000 also
contributed to 2001’s higher level of net interest income.

Weakness in general economic conditions in 2002 and 2001, nationally and
in the markets directly served by the Company, contributed to the Company’s
recognition of provisions for credit losses of $122 million in 2002 and $104
million in 2001, both up significantly from $38 million in 2000. Net
charge-offs totaled $108 million in 2002, up from $75 million in 2001 and $29
million in 2000. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases
outstanding were .42%, .31% and .16% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Noninterest income totaled $512 million in 2002, up 7% from $477 million
in 2001 and 58% higher than $325 million in 2000. Higher revenues from
providing deposit account and mortgage banking services significantly
contributed to the rise in noninterest income from 2001 to 2002. Approximately
55% of the increase from 2000 to 2001 was attributable to revenues related to
operations in market areas associated with the Keystone and Premier
acquisitions. Growth in mortgage banking revenues, including the impact of
adopting SFAS No. 133, and higher service charges on deposit accounts also
contributed to 2001’s increase in noninterest income.

Noninterest operating expenses, which exclude merger-related expenses and
amortization of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets,
aggregated $870 million in 2002, up from $819 million in 2001 and $599 million
in 2000. Components of noninterest expenses considered to be nonoperating in
nature and therefore excluded from the noninterest operating expense totals
were amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $51 million in
2002, $60 million in 2001 and $34 million in 2000; amortization of goodwill of
$62 million in 2001 and $36 million in 2000; and merger-related expenses
totaling $8 million in 2001 and $26 million in 2000. A provision for the
impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $32 million
and higher costs for salaries, including commissions and incentive
compensation, were large contributors to the 6% rise in operating expenses in
2002 as compared with 2001. Expenses related to the acquired operations of
Keystone and Premier significantly contributed to the 37% increase in
noninterest
operating expense levels in 2001 compared with 2000. Also contributing to

-36-


2001’s higher expense levels were increased expenses for salaries and employee
benefits, including incentive-based compensation arrangements, advertising,
professional and other services, and amortization of capitalized servicing
rights.

The efficiency ratio is a relative measure used by banking institutions
that expresses noninterest operating expenses as a percentage of the sum of
taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income. The efficiency
ratio measures how much of a company’s revenue is used to pay operating
expenses. The Company’s efficiency ratio, calculated using the operating
expense totals noted above and excluding gains or losses from sales of bank
investment securities from noninterest income, was 49.0% in 2002, improved from
49.6% in 2001 and 50.2% in 2000.

Cash Operating Results

M&T has accounted for substantially all of its business combinations using the
purchase method of accounting. As a result, the Company had recorded
intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible
assets totaling $1.2 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2000 and $1.3 billion at
December 31, 2001. Included in such intangible assets was goodwill of $1.1
billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2000.
Since the amortization of these acquired intangible assets does not result in a
cash expense, M&T believes that supplemental reporting of its operating results
on a “cash,” or “tangible,” basis (which excludes the after-tax effect of
amortization of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets and the
related asset balances) represents a relevant measure of financial performance,
and, as a result of the required prospective application of SFAS No. 142 as of
January 1, 2002, provides meaningful comparative financial information. The
supplemental cash basis data presented herein do not exclude the effect of
non-cash operating expenses such as depreciation, provision for credit losses,
provision for impairment of capitalized servicing rights, or deferred income
taxes associated with the results of operations. Unless noted otherwise, cash
basis data do, however, exclude the after-tax impact of the previously
described merger-related expenses associated with acquisitions.

Cash net income increased 7% to $518 million in 2002 from $482 million in
2001. Diluted and basic cash earnings per share in 2002 both increased by 11%,
to $5.41 and $5.60, respectively, from $4.87 and $5.04, respectively, in 2001.
In 2000, cash net income totaled $359 million, while diluted and basic cash
earnings per share were $4.31 and $4.45, respectively.

Expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets, cash net income
was 1.68% in 2002, improved from 1.63% in 2001 and 1.56% in 2000. Cash return
on average tangible common equity was 28.62% in 2002, compared with 28.50% and
27.65% in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Including the effect of merger-related
expenses, the cash return on average tangible assets for 2001 and 2000 was
1.62% and 1.49%, respectively, and the cash return on average tangible common
equity was 28.22% and 26.38%, respectively.

Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities

Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose 7% to $1.26 billion in 2002 from
$1.18 billion in 2001, largely the result of a widening of the Company’s net
interest margin and growth in average earning assets. The Company’s average
earning assets in 2002 were $28.9 billion, up 4% from $27.8 billion in 2001.
The growth in such assets was largely attributable to higher average loans and
leases outstanding, which totaled $25.5 billion in 2002, up 4% from 2001’s
average of $24.4 billion. Average outstanding balances of consumer loans and
leases rose $1.2 billion, or 21%, from 2001 to 2002. Such growth,
predominately in home equity lines of credit and automobile loans, more than
offset declines in the commercial loan and lease and residential real estate
loan portfolios. The lower average balances of commercial loans and leases
were due in part to the sluggish economic conditions in the Company’s core
markets. The residential real estate loan portfolio’s decline was due largely
to customer repayments of loans and the impact of a November 2002
securitization of approximately $1.1 billion of such loans. In connection with
the securitization transaction, the Company transferred approximately $1.1
billion of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans to a qualified special
purpose trust. The Company received $140 million in cash and retained
approximately 88% of the resulting securities in exchange for the loans. The
Company realized a $5 million gain on the transaction which has been included
in other noninterest income. In accordance with GAAP, the qualified special
purpose trust is not included in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements. Additional information about this transaction and the qualified
special purpose trust is included in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.
2001’s taxable-equivalent net interest income represented a 36% increase from
$865 million in 2000, when average earning assets aggregated $21.5 billion. The
increase in 2001’s taxable-equivalent net interest income was also largely the
result of higher balances of average earning assets and a widening of the net
interest margin. Average loans and leases in 2001 were 32% higher than 2000’s
average of $18.5 billion. The higher levels of loans and leases in
2001 reflect the impact of loans obtained in the Keystone and Premier mergers

-38-


as well as growth from new loan originations, net of customer repayments. On
the October 6, 2000 acquisition date, Keystone’s loans totaled $4.8 billion and
included $1.2 billion of commercial loans, $1.3 billion of commercial real
estate loans, $1.1 billion of residential real estate loans and $1.2 billion of
consumer loans and leases. Loans obtained in the Premier acquisition on
February 9, 2001 totaled $994 million and included $127 million of commercial
loans, $317 million of commercial real estate loans, $356 million of
residential real estate loans, and $194 million of consumer loans.
Approximately one-fourth of the increase in average loans and leases during
2001 as compared with 2000 was attributable to net loan origination activities.
Of such increase, approximately $450 million was attributable to higher
average balances of residential mortgage loans held for sale. The accompanying
table 4 summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in 2002 and percentage
changes in the major components of the portfolio over the past two years.

Commercial loans and leases, excluding loans secured by real estate,
totaled $5.3 billion at December 31, 2002, representing 21% of total loans and
leases. The accompanying table 17 presents such commercial loans and leases as
of December 31, 2002 by geographic area, size, and whether the loans are
secured by collateral or unsecured. The Company provides financing for leases
to commercial customers, primarily for equipment. Total commercial leases at
December 31, 2002 were $148 million, of which 70% were secured by collateral
located in New York State and 7% were secured by collateral in Pennsylvania.
Of the $5.2 billion of commercial loans outstanding at the 2002 year-end,
approximately $4.1 billion, or 79%, were secured, while 71% and 21% were
granted to businesses in New York State and Pennsylvania, respectively.

Loans secured by real estate, including outstanding balances of home
equity loans and lines of credit which the Company classifies as consumer
loans, represented approximately 63% of the loan and lease portfolio during
2002, compared with 64% in 2001 and 65% in 2000. At December 31, 2002, the
Company held approximately $9.7 billion of commercial real estate loans, $3.2
billion of consumer real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential
properties and $2.7 billion of outstanding balances of home equity loans and
lines of credit, compared with $9.4 billion, $4.6 billion and $2.3 billion,
respectively, at December 31, 2001.

Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company are largely secured
by properties in the New York City metropolitan area, including areas in
neighboring states generally considered to be within commuting distance of New
York City, and other areas of New York State where the Company operates,
including the Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany, Hudson Valley and Southern
Tier regions. Commercial real estate loans are also originated through the
Company’s offices in central Pennsylvania, Maryland, Oregon and West Virginia.
Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company include fixed-rate
instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining unpaid
principal at maturity, in many cases five years after origination. For
borrowers in good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the
customer for an additional five years at the then-current market rate of
interest. The Company also originates fixed-rate commercial real estate loans
with maturities of greater than five years, generally having original maturity
terms of approximately ten years, and adjustable-rate commercial real estate
loans, which represented approximately 42% of the commercial real estate loan
portfolio as of December 31, 2002. The accompanying table 6 presents
commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of collateral and size of
the loans outstanding at December 31, 2002. Of the $4.2 billion of commercial
real estate loans in the New York City metropolitan area, approximately 37%
were secured by multifamily residential properties, 22% by retail space and 14%
by office space. The Company’s experience has been that office space and
retail properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value
through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multifamily
residential properties. Approximately 47% of the aggregate dollar amount of
New York City-area loans were for $5 million or less, while loans of more than
$10 million made up approximately 36% of the total. Commercial real estate
loans secured by properties elsewhere in New

-39-


York State and in Pennsylvania tend to have a greater diversity of collateral
types and include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the
mortgaged property in their trade or business. Approximately 76% of the
aggregate dollar amount of commercial real estate loans in New York State
secured by properties located outside of the metropolitan New York City area
were for $5 million or less. Approximately 76% of the outstanding balance of
commercial real estate loans in Pennsylvania were also for $5 million or less.

Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of New
York State and Pennsylvania, and outside of areas of neighboring states
considered to be part of the New York City metropolitan area, comprised 11% of
total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2002.

Of the $469 million of commercial construction loans presented in the
accompanying table, $289 million represent loans for which the Company has
also committed to provide permanent financing. Commercial construction loans
represented 2% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2002.

Real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties
totaled $3.2 billion at December 31, 2002, including approximately 47% secured
by properties located in New York State and 17% secured by properties located
in Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2002, $1.1 billion of residential real estate
loans were held for sale by M&T Mortgage Corporation, the Company’s residential
mortgage banking subsidiary, compared with $1.0 billion at December 31, 2001.
Loans to finance the construction of one-to-four family residential properties
totaled $529 million at December 31, 2002, or approximately 2% of total loans
and leases.

Consumer loans and leases represented approximately 27% of the average
loan portfolio during 2002, up from 23% during 2001 and 21% during 2000.
Automobile loans and leases and outstanding balances of home equity lines of
credit represent the largest components of the consumer loan portfolio.
Approximately 80% of home equity lines of credit outstanding at December 31,
2002 were secured by properties in New York State and 17% were secured by
properties in Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2002, 36% and 40% of the
automobile loan and lease portfolio were to customers residing in New York
State and Pennsylvania, respectively. Automobile loans and leases are
generally originated through dealers, however, all applications submitted
through dealers are subject to the Company’s normal underwriting and loan
approval procedures. Automobile loans and leases represented approximately 11%
of the Company’s average loan portfolio during 2002, while no other consumer
loan product represented more than 7%. The average outstanding balance of
automobile leases was approximately $556 million in 2002, $587 million in 2001
and $375 million in 2000. The increase from 2000 to 2001 reflects automobile
leases acquired in the Keystone transaction that totaled $231 million on
October 6, 2000.

The accompanying table 18 presents the composition of the Company’s loan
and lease portfolio at December 31, 2002, including outstanding balances to
businesses and consumers in New York State, Pennsylvania and other states.
Approximately 64% of total loans and leases at the 2002 year-end were to New
York State customers and 21% were to Pennsylvania customers.

The investment securities portfolio averaged $3.1 billion in 2002,
compared with $3.3 billion in 2001 and $2.8 billion in 2000. The previously
discussed retention of mortgage-backed securities related to the November 2002
securitization of $1.1 billion of residential real estate loans added
approximately $147 million to average investment securities in 2002, which was
more than offset by maturities and prepayments on mortgage-backed securities
and collateralized mortgage obligations. Investment securities obtained in the
Keystone transaction totaled approximately $1.2 billion on October 6, 2000 and
in the Premier transaction totaled $453 million on February 9, 2001. The impact
on 2001 average balances of the Keystone and Premier acquisitions was
approximately $359 million and $300 million, respectively. The investment
securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential mortgage-backed
securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, commercial real estate
mortgage-backed securities, and shorter-term U.S. Treasury notes. The Company has also
invested

-40-


in debt securities issued by municipalities, debt and preferred equity
securities issued by government-sponsored agencies and certain financial
institutions and short-term commercial paper. When purchasing investment
securities, the Company considers its overall interest-rate risk profile as
well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed, including
prepayments. In managing its investment securities portfolio, the Company
occasionally sells investment securities as a result of changes in interest
rates and spreads, actual or anticipated prepayments, or credit risk associated
with a particular security, or following completion of a business combination.
Money-market assets, which are comprised of interest-earning deposits at banks,
interest-earning trading account assets, federal funds sold and agreements to
resell securities, averaged $291 million in 2002, compared with $80 million in
2001 and $239 million in 2000. The size of the investment securities and
money-market assets portfolios are influenced by such factors as demand for
loans, which generally yield more than investment securities and money market
assets, ongoing repayments, the level of deposits, and management of balance
sheet size and resulting capital ratios.

The most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits,
which are comprised of noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing
transaction accounts, nonbrokered savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic
time deposits under $100,000. The Company’s branch network is its principal
source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than
wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Certificates of deposit under
$100,000 generated on a nationwide basis by M&T Bank, N.A. are also included in
core deposits. Average core deposits were $17.6 billion in 2002 and 2001, and
$13.6 billion in 2000. The significant increase in average core deposits in
2001 was largely due to the full-year impact of the $4.7 billion of core
deposits obtained on October 6, 2000 in connection with the Keystone
acquisition as well as the $1.2 billion of core deposits obtained on February
9, 2001 in connection with the Premier transaction. The Company experienced a
significant shift in the composition of core deposits throughout 2001 and 2002,
largely as a result of the low interest rate environment. Reflecting a change
in customer saving trends, average core savings and noninterest-bearing
deposits rose during 2001 and 2002, while average time deposits under $100,000
decreased in 2002. Average core deposits of M&T Bank, N.A. were $342 million
in 2002, $521 million in 2001 and $643 million in 2000. Funding provided by
core deposits totaled 61% of average earning assets in 2002, compared with 63%
in 2001 and 2000. The accompanying table 7 summarizes average core deposits in
2002 and percentage changes in the components of such deposits over the past
two years.

The Company also obtains funding through domestic time deposits of
$100,000 or more, deposits originated through the Company’s offshore branch
office, and brokered deposits. Domestic time deposits over $100,000, excluding
brokered certificates of deposit, averaged $1.2 billion in 2002, compared with
$2.0 billion in 2001 and $1.8 billion in 2000. Offshore branch deposits,
primarily comprised of accounts with balances of $100,000 or more, averaged
$569 million in 2002, compared with $327 million and $250 million in 2001 and
2000, respectively. Brokered time deposits, which have been used as an
alternative to short-term borrowings, averaged $1.9 billion in 2002, $794
million in 2001 and $696 million in 2000, and totaled $1.5 billion at December
31, 2002. The weighted-average remaining term to maturity of brokered deposits
at December 31, 2002 was 7 months. Certain of the brokered deposits have
provisions that allow early redemption. In connection with the Company’s
management of interest rate risk, interest rate swaps have been entered into
under which the Company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable
rate and that have notional amounts and terms substantially similar to the
amounts and terms of $270 million of brokered deposits. The Company also had
brokered money-market deposit accounts which averaged $59 million in 2002.
Additional amounts of brokered deposits may be solicited in the future
depending on market conditions and the cost of funds available from alternative
sources at the time.

The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers, the
Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh
(together, the “FHLB”), and others as sources of funding. Short-term
borrowings

-41-


averaged $3.1 billion in 2002, $3.3 billion in 2001 and $2.7 billion
in 2000. Amounts borrowed from the FHLB and included in short-term borrowings
averaged $904 million in 2002, $814 million in 2001 and $574 million in 2000.
The remaining short-term borrowings were predominately comprised of unsecured
federal funds borrowings, which generally mature daily. Additionally, in
November 2002 the Company entered into a $500 million revolving asset-backed
structured borrowing secured by automobile loans that were transferred to M&T
Auto Receivables I, LLC, a special purpose subsidiary of M&T Bank. The
subsidiary, the loans and the borrowings are included in the consolidated
financial statements of the Company. Additional information about M&T Auto
Receivables I, LLC and the revolving borrowing agreement is included in note 9
of Notes to Financial Statements. The average balance of long-term borrowings
was $4.2 billion in 2002, $3.5 billion in 2001 and $2.1 billion in 2000.
Included in average long-term borrowings were amounts borrowed from the FHLB of
$3.0 billion in 2002, $2.4 billion in 2001 and $1.4 billion in 2000 and
subordinated capital notes issued by M&T Bank of $668 million in 2002, $674
million in 2001 and $295 million in 2000. The increase in the average balance
of subordinated capital notes from 2000 to 2001 reflects M&T Bank’s issuance of
$500 million of 8% subordinated capital notes on October 5, 2000 in
anticipation of the Keystone and Premier acquisitions. Trust preferred
securities with a carrying value of $318 million that were issued in 1997 are
also included in average long-term borrowings. Information regarding trust
preferred securities, as well as information regarding contractual maturities
of long-term borrowings, is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial
Statements. Certain interest rate swap agreements have been entered into by
the Company as part of its management of interest rate risk relating to
long-term borrowings. Further information on such interest rate swap
agreements is provided in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Net interest income can be impacted by changes in the composition of the
Company’s earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as described herein,
as well as changes in interest rates and spreads. The Federal Reserve took
numerous actions throughout 2001 to lower the level of interest rates by
reducing its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate by 475 basis points.
A further reduction of 50 basis points was initiated in November 2002. In
general, such actions contributed to a greater decline in short-term rates on
deposits and borrowings as compared with the decline in yields on loans and
other earning assets. The impact of changing interest rates had a positive
effect on the Company’s net interest spread, or the difference between the
taxable-equivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on
interest-bearing liabilities, in 2002 and 2001. The yield on the Company’s
earning assets decreased 120 basis points to 6.42% in 2002 from 7.62% in 2001,
while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities in 2002 was 2.39%, down 152
basis points from 3.91% in 2001. The impact of the more rapid repricing of
interest-bearing liabilities than earning assets combined with the full-year
impact of the magnitude of 2001’s interest rate reductions led to a 32 basis
point increase in the Company’s net interest spread, from 3.71% in 2001 to
4.03% in 2002. As a result of a decline in short-term interest rates and a
general steepening of the yield curve, the net interest spread in 2001 was also
improved by 32 basis points as compared to a year earlier. In 2000, the net
interest spread was 3.39%, the yield on earning assets was 8.30% and the rate
paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 4.91%.

Net interest-free funds consist largely of noninterest-bearing demand
deposits and stockholders’ equity, partially offset by bank owned life
insurance and non-earning assets that include goodwill and core deposit and
other intangible assets. Average net interest-free funds totaled $4.0 billion
in 2002, $3.7 billion in 2001 and $2.8 billion in 2000. The increases in
average net interest-free funds in 2002 and 2001 as compared with 2000 were
largely the result of higher levels of noninterest-bearing deposits and
stockholders’ equity. Net interest-free funds contributed .33% to net interest
margin in 2002, compared with .52% in 2001 and .63% in 2000. The decline in the
contribution to net interest margin ascribed to net interest-free funds in 2002
and 2001 from 2000 resulted largely from the impact of lower interest rates on
interest-bearing liabilities used to value such contribution. Goodwill
and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged $1.2 billion in
2002, $1.3

-42-


billion in 2001 and $766 million in 2000, while the cash surrender
value of bank owned life insurance averaged $604 million in 2002, $573 million
in 2001 and $458 million in 2000. Increases in the cash surrender value of
bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income, but rather are
recorded in “other revenues from operations.” Reflecting the changes to the
net interest spread and the contribution of interest-free funds as described
herein, the Company’s net interest margin was 4.36% in 2002, improved from
4.23% in 2001 and 4.02% in 2000.

Future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in
the composition of the Company’s portfolios of earning assets and
interest-bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads, could
adversely impact the Company’s net interest margin and net interest income.
Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates
and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate
scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company utilizes interest rate
swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of
its portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Periodic
settlement amounts arising from these agreements are generally reflected in
either the yields earned on assets or, as appropriate, the rates paid on
interest-bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate swap
agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes as of
December 31, 2002 was $495 million. In general, under the terms of these swap
agreements, the Company receives payments based on the outstanding notional
amount of the swaps at fixed rates of interest and makes payments at variable
rates. However, under the terms of $100 million of swaps, the Company pays a
fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate. In anticipation of the
previously noted issuance of $500 million of fixed-rate subordinated notes in
October 2000, the Company terminated certain interest rate swap agreements
during September 2000, including forward-starting swap agreements, with an
aggregate notional amount of approximately $421 million. Under the terms of
the terminated swap agreements, the Company would have made fixed-rate payments
and received variable-rate payments. The termination of these swap agreements,
which had been entered into to hedge interest rate risk associated with
fixed-rate commercial real estate loans, resulted in a net deferred gain of
approximately $15.5 million which is being recognized in income over the
designated hedge period of the swaps. The impact on the Company’s results of
operations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 from amortizing
the net deferred gain was not significant. The amounts of net deferred gain to
be recognized in future years is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial
Statements. As of December 31, 2002, $395 million of the Company’s interest
rate swap agreements entered into for risk management purposes had been
designated as fair value hedges and $100 million had been designated as cash
flow hedges. In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the
interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of the hedged item
are recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding
gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items
represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in “other revenues from
operations” in the Company’s consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow
hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially
reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently
reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings.
The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in “other revenues from
operations” immediately. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness of both fair
value and cash flow hedges recognized in 2002 and 2001 was not material to the
Company’s results of operations. The estimated fair value of interest rate
swap agreements designated as fair value hedges was a gain of approximately $8
million at December 31, 2002 compared with a gain of $5 million at December 31,
2001. The fair values of such swap agreements were substantially offset by
unrealized losses on the fair values of the hedged items. The estimated fair
value of the interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges was a
loss of approximately $1 million at December 31, 2002, compared with a loss of
$461 thousand at December 31, 2001. Net of applicable income taxes, such
losses were approximately $622 thousand and $298 thousand, respectively, and
have been
included in “accumulated other comprehensive income, net” in the Company’s

-43-


consolidated balance sheet. The changes in the fair values of the interest
rate swap agreements and the hedged items result from the effects of changing
interest rates. Prior to the January 1, 2001 adoption of SFAS No. 133, the
fair value of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk
management purposes was not recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance
sheet. The unrecognized fair value associated with such interest rate swap
agreements at December 31, 2000 was a pre-tax gain of approximately $1 million.
The average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for
interest rate risk management purposes, the related effect on net interest
income and margin, and the weighted-average rate paid or received on those
swaps are presented in the accompanying table 8.

Provision For Credit Losses

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in management’s
judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio.
A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance
as deemed necessary by management. The provision for credit losses was $122
million in 2002, up from $104 million in 2001 and $38 million in 2000.
Continued weakness in general economic conditions across the United States, as
a whole, and in markets directly served by the Company, contributed to net loan
charge-offs in 2002 and 2001 of $108 million and $75 million, respectively, up
significantly from $29 million in 2000. Net loan charge-offs as a percentage
of average loans outstanding were .42% in 2002, compared with .31% in
2001 and .16% in 2000. A summary of loan charge-offs, provision and allowance for
credit losses is presented in the accompanying table 9.

Nonperforming loans, consisting of nonaccrual and restructured loans,
totaled $215 million or .84% of loans and leases outstanding at December 31,
2002, compared with $190 million or .76% at December 31, 2001 and $111 million
or .49% at December 31, 2000. The higher level of nonperforming loans in 2002
and 2001 as compared with 2000 and earlier years reflects a prolonged weakness
in the economy and its impact on the Company’s customers. Nonperforming loans
at the 2002 year-end included three commercial loans totaling $49 million that
were classified as such during 2002. The increase in nonperforming loans in
2001 from 2000 reflects two larger-balance commercial loans totaling $40
million at 2001’s year-end that were classified as nonperforming during that
year. The increase in nonperforming loans in 2000 largely reflects the impact
of the Keystone acquisition.

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were $154 million or .60% of total
loans and leases at December 31, 2002, compared with $147 million or .58% at
December 31, 2001 and $142 million or .62% at December 31, 2000. Such loans
included $123 million, $108 million and $93 million at December 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively, of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans
serviced by the Company and repurchased from the Government National Mortgage
Association (“GNMA”). The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased
loans are fully guaranteed by government agencies. The loans were repurchased
to reduce servicing costs associated with them, including a requirement to
advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from
individual mortgagors. In general, the remaining portion of accruing loans past
due 90 days or more were either also guaranteed by government agencies or
well-secured by collateral. A summary of nonperforming assets and certain past
due loan data is presented in the accompanying table 11.

Factors that influence the Company’s credit loss experience include
overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general,
and, due to the size of the Company’s commercial real estate loan portfolio,
real estate valuations, in particular. Commercial real estate valuations are
based upon many assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective. Such
values can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by
changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates, and, in many
cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real
property.

-44-


Net charge-offs of commercial real estate loans in 2002 were $7 million,
compared with $5 million in 2001. During 2000, the Company realized net
recoveries of previously charged-off commercial real estate loans of $383
thousand. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans totaled $49 million at
December 31, 2002, compared with $39 million and $37 million at December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

During 2002, net charge-offs of commercial loans and leases totaled $54
million, compared with $32 million in 2001 and $6 million in 2000. The higher
levels of charge-offs in 2002 and 2001 compared with 2000 were largely a
function of the sluggish economic environment faced by commercial customers
throughout much of the past two years. Included in 2002’s net charge-offs was
the entire $17 million outstanding balance of two leases to a major airline
company that filed for bankruptcy protection in the third quarter of that year.
Reflecting the weakened economy and the previously noted loans totaling $49
million and $40 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001 respectively,
nonperforming commercial loans and leases totaled $102 million at December 31,
2002 and $85 million a year earlier, compared with $26 million at December 31,
2000.

Net charge-offs of residential real estate loans were $5 million in 2002
and $4 million in 2001 and 2000. Residential real estate loans classified as
nonperforming at December 31, 2002 totaled $37 million, compared with $35
million and $33 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Residential real estate loans past due ninety days or more and accruing
interest totaled $142 million, $135 million and $115 million at December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As already highlighted, a substantial
portion of such amounts relate to loans repurchased from GNMA which are fully
guaranteed by government agencies.

Net charge-offs of consumer loans and leases were $42 million in 2002,
representing .62% of average consumer loans and leases outstanding during the
year, compared with $34 million or .61% in 2001 and $20 million or .50% in
2000. Indirect automobile loans and leases represented the most significant
category of consumer loan charge-offs in each of the past three years. Net
indirect automobile loan and lease charge-offs during 2002 were $21 million,
compared with $12 million and $7 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Consumer loans and leases classified as nonperforming totaled
$27 million or .37% of outstanding consumer loans and leases at December 31, 2002, compared
with $31 million or .51% at December 31, 2001 and $15 million or .30% at
December 31, 2000. Consumer loans and leases past due 90 days or more and
accruing interest totaled $3 million, $5 million and $21 million at December
31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. During 2001’s first quarter, the
Company began classifying non-guaranteed consumer loans and leases past due 90
days or more as nonaccrual. Previously, such loans accrued interest until the
loan balances were charged off. The change in classification did not have a
material effect on the Company’s results of operations or its financial
condition. Despite the existence of loan collateral in many cases, management
conservatively evaluated the collectability of delinquent consumer loans and
leases when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which it believes is
adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of each
respective balance sheet date. Management regularly assesses the adequacy of
the allowance by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease
portfolio, including such factors as the differing economic risks associated
with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers,
the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent
loans and the value of any collateral. Management evaluated the impact of
changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of
borrowers to meet repayment obligations when quantifying the Company’s exposure
to credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the Company’s allowance for such
losses as of each reporting date. Factors also considered by management when
performing its assessment, in addition to general economic conditions and the
other factors described above, included, but were not
limited to: (i) the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the

-45-


Company’s loan portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured
by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York City
metropolitan area, in particular; (ii) the amount of commercial and industrial
loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City
metropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically
experienced less economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other
regions of the country; and (iii) significant growth in loans to individual
consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a
percentage of loans outstanding than other loan types. The level of the
allowance for credit losses is adjusted based on the results of management’s
analysis.

In ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, the
Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits and also
estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases. The total allowance for
credit losses, therefore, includes both specific and inherent base level loss
components, as well as inherent unallocated loss components, which are
described in the following paragraphs.

The amount of specific loss components in the loan and lease portfolios is
determined through a loan by loan analysis of all nonaccrual commercial and
commercial real estate loans. Specific loss components are also established
for certain classified commercial and commercial real estate loans greater than
$100,000 when it is determined that there is a differing risk of loss than
otherwise prescribed under the inherent base level loss component calculation.
Measurement of the specific loss components is typically based on expected
future cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the
borrower’s ability to pay. Impaired loans, as defined in SFAS No. 114,
“Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan,” as amended, are evaluated
for specific loss components. Except for consumer loans and residential real
estate loans that are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are
evaluated collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based
on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be
unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan
agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more. Loans less than 90 days
delinquent are deemed to have a minimum delay in payment and are generally not
considered to be impaired.

The inherent base level loss components are generally determined by
applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and
management’s classification of such loans under the Company’s loan grading
system. The Company utilizes a ten-point loan grading system which is applied
to all commercial and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers are
responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans based on standards
outlined in the Company’s Credit Policy. Internal loan grades are also
extensively monitored by the Company’s loan review department to ensure
consistency and strict adherence to the prescribed standards.

Loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component
computations exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are
maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss component factors that reflect the
Company’s loss estimate for each group of loans and leases. Items considered
in assigning loan grades and loss component factors include borrower-specific
information related to expected future cash flows and operating results,
collateral value, financial condition, payment status, and other factors;
levels of and trends in portfolio charge-offs and recoveries; levels of and
trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans; changes in the risk
profile of specific portfolios; trends in volume and terms of loans; national
and local economic conditions and trends; and observed trends and practices in
the banking industry.

The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss components
together comprise the total base level or “allocated” allowance for credit
losses. Such allocated portion of the allowance represents management’s
assessment of near-term charge-offs and losses existing in specific larger
balance loans that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other
loans that are not individually analyzed.

-46-


The inherent unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide
for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable. The inherent
unallocated allowance includes management’s subjective determination of amounts
necessary for such things as economic uncertainties; customer, industry and
geographic concentrations; and expansion into new products and market areas.
The unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable
losses that are not otherwise identifiable resulting from
(i) comparatively poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business
climate in many market regions served by the Company, specifically New York
State and central Pennsylvania, that resulted in such regions not having
experienced the same degree of economic growth in previous years as experienced
by much of the rest of the country; (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding
loan type, collateral type and geographic location, in particular the large
concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the New
York City metropolitan area and other areas of New York State; (iii) the effect
of expansion into new markets, including market areas entered through
acquisitions; (iv) the introduction of new loan product types, including
expansion of automobile loan and leasing activities in recent years; and, (v)
the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of
the allowance.

Commercial real estate valuations include many assumptions and, as a
result, can be highly subjective. Commercial real estate values in the New
York City metropolitan area can be significantly affected over relatively short
periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions and
interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and
other occupants of the real property. The tragic events of September 11, 2001
further dampened the economic outlook for the United States, which in 2001 and
2002 experienced its first significant downturn in many years. The economies
of New York State, and New York City in particular, were specifically damaged
by the events of September 11, 2001. Economic growth outside of New York City,
especially in the industrialized upstate New York markets, continues to lag
most other regions of the country. The unemployment rate in New York State
grew in 2002 and 2001, rising to 6.1% at December 31, 2002. Slow job growth,
coupled with a declining population base, has left the upstate New York region
susceptible to credit problems, particularly related to commercial customers.
The central Pennsylvania economy has also remained depressed, with employment
declining by an average of .5% in 2002, compared with a .1% increase in 2001.
However, the region’s job losses were roughly half the overall .9% average
decrease for the United States in 2002.

The accompanying table 10 presents a comparative allocation of the
allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year-ends. Amounts were
allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to
management at the time of each year-end assessment and using the methodology
described herein. Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan
category as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in management’s
estimate of specific loss components and inherent base level loss components.
At December 31, 2002, the amount of allowance allocated to the commercial loan
and lease portfolio as a percentage of total loans was lower than a year
earlier, largely due to a decrease in outstanding balances of classified loans
having estimated inherent losses at those respective year-ends. The increased
allocation percentage for real estate loans at December 31, 2002 as compared
with December 31, 2001 was the result of higher levels of classified loans in
the commercial real estate portfolio. Increased allocation percentages in the
commercial loan and real estate loan portfolios from December 31, 2000 to
December 31, 2001 reflect weakened economic conditions and an increased level
of impaired and other classified loans. As described in note 4 of Notes to
Financial Statements, loans considered impaired pursuant to the requirements of
SFAS No. 114 increased to $164 million at December 31, 2002 from $140 million
at December 31, 2001. Such impaired loans totaled $81 million at December 31,
2000. The allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses related to
impaired loans was $18 million and $21 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was
equal to .19% and .24% of gross loans outstanding at December 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively. The slight decrease in the unallocated
allowance

-47-


as a percentage of loans from the 2001 year-end to December 31, 2002
reflects the modest impact of improving economic conditions at the recent
year’s end. The effect of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the
economic outlook at December 31, 2001 and in early 2002 diminished later in the
year as indications of a gradual economic recovery emerged. Given the
Company’s high concentration of commercial loans and commercial real estate
loans in New York State, including the upstate New York region, and central
Pennsylvania, and considering the other factors already discussed herein,
management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance
for credit losses to be prudent and reasonable. Nevertheless, the Company’s
allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan
or lease category.

Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at December 31,
2002 was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that
date. The allowance for credit losses was $436 million or 1.70% of total loans
at December 31, 2002, compared with $425 million or 1.69% at December 31, 2001
and $375 million or 1.65% at December 31, 2000. The ratio of the allowance to
nonperforming loans at year-end 2002, 2001 and 2000 was 203%, 223% and 339%,
respectively. The level of the allowance reflects management’s evaluation of
the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date. The increases in the
allowance as a percentage of total loans at December 31, 2002 and 2001 compared
with December 31, 2000 also considered the weakened state of the economy in
2002 and 2001, as well as the other specific factors and conditions described
herein.

Commercial real estate loans secured by multifamily properties in the New
York City metropolitan area represented 6% of loans outstanding at December 31,
2002. The Company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific
industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2002. Furthermore,
the Company had no exposure to less developed countries and less than $3
million of outstanding foreign loans at December 31, 2002.

Assets acquired in settlement of defaulted loans totaled $17 million at
December 31, 2002, compared with $16 million a year earlier and $14 million at
the end of 2000.

Other Income

Other income rose 7% to $512 million in 2002 from $477 million in 2001. Higher
revenues from providing deposit account and mortgage banking services
significantly contributed to the increase from 2001. Other income in 2001 was
47% higher than the $325 million earned in 2000. Approximately 55% of such
increase was attributable to the impact of the Keystone and Premier
acquisitions. Higher service charges on deposit accounts and mortgage banking
revenues were also large contributors to the increase from 2000 to 2001.

Mortgage banking revenues, which consist of gains from sales of
residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights, residential mortgage loan
servicing fees, and other residential mortgage loan-related fees and income,
increased 13% to $116 million in 2002 from $103 million in 2001. The higher
revenues in 2002 were due to the impact of historically low levels of interest
rates that produced a favorable environment for loan origination and
refinancing activities by consumers. Mortgage banking revenues in 2001 were
63% higher than $63 million in 2000, also largely due to the impact of lower
interest rates. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other
investors totaled approximately $5.7 billion in 2002, compared with $5.0
billion and $2.4 billion in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Realized gains from
sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights and unrealized
gains from recording residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to
originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans at fair market value
aggregated $54 million and $50 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
Company adopted SFAS No. 133 as of January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 requires that
changes in the fair value of hedged residential mortgage loans held for sale,
commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate residential
mortgage loans for sale be recorded in the Company’s results of
operations.

-48-


Such unrealized gains totaled approximately $15 million (pre-tax)
and $8 million (pre-tax) at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In
general, unrealized gains are realized in subsequent periods as the related
loans are sold. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 133, residential mortgage
loans originated for sale and related commitments to sell loans and to
originate loans for sale were recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at the
lower of aggregate cost or fair market value. Realized gains from sales of
residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights totaled $25 million in
2000. Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others were $53
million in 2002, up from $44 million in 2001 and $32 million in 2000.
Residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled $12.6 billion at
December 31, 2002, $11.0 billion at December 31, 2001 and $10.9 billion at
December 31, 2000. Capitalized servicing assets, net of applicable valuation
allowances for possible impairment, were $103 million, $107 million and $101
million at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Additional
information about the Company’s capitalized servicing assets is presented
herein under the heading “Other Expense” and in note 7 of Notes to Financial
Statements.

Service charges on deposit accounts grew 16% to $168 million in 2002 from
$144 million in 2001. Services charges in 2001 were up 56% from $93 million in
2000. Higher transactional deposit account balances, which generate higher
levels of service charges than non-transactional accounts, contributed to the
higher service charge income levels in 2002 and 2001. Fees for services
provided to customers in areas formerly served by Keystone and Premier also
contributed approximately 60% of the increase from 2000 to 2001.

Reflecting general declines in market values of equity securities, trust
income declined 7% to $60 million in 2002 from $64 million in 2001. Trust
income in 2001 was 43% higher than 2000’s $45 million due largely to the impact
of the Keystone acquisition. Brokerage services income, which includes
revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage
fees, totaled $43 million in 2002, an increase of 10% from $39 million in 2001
that resulted from higher revenues from sales of annuity products. Largely the
result of the Keystone acquisition, brokerage services income in 2001 was up
20% from the $33 million of such income earned in 2000. Trading account and
foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of $3 million in 2002, $4 million
in 2001 and $2 million in 2000. The Company sold bank investment securities
resulting in losses of $608 thousand in 2002 and $3 million in 2000, compared
with gains of $2 million in 2001. Losses in 2000 reflect $3 million of net
losses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2000 from sales of investment
securities following the acquisition of Keystone and the combination of the
investment portfolios of Keystone and the Company. All sold securities had
been previously classified as available for sale for financial reporting
purposes.

Other revenues from operations totaled $122 million in 2002, compared with
$120 million in 2001. The previously discussed $5 million gain on the sale of
the 12% portion of the residential real estate loans that were securitized in
November 2002 offset, in part, by lower benefits income from bank owned life
insurance, contributed to the increase. Other revenues from operations were
$92 million in 2000. Approximately two-thirds of the increase from 2000 to
2001 resulted from activities and/or market areas associated with the Keystone
and Premier acquisitions. Other items that contributed to the increase in other
revenues from operations in 2001 from 2000 include higher letter of credit and
other credit-related fees, insurance-related revenues, and automated teller
machine (“ATM”) usage fees.

Other revenues from operations included $33 million, $35 million and $26
million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of tax-exempt income earned from
bank owned life insurance, which includes increases in cash surrender value of
life insurance policies and benefits received. Also included were revenues
from merchant discount and credit card fees of $13 million in 2002 and 2001 and
$9 million in 2000. Letter of credit and other credit-related fees were $26
million, $24 million and $18 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Insurance-related revenues totaled $15 million in 2002, compared with $13
million and $7 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The impact of

-49-


acquisitions was the leading factor contributing to 2001’s higher
insurance-related revenues as compared with 2000. ATM usage fees totaled $12
million in 2002, compared with $11 million in 2001 and $6 million in 2000. The
increase in such usage fees from 2000 to 2001 was also largely the result of
the Keystone transaction. Income from leasing activities in 2000 reflected a
net gain of $9 million resulting from a $13 million gain from the sale of
equipment previously leased to a commercial customer and an accrual of $4
million for losses associated with selling automobiles and other vehicles
leased to retail customers.

Other Expense

Operating expenses, which exclude merger-related expenses and amortization of
goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, were $870 million in
2002, 6% higher than $819 million in 2001. A provision for the impairment of
capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $32 million and higher
costs for salaries, including commissions and incentive compensation, largely
contributed to the higher level of operating expenses in 2002. Operating
expenses in 2001 were up 37% from $599 million in 2000. Expenses related to
acquired operations significantly contributed to the higher expense levels in
2001 as compared with 2000. Components of other expense considered to be
nonoperating in nature and therefore excluded from the operating expense totals
noted above were amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of
$51 million in 2002, $60 million in 2001 and $34 million in 2000; amortization
of goodwill of $62 million and $36 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively; and
merger-related expenses of $8 million and $26 million in 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

Salaries and employee benefits expense was $456 million in 2002, an
increase of 5% from $435 million in 2001. The higher level of salaries and
benefits expense in 2002 was largely the result of merit salary increases and
higher commissions and incentive compensation costs. Also contributing to the
rise in 2002’s expense were higher pension costs, which rose from $2 million in
2001 to $6 million in 2002. Reflecting poor investment performance in recent
years of assets held by the Company’s funded pension plans, the Company
contributed $19 million to such plans during the fourth quarter of 2002. That
was the first pension plan contribution made by the Company since 1995. The
Company anticipates that pension expense in 2003 will exceed 2002’s expense by
approximately $7 million (excluding the Allfirst transaction impact).
Information about the Company’s pension plans, including significant
assumptions utilized in completing actuarial calculations for the plans, is
included in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. Salaries and employee
benefits expense rose 32% in 2001 from $329 million in 2000. Salaries and
benefits related to acquired operations, merit salary increases, and higher
expenses for incentive compensation arrangements and medical and other benefits
were factors contributing to the increase. The number of full-time equivalent
employees was 8,726 at December 31, 2002, compared with 8,803 and 8,219 at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Excluding the nonoperating expense items previously noted, nonpersonnel
expense totaled $413 million in 2002, 8% higher than $384 million in 2001.
Nonpersonnel expense was $272 million in 2000. The most significant factor
contributing to the rise in such expenses in 2002 as compared with 2001 was the
aforementioned $32 million provision for impairment of capitalized residential
mortgage servicing rights. Reflecting the impact on customer refinancings of
outstanding mortgage loans that the low interest rate environment is expected
to have on residential mortgage prepayment speeds, the Company recognized
impairment of certain strata of residential mortgage loan servicing rights in
2002. There was no such provision for the years ended December 31, 2001 or
2000. Higher amortization of residential mortgage servicing rights also
contributed to the higher 2002 expense level. Higher expenses for equipment
and occupancy; advertising, promotion and travel; amortization of capitalized
servicing rights; and professional services and processing, all largely
attributable to the impact of acquisitions, were significant factors
contributing to the rise in nonpersonnel expenses from 2000 to 2001.

-50-


Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $231 million in 2002, compared with $206
million in 2001 and $160 million in 2000. The effective tax rates were 32.3%
in 2002, 35.2% in 2001 and 35.9% in 2000. The lower tax rate in 2002 was the
result of the Company ceasing to amortize non-deductible goodwill in connection
with the implementation of SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. A
reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the
statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income is provided in note 12 of
Notes to Financial Statements.

International Activities

The Company’s net investment in international assets was $6 million at December
31, 2002 and 2001. Offshore deposits totaled $1.2 billion at December 31, 2002
and $778 million at December 31, 2001.

Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity

As a financial intermediary the Company is exposed to various risks, including
liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Company’s ability to ensure
that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy demands
for loans and deposit withdrawals, to fund operating costs, and to be used for
other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of
financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.

Core deposits have historically been the most significant funding source
for the Company and are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and
institutional customers, which over the past several years has become more
geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the
Company’s businesses. Nevertheless, in recent years the Company has faced
increased competition in offering services and products from a large array of
financial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds,
securities dealers and others. Core deposits financed 60% of the Company’s
earning assets at December 31, 2002, compared with 62% and 65% at December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits with
various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds
purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered
certificates of deposit, and borrowings from the FHLB and others. M&T Bank had
short-term and long-term credit facilities with the FHLB aggregating $5.1
billion at December 31, 2002. Outstanding borrowings under these credit
facilities totaled $4.2 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Such borrowings are secured by loans and investment securities.
M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. had available lines of credit with the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York at December 31, 2002 totaling approximately $1.3
billion. The amounts of these lines are dependent upon the balance of loans
and securities pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings outstanding
under these lines of credit at either December 31, 2002 or 2001. As an
additional source of funding, in November 2002, the Company entered into a $500
million revolving asset-backed structured borrowing which is collateralized by
approximately $560 million of automobile loans and related assets. The
automobile loans and related assets have been transferred to a special purpose
consolidated subsidiary of M&T Bank. As existing automobile loans of the
subsidiary pay down, monthly proceeds, after payment of certain fees and debt
service costs, are used to purchase additional automobile loans to replenish
the collateral and maintain the existing borrowing base. Additional
information about this borrowing is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial
Statements. M&T Bank also issued $500 million of 8% fixed rate subordinated
capital notes in October 2000 that provided liquidity and facilitated the
acquisitions of Keystone and Premier. Informal
and sometimes reciprocal sources of funding are available to the Company

-51-


through various arrangements for unsecured short-term borrowings from a wide
group of banks and other financial institutions. Short-term federal funds
borrowings aggregated $2.1 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001. In general,
these borrowings were unsecured and matured within two days. Should the
Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or
its debt rating, or should the availability of short-term funding become
restricted, the Company’s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources
could be negatively impacted. Information regarding the terms and maturities
of all of the Company’s short-term and long-term borrowings is provided in note
9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to deposits and borrowings,
other sources of liquidity include maturities of money-market assets and
investment securities, repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash
generated from operations, such as fees collected for services.

M&T’s primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, shareholder
dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of
dividends from its banking subsidiaries, which are subject to various
regulatory limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T are
limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current year
and the two preceding years. For purposes of the test, at December 31, 2002
approximately $407 million was available for payment of dividends to M&T from
banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval. These historic sources
of cash flow have been augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred
securities. Information regarding trust preferred securities is included in
note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. M&T also maintains a $30 million line
of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank, of which there were no
borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2002. A similar $30 million
line of credit that expired during 2002 was entirely available for borrowing at
December 31, 2001.

In connection with the pending acquisition of Allfirst, M&T Bank expects
to issue up to $500 million of subordinated capital notes. As a result,
sufficient liquid assets are expected to be available to fund the cash portion
of the consideration to be paid in connection with the acquisition. On an
ongoing basis, management closely monitors the Company’s liquidity position for
compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of
liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs in the normal course of business.
Management does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or
in the long-term, for which adequate funding would not be available and would
therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either M&T or its
subsidiary banks.

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices
and/or interest rates of the Company’s financial instruments. The primary
market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. The core banking
activities of lending and deposit-taking expose the Company to interest rate
risk, which occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times and
by different amounts as interest rates change. Therefore, net interest income
earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates.
The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net
interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using
projected balances for earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and
derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Management’s philosophy toward
interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest
income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are
based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated
prepayments of mortgage-related assets and expected maturities of investment
securities, loans and deposits. Management supplements the modeling technique
described above with analyses of market values of the Company’s financial
instruments. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to
help manage exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2002, the
aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for
interest rate risk management purposes was $495 million. Information about
interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management
purposes is included herein under “Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding
Activities” and in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements.

-52-


The Company’s Asset-Liability Committee, which includes members of senior
management, monitors interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a computer model
that considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit-gathering activities,
as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of
financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on
expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, management has taken
actions, and intends to do so in the future, to mitigate exposure to interest
rate risk through the use of on- or off-balance sheet financial instruments.
Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of
loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and
interest-bearing liabilities, and modifying or terminating existing interest
rate swap agreements or entering into additional interest rate swap agreements
or other financial instruments used for risk management purposes.

The accompanying table 14 as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 displays the
estimated impact on net interest income from non-trading financial instruments
resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories
during the first modeling year.

Many assumptions were utilized by the Company to calculate the impact that
changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more
significant assumptions related to the rate of prepayments of mortgage-related
assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for
non-trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit
maturities. The Company also assumed gradual changes in rates across repricing
categories of 100 and 200 basis points up and down during a twelve-month
period. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the
Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net
interest income. Actual results may differ significantly due to the timing,
magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, and
interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/repricing categories, as
well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may
take to counter such changes. In light of the uncertainties and assumptions
associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table and changes in
such amounts are not considered significant to the Company’s past or projected
net interest income.

In accordance with industry practice, the accompanying table 15 presents
cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a contractual basis
within the specified time frames, as adjusted for the impact of interest rate
swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes.
Management believes this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate
risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories
of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities equally nor, as assumed in
the table, on the contractual maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this
static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of
ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected changes in balance
sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities
the Company is likely to implement.

The Company engages in limited trading activities to meet the financial
needs of customers and to profit from perceived market opportunities. Financial
instruments utilized in trading activities have included forward and futures
contracts related to foreign currencies and mortgage-backed securities, U.S.
Treasury and other government securities, mortgage-backed securities and
interest rate contracts, such as swap agreements. The Company generally
mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading
activities by entering into offsetting trading positions. The amounts of gross
and net trading positions as well as the type of trading activities conducted
by the Company are subject to a well-defined series of potential loss exposure
limits established by the Asset-Liability Committee, however, as with any
non-government guaranteed financial instrument, the Company is exposed to
credit risk associated with counter parties to the Company’s trading
activities.

The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading
purposes totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2002 and $1.4 billion at December
31, 2001. The notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and
futures contracts entered into for trading purposes were $290 million and $242
million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The notional amounts of
these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet.
However, the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading
activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of
all trading account assets and liabilities were $52 million and $36 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2002 and $39 million and $27 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2001.

Given the Company’s policies, limits and positions, management believes
that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk
associated with trading activities was not material. Additional information
related to trading derivative contracts is included in notes 17 and 18 of Notes
to Financial Statements.

Capital

Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2002 was $3.2 billion or 9.59% of total
assets, compared with $2.9 billion or 9.35% at December 31, 2001 and $2.7
billion or 9.33% at December 31, 2000. On a per share basis, stockholders’
equity increased 10% to $34.53 at the 2002 year-end from $31.33 at December 31,
2001, and was 19% higher than $28.93 at December 31, 2000. Tangible equity per
share, which excludes goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets and
applicable deferred tax balances, was $21.75 at December 31, 2002, up from
$18.34 a year earlier and $16.74 at December 31, 2000. The ratio of average
total stockholders’ equity to average total assets was 9.41%, 9.60% and 8.59%
in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

M&T issued shares of common stock in 2001 and 2000 to complete the
acquisitions of Premier and Keystone, respectively. On February 9, 2001, M&T
issued 2,440,812 shares of common stock to former holders of Premier common
stock and assumed employee stock options to purchase 224,734 shares of M&T
common stock, resulting in an addition to stockholders’ equity of $176 million.
To complete the acquisition of Keystone on October 6, 2000, M&T issued
15,900,292 shares of common stock to former holders of Keystone common stock
and assumed employee stock options to purchase 1,259,493 shares of M&T common
stock, resulting in an addition to stockholders’ equity of $664 million.

Included in stockholders’ equity was accumulated other comprehensive
income which reflects the net after-tax impact of unrealized gains or losses on
investment securities classified as available for sale and the estimated fair
value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges. Net unrealized
gains on available-for-sale investment securities were $55 million, or $.60 per
common share, at December 31, 2002 and $23 million, or $.25 per common share,
at December 31, 2001. Unrealized losses, also net of tax effect, on similarly
classified investment securities were $432 thousand, or less than $.01 per
share, at December 31, 2000. Such unrealized gains or losses are generally due
to changes in interest rates and represent the difference, net of applicable
income tax effect, between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of
investment securities classified as available for sale. Unrealized losses, net
of tax effect, on interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges were $622
thousand and $298 thousand at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively,
representing less than $.01 per share at those respective dates.

On September 19, 2000, M&T’s Board of Directors authorized a ten-for-one
split of M&T’s common stock in connection with the Keystone transaction. The
additional shares were payable to stockholders of record as of September 29 and
were distributed on October 5, 2000. The par value of each share of M&T’s
common stock was reduced from $5.00 to $.50 in conjunction with the stock
split. All per share data presented herein, including earnings, dividends and
the number of common shares authorized, issued, issuable or held in treasury,
have been adjusted to reflect the ten-for-one stock split. Also in
connection

-54-


with the Keystone transaction, in the fourth quarter of 2000 M&T
doubled the quarterly cash dividend payable on its common stock to $.25 on each
post-split share.

Cash dividends paid in 2002 on M&T’s common stock were $97 million,
compared with $96 million and $52 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively.
M&T increased its quarterly dividend on common stock in the fourth quarter of
2002 to $.30 per share from $.25 per share. As noted in the preceding
paragraph, M&T’s quarterly common stock dividend rate was increased to $.25 per
share from $.125 per share in the fourth quarter of 2000. Dividends per common
share totaled $1.05 in 2002, up from $1.00 in 2001 and $.625 in 2000.

M&T repurchased 3,007,585 shares of its common stock in 2002, 4,396,303
shares in 2001 and 1,313,760 shares in 2000, at a cost of $240 million, $324
million and $55 million, respectively. In November 2001, M&T announced that it
had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up to 5,000,000
shares of its common stock. Through December 31, 2002, M&T had repurchased a
total of 3,632,098 shares of common stock pursuant to such plan at an average
cost of $78.49 per share. M&T discontinued purchases of its common stock
during the third quarter of 2002, determining instead that going forward it
would use the Company’s internal generation of capital to support the
acquisition of Allfirst. During 2001, M&T completed previously authorized
repurchase plans that had been announced in November 1999 and June 2001.

Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain
“core capital” and “total capital” ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively,
of risk-adjusted total assets. In addition to the risk-based measures, Federal
bank regulators have also implemented a minimum “leverage” ratio guideline of
3% of the quarterly average of total assets. Core capital includes the $318
million carrying value of trust preferred securities as described in note 9 of
Notes to Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2002, total capital further
included $540 million of subordinated notes issued by M&T Bank in prior years.

The capital ratios of the Company and its banking subsidiaries as of December
31, 2002 and 2001 are presented in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company generates significant amounts of regulatory capital. The rate
of regulatory core capital generation, or cash net income (reduced by the
impact of merger-related expenses) less dividends paid expressed as a
percentage of regulatory “core capital” at the beginning of each year, was
21.42% in 2002, 20.96% in 2001 and 19.48% in 2000.

Fourth Quarter Results

The Company’s net income was $126 million during the final quarter of 2002, up
24% from $102 million in the year-earlier quarter. Diluted and basic earnings
per share were $1.33 and $1.37, respectively, in 2002’s final quarter, compared
with $1.05 and $1.08, respectively, in the corresponding 2001 quarter.
Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets, net income for the
fourth quarter of 2002 improved to 1.51% from 1.29% in 2001’s last quarter.
The annualized rate of return on average common stockholders’ equity in the
last three months of 2002 was 16.05%, up from 13.70% in the similar quarter of
2001. Cash net income in the fourth quarter of 2002 increased 5% to $133
million from $126 million earned in 2001’s final quarter. Diluted cash earnings
per share rose 8% to $1.40 in 2002’s fourth quarter from $1.30 in the
year-earlier quarter. The annualized cash returns on average tangible assets
and average tangible common equity were 1.65% and 27.38%, respectively, in the
recent quarter, compared with 1.67% and 29.43%, respectively, in the comparable
2001 quarter. There were no significant merger-related expenses incurred
during the fourth quarters of 2002 or 2001.

As previously noted, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, effective January 1,
2002 the Company ceased amortization of goodwill associated with corporate
acquisitions. Amortization of such goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2001,
none of which was tax deductible, was $16 million ($.16 per diluted share).

-55-


Amortization expense related to core deposit and other intangible assets
was $7 million (after-tax), or $.07 per diluted share, during the fourth
quarter of 2002, compared with $9 million (after-tax), or $.09 per diluted
share, during the year-earlier quarter. Pro forma net income, diluted earnings
per share and basic earnings per share for last year’s fourth quarter, computed
as if SFAS No. 142 had been in effect during 2001, were $117 million, $1.21 and
$1.24 respectively. Pro forma annualized returns on average assets and average
common stockholders’ equity for the final quarter of 2001 were 1.49% and
15.79%, respectively, after excluding the impact of goodwill amortization.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased to $325 million in the
fourth quarter of 2002, up 5% from $309 million in the similar quarter of 2001.
A 7% increase in average earning assets offset, in part, by a narrowing of the
Company’s net interest margin, resulted in the improvement in net interest
income. Average earning assets were $30.1 billion and $28.2 billion in the
final quarter of 2002 and 2001, respectively. Average loans and leases for the
recently completed quarter totaled $25.9 billion, an increase of 3% from $25.0
billion during the year-earlier quarter. Damping the year-over-year fourth
quarter loan growth was the November 2002 securitization of $1.1 billion of
residential real estate loans already discussed. The yield on earning assets
was 6.08% in the final three months of 2002, down 89 basis points from 6.97% in
the comparable 2001 period. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was
2.09% in the fourth quarter of 2002, down 94 basis points from 3.03% in the
comparable period of 2001. The resulting net interest spread was 3.99% in the
fourth quarter of 2002, compared with 3.94% in the corresponding 2001 period.
A decrease in the imputed contribution of interest-free funds in the final 2002
quarter more than offset the improved net interest spread. As a result, the
Company’s net interest margin declined to 4.28% in the fourth quarter of 2002
from 4.34% in the year-earlier quarter.

The provision for credit losses was $33 million in the final quarter of
both 2002 and 2001. Net charge-offs increased to $31 million in the recent
quarter from $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. Net charge-offs as an
annualized percentage of average loans and leases were .48% in the final 2002
quarter, compared with .33% in the corresponding 2001 period.

Other income increased 8% to $138 million in the final quarter of 2002
from $128 million in the year-earlier period. The major factors contributing
to the higher level of income were increased mortgage banking revenues, which
rose 28% from the prior year’s corresponding quarter, and higher service
charges on deposit accounts, which were up 15% from the last three months of
2001. As previously noted, a favorable environment for loan origination and
refinancing activities by consumers, including the lowest residential mortgage
interest rates in over 40 years, led to the higher mortgage banking revenues.

Operating expenses, which as previously discussed exclude merger-related
expenses and the amortization of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible
assets, rose $14 million or 7% to $229 million in the fourth quarter of 2002
from $215 million in the year-earlier period. A $13 million provision for the
impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights in 2002’s final
quarter and higher salary costs relating to incentive compensation arrangements
and merit salary increases were the predominant contributors to the higher
level of operating expenses in the 2002 period.

Segment information

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures About Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information,” the Company’s reportable segments
have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system,
which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business
units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the
nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution
of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are
Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio,
Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking.

-56-


The financial information of the Company’s segments was compiled utilizing
the accounting policies described in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.
The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment
financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting,
are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported
segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not
necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial
institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation
methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment
financial data. Financial information about the Company’s segments is
presented in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products
and banking services for middle-market and large commercial customers, largely
within the markets the Company serves. Among the services provided by this
segment are commercial lending and leasing, deposit products, and cash
management services. The Commercial Banking segment contributed $103 million to
the Company’s earnings in 2002, down from $109 million in 2001. The decline in
net income from 2001 was attributable to a $14 million decrease in net interest
income, due to a 26 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin, partially
offset by a $4 million increase in deposit service charges. Earnings for this
segment totaled $96 million in 2000. The rise in earnings in 2001 as compared
with 2000 reflects a $42 million, or 22%, increase in net interest income, due
largely to a 25% increase in average loans and leases outstanding.
Approximately one-half of the increase in net interest income was attributable
to operations in market areas related to the Keystone acquisition. Partially
offsetting the higher net interest income was a $23 million increase in the
provision for credit losses, resulting from higher net charge-offs.

The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit services to
its customers. Loans are largely secured by properties in the New York City
metropolitan area and in western New York, however, loans are also originated
in the other regions in New York State, in Pennsylvania and, to a lesser
extent, in Maryland, West Virginia and the northwestern portion of the United
States. Commercial real estate loans may be secured by apartment/multifamily
buildings; office, retail and industrial space; or other types of collateral.
Net income for the Commercial Real Estate segment was $93 million in 2002, up
7% from $87 million in 2001. The increase was due largely to an $11 million
increase in net interest income, the result of a 12 basis point widening of the
net interest margin on loans and a 5% increase in average loan balances
outstanding. Net income for this segment was $74 million in 2000. Higher net
interest income of $25 million, led by a 18% increase in average loan balances
outstanding, was the major factor for the rise in net income from 2000 to 2001.
Approximately one-quarter of the increase in net interest income was
attributable to operations in market areas associated with the Keystone
acquisition.

The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and trading
securities, residential mortgage loans and other assets; short-term and
long-term borrowed funds; brokered certificates of deposit and interest rate
swaps related thereto; and offshore branch deposits. This segment also
provides services to commercial customers and consumers that include foreign
exchange, securities trading and municipal bond underwriting and sales. Net
income contributed by the Discretionary Portfolio segment totaled $65 million
in 2002, up 21% from $54 million in 2001. The higher net income in 2002 was
predominately the result of an $18 million increase in net interest income,
largely the result of a 34 basis point rise in the net interest margin on
investment securities. Net income for the Discretionary Portfolio was $34
million in 2000. The increase from 2000 to 2001 was due, in part, to a $9
million rise in tax-exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance and a
$14 million increase in net interest income, the result of increased balances
of loans and investment securities and a 4 basis point increase in net interest
margin.

The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services
residential mortgage loans for consumers and sells substantially all of those
loans in the secondary market to investors or to bank subsidiaries of M&T. In

-57-


addition to the geographic regions served by or contiguous with the
Company’s branch network, the Company maintains mortgage loan origination
offices in several states in the western United States. The Company also
periodically purchases the rights to service residential mortgage loans.
Residential mortgage loans held for sale are included in this segment. The
Residential Mortgage Banking segment’s net income for 2002 was $39 million,
down 12% from $44 million in 2001. The decrease from the previous year was
attributable to a $29 million increase in the provision for impairment of
capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing rights and a $19 million
increase in salaries, commissions and other operating expenses, offset in large
part by a $27 million increase in net interest income, the result of a higher
loan net interest margin and higher balances outstanding; increased loan
servicing revenues of $7 million, largely the result of purchased servicing
rights; and a $6 million increase in revenues from loan origination and sales
activities, including gains from sales of loans to the Company’s Discretionary
Portfolio segment. In 2000, this segment’s net income was $6 million. The
higher level of earnings in 2001 when compared with 2000 was largely due to the
impact of lower interest rates. Higher loan origination volume in 2001
contributed to a $48 million increase in revenues from loan origination and
sales activities, including sales to the Discretionary Portfolio segment of the
Company. The previously described adoption of SFAS No. 133 contributed
approximately $8 million to such increase. Revenues from servicing residential
mortgage loans for others, including the Discretionary Portfolio segment,
increased by $15 million from 2000 to 2001. Net interest income in 2001 was
$33 million higher than in 2000, predominately the result of an increase in
loan balances outstanding. Reflecting the year’s higher revenues, 2001’s
operating expenses increased by $36 million, or 34%, from 2000.

The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of consumer and small business
services through several delivery channels which include traditional and
“in-store” banking offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and
internet banking. The Company has banking offices in New York State,
Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia. The Retail Banking segment also
offers certain deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis through M&T
Bank, N.A. Credit services offered by this segment include consumer
installment loans, student loans, automobile loans and leases (originated both
directly and indirectly through dealers), home equity loans and lines of
credit, and loans and leases to small businesses. The segment also offers to
its customers deposit products, including demand, savings and time accounts;
investment products, including mutual funds and annuities; and other services.
The Retail Banking segment recorded net income of $163 million in 2002, down
19% from $201 million in 2001. A $44 million reduction in net interest income
was a significant contributor to the decline in net income. The reduced net
interest income reflects an $82 million decline that resulted from a lower
deposit net interest margin of 42 basis points that was largely attributable to
the impact of the year’s low interest rate environment and a 6% decline in
retail deposit balances. Partially offsetting this decline was higher loan net
interest income of $38 million, primarily the result of a 14% increase in
average loan balances outstanding. Also contributing to the lower earnings was
a $15 million increase in the provision for credit losses and increased
operating expenses of $22 million, offset, in part, by an $18 million increase
in service charges on deposit accounts. Net income for this segment in 2000
was $164 million. Higher net interest income and service charges on deposit
accounts of $158 million and $40 million, respectively, partially offset by
higher operating expenses of $137 million, were the leading factors
contributing to the improvement in net income from 2000. Such increases in
income and expenses during 2001 were largely the result of the Keystone and
Premier acquisitions.

The “All Other” category consists largely of other activities of the
Company that are not directly attributable to the reported segments as
determined in accordance with SFAS No. 131. Included in this category are the
amortization of goodwill (prior to 2002) and core deposit and other intangible
assets, merger-related expenses resulting from acquisitions, and the net impact
of the Company’s allocation methodologies for internal funds transfer pricing
and the
provision for credit losses. This category also includes the previously

-58-


described charge-off of $17 million during the third quarter of 2002 related to
two commercial leases to a major airline company that filed for bankruptcy
protection. The various components comprising the “All Other” category
resulted in net income of $22 million in 2002, compared with net losses of $117
million and $88 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The improvement from
2001 was due to the Company’s allocation methodologies for internal funds
transfer pricing, combined with the cessation of amortization of goodwill
resulting from the January 1, 2002 adoption of SFAS No. 142, offset, in part,
by the commercial lease charge-off. The decrease in net contribution in 2001
from 2000 was largely due to increases in the amortization of goodwill and core
deposit intangible and other expenses relating to the Keystone and Premier
acquisitions, and the effects of the Company’s allocation methodologies.

Recent Accounting Developments

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No.
143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” SFAS No. 143 requires
entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is
initially recorded, the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying
amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted
to its present value, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful
life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either
settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon
settlement. SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June
15, 2002, with earlier application encouraged. The provisions of SFAS No. 143
are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, “Recission of FASB Statements
No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections.” SFAS No. 145 addresses a number of different issues and is
effective at various dates in 2002 and 2003, with earlier application
encouraged. None of the provisions of SFAS No. 145 had or are expected to have
a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” SFAS No. 146 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities
and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition
for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
(including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring).” SFAS No. 146 requires
companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when
they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or
disposal plan. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 are effective for exit or
disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with early
application encouraged. SFAS No. 142 does not apply to costs associated with
an exit activity that involves an entity newly acquired in a business
combination. The Company believes that adopting SFAS No. 146 will not have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, but that
adoption could affect the timing of when certain costs associated with exit or
disposal activities are recognized.

In October 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 147, “Acquisitions of Certain
Financial Institutions.” SFAS No. 147 amends SFAS No. 72, SFAS No. 144 and
FASB Interpretation No. 9, and clarifies that acquisitions of all or part of
financial institutions, including branch acquisitions that meet the definition
of a business combination, should be accounted for in accordance with SFAS No.
141, “Business Combinations” and SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 147 requires that if
an acquisition is not a business combination because the transferred net assets
and activities do not constitute a business, that transaction shall be
accounted for as an acquisition of net assets that does not result in the
recognition of non-amortizing goodwill, in accordance with paragraphs 4-8 of
SFAS No. 141. The provisions of SFAS No. 147 relating to the application of
the purchase method of accounting are effective for acquisitions for which the
date of acquisition is on or after October 1, 2002. The provisions
related to

-59-


accounting for the impairment or disposal of certain long-term
customer relationship intangible assets were effective on October 1, 2002.
Transition provisions for previously recognized unidentifiable intangible
assets were effective on October 1, 2002, with earlier application permitted.
The adoption of SFAS No. 147 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

FASB Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others,” was issued in November 2002. FASB Interpretation No. 45 elaborates on
the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial
statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued.
It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception
of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in
issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement
provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45 are applicable on a prospective basis
to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure
requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual
periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Company has complied with the
required disclosure requirements in its 2002 annual financial statements. The
Company adopted the recognition and measurement provisions of FASB
Interpretation No. 45 effective January 1, 2003. Such adoption is not expected
to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure — An Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123.” SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition
for voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the
disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in
both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported
results.

If an entity elects to adopt the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 148
for stock-based compensation in a fiscal year beginning before December 16,
2003, that change in accounting principle must be reported using any one of
three methods, as follows:

1)

Prospective method. The recognition provisions must be applied to
all employee awards granted, modified or settled after the beginning of
the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied.

2)

Modified prospective method. Stock-based employee compensation
cost must be recognized from the beginning of the fiscal year in which
the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair value based
accounting method specified in SFAS No. 123 had been used to account
for all employee awards granted, modified or settled in fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1994.

3)

Retroactive restatement method. All periods presented must be
restated to reflect stock-based employee compensation cost under the
fair value based accounting method specified in SFAS No. 123 for all
employee awards granted, modified or settled in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1994. Restatement of periods prior to those
presented is permitted but not required.

The amendments to SFAS No. 123 as provided in SFAS No. 148 are effective
for financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002, while
the interim reporting requirements are effective for financial reports
containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2002. The Company adopted the recognition provisions of SFAS No.
123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, effective January 1, 2003 using the
retroactive restatement method. Information regarding the impact of such
adoption on the Company’s consolidated financial statements is included in note

FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,”
was issued in January 2003. FASB Interpretation No. 46 clarifies

-60-


the
application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, “ Consolidated Financial
Statements,” to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the
characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient
equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support from other parties. FASB Interpretation No. 46
requires an enterprise to consolidate a variable interest entity if that
enterprise has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that
will absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses if they occur, receive a
majority of the entity’s expected returns if they occur, or both. It also
requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a
significant variable interest in a variable interest entity make certain
disclosures. FASB Interpretation No. 46 applies immediately to variable
interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest
entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It
applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15,
2003, to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable
interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. The Company has provided
the required transition disclosures with respect to its involvement with
variable interest entities in notes 4, 9, and 19 of Notes to Financial
Statements. The Company does not expect to change its accounting for its
existing interests in variable interest entities upon adoption of the
consolidation provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Financial Review and other sections of this Annual Report contain
forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates
and projections about the Company’s business, management’s beliefs and
assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future
performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (“Future
Factors”) which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and
results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such
forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update
publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise.

Future Factors include changes in interest rates, spreads on earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity; credit
losses; sources of liquidity; common shares outstanding; common stock price
volatility; fair value of and number of stock options to be issued in future
periods; legislation affecting the financial services industry as a whole,
and/or M&T and its subsidiaries individually or collectively; regulatory
supervision and oversight, including required capital levels; increasing price
and product/service competition by competitors, including new entrants; rapid
technological developments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce
competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis; the
mix of products/services; containing costs and expenses; governmental and
public policy changes, including environmental regulations; protection and
validity of intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers;
technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large, multi-year
contracts; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental
proceedings; continued availability of financing; financial resources in the
amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support the Company’s future
businesses; and material differences in the actual financial results of merger
and acquisition activities compared to the Company’s initial expectations,
including the full realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue
enhancements. These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect
the outcome of the forward-looking statements. In addition, such statements
could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates,
general economic conditions, including interest rate and currency exchange rate
fluctuations, and other Future Factors.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

M&T Bank Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of M&T Bank
Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in
stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2002. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of M&T Bank
Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” as of January 1, 2002, which changed its method of
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets.

M&T BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant accounting policies

M&T Bank Corporation (“M&T”) is a bank holding company headquartered in
Buffalo, New York. Through subsidiaries, M&T provides individuals,
corporations and other businesses, and institutions with commercial and retail
banking services, including loans and deposits, trust, mortgage banking, asset
management, insurance and other financial services. Banking activities are
largely focused on consumers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, and
on small and medium-size businesses based in those areas. Banking services are
also provided in Maryland and West Virginia, while certain subsidiaries also
conduct activities in other states.

The accounting and reporting policies of M&T and subsidiaries (“the
Company”) conform to generally accepted accounting principles and to general
practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The more significant accounting policies are as follows:

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include M&T and all of its subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. The financial statements of M&T included in note 22 report
investments in subsidiaries under the equity method.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

For purposes of this statement, cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and
agreements to resell securities are considered cash and cash equivalents.

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under
agreements to repurchase

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under
agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing transactions
and are recorded at amounts equal to the cash or other consideration exchanged.
It is generally the Company’s policy to take possession of collateral pledged
to secure agreements to resell.

Trading account

Financial instruments used for trading purposes are stated at fair value.
Realized gains and losses and unrealized changes in fair value of financial
instruments utilized in trading activities are included in trading account and
foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income.

Investment securities

Investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and stated at
amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold such
securities to maturity. Investments in other debt securities and equity
securities having readily determinable fair values are classified as available
for sale and stated at estimated fair value. Except for investment securities

-87-


M&T BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements, continued

1. Significant accounting policies, continued

Investment securities, continued

for which the Company has entered into a related fair value hedge, unrealized
gains or losses on investment securities available for sale are reflected in
accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes.

Other securities are stated at cost and include stock of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.

Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts for investment
securities available for sale and held to maturity are included in interest
income. The cost basis of individual securities is written down to estimated
fair value through a charge to earnings when declines in value below
amortized cost are considered to be other than temporary. Realized gains and
losses on the sales of investment securities are determined using the specific
identification method.

Loans

Interest income on loans is accrued on a level yield method. Loans are placed
on nonaccrual status and previously accrued interest thereon is charged against
income when principal or interest is delinquent 90 days, unless management
determines that the loan status clearly warrants other treatment. Loan
balances are charged off when it becomes evident that such balances are not
fully collectible. Loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are
deferred and recognized as an interest yield adjustment over the life of the
loan. Net deferred fees have been included in unearned discount as a reduction
of loans outstanding. As discussed in the “Derivative financial instruments”
section of this note, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” as amended, effective January 1, 2001. Since commitments to sell
residential real estate loans are utilized by the Company to hedge the exposure
to changes in fair value of residential real estate loans held for sale,
effective January 1, 2001 hedged residential real estate loans held for sale
are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair market value.
Prior to 2001, loans held for sale and related commitments were carried at the
lower of aggregate cost or fair market value. Valuation adjustments made on
these loans are included in mortgage banking revenues.

Except for consumer and residential mortgage loans that are considered
smaller balance homogenous loans and are evaluated collectively, the Company
considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events,
it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts
according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is
delinquent 90 days. Impaired loans are classified as either nonaccrual or as
loans renegotiated at below market rates. Loans less than 90 days delinquent
are deemed to have an insignificant delay in payment and are generally not
considered impaired. Impairment of a loan is measured based on the present
value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest
rate, the loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of collateral if
the loan is collateral dependent. Interest received on impaired loans placed
on nonaccrual status is applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan or, if
principal is considered fully collectible, recognized as interest income.

Allowance for credit losses

The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in management’s
judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and
lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The adequacy of the allowance is
determined by management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on
such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan
category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic
environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans and the
value of any collateral.

Premises and equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation expense is computed principally using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Sales and securitizations of financial assets

Transfers of financial assets for which the Company has surrendered control of
the financial assets are accounted for as sales to the extent that
consideration other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets is
received in exchange. Retained interests in a sale or securitization of
financial assets are measured at the date of transfer by allocating the
previous carrying amount between the assets transferred and based on their
relative estimated fair values. The fair values of retained debt securities
are generally determined through reference to independent pricing information.
The fair values of retained servicing rights and any other retained interests
are determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows
associated with those interests and by reference to market prices for similar
assets.

Capitalized servicing rights

Servicing assets purchased or servicing liabilities assumed that are not
recognized in connection with the sale or securitization of financial assets
are initially measured at fair value. Capitalized servicing assets are
included in other assets and amortized in proportion to and over the period of
estimated net servicing income.

To estimate the fair value of servicing rights, the Company considers
market prices for similar assets and the present value of expected future
cash flows associated with the servicing rights calculated using assumptions
that market participants would use in estimating future servicing income and
expense. Such assumptions include estimates of the cost of servicing loans,
loan default rates, an appropriate discount rate, and prepayment speeds. For
purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment of capitalized servicing
rights, the Company stratifies such assets based on predominant risk
characteristics of underlying financial instruments that are expected to have
the most impact on projected prepayments, cost of servicing and other factors
affecting future cash flows associated with the servicing rights. Such factors
may include financial asset or loan type, note rate and term. The amount of
impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the
capitalized servicing rights for a stratum exceeds estimated fair value.
Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance.

Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets.” SFAS No. 142 revised the accounting for purchased
intangible assets and, in general, requires that goodwill no longer be
amortized, but rather that it be tested for impairment at the reporting unit
level, which is either at the same level or one level below an operating
segment. Other acquired intangible assets with finite lives, such as core
deposit intangibles, are required to be amortized over their estimated lives.
Prior to January 1, 2002, substantially all of the Company’s goodwill was
amortized using the straight line method over twenty years. Core deposit and
other intangible assets are amortized using accelerated methods over estimated
useful lives of five to ten years. The Company periodically assesses whether
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of
goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets may be impaired.

Derivative financial instruments

Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, as amended. SFAS
No. 133 established accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize
all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and
measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a
derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to
changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized
firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a
forecasted transaction or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net
investment in a foreign operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, an
available for sale security, or a foreign currency denominated forecasted
transaction. Pursuant to SFAS No. 133, the accounting for changes in the fair
value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the
resulting designation. An entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is
required to establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use for
assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement
approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge. Those methods
must be consistent with the entity’s approach to managing risk.

The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of the
management of interest rate risk to modify the repricing characteristics of
certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities. For such agreements, amounts receivable or payable are recognized
as accrued under the terms of the agreement and the net differential is
recorded as an adjustment to interest income or expense of the related asset or
liability. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, effective January 1, 2001 such
agreements have been designated as either fair value hedges or cash flow
hedges. In a fair value hedge, the fair values of the interest rate swap
agreements and changes in the fair values of the hedged items are recorded in
the Company’s consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss
being recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the
fair values of interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents
hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in “other revenues from operations” in
the Company’s consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, the
effective portion of the derivative’s unrealized gain or loss is initially
recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently
reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings.
The ineffective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is reported in “other
revenues from operations” immediately. Prior to January 1, 2001, interest rate

swap agreements used to manage interest rate risk were not recorded at fair
value in the consolidated balance sheet. Amounts receivable or payable under
such agreements were recognized as accrued under the terms of the agreement and
the net differential, including any amortization of premiums paid or accretion
of discounts received, was recorded as an adjustment to interest income or
expense of the related asset or liability. To qualify for such accounting
treatment, an interest rate swap agreement must (i) have been designated as
having been entered into for interest rate risk management purposes and linked
to a specific financial instrument or pool of similar financial instruments in
the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and (ii) have had interest rate and
repricing characteristics that had a sufficient degree of correlation with the
corresponding characteristics of the designated on-balance sheet financial
instrument. Gains and losses resulting from early termination of interest rate
swap agreements used to manage interest rate risk were amortized over the
shorter of the remaining term or estimated life of the agreement or the on-balance sheet financial instrument to which the swap agreement had been linked.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell residential real estate loans to
hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of residential real estate
loans held for sale. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 133, hedged residential
real estate loans held for sale, commitments to originate residential real
estate loans to be held for sale, and commitments to sell residential real
estate loans are now generally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at
estimated fair market value. Prior to January 1, 2001, residential real estate
loans held for sale and related commitments were carried at the lower of
aggregate cost or fair market value.

Derivative instruments, including financial futures commitments and
interest rate swap agreements, that do not satisfy the hedge accounting
requirements noted above are valued at fair value and are generally classified
as trading account assets or liabilities with resultant changes in fair value
being recognized in trading account and foreign exchange gains in the Company’s
consolidated statement of income.

Stock-based compensation

Through December 31, 2002, the Company applied the intrinsic value method
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations in accounting for
stock-based compensation awards to employees. Accordingly, no compensation
expense was recognized for stock option awards to employees under the Company’s
stock option plans since the exercise price of stock options granted was equal
to the market price of the underlying stock at date of grant. Compensation
expense for stock appreciation rights issued separately from stock options was
recognized based upon changes in the quoted market value of M&T’s common stock.
Compensation expense was not recognized for stock purchase plan rights as such
rights were considered to be noncompensatory under APB No. 25.

The pro forma effects of stock-based compensation plans are based on the
estimated grant date fair value of stock options and stock purchase plan rights
that are expected to vest calculated pursuant to the provisions of
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended by SFAS No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.” Pro

The pro forma effects are presented in accordance with the requirements of
SFAS No. 123, as amended, however, such effects are not representative of the
effects to be reported in future years due to the fact that options vest over
several years and additional awards generally are made each year.

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the recognition provisions
of SFAS No. 123, as amended. The Company elected the retroactive restatement
transition method. The Company expects that stock-based employee compensation
determined under the fair value method, net of applicable tax effects, will be
approximately $33 million in 2003.

Income taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects
attributable to differences between the financial statement value of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and
laws. Investment tax credits related to leveraged leasing property are
amortized into income tax expense over the life of the lease agreement.

Earnings per common share

Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income
available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding and common shares issuable under deferred compensation
arrangements during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the

-92-

potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue
common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the
issuance of common stock that then shared in earnings. Proceeds assumed to
have been received on such exercise or conversion are assumed to be used to
purchase shares of M&T common stock at the average market price during the
period, as required by the “treasury stock method” of accounting.

Treasury stock

Repurchases of shares of M&T common stock are recorded at cost as a reduction
of stockholders’ equity. Reissuances of shares of treasury stock are recorded
at average cost.

2. Acquisitions

On September 26, 2002, M&T entered into a definitive agreement with Allied
Irish Banks, p.l.c. (“AIB”), Dublin, Ireland, to acquire Allfirst Financial
Inc. (“Allfirst”), a wholly owned bank holding company subsidiary of AIB
headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, and to merge it into M&T. Upon
completion of the merger, Allfirst Bank, Allfirst’s primary banking subsidiary,
will be merged into Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T Bank”), M&T’s
principal banking subsidiary. Allfirst Bank operates 258 banking offices in
Maryland, Pennsylvania, Washington D.C., Virginia and Delaware. At December
31, 2002, Allfirst had $17.0 billion of assets, including $10.4 billion of
loans and leases and $2.6 billion of investment securities, and $15.3 billion
of liabilities, including $11.3 billion of deposits. The merger was approved
by the stockholders of both M&T and AIB in December 2002 and, assuming approval
by various regulatory agencies, is expected to be completed shortly after the
end of the first quarter of 2003. Under the terms of the agreement between AIB
and M&T, AIB will receive 26.7 million shares of M&T common stock (representing
approximately 22.5% of M&T’s post-merger outstanding common shares) and $886
million in cash in exchange for all outstanding Allfirst common shares.
Merger-related expenses associated with the pending Allfirst acquisition
incurred during the year ended December 31, 2002 were not significant.

On February 9, 2001, M&T completed the merger of Premier National Bancorp,
Inc. (“Premier”), a bank holding company headquartered in Lagrangeville, New
York, with and into Olympia Financial Corp. (“Olympia”), a wholly owned
subsidiary of M&T. Following the merger, Premier National Bank, Premier’s bank
subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank. Premier National Bank operated 34
banking offices in the mid-Hudson Valley region of New York State. After
application of the election, allocation, and proration procedures contained in
the merger agreement with Premier, M&T paid $171 million in cash and issued
2,440,812 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for the Premier shares
outstanding at the time of acquisition. In addition, based on the merger
agreement and the exchange ratio provided therein, M&T converted outstanding
and unexercised stock options granted by Premier into options to purchase
224,734 shares of M&T common stock. The purchase price was approximately $347
million based on the cash paid to Premier shareholders, the fair value of M&T
common stock exchanged, and the estimated fair value of Premier stock options
converted into M&T stock options.

Acquired assets, loans and deposits of Premier on February 9, 2001 totaled
approximately $1.8 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion,
respectively. The transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, operations acquired from Premier have been

included in the Company’s financial results since the acquisition date. In
connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $178
million of goodwill and $32 million of core deposit intangible. The core
deposit intangible is being amortized over seven years using an accelerated
method. Through December 31, 2001, the goodwill was being amortized over
twenty years using the straight-line method. Pro forma information for the
year ended December 31, 2001 as if Premier had been acquired on January 1, 2001
is not presented since such pro forma results were not materially different
from the Company’s actual results.

On October 6, 2000, M&T completed the merger of Keystone Financial, Inc.
(“Keystone”), a bank holding company headquartered in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,
with and into Olympia. Following the merger, Keystone Financial Bank, N.A.,
Keystone’s bank subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank. Keystone Financial Bank,
N.A. operated banking offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia.
After application of the election, allocation and proration procedures
contained in the merger agreement with Keystone, M&T paid $375 million in cash
and issued 15,900,292 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for the Keystone
shares outstanding at the time of acquisition. In addition, based on the
merger agreement and the exchange ratio provided therein, M&T converted
outstanding and unexercised stock options granted by Keystone into options to
purchase 1,259,493 shares of M&T common stock. The purchase price of the
transaction was approximately $1.0 billion based on the cash paid to Keystone
shareholders, the market price of M&T common shares on May 16, 2000 before the
terms of the merger were agreed to and announced by M&T and Keystone, and the
estimated fair value of Keystone stock options converted into M&T stock
options.

Acquired assets, loans and deposits of Keystone on October 6, 2000
totaled approximately $7.4 billion, $4.8 billion and $5.2 billion,
respectively. The transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, operations acquired from Keystone have been
included in the Company’s financial results since the acquisition date. In
connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $475
million of goodwill and $121 million of core deposit intangible. The core
deposit intangible is being amortized over seven years using an accelerated
method. Through December 31, 2001, the goodwill was being amortized over
twenty years using the straight-line method.

On March 1, 2000, M&T Bank completed the acquisition of Matthews, Bartlett
& Dedecker, Inc. (“MBD”), an insurance agency located in Buffalo, New York for
$4.5 million in cash. MBD provides insurance services principally to the
commercial market and operates as a subsidiary of M&T Bank. The acquisition
has not had a material impact on the Company’s financial position or its
results of operations.

On March 31, 2000, The Chase Manhattan Bank (“Chase”) transferred trust
and fiduciary accounts with assets of approximately $147 million to M&T Bank,
completing a transaction that began in September 1999 with M&T Bank’s
acquisition from Chase of 29 branch offices in upstate New York and the
investment management and custody accounts associated with those offices. At
the time of closing in September 1999, the branches had approximately $634
million of deposits and approximately $44 million of retail installment and
commercial loans, and the investment management and custody accounts had
assets of approximately $286 million. In connection with the transaction, the
Company recorded approximately $55 million of intangible assets that are being
amortized over periods ranging from five to seven years.

The Company incurred merger expenses related to systems conversions and
other costs of integrating and conforming acquired operations with and into the
Company of approximately $8 million ($5 million net of applicable income taxes)

borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and the Federal Home
Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (together, the “Federal Home Loan Banks”), repurchase
agreements, governmental deposits and interest rate swap agreements.

pledged securities are included in government issued or guaranteed
mortgage-backed securities available for sale.

At December 31, 2002, collateral accepted by the Company, which by
contract or custom can be sold or repledged, consisted of investment securities
with a fair value of $301,880,000 purchased under agreements to resell.

4. Loans and leases

Total gross loans and leases outstanding were comprised of the following:

One-to-four family residential mortgage loans held for sale were $1.1
billion at December 31, 2002 and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2001.
One-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled
approximately $12.6 billion and $11.0 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $10 million of
one-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced for others have been
sold with recourse. The total credit loss exposure resulting from residential
mortgage loans sold with recourse was considered negligible. Commercial
mortgage loans serviced for others totaled approximately $644 million and $472 million at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In November 2002, the Company transferred approximately $1.1 billion of
one-to-four family residential mortgage loans to Manufacturers and Traders
Trust Company Mortgage Trust 2002-1 (“M&T Trust”), a qualified special purpose
trust, in a non-recourse securitization transaction. The Company received $140
million in cash and retained approximately 88% of the resulting securities in
exchange for the loans. The Company realized a $5 million gain on the
transaction and allocated $977 million and $7 million of the carrying value of
the loans to the retained securities and to capitalized servicing assets,
respectively. All of the retained securities were classified as investment
securities available for sale. The Company received $47 million in principal
and interest payments on the retained securities and $355,000 in servicing fees
from M&T Trust in 2002. At December 31, 2002, retained securities had an
aggregate amortized cost of $936 million and an aggregate estimated fair value
of $972 million. Securities included therein rated A or higher had an
amortized cost and an estimated fair value of $920 million and

$955 million, respectively, and securities rated BBB or lower had an amortized
cost and an estimated fair value of $16 million and $17 million, respectively.
The estimated fair values were obtained from independent pricing sources and
management does not anticipate that a hypothetical adverse change from expected
pricing assumptions would have a significant impact on the fair value of the
subordinated retained securities. The hypothetical effect of adverse changes
on the retained capitalized servicing assets at December 31, 2002 is included
in note 7. As a qualified special purpose trust, M&T Trust is not included in
the Company’s consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2002, M&T
Trust held $1.0 billion of residential mortgage loans, $70,000 of which were
past due 30 days or more. M&T Trust had no credit losses in 2002. Because the
transaction was non-recourse, the Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a
result of its association with M&T Trust is limited to realizing the carrying
value of the retained securities and servicing rights.

In 2000, the Company securitized approximately $1.0 billion of one-to-four
family residential mortgage loans in a guaranteed mortgage securitization with
the Federal National Mortgage Association. The Company recognized no gain or
loss on the transaction as it retained all of the resulting securities and
allocated $14 million of the carrying value of the loans to capitalized
servicing assets. All of the resulting securities were classified as
investment securities available for sale.

Nonperforming loans (loans on which interest was not being accrued or had
been renegotiated at below-market interest rates) totaled $215,290,000 at
December 31, 2002 and $190,472,000 at December 31, 2001. If nonaccrual and
renegotiated loans had been accruing interest at their originally contracted
terms, interest income on these loans would have amounted to $17,555,000 in
2002 and $18,054,000 in 2001. The actual amount included in interest income
during 2002 and 2001 on these loans was $6,483,000 and $5,741,000,
respectively.

The recorded investment in loans considered impaired was $164,497,000 and
$139,750,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The recorded
investment in loans considered impaired for which there was a related valuation
allowance for impairment included in the allowance for credit losses and the
amount of such impairment allowance were $110,064,000 and $17,626,000,
respectively, at December 31, 2002 and $84,818,000 and $20,956,000,
respectively, at December 31, 2001. The recorded investment in loans
considered impaired for which there was no related valuation allowance for
impairment was $54,433,000 and $54,932,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The average recorded investment in impaired loans during 2002,
2001 and 2000 was $143,118,000, $116,841,000 and $47,475,000, respectively.
Interest income recognized on impaired loans totaled $4,180,000, $3,310,000 and
$2,947,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Borrowings by directors and certain officers of M&T and its banking
subsidiaries, and by associates of such persons, exclusive of loans aggregating
less than $60,000, amounted to $153,054,000 and $198,114,000 at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2002, new borrowings by such
persons amounted to $22,180,000 (including borrowings of new directors or
officers that were outstanding at the time of their election) and repayments
and other reductions were $67,240,000.

At December 31, 2002, approximately $1.9 billion of commercial mortgage
loans, $1.1 billion of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans and $525
million of consumer loans were pledged to secure outstanding borrowings.

valuation allowance since the carrying value of certain strata of capitalized
servicing assets exceeded estimated fair value. There was no provision for
impairment added to the allowance for the years ended December 31, 2001 and

approximately $115 million at December 31, 2002 and $163 million at December
31, 2001. Such amounts were estimated using discount rates ranging from 9.5%
to 10.1% at December 31, 2002 and 10.8% to 11.9% at December 31, 2001, and
contemporaneous prepayment assumptions. The estimated market value of
capitalized servicing rights may vary significantly in subsequent periods due
to changing interest rates and the effect thereof on prepayment speeds.

The key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of
capitalized servicing rights at December 31, 2002 and the sensitivity of such
value to changes in those assumptions are summarized in the table that follows.
These calculated sensitivities are hypothetical and actual changes in the fair
value of capitalized servicing rights may differ significantly
from the amounts presented herein. The effect of a variation in a
particular assumption on the fair value of the servicing rights is calculated
without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may
result in changes in another which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities.
The changes in assumptions are presumed to be instantaneous.

8. Goodwill and other intangible assets

As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company ceased amortization of
goodwill associated with corporate acquisitions effective January 1, 2002. As
prescribed by SFAS No. 142, the following is a reconciliation of reported net
income and earnings per share and net income and earnings per share adjusted to
exclude the impact of amortization of goodwill for the years ended December 31,
2001 and 2000:

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the Company continues
to amortize core deposit and other intangible assets over the estimated
remaining life of each respective asset. Amortizing intangible assets were
comprised of the following:

Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets was generally
computed using accelerated methods over original amortization periods of five
to ten years. The weighted average original amortization period was
approximately seven years. The remaining weighted average amortization period
as of December 31, 2002 was approximately four years. Amortization expense for
core deposit and other intangible assets was $51,484,000, $59,816,000 and
$33,816,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Estimated amortization expense in future years for such intangible assets is
as follows:

Also in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the Company
completed a transitional goodwill impairment test and an annual goodwill
impairment test as of January 1 and October 1, 2002, respectively. For
purposes of testing for impairment, the Company assigned all recorded goodwill
to the reporting units originally intended to benefit from past business
combinations. Goodwill was generally assigned based on the implied fair value
of the acquired goodwill applicable to the benefited reporting units at the
time of each respective acquisition. The implied fair value of the goodwill
was determined as the difference between the estimated incremental overall fair
value of the reporting unit and the estimated fair value of the net assets
assigned to the reporting unit as of each respective acquisition date. To test
for goodwill impairment at each evaluation date, the Company compared the
estimated fair value of each of its reporting units to their respective
carrying amounts and certain other assets and liabilities assigned to the
reporting unit, including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible
assets. The methodologies used to estimate fair values of reporting units as
of the acquisition dates and as of the evaluation dates were similar. For the
Company’s core customer relationship business reporting units, fair value was
estimated as the present value of the expected future cash flows of the
reporting unit. The Company’s non-relationship business reporting units were
individually analyzed and fair value was largely determined by comparisons to
market transactions for similar businesses. Based on the results of the
transitional and annual goodwill impairment tests, the Company concluded that
the amount of recorded goodwill was not impaired.

A summary of goodwill assigned to each of the Company’s reportable segments for
purposes of testing for impairment was as follows:

9. Borrowings

The amounts and interest rates of short-term borrowings were as follows:

In general, federal funds purchased and short-term repurchase agreements
outstanding at December 31, 2002 matured within two days following year-end.
Other short-term borrowings included borrowings from the Federal Home Loan
Banks and others having original maturities of one year or less. Other
short-term borrowings at December 31, 2002 included $750 million of borrowings
from the Federal Home Loan Banks that matured in two days and a $500 million
revolving asset-backed structured borrowing with an unaffiliated conduit
lender, which was entered into in November 2002. At December 31, 2002, the
revolving asset-backed structured borrowing was secured by $560 million of
automobile loans and related assets that had been transferred to M&T Auto
Receivables I, LLC, a special purpose consolidated subsidiary of M&T Bank. The
special purpose subsidiary’s

activities are generally restricted to purchasing and owning automobile loans
for the purpose of securing this revolving borrowing arrangement. Proceeds
from payments on the automobile loans are required to be applied in priority
order for fees, principal and interest on the borrowing, and funding the
monthly replenishment of automobile loans. Any remaining proceeds are
available for distribution to M&T Bank. The secured borrowing is non-recourse
to M&T Bank and the Company, therefore, the Company’s exposure to loss is
generally restricted to the amount that such borrowing is overcollateralized.
The borrowing is prepayable, in whole or in part, at any time and 80% of the
borrowing can be put back to M&T Bank upon demand.

the Federal Home Loan Banks whereby M&T Bank could borrow up to approximately
$5.1 billion. Additionally, M&T Bank and M&T Bank, National Association (“M&T
Bank, N.A.”), a wholly owned subsidiary of M&T, had available lines of credit
with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York totaling approximately $1.3 billion,
under which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2002 or 2001.

The subordinated notes of M&T Bank are unsecured and are subordinate to
the claims of depositors and other creditors of M&T Bank. The senior medium
term notes were issued in 1997 and 1998 by Keystone Financial Mid-Atlantic
Funding Corp., previously a wholly owned subsidiary of Keystone, but now a
wholly owned subsidiary of Olympia. The notes provide for semi-annual interest
payments at fixed rates of interest and are guaranteed by Olympia.

Long-term variable rate advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks had
contractual interest rates that ranged from 1.38% to 1.80% at December 31, 2002
and from 1.89% to 2.42% at December 31, 2001. The weighted-average contractual
interest rates were 1.49% and 2.08% at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Long-term fixed-rate advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks
had contractual interest rates ranging from 4.05% to 8.29%. The
weighted-average contractual interest rates payable were 5.52% and 5.53% at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Advances from the Federal Home Loan
Banks mature at various dates through 2029 and are secured by residential real
estate loans, commercial real estate loans and investment securities.

In 1997, M&T Capital Trust I (“Trust I”), M&T Capital Trust II (“Trust
II”), and M&T Capital Trust III (“Trust III” and, together with Trust I and
Trust II, the “Trusts”), issued $310 million of preferred capital securities.
The financial statement carrying value of the preferred capital securities of
Trust III include the unamortized portion of a purchase accounting adjustment
to reflect estimated fair value at the April 1, 1998 acquisition of the common
securities of Trust III.

Other than the following payment terms (and the redemption terms described

securities of each trust (“Common Securities”) are the only class of each
trust’s securities possessing general voting powers. The Capital Securities
represent preferred undivided interests in the assets of the corresponding
trust and are classified in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as
long-term borrowings with accumulated distributions on such securities included
in interest expense. Under the Federal Reserve Board’s current risk-based
capital guidelines, the Capital Securities are includable in M&T’s Tier 1
capital.

The Junior Subordinated Debentures represent the sole assets of each Trust
and payments under the Junior Subordinated Debentures are the sole source of
cash flow for each Trust.

Holders of the Capital Securities receive preferential cumulative cash
distributions semi-annually on each distribution date at the stated
distribution rate unless M&T, in the case of Trust I or Trust II, or Olympia,
in the case of Trust III, exercise the right to extend the payment of interest
on the Junior Subordinated Debentures for up to ten semi-annual periods, in
which case payment of distributions on the Capital Securities will be deferred
for a comparable period. During an extended interest period, M&T and/or
Olympia may not pay dividends or distributions on, or repurchase, redeem or
acquire any shares of the respective company’s capital stock. The agreements
governing the Capital Securities, in the aggregate, provide a full, irrevocable
and unconditional guarantee by M&T in the case of Trust I or Trust II, or
Olympia, in the case of Trust III, of the payment of distributions on, the
redemption of, and any liquidation distribution with respect to the Capital
Securities. The obligations under such guarantee and the Capital Securities
are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all senior indebtedness of
M&T and Olympia.

The Capital Securities are mandatorily redeemable in whole, but not in
part, upon repayment at the stated maturity dates of the Junior Subordinated
Debentures or the earlier redemption of the Junior Subordinated Debentures in
whole upon the occurrence of one or more events (“Events”) set forth in the
indentures relating to the Capital Securities, and in whole or in part at any
time after the stated optional redemption dates (February 1, 2007 in the case
of Trust I and Trust III, and June 1, 2007 in the case of Trust II)
contemporaneously with the Company’s optional redemption of the related Junior
Subordinated Debentures in whole or in part. The Junior Subordinated
Debentures are redeemable prior to their stated maturity dates at M&T’s option
in the case of Trust I and Trust II and Olympia’s option in the case of Trust
III (i) on or after the stated optional redemption dates, in whole at any time
or in part from time to time, or (ii) in whole, but not in part, at any time
within 90 days following the occurrence and during the continuation of one or
more of the Events, in each case subject to possible regulatory approval. The

10. Stock-based compensation plans

Stock option plans

M&T had two stock option plans at December 31, 2002. The 1983 Stock Option
Plan (“1983 Plan”) allowed the grant of stock options and stock appreciation
rights (either in tandem with options or independently) at prices which could
not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of
grant. Except as described below, awards granted under the 1983 Plan generally
vest over four years and are exercisable over terms not exceeding ten years and
one day from the date of grant. When exercisable, the stock
appreciation rights issued in tandem with stock options entitle grantees to
receive cash, stock or a combination equal to the amount of stock appreciation
between the dates of grant and exercise. During 2001, the remaining shares
available for grant under the 1983 Plan were awarded. Stock appreciation rights
that had been issued independently of stock options pursuant to the 1983 Plan
contained similar terms as the stock options, although upon exercise the holder
was only entitled to receive cash instead of purchasing shares of M&T’s common
stock. In 1999, the Company granted options to substantially all employees who
had not previously received awards under the 1983 Plan. The options granted
under this award vested three years after the grant date and are exercisable
for a period of seven years thereafter.

In April 2001, stockholders approved the 2001 Stock Option Plan (“2001
Plan”). Options granted under the 2001 Plan contain similar terms as the 1983
Plan, other than the 2001 Plan does not permit the granting of stock
appreciation rights, either in tandem with options or as stand-alone grants.
Under the 2001 Plan, a maximum of 10,000,000 shares of stock may be issued upon
the exercise of options granted.

The Company used an option pricing model to estimate the grant date
present value of stock options granted. The weighted-average estimated value
per option was $22.97 in 2002, $20.62 in 2001 and $13.37 in 2000. The values
were calculated using the following weighted-average assumptions: an option
term of 6.5 years (representing the estimated period between grant date and
exercise date based on historical data); a risk-free interest rate of 4.74%

in 2002, 5.17% in 2001 and 6.80% in 2000 (representing the yield on a U.S.
Treasury security with a remaining term equal to the expected option term);
expected volatility of 29% in 2002 and 2001 and 22% in 2000; and estimated
dividend yields of 1.32% in 2002, 1.52% in 2001 and 1.19% in 2000 (representing
the approximate annualized cash dividend rate paid with respect to a share of
common stock at or near the grant date). Based on historical data and
projected employee turnover rates, the Company reduced the estimated value per
option by 10% to reflect an estimate of the probability of forfeiture prior to
vesting.

Stock purchase plan

The Company began offering a stock purchase plan to employees in 2002, pending
stockholder approval at the Company’s 2003 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The
stock purchase plan provides eligible employees of the Company with the right
to purchase shares of M&T common stock through accumulated payroll deductions.
Shares of M&T common stock will be issued at the end of an option period, the
first of which is one year long and ends on September 2, 2003. In connection
with the employee stock purchase plan, 1,000,000 shares of M&T common stock
were authorized for issuance.

Similar to the stock option plans, the Company used an option pricing
model to estimate the grant date present value of purchase rights under the
stock purchase plan. The estimated value per right was $12.47, which was
calculated using the following assumptions: a term of 1 year (representing the
period between grant date and exercise date); a risk-free interest rate of
1.62% (representing the yield on a U.S. Treasury security with a one year
term); expected volatility of 24%; and an estimated dividend yield of 1.21%
(representing the approximate annualized cash dividend rate paid with respect
to a share of common stock at or near the grant date).

Deferred bonus plan

The Company provides a deferred bonus plan pursuant to which eligible employees
may elect to defer all or a portion of their current annual incentive
compensation awards and allocate such awards to several investment options,
including M&T common stock. Participants may elect the timing of distributions
from the plan. Such distributions are payable in cash with the exception of
balances allocated to M&T common stock which are distributable in the form of
M&T common stock. Shares of M&T common stock distributable pursuant to the
terms of the deferred bonus plan were 83,072 and 84,743 at December 31, 2002
and 2001, respectively. The obligation to issue such shares is included in common
stock issuable in the consolidated balance sheet. In connection with the deferred bonus plan, 150,000
shares of M&T common stock were authorized for issuance, of which 44,597 shares
have been issued.

Directors’ stock plan

The Company maintains a compensation plan for non-employee members of the
Company’s boards of directors and directors advisory councils that allows such
members to receive all or a portion of their compensation in shares of M&T
common stock. In connection with the directors’ stock plan, 100,000 shares of
M&T common stock were authorized for issuance, of which 39,816 shares have been
issued.

In connection with the Keystone acquisition, the Company assumed an

directors compensation plan. Shares of common stock issuable under such plan
were 43,598 and 45,685 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
obligation to issue such shares is included in common stock issuable in the
consolidated balance sheet.

Management stock ownership program

Keystone had a management stock ownership program which established stock
ownership goals for senior management of Keystone. In order to assist senior
management in attaining their goals, a related plan provided for nonrecourse,
noninterest-bearing loans to be used to purchase Keystone common stock at fair
market value. The Company acquired these loans as a result of the Keystone
transaction. The loans are secured by collateral having an initial value of
120% of the loan amount and consisting of M&T common stock (Keystone stock
purchased with the loan)plus additional shares of stock or other acceptable
collateral owned by the executive. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the amount
owed M&T for the financed stock purchased totaled $4,601,000 and is classified
as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet.
The amounts are due to M&T no later than October 5, 2010.

Pension plan assets included common stock of M&T with a fair value of
$26,021,000 and $23,889,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The Company has a retirement savings plan (“Savings Plan”) that is a
defined contribution plan in which eligible employees of the Company may defer
up to 15% of qualified compensation via contributions to the plan. The Company
makes an employer matching contribution in an amount equal to 75% of an
employee’s contribution, up to 4.5% of the employee’s qualified compensation.
Employees’ accounts, including employee contributions, employer matching
contributions and accumulated earnings thereon, are at all times fully vested
and nonforfeitable. The Company’s contributions to the Savings Plan totaled
$10,724,000, $10,103,000 and $7,699,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

12. Income taxes, continued

The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return reflecting
taxable income earned by all subsidiaries. In prior years, applicable federal
tax law allowed certain financial institutions the option of deducting as bad
debt expense for tax purposes amounts in excess of actual losses. In
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, such financial
institutions were not required to provide deferred income taxes on such excess.
Recapture of the excess tax bad debt reserve established under the previously
allowed method will result in taxable income if M&T Bank fails to maintain bank
status as defined in the Internal Revenue Code or charges are made to the
reserve for other than bad debt losses. At December 31, 2002 M&T Bank’s tax
bad debt reserve for which no federal income taxes have been provided was
$74,021,000. No actions are planned that would cause this reserve to become
wholly or partially taxable.

The portion of income taxes attributable to gains or losses on sales of
bank investment securities was a benefit of $221,000 and $1,216,000 in 2002 and
2000, respectively, and an expense of $724,000 in 2001. No alternative
minimum tax expense was recognized in 2002, 2001 or 2000.

Total income taxes differed from the amount computed by applying the
statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income as follows:

$6,374,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Deposits at M&T Bank’s
offshore branch office were $1,160,716,000 and $777,895,000 at December 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

17. Derivative financial instruments

As described in note 1, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, as amended, as of
January 1, 2001. The January 1, 2001 transition adjustment prescribed by SFAS
No. 133 was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial position or
its results of operations.

As part of managing interest rate risk, the Company has entered into
several interest rate swap agreements. The agreements modify the repricing
characteristics of certain portions of the Company’s portfolios of earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate swap agreements are
generally entered into with counterparties that meet established credit
standards and most contain collateral provisions protecting the at-risk party. The
Company considers the credit risk inherent in these contracts to be negligible.

-117-


M&T BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements, continued

17. Derivative financial instruments, continued

Beginning January 1, 2001, the Company has designated its interest rate
swap agreements utilized in the management of interest rate risk as either fair
value hedges or cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS No. 133. The Company
utilizes interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges to
protect its exposure to changes in the fair value of certain recognized assets
and liabilities. The Company also utilizes an interest rate swap agreement
designated as a cash flow hedge to protect against the variability in cash
flows of variable rate long-term borrowings.

Information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest
rate risk management purposes summarized by type of financial instrument the
swap agreements were intended to hedge or modify follows:

(a)

Under the terms of these agreements, the Company receives settlement
amounts at a variable rate and pays at a fixed rate.

(b)

Under the terms of these agreements, the Company receives settlement
amounts at a fixed rate and pays at a variable rate.

17. Derivative financial instruments, continued

The estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements represents the
amount the Company would have expected to receive (pay) to terminate such
contracts. At December 31, 2002, the estimated fair value of interest rate swap
agreements designated as fair value hedges was substantially offset by
unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of the
hedged items. The estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements
designated as cash flow hedges, net of applicable income taxes, is included in
“accumulated other comprehensive income, net” in the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet. For periods prior to January 1, 2001, the estimated fair value
of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management
purposes was not recognized in the consolidated financial statements, except
for swap agreements that modified the repricing characteristics of investment
securities classified as available for sale. Changes in the fair value of such
swap agreements and investment securities were included in other comprehensive
income, net of applicable income taxes.

At December 31, 2002 the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements
outstanding mature as follows:

The net effect of interest rate swap agreements was to increase net
interest income by $8,822,000 in 2002, $6,720,000 in 2001 and $13,000 in 2000.
The average notional amount of interest rate swap agreements impacting net
interest income which were entered into for interest rate risk management
purposes were $693,910,000 in 2002, $522,730,000 in 2001 and $875,933,000 in
2000.

In anticipation of M&T Bank’s issuance of $500 million of fixed rate
subordinated capital notes in October 2000, the Company terminated certain
interest rate swap agreements, including forward-starting agreements, with an
aggregate notional amount of $421 million. Under the terms of the terminated
agreements, the Company was required to make fixed-rate payments and receive
variable-rate payments. The termination of the agreements, which had been
entered into to hedge interest rate risk associated with fixed-rate commercial
real estate loans, resulted in a net deferred gain of $15,460,000 which is
being recognized in income over the designated hedge period of the agreements.
Income recognized in 2002, 2001 and 2000 related to the terminated swap
agreements totaled $2,239,000, $1,834,000 and $311,000, respectively. The net
increase in interest income in future years from amortization of the deferred
gain related to the interest rate swap terminations is as follows:

The Company utilizes commitments to sell residential real estate loans to
hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of residential real estate
loans held for sale. Beginning January 1, 2001, such commitments have been
designated as fair value hedges and, as a result, the commitments and the
hedged loans are recorded at estimated fair value. The Company also utilizes
commitments to sell residential real estate loans to offset the exposure to
changes in the fair value of certain commitments to originate residential real
estate loans for sale. As a result of these activities, at December 31, 2002
and 2001 net unrealized pre-tax gains related to loans held for sale,
commitments to originate loans for sale, and commitments to sell loans were
approximately $15 million and $8 million, respectively. Such unrealized gains
are included in mortgage banking revenues and, in general, are realized in
subsequent periods as the related loans are sold. Prior to the adoption of
SFAS No. 133, residential real estate loans held for sale and related
commitments to sell loans and to originate loans for sale were recorded at the
lower of aggregate cost or fair market value.

The amount of hedge ineffectiveness of both fair value and cash flow
hedges recognized in 2002 and 2001 was not material to the Company’s results of
operations.

Derivative financial instruments used for trading purposes included
foreign exchange and other option contracts, foreign exchange forward and spot
contracts, interest rate swap contracts and financial futures. The

respectively.

18. Disclosures about fair value of financial instruments

SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,” requires
disclosure of the estimated “fair value” of financial instruments. “Fair
value” is generally defined as the price a willing buyer and a willing seller
would exchange for a financial instrument in other than a distressed sale
situation. Disclosures related to fair value presented herein are as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001.

With the exception of marketable securities, certain off-balance sheet
financial instruments and one-to-four family residential mortgage loans
originated for sale, the Company’s financial instruments are not readily
marketable and market prices do not exist. The Company, in attempting to
comply with the provisions of SFAS No. 107, has not attempted to market its
financial instruments to potential buyers, if any exist. Since negotiated
prices in illiquid markets depend greatly upon the then present motivations of
the buyer and seller, it is reasonable to assume that actual sales prices could
vary widely from any estimate of fair value made without the benefit of
negotiations. Additionally, changes in market interest rates can dramatically
impact the value of financial instruments in a short period of time.

The estimated fair values of investments in readily marketable debt and
equity securities were based on quoted market prices at the respective
year-end. In arriving at estimated fair value of other financial instruments,
the Company generally used calculations based upon discounted cash flows of the
related financial instruments. In general, discount rates used for loan
products were based on the Company’s pricing at the respective year-end. A
higher discount rate was assumed with respect to estimated cash flows
associated with nonaccrual loans.

As more fully described in note 3, the carrying value and estimated fair
value of investment securities were as follows:

The allowance for credit losses represented the Company’s assessment of
the overall level of credit risk inherent in the portfolio and totaled
$436,472,000 and $425,008,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

As described in note 17, the Company enters into various commitments to
originate residential real estate loans for sale and commitments to sell
residential real estate loans. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, beginning
January 1, 2001 such commitments are considered to be derivative financial
instruments and therefore, are carried at estimated fair value on the
consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair values of such commitments were
generally calculated based on quoted market prices for commitments to sell
residential real estate loans to certain government sponsored entities and
other parties. The Company’s commitments to originate residential real estate
loans for sale represented aggregate fair value gains of $10,075,000 at
December 31, 2002 and aggregate fair value losses of $2,795,000 at December 31,
2001. The Company’s commitments to sell residential real estate loans
represented aggregate fair value losses of $15,139,000 at December 31, 2002 and
aggregate fair value gains of $8,862,000 at December 31, 2001. Unrealized fair
value gains and losses at December 31, 2002 and 2001 are included in other
assets and other liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet.

M&T BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements, continued

As described in note 19, in the normal course of business, various
commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding, such as loan
commitments, credit guarantees and letters of credit. The Company’s pricing of
such financial instruments is based largely on credit quality and relationship,
probability of funding and other requirements. Commitments generally have
fixed expiration dates and contain termination and other clauses which provide
for relief from funding in the event of significant deterioration in the credit
quality of the customer. The rates and terms of the Company’s loan
commitments, credit guarantees and letters of credit are competitive with other
financial institutions operating in markets served by the Company. The Company
believes that the carrying amounts are reasonable estimates of the fair value
of these financial instruments. Other than residential real estate
loan-related commitments described above, such carrying amounts, comprised
principally of unamortized fee income, are included in other liabilities and
totaled $12,486,000 and $7,733,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

SFAS No. 107 requires that the estimated fair value ascribed to
noninterest-bearing deposits, savings deposits and NOW accounts be established
at carrying value because of the customers’ ability to withdraw funds
immediately. Time deposit accounts are required to be revalued based upon
prevailing market interest rates for similar maturity instruments.

The following summarizes the results of these calculations:

The Company believes that deposit accounts have a value greater than that
prescribed by SFAS No. 107. The Company feels, however, that the value
associated with these deposits is greatly influenced by characteristics of the
buyer, such as the ability to reduce the costs of servicing the deposits and
deposit attrition which often occurs following an acquisition. Accordingly,
estimating the fair value of deposits with any degree of certainty is not
practical.

As more fully described in note 17, the Company had entered into interest
rate swap agreements for purposes of managing the Company’s exposure to
changing interest rates. The estimated fair value of interest rate swap
agreements represents the amount the Company would have expected to receive or

As described in note 17, the Company also uses certain derivative
financial instruments as part of its trading activities. Interest rate
contracts entered into for trading purposes had notional values and estimated
fair value gains of $1.3 billion and $1,096,000, respectively, at December 31,
2002 and notional values and estimated fair value gains of $1.4 billion and
$1,083,000, respectively, at December 31, 2001. The Company also entered into
foreign exchange and other option and futures contracts totaling approximately
$290 million and $242 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Such contracts were valued at gains of $121,000 and losses of $185,000 at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. All trading account assets and
liabilities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair
value. The fair values of all trading account assets and liabilities were $52
million and $36 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002 and $39 million and
$27 million, respectively, at December 31, 2001.

Due to the near maturity of other money-market assets and short-term
borrowings, the Company estimates that the carrying value of such instruments
approximates estimated fair value. The carrying value and estimated fair value
of long-term borrowings were $4,497,374,000 and $4,692,771,000, respectively,
at December 31, 2002 and $3,461,769,000 and $3,505,520,000, respectively, at
December 31, 2001.

The Company does not believe that the estimated fair value information
presented herein is representative of the earnings power or value of the
Company. The preceding analysis, which is inherently limited in depicting fair
value, also does not consider any value associated with existing customer
relationships nor the ability of the Company to create value through loan
origination, deposit gathering or fee generating activities.

Many of the fair value estimates presented herein are based upon the use
of highly subjective information and assumptions and, accordingly, the results
may not be precise. Management believes that fair value estimates may not be
comparable between financial institutions due to the wide range of permitted
valuation techniques and numerous estimates which must be made. Furthermore,
since the disclosed fair value amounts were estimated as of the balance sheet
date, the amounts actually realized or paid upon maturity or settlement of the
various financial instruments could be significantly different.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers,
generally having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may
require payment of a fee. Standby and commercial letters of credit are
conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a
third party. Standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the
failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of the underlying
contract with the third party, whereas commercial letters of credit are issued
to facilitate commerce and typically result in the commitment being funded when
the underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and third party.
The credit risk associated with commitments to extend credit and standby and
commercial letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with
extending loans to customers and is subject to normal credit policies.
Collateral may be obtained based on management’s assessment of the customer’s
creditworthiness.

In December 2002, M&T Bank entered into a mandatory purchase agreement
with an unaffiliated asset-backed security trust. The agreement provides for
M&T Bank to guarantee the purchase of the outstanding Class A-1, AAA rated
securities of the special purpose trust at par value less credit losses in the
event that the trust’s scheduled sale of the underlying collateral is not
achieved. Such sale is scheduled to occur when the remaining principal balance
of the Class A-1 securities is less than $56 million, which represents 35% of
the aggregate principal balance of the securities at the date of original
issuance (estimated to be four years). The original par value of the Class A-1
securities
issued from the trust was $160 million. The securities are backed by
approximately $300 million of residential and commercial real estate loans held
by the trust. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of this
guarantee is equal to the par value of the Class A-1 securities, less credit
losses, at the time it may be necessary to perform under the purchase guarantee
agreement. Management believes that the probability of a loss of that
magnitude is remote and currently estimates no material losses will occur as a
result of the agreement.

Since many loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and guarantees and
indemnification contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the
contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell residential real estate loans to
hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of residential real estate loans
held for sale. Such commitments are considered derivatives in accordance with
SFAS No. 133, and along with commitments to originate residential real estate
loans to be held for sale and hedged residential real estate loans held for
sale are now generally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at estimated
fair market value. Additional information about such derivative financial
instruments is included in note 17.

The Company also has commitments under long-term operating leases as
described in note 6.

M&T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course of business to
various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary
damages are asserted. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, does
not anticipate that the aggregate ultimate liability, if any, arising out of
litigation pending against M&T or its subsidiaries will be material to the
Company’s consolidated financial position, but at the present time is not in a
position to determine whether such litigation will have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations in any future
reporting period.

20. Segment information

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures About Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information,” reportable segments have been
determined based upon the Company’s internal profitability reporting system,
which is organized by strategic business units. Certain strategic business
units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the
nature of the products and services, the type of customer and the distribution
of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are
Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio,
Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking.

The financial information of the Company’s segments has been compiled
utilizing the accounting policies described in note 1 with certain exceptions.
The more significant of these exceptions are described herein. The Company
allocates interest income or interest expense using a methodology that charges
users of funds (assets) interest expense and credits providers of funds
(liabilities) with income based on the maturity, prepayment and/or repricing
characteristics of the assets and liabilities. The net effect of this
allocation is recorded in the “All Other” category. A provision for credit
losses is allocated to segments in an amount based largely on actual net
charge-offs incurred by the segment during the period plus or minus an amount
necessary to adjust the segment’s allowance for credit losses due to changes
in loan balances. In contrast, the level of the consolidated provision
for credit losses is determined using the methodologies described in note 1 to
assess the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Indirect
fixed and variable expenses incurred by certain centralized support areas are
allocated to segments based on actual usage (for example, volume measurements)
and other criteria. Certain types of administrative expenses and bankwide
expense accruals (including amortization of goodwill and core deposit and other
intangible assets) are generally not allocated to segments. Income taxes are
allocated to segments based on the Company’s marginal statutory tax rate
adjusted for any tax-exempt income or non-deductible expenses. Equity is

allocated to the segments based on regulatory capital requirements and in proportion to an assessment of the inherent risks associated with the business
of the segment (including interest, credit and operating risk).

The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling
segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial
accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to generally
accepted accounting principles. As a result, reported segment results are not
necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial
institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation
methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment
financial data. Information about the Company’s segments is presented in the
accompanying table.

The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products
and banking services to middle-market and large commercial customers, largely
within the markets the Company serves. Among the services provided by this
segment are commercial lending and leasing, deposit products and cash
management services. The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit
services which are secured by various types of multifamily residential and
commercial real estate and deposit services to its customers. The
Discretionary Portfolio segment includes securities, residential mortgage loans
and other assets; short-term and long-term borrowed funds; brokered
certificates of deposit and interest rate swap agreements related thereto; and
offshore branch deposits. This segment also provides services to commercial
customers and consumers which include foreign exchange, securities trading and
municipal bond underwriting and sales. The Residential Mortgage Banking
segment originates and services residential mortgage loans for consumers and
sells substantially all of those loans in the secondary market to investors or
to bank subsidiaries of M&T. Residential mortgage loans held for sale
are included in the Residential Mortgage Banking segment. The Retail Banking
segment offers a variety of consumer and small business services through
several delivery channels which include traditional and “in-store” banking
offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and internet banking.
The “All Other” category includes other operating activities of the Company
that are not directly attributable to the reported segments as determined in
accordance with SFAS No. 131, the difference between the provision for credit
losses and the calculated provision allocated to the reportable segments,
goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from
acquisitions of financial institutions, the net impact of the Company’s
internal funds transfer pricing methodology, eliminations of transactions
between reportable segments, merger-related expenses, the residual effects of
unallocated support systems and general and administrative expenses, and the
impact of interest rate risk management strategies. The amount of
intersegment activity eliminated in arriving at consolidated totals was
included in the “All Other” category as follows:

(a)

Net interest income is the difference between
actual taxable-equivalent interest earned on assets and interest paid on
liabilities by a segment and a funding charge (credit) based on the
Company’s internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Segments are
charged a cost to fund any assets (e.g. loans) and are paid a funding credit
for any funds provided (e.g. deposits). The taxable-equivalent adjustment
aggregated $14,049,000 in 2002, $17,513,000 in 2001 and $10,547,000 in 2000
and is eliminated in “All Other” net
interest income and income tax expense (benefit).

(b)

Including the impact in the “All Other” category of the merger-related expenses described in note 2.

(c)

During 2002, a strategic business unit which had previously been included in the Commercial Banking segment was moved to the Commercial Real Estate segment for internal profitability reporting purposes. As a result, approximately $270 million of loans were
transferred from the Commercial Banking segment to the Commercial Real Estate segment. Reflecting this change, net income decreased in the Commercial Banking segment and increased in the Commercial Real Estate segment from the amounts previously reported by
approximately $4 million and $2 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Financial information for such years has been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

The Company conducts substantially all of its operations in the United
States. There are no transactions with a single customer that in the aggregate
result in revenues that exceed ten percent of consolidated total revenues.

21. Regulatory matters

Payment of dividends by M&T’s banking subsidiaries is restricted by various
legal and regulatory limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T
are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current
year and the preceding two years. For purposes of this test, at December 31,
2002, approximately $407,168,000 was available for payment of dividends to M&T
from banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval.

Banking regulations prohibit extensions of credit by the subsidiary banks
to M&T unless appropriately secured by assets. Securities of affiliates are
not eligible as collateral for this purpose.

The bank subsidiaries are required to maintain noninterest-earning
reserves against certain deposit liabilities. During the maintenance periods
that included December 31, 2002 and 2001, cash and due from banks included a
daily average of $311,810,000 and $287,830,000, respectively, for such purpose.

Federal regulators have adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank
holding companies and banks. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by
regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on the Company’s
financial statements. Under the capital adequacy guidelines, the so-called
“Tier 1 capital” and “Total capital” as a percentage of risk-weighted assets
and certain off-balance sheet financial instruments must be at least 4% and 8%,
respectively. In addition to these risk-based measures, regulators also
require banking institutions that meet certain qualitative criteria to maintain
a minimum “leverage” ratio of “Tier 1 capital” to average total assets,
adjusted for goodwill and certain other items, of at least 3% to be considered
adequately capitalized. As of December 31, 2002, M&T and each of its banking
subsidiaries exceeded all applicable capital adequacy requirements.

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the most recent notifications from
federal regulators categorized each of M&T’s bank subsidiaries as well
capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be
considered well capitalized, a banking institution must maintain Tier 1
risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and leverage ratios of at least
6%, 10% and 5%, respectively. Management is unaware of any conditions or
events since the latest notifications from federal regulators that have changed
the capital adequacy category of M&T’s bank subsidiaries.
