Item 1.

Business.

M&T Bank Corporation (“Registrant” or “M&T”) is a New York business corporation
which is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”) and under Article III-A of the New York
Banking Law (“Banking Law”). The principal executive offices of the Registrant
are located at One M&T Plaza, Buffalo, New York 14203. The Registrant was
incorporated in November 1969. The Registrant and its direct and indirect
subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the “Company.” As of
December 31, 2003 the Company had consolidated total assets of $49.8 billion,
deposits of $33.1 billion and stockholders’ equity of $5.7 billion. The
Company had 12,426 full-time and 1,574 part-time employees as of December 31,
2003.

At December 31, 2003, the Registrant had two wholly owned bank subsidiaries:
Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T Bank”) and M&T Bank, National
Association (“M&T Bank, N.A.”). The banks collectively offer a wide range of
commercial banking, trust and investment services to their customers. At
December 31, 2003, M&T Bank represented 99% of consolidated assets of the
Company.

The Company from time to time considers acquiring banks, thrift institutions,
branch offices or other businesses within markets currently served by the
Company or in other locations that would complement the Company’s business or
its geographic reach. The Company has pursued acquisition opportunities in the
past, continues to review different opportunities, including the possibility of
major acquisitions, and intends to continue this practice.

Acquisition of Allfirst Financial
Inc.

On April 1, 2003, M&T completed the acquisition of Allfirst Financial Inc.
(“Allfirst”), a bank holding company headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland.
Acquired assets on April 1, 2003 totaled $16 billion, including $10 billion of
loans and leases, liabilities assumed aggregated $14 billion, including $11
billion of deposits, and $2 billion was added to stockholders’ equity.
Allfirst had a strong banking presence in Maryland and central Pennsylvania.
Allfirst and its subsidiaries served customers through a network of 269 full
service offices and approximately 600 ATMs in the mid-Atlantic region of the
United States. Prior to April 1, 2003, Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c. (“AIB”)
controlled 100% of the voting power of Allfirst’s outstanding capital stock.

Allfirst’s primary subsidiary bank was Allfirst Bank, which operated in
Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Delaware and the District of Columbia.
Allfirst Bank’s bank and non-bank subsidiaries offered a variety of financial
services, including trust and asset management, leasing, discount brokerage
services, sales of mutual funds and annuities, investment advisory services,
reinsurance, brokerage, mortgage banking and community development. One of the
most notable Allfirst non-banking activities was its trust and asset management
business with $15.7 billion in assets under management. Allied Investment
Advisors, the main institutional advisory subsidiary of Allfirst, managed over
$10 billion in assets from 175 institutions.

When the Allfirst acquisition was consummated, the combined company had over
700 branches in six states and the District of Columbia, and a leading
deposit market share in the combined area of upstate New York, central
Pennsylvania and Maryland.

Under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated September 26,
2002 by and among AIB, Allfirst and M&T (the “Reorganization Agreement”), M&T
combined with Allfirst through the acquisition of all of the issued and
outstanding Allfirst stock in exchange for 26,700,000 shares of M&T common
stock and $886,107,000 in cash paid to AIB. Immediately thereafter, Allfirst
merged with and into M&T, with M&T being the surviving company. Allfirst Bank
merged with and into M&T Bank, with M&T Bank being the surviving bank.

- 5 -


As a result of the transaction, AIB owns approximately 22.5% of the issued and
outstanding shares of M&T common stock. Further, there are several M&T
corporate governance changes that have resulted from the transaction. While it
maintains a significant ownership in M&T, AIB will have representation on the
M&T board, the M&T Bank board and key M&T board committees and will have
certain protections of its rights as a substantial M&T shareholder. In
addition, AIB will have rights that will facilitate its ability to maintain its
proportionate ownership position in M&T. M&T will also have representation on
the AIB board while AIB remains a significant
shareholder. The following is a description of the ongoing relationship
between M&T and AIB that resulted from the Allfirst acquisition. The following
description is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Reorganization
Agreement. The Reorganization Agreement was filed with the Securities Exchange
Commission on October 3, 2002 as Exhibit 2 to the Current Report on Form 8-K of
M&T dated September 26, 2002.

Board of Directors; Management

At December 31, 2003, AIB held approximately 22.5% of the issued and
outstanding shares of M&T common stock. In defining their relationship after
the acquisition, M&T and AIB negotiated certain agreements regarding share
ownership and corporate governance issues such as board representation, with
the number of AIB’s representatives on the M&T and M&T Bank boards of directors
being dependent upon the amount of M&T common stock held by AIB. M&T has the
right to one seat on the AIB board of directors until AIB no longer holds at
least 15% of the outstanding shares of M&T common stock. Pursuant to the
Reorganization Agreement, AIB has the right to name four members to serve on
the Boards of Directors of M&T and M&T Bank, each of whom must be reasonably
acceptable to M&T (collectively, the “AIB Designees”). Further, one of the AIB
Designees will serve on each of the Executive Committee, Nomination,
Compensation and Governance Committee, and Audit Committee (or any committee or
committees performing comparable functions) of the M&T board of directors. In
order to serve, the AIB Designees must meet the requisite independence and
expertise requirements prescribed under applicable law or stock exchange rules.
In addition, the Reorganization Agreement provides that the board of directors
of M&T Bank will include four members designated by AIB, each of whom must be
reasonably acceptable to M&T.

As long as AIB remains a significant shareholder of M&T, AIB will have
representation on the boards of directors of both M&T and M&T Bank as follows:

- 6 -


within one year. Additionally, as described in more detail below, M&T has
agreed to repurchase shares of M&T common stock in order to offset dilution
to AIB’s ownership interests that may otherwise be caused by issuances of
M&T common stock under M&T employee and director benefit or stock purchase
plans. Dilution of AIB’s ownership position caused by such issuances will
not be counted in determining whether the “Sunset Date” has occurred or
whether any of AIB’s other rights under the Reorganization Agreement have
terminated. The “Sunset Date” is the date on which AIB no longer holds at
least 15% of the M&T common stock, calculated as described in this
paragraph.

The AIB Designees at December 31, 2003 were Michael D. Buckley, Derek C.
Hathaway, Gary Kennedy and Eugene J. Sheehy. Mr. Buckley serves as a member of
the Executive Committee and the Nomination, Compensation and Governance
Committee, and Mr. Hathaway serves as a member of the Audit Committee. Robert
G. Wilmers joined the AIB board of directors.

Amendments to M&T’s Bylaws

Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, M&T has amended and restated its
bylaws. The following is a description of the amended bylaws:

The amended bylaws provide that until the Sunset Date, the M&T board of
directors may not take or make any recommendation to M&T’s shareholders
regarding the following actions without the approval of the Executive
Committee, including the approval of the AIB Designee serving on the committee:

•

Any amendment of M&T’s Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws that
would be inconsistent with the rights described herein or that would
otherwise have an adverse effect on the board representation,
committee representation or other rights of AIB contemplated by the
Reorganization Agreement;

•

Any activity not permissible for a U.S. bank holding company;

•

The adoption of any shareholder rights plan or other measures having
the purpose or effect of preventing or materially delaying completion
of any transaction involving a change in control of M&T; and

•

Any public announcement disclosing M&T’s desire or intention to take
any of the foregoing actions.

The amended bylaws also provide that until the Sunset Date, the M&T board of
directors may only take or make any recommendation to M&T’s shareholders
regarding the following actions if the action has been approved by the
Executive Committee (in the case of the first four items and sixth item below)
or Nomination and Compensation Committee (in the case of the fifth item below)
and the members of such committee not voting in favor of the action do not
include the AIB Designee serving on such committee and at least one other
member of the committee who is not an AIB Designee:

•

Any reduction in M&T’s cash dividend policy such that the ratio of
cash dividends to net income is less than 15%, or any extraordinary
dividends or distributions to holders of M&T common stock;

•

Any acquisition of any assets or businesses, (1) if the consideration
is in M&T common stock, where the stock consideration paid by M&T
exceeds 10% of the aggregate voting power of M&T common stock and (2)
if the consideration is cash, M&T stock or other consideration, where
the fair market value of the consideration paid by M&T exceeds 10% of
the market capitalization of M&T, as determined under the
Reorganization Agreement;

- 7 -


•

Any sale of any assets or businesses in which the value of the
aggregate consideration to be received exceeds 10% of the market
capitalization of M&T, as determined under the Reorganization
Agreement;

•

Any liquidation or dissolution of M&T;

•

The appointment or election of the Chairman of the board of directors
or the Chief Executive Officer of M&T; and

•

Any public announcement disclosing M&T’s desire or intention to take
any of the foregoing actions prior to obtaining the requisite
committee approval.

The provisions of the bylaws described above may not be amended or repealed
without the unanimous approval of the entire M&T board of directors or the
approval of the holders of not less than 80% of the outstanding shares of M&T
common stock. The provisions of the bylaws described above will automatically
terminate when AIB holds less than 5% of the outstanding shares of M&T common
stock.

Investment Parameters

The Reorganization Agreement provides that through the second anniversary of
the Sunset Date, without prior written consent of the M&T board of directors,
AIB will not, directly or indirectly, acquire or offer to acquire (except by
way of stock dividends, offerings made available to M&T shareholders generally,
or pursuant to compensation plans) more than 25% of the then outstanding shares
of M&T common stock. Further, during this period, AIB and AIB’s subsidiaries
have agreed not to participate in any proxy solicitation or to otherwise seek
to influence any M&T shareholder with respect to the voting of any shares of
M&T common stock for the approval of any shareholder proposals.

The Reorganization Agreement also provides that, during this period, AIB will
not make any public announcement with respect to any proposal or offer by AIB
or any AIB subsidiary with respect to certain transactions (such as mergers,
business combinations, tender or exchange offers, the sale or purchase of
securities or similar transactions) involving M&T or any of the M&T
subsidiaries. The Reorganization Agreement also provides that, during this
period, AIB may not subject any shares of M&T common stock to any voting trust
or voting arrangement or agreement and will not execute any written consent as
a shareholder with respect to the M&T common stock.

The Reorganization Agreement also provides that, during this period, AIB will
not seek to control or influence the management, the board of directors of M&T
or policies of M&T, including through communications with shareholders of M&T
or otherwise, except through non-public communications with the directors of
M&T, including the AIB Designees.

These restrictions on AIB will no longer apply if a third party commences or
announces its intention to commence a tender offer or an exchange offer and,
within a reasonable time, the M&T board of directors either does not recommend
that shareholders not accept the offer or fails to adopt a shareholders rights
plan, or if M&T or M&T Bank becomes subject to any regulatory capital directive
or becomes an institution in “troubled” condition under applicable banking
regulations. However, in the event the tender offer or exchange offer is not
commenced or consummated in accordance with its terms, the restrictions on AIB
described above will thereafter continue to apply.

Anti-Dilution Protections

M&T has agreed that until the Sunset Date, in the event M&T issues shares of
M&T stock (other than certain issuances to employees pursuant to option and

- 8 -


benefit plans), subject to applicable law and regulatory requirements, AIB will
have the right to purchase at fair market value up to the number of shares of
M&T common stock required to increase or maintain its equity interest in M&T to
22.5% of the then outstanding M&T common stock.

M&T has also agreed that until the Sunset Date, in connection with any issuance
of M&T stock pursuant to employee option or benefit plans, M&T will as soon as
reasonably practicable, taking into account applicable law, regulatory capital
requirements, capital planning and risk management, take such necessary actions
so that AIB’s proportionate ownership of M&T common stock is not reduced as a
result of such issuances, including by funding such issuances through purchases
of M&T common stock in the open market or by undertaking share repurchase
programs.

Sale of M&T Common Stock; Right of First Refusal in Certain Circumstances

The M&T common stock issued to AIB in connection with the Allfirst acquisition
was not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and
may only be disposed of by AIB pursuant to an effective registration statement
or pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and
subject to the provisions of the Reorganization Agreement.

M&T and AIB have entered into a registration rights agreement that provides
that upon AIB’s request, M&T will file a registration statement relating to all
or a portion of AIB’s shares of M&T common stock providing for the sale of such
shares by AIB from time to time on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415
under the Securities Act, provided that M&T need only effect one such “shelf
registration” in any 12-month period. In addition, the registration rights
agreement provides that AIB is entitled to demand registration under the
Securities Act of all or part of its shares of M&T stock, provided that M&T is
not obligated to effect two such “demand registrations” in any 12-month period.
Any demand or shelf registration must cover no less than one million shares.

The registration rights agreement further provides that in the event M&T
proposes to file a registration statement other than pursuant to a shelf
registration or demand registration or Forms S-8 or S-4, for an offering and
sale of shares by M&T in an underwritten offering or an offering and sale of
shares on behalf of one or more selling shareholders, M&T must give AIB notice
at least 15 days prior to the anticipated filing date, and AIB may request that
all or a portion of its M&T common shares be included in the registration
statement. M&T will honor the request, unless the managing underwriter advises
M&T in writing that in its opinion the inclusion of all shares requested to be
included by M&T, the other selling shareholders, if any, and AIB would
materially and adversely affect the offering, in which case M&T may limit the
number of shares included in the offering to a number that would not reasonably
be expected to have such an effect. In such event, the number of shares to be
included in the registration statement shall first include the number of shares
requested to be included by M&T and then the shares requested by other selling
shareholders, including AIB, on a pro rata basis according to the number of
shares requested to be included in the registration statement by each
shareholder.

As long as AIB holds 5% or more of the outstanding shares of M&T common stock,
AIB will not dispose of any of its shares of M&T common stock except, subject
to the terms and conditions of the Reorganization Agreement and applicable law,
in a widely dispersed public distribution; a private placement in which no one
party acquires the right to purchase more than 2% of the outstanding shares of
M&T common stock; an assignment to a single party (such as a broker or
investment banker) for the purpose of conducting a widely dispersed public
distribution on AIB’s behalf; pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act;
pursuant to a tender or exchange offer to M&T’s shareholders not opposed by
M&T’s board of directors, or open market purchase programs made by M&T; with
the consent of M&T, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, to a

- 9 -


controlled subsidiary of AIB; or pursuant to M&T’s right of first refusal as
described below.

The Reorganization Agreement provides that until AIB no longer holds at least
5% of the outstanding shares of M&T common stock, if AIB wishes to sell or

otherwise transfer any of its shares of M&T common stock other than as
described in the preceding paragraph, AIB must first submit an offer notice to
M&T identifying the proposed transferee and setting forth the proposed terms of
the transaction, which shall be limited to sales for cash, cash equivalents or
marketable securities. M&T will have the right, for 20 days following receipt
of an offer notice from AIB, to purchase all (but not less than all) of the
shares of M&T common stock that AIB wishes to sell, on the proposed terms
specified in the offer notice. If M&T declines or fails to respond to the
offer notice within 20 days, AIB may sell all or a portion of the M&T shares
specified in the offer notice to the proposed transferee at a purchase price
equal to or greater than the price specified in the offer notice, at any time
during the three months following the date of the offer notice, or, if prior
notification to or approval of the sale by the Federal Reserve Board or another
regulatory agency is required, AIB shall pursue regulatory approval
expeditiously and the sale may occur on the first date permitted under
applicable law.

Certain Post-Closing Bank Regulatory Matters

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve Board”)
deems AIB to be M&T’s bank holding company for purposes of the BHCA. In
addition, the New York Banking Superintendent (“Banking Superintendent”) deems
AIB to be M&T’s bank holding company for purposes of Article III-A of the
Banking Law. Among other things, this means that, should M&T propose to make
an acquisition or engage in a new type of activity that requires the submission
of an application or notice to the Federal Reserve Board or the Banking
Superintendent, AIB, as well as M&T, may also be required to file an
application or notice. The Reorganization Agreement generally provides that
AIB will make any applications, notices or filings that M&T determines to be
necessary or desirable. The Reorganization Agreement also requires AIB not to
take any action that would have a material adverse effect on M&T and to advise
M&T prior to entering into any material transaction or activity. These
provisions of the Reorganization Agreement would no longer apply if AIB ceased
to be M&T’s bank holding company and also was not otherwise considered to
control M&T for purposes of the BHCA.

Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, if, as a result of any administrative
enforcement action under Section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the
“FDI Act”), memorandum of understanding, written agreement, supervisory letter
or any other action or determination of any regulatory agency relating to the
status of AIB (but not relating to the conduct of M&T or any subsidiary of
M&T), M&T or M&T Bank also becomes subject to such an action, memorandum,
agreement or letter that relates to M&T or any M&T subsidiary, or experiences
any fact, event or circumstance that affects M&T’s regulatory status or
compliance, and that in either case would be reasonably likely to create a
material burden on M&T or to cause any material adverse economic or operating
consequences to M&T or an M&T subsidiary (a “Material Regulatory Event”), then
M&T will notify AIB thereof in writing as promptly as practicable. Should AIB
fail to cure the Material Regulatory Event within 90 days following the receipt
of such notice, AIB will, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than
30 days from the end of the cure period, take any and all such actions (with
the reasonable cooperation of M&T as requested by AIB) as may be necessary or
advisable in order that it no longer has “control” of M&T for purposes of the
BHCA, including, if necessary, by selling some or all of its shares of M&T
common stock (subject to the right of first refusal provisions of the
Reorganization Agreement) and divesting itself as required of its board and
committee representation and governance rights as set forth in the
Reorganization Agreement. If, at the end of such 30-day period, the Material
Regulatory Event is continuing and AIB has not terminated its control of M&T,
then M&T will have the right to repurchase, at fair market value, such

- 10 -


amount of the M&T common stock owned by AIB as would result in AIB holding no
less than 4.9% of the outstanding shares of M&T common stock, pursuant to the
procedures detailed in the Reorganization Agreement.

As long as AIB is considered to “control” M&T for purposes of the BHCA or the
federal Change in Bank Control Act, if AIB acquires any insured depository
institution with total assets greater than 25% of the assets of M&T’s largest
insured depository institution subsidiary, then within two years AIB must
terminate its affiliation with the insured depository institution or take such
steps as may be necessary so that none of M&T’s bank subsidiaries would be
subject to “cross guarantee” liability for losses incurred if the institution
AIB acquired potentially were to fail. This liability applies under the FDI
Act to insured depository institutions that are commonly controlled. The
actions AIB would take could include disposing of shares of M&T common stock
and/or surrendering its representation or governance rights. Also, if such an
insured depository institution that is controlled by AIB and of the size
described in the first sentence of this paragraph that would be considered to
be commonly controlled with M&T’s insured depository institution subsidiaries
fails to meet applicable requirements to be “adequately capitalized” under
applicable U.S. banking laws, then AIB will have to take the actions described
in the previous sentence no later than 180 days after the date that the
institution failed to meet those requirements, unless the institution is sooner
returned to “adequately capitalized” status.

Other Acquisitions

Segment Information, Principal Products/Services

and Foreign Operations

Information about the Registrant’s business segments is included in note 21 of
Notes to Financial Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data” and is further discussed in Part II, Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by
strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined
for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and
services, the type of customer and the distribution of those products and
services are similar. The reportable segments are Commercial Banking,
Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking

such sources during those years is set forth on the Company’s Consolidated
Statement of Income filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data.”

Supervision and Regulation of the Company

The banking industry is subject to extensive state and federal regulation and
continues to undergo significant change. The following discussion summarizes

- 14 -


certain aspects of the banking laws and regulations that affect the Company.
Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are
frequently raised in Congress, in state legislatures, and before the various
bank regulatory agencies. The likelihood and timing of any changes and the
impact such changes might have on the Company are impossible to determine with
any certainty. A change in applicable laws or regulations, or a change in the
way such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts,
may have a material impact on the business, operations and earnings of the
Company. To the extent that the following information describes statutory or
regulatory provisions, it is qualified entirely by reference to the particular
statutory or regulatory provision.

Financial Services Modernization

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“Gramm-Leach”) enables combinations among
banks, securities firms and insurance companies. Under Gramm-Leach, bank
holding companies are permitted to offer their customers virtually any type of
financial service that is financial in nature or incidental thereto,
including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both underwriting and
agency), and merchant banking.

In order to engage in these new financial activities, a bank holding company
must qualify and register with the Federal Reserve Board as a “financial
holding company” by demonstrating that each of its bank subsidiaries is “well
capitalized,” “well managed,” and has at least a “satisfactory” rating under
the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”). M&T currently satisfies the
qualifications for registering as a financial holding company, but has not
elected to do so to date. For as long as AIB owns at least 15% of M&T’s
outstanding common stock, M&T may not become a financial holding company
without the approval of the Executive Committee of the M&T board of directors,
which must also include the affirmative approval of the AIB Designee on such
committee, as described above under the caption “Amendments to M&T’s Bylaws.”

The financial activities authorized by Gramm-Leach may also be engaged in by a
“financial subsidiary” of a national or state bank, except for insurance or
annuity underwriting, insurance company portfolio investments, real estate
investment and development, and merchant banking, which must be conducted in a
financial holding company. In order for these financial activities to be
engaged in by a financial subsidiary of a national or state bank, Gramm-Leach
requires each of the parent bank (and its sister-bank affiliates) to be well
capitalized and well managed; the aggregate consolidated assets of all of that
bank’s financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of its
consolidated total assets or $50 billion; the bank must have at least a
satisfactory CRA rating; and, if that bank is one of the 100 largest national
banks, it must meet certain financial rating or other comparable requirements.
M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. currently satisfy the qualifications for engaging
in financial activities through financial subsidiaries, but neither has elected
to do so to date. Gramm-Leach also establishes a system of functional
regulation, under which the federal banking agencies will regulate the banking
activities of financial holding companies and banks’ financial subsidiaries,
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will regulate their securities
activities, and state insurance regulators will regulate their insurance
activities. Rules developed by the federal financial institutions regulators
under Gramm-Leach require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in
some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent the disclosure of certain
personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The foregoing discussion
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutory provisions of
Gramm-Leach and the implementing regulations which have been or will be adopted
by various government agencies pursuant to Gramm-Leach.

Bank Holding Company Regulation

As a registered bank holding company, the Registrant and its nonbank
subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation under the BHCA by the
Federal Reserve Board and under the Banking Law by the Banking Superintendent.
The Federal Reserve Board requires regular reports from the Registrant and is

- 15 -


authorized by the BHCA to make regular examinations of the Registrant and its
subsidiaries.

The Registrant may not acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more
than 5% of the voting shares of any company, including a bank, without the
prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, except as specifically authorized
under the BHCA. The Registrant is also subject to regulation under the Banking
Law with respect to certain acquisitions of domestic banks. Under the BHCA, the
Registrant, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, may acquire
shares of non-banking corporations the activities of which are deemed by the
Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or
controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.

The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement powers over bank holding companies
and their non-banking subsidiaries, among other things, to interdict activities
that represent unsafe or unsound practices or constitute violations of law,
rule, regulation, administrative orders or written agreements with a federal
bank regulator. These powers may be exercised through the issuance of
cease-and-desist orders, civil money penalties or other actions.

Under the Federal Reserve Board’s statement of policy with respect to bank
holding company operations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a
source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to
commit all available resources to support such institutions in circumstances
where it might not do so absent such policy. Although this “source of
strength” policy has been challenged in litigation, the Federal Reserve Board
continues to take the position that it has authority to enforce it. For a
discussion of circumstances under which a bank holding company may be required
to guarantee the capital levels or performance of its subsidiary
banks,

see

“Capital Adequacy,” below. Consistent with this “source of strength” policy,
the Federal Reserve Board takes the position that a bank holding company
generally should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income
available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fully fund the
dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be
consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall
financial condition. The Federal Reserve also has the authority to terminate
any activity of a bank holding company that constitutes a serious risk to the
financial soundness or stability of any subsidiary depository institution or to
terminate its control of any bank or nonbank subsidiaries.

The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as
amended (the “Interstate Banking Act”) generally permits bank holding companies
to acquire banks in any state, and preempts all state laws restricting the
ownership by a bank holding company of banks in more than one state. The
Interstate Banking Act also permits a bank to merge with an out-of-state bank
and convert any offices into branches of the resulting bank if both states have
not opted out of interstate branching; permits a bank to acquire branches from
an out-of-state bank if the law of the state where the branches are located
permits the interstate branch acquisition; and permits banks to establish and
operate

de novo

interstate branches whenever the host state opts-in to

de novo

branching. Bank holding companies and banks seeking to engage in transactions
authorized by the Interstate Banking Act must be adequately capitalized and
managed.

The Banking Law authorizes interstate branching by merger or acquisition on a
reciprocal basis, and permits the acquisition of a single branch without
restriction, but does not provide for

de novo

interstate branching.

Bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks are also subject to the
provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of the CRA, the Federal Reserve Board
(or other appropriate bank regulatory agency) is required, in connection with
its examination of a bank, to assess such bank’s record in meeting the credit
needs of the communities served by that bank, including low- and
moderate-income neighborhoods. Furthermore, such assessment is also required
of any bank that has applied, among other things, to merge or consolidate with
or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of a federally-regulated

- 16 -


financial institution, or to open or relocate a branch office. In the case of
a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or bank holding
company, the Federal Reserve Board will assess the record of each subsidiary
bank of the applicant bank holding company in considering the application. The
Banking Law contains provisions similar to the CRA which are applicable to New
York-chartered banks.

Supervision and Regulation of Bank Subsidiaries

The Registrant’s bank subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation,
and are examined regularly, by various bank regulatory agencies: M&T Bank by
the Federal Reserve Board and the Banking Superintendent; and M&T Bank, N.A. by
the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). The Registrant and its direct
non-banking subsidiaries are affiliates, within the meaning of the Federal
Reserve Act, of the Registrant’s subsidiary banks and their subsidiaries. As a
result, the Registrant’s subsidiary banks and their subsidiaries are subject to
restrictions on loans or extensions of credit to, purchases of assets from,
investments in, and transactions with the Registrant and its direct non-banking
subsidiaries and on certain other transactions with them or involving their
securities. Gramm-Leach places similar restrictions on the Registrant’s
subsidiary banks making loans or extending credit to, purchasing assets from,
investing in, or entering into transactions with, their financial subsidiaries.

Under the “cross-guarantee” provisions of the FDI Act, insured depository
institutions under common control are required to reimburse the FDIC for any
loss suffered by either the BIF or SAIF of the FDIC as a result of the default
of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or for any assistance
provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in
danger of default. Thus, any insured depository institution subsidiary of M&T
could incur liability to the FDIC in the event of a default of another insured
depository institution owned or controlled by M&T. The FDIC’s claim under the
cross-guarantee provisions is superior to claims of stockholders of the insured
depository institution or its holding company and to most claims arising out of
obligations or liabilities owed to affiliates of the institution, but is
subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and holders of
subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured
depository institution. The FDIC may decline to enforce the cross-guarantee
provisions if it determines that a waiver is in the best interest of the BIF or
SAIF or both.

Dividends from Bank Subsidiaries

M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. are subject, under one or more of the banking laws,
to restrictions on the amount and frequency (no more often than quarterly) of
dividend declarations. Future dividend payments to the Registrant by its
subsidiary banks will be dependent on a number of factors, including the
earnings and financial condition of each such bank, and are subject to the
limitations referred to in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements filed
herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and
to other statutory powers of bank regulatory agencies.

An insured depository institution is prohibited from making any capital
distribution to its owner, including any dividend, if, after making such
distribution, the depository institution fails to meet the required minimum
level for any relevant capital measure, including the risk-based capital
adequacy and leverage standards discussed below.

Supervision and Regulation of M&T Bank’s Subsidiaries

M&T Bank has a number of subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are subject to the
laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in
which they conduct business. For example, M&T Securities is regulated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. and state securities regulators. M&T Mortgage also is subject to
state regulation in the states in which it operates.

Capital Adequacy

The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC have adopted risk-based capital
adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies and banks under their
supervision. Under these guidelines, the so-called “Tier 1 capital” and “Total
capital” as a percentage of risk-weighted assets and certain off-balance sheet
instruments must be at least 4% and 8%, respectively.

The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC have also imposed a leverage
standard to supplement their risk-based ratios. This leverage standard focuses
on a banking institution’s ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets,
adjusted for goodwill and certain other items. Under these guidelines, banking
institutions that meet certain criteria, including excellent asset quality,
high liquidity, low interest rate exposure and good earnings, and that have
received the highest regulatory rating must maintain a ratio of Tier 1 capital
to total adjusted average assets of at least 3%. Institutions not meeting
these criteria, as well as institutions with supervisory, financial or
operational weaknesses, along with those experiencing or anticipating
significant growth are expected to maintain a Tier 1 capital to total adjusted
average assets ratio equal to at least 4% to 5%. As reflected in the following
table, the risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios of the Registrant, M&T
Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. as of December 31, 2003 exceeded the required capital
ratios for classification as “well capitalized,” the highest classification
under the regulatory capital guidelines.

The federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC,
maintain risk-based capital standards in order to ensure that those standards
take adequate account of interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk, the
risk of nontraditional activities and equity investments in nonfinancial
companies, as well as reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss
on certain multifamily housing loans. Bank regulators periodically propose
amendments to the risk-based capital guidelines and related regulatory
framework, and consider changes to the risk-based capital standards that could
significantly increase the amount of capital needed to meet the requirements
for the capital tiers described below. While the Company’s management studies
such proposals, the timing of adoption, ultimate form and effect of any such
proposed amendments on the Company’s capital requirements and operations cannot
be predicted.

In January 2001, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a proposal
for a “New Capital Accord.” The New Capital Accord incorporates a three-part
framework of minimum capital requirements, supervisory review of an
institution’s capital adequacy and internal assessment process, and market
discipline through effective disclosure to encourage safe and sound banking
practices. The New Capital Accord is scheduled for implementation by the end
of 2006.

The federal banking agencies are required to take “prompt corrective action” in
respect of depository institutions and their bank holding companies that do

- 18 -


not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA established five capital tiers:
“well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly
undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository
institution’s capital tier, or that of its bank holding company, depends upon
where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures,
including a risk-based capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure,
and certain other factors.

Under the implementing regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies, a
bank holding company or bank is considered “well capitalized” if it has (i) a
total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based
capital ratio of 6% or greater, (iii) a leverage ratio of 5% or greater and
(iv) is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a
specific capital level for any capital measure. An “adequately capitalized”
bank holding company or bank is defined as one that has (i) a total risk-based
capital ratio of 8% or greater, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4% or
greater and (iii) a leverage ratio of 4% or greater (or 3% or greater in the
case of a bank with a composite CAMELS rating of 1). A bank holding company or
bank is considered (A) “undercapitalized” if it has (i) a total risk-based
capital ratio of less than 8%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less
than 4% or (iii) a leverage ratio of less than 4% (or 3% in the case of a bank
with a composite CAMELS rating of 1); (B) “significantly undercapitalized” if
the bank has (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, or (ii) a
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3% or (iii) a leverage ratio of
less than 3% and (C)“critically undercapitalized” if the bank has a ratio of
tangible equity to total assets equal to or less than 2%. The Federal Reserve
Board may reclassify a “well capitalized” bank holding company or bank as
“adequately capitalized” or subject an “adequately capitalized” or
“undercapitalized” institution to the supervisory actions applicable to the
next lower capital category if it determines that the bank holding company or
bank is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the bank holding company or
bank to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice and not to have corrected
the deficiency. M&T, M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. currently meet the definition
of “well capitalized” institutions.

“Undercapitalized” depository institutions, among other things, are subject to
growth limitations, are prohibited, with certain exceptions, from making
capital distributions, are limited in their ability to obtain funding from a
Federal Reserve Bank and are required to submit a capital restoration plan.
The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining,
among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is
likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. In
addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository
institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will
comply with such capital restoration plan and provide appropriate assurances of
performance. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan,
including if the holding company refuses or is unable to make the guarantee
described in the previous sentence, it is treated as if it is “significantly
undercapitalized.” Failure to submit or implement an acceptable capital plan
also is grounds for the appointment of a conservator or a receiver.
“Significantly undercapitalized” depository institutions may be subject to a
number of additional requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell
sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized,” requirements to
reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent
banks. Moreover, the parent holding company of a “significantly
undercapitalized” depository institution may be ordered to divest itself of the
institution or of nonbank subsidiaries of the holding company. “Critically
undercapitalized” institutions, among other things, are prohibited from making
any payments of principal and interest on subordinated debt, and are subject to
the appointment of a receiver or conservator.

Each federal banking agency prescribes standards for depository institutions
and depository institution holding companies relating to internal controls,
information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit
underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, a maximum
ratio of classified assets to capital, minimum earnings sufficient to absorb
losses, a minimum ratio of market value to book value for publicly traded

- 19 -


shares and other standards as they deem appropriate. The Federal Reserve Board
and OCC have adopted such standards.

Depository institutions that are not “well capitalized” or “adequately
capitalized” and have not received a waiver from the FDIC are prohibited from
accepting or renewing brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2003, M&T Bank and
M&T Bank, N.A. had approximately $889 million and $149 thousand of brokered
deposits, respectively.

Although M&T has issued shares of common stock in connection with acquisitions
or at other times, the Company has generally maintained capital ratios in
excess of minimum regulatory guidelines largely through internal capital
generation (i.e., net income less dividends paid). Historically, M&T’s
dividend payout ratio and dividend yield, when compared with other bank holding
companies, has been relatively low, thereby allowing for capital retention to
support growth or to facilitate purchases of M&T’s common stock to be held as
treasury stock. Management’s policy of reinvestment of earnings and repurchase
of shares of common stock is intended to enhance M&T’s earnings per share
prospects and thereby reward stockholders over time with capital gains in the
form of increased stock price rather than high dividend income.

FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments

As institutions with deposits insured by the BIF and the SAIF, M&T Bank and M&T
Bank, N.A. are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. Under current
law the regular insurance assessments to be paid by BIF-insured and
SAIF-insured institutions are specified in schedules issued by the FDIC that
specify, at semiannual intervals, target reserve ratios designed to maintain
the reserve ratios of each of those insurance funds at 1.25% of their
estimated insured deposits. The FDIC is also authorized to impose one or more
special assessments.

The FDIC has implemented a risk-based deposit premium assessment system under
which each depository institution is placed in one of nine assessment
categories based on the institution’s capital classification under the prompt
corrective action provisions described above, and whether such institution is
considered by its supervisory agency to be financially sound or to have
supervisory concerns. The adjusted assessment rates for both BIF-insured and
SAIF-insured institutions under the current system range from .00% to .27%
depending upon the assessment category into which the insured institution is
placed. Neither of the Company’s bank subsidiaries paid regular insurance
assessments to the FDIC in 2003. However, the FDIC retains the ability to
increase regular BIF and SAIF assessments and to levy special additional
assessments.

In addition to deposit insurance fund assessments, beginning in 1997 the FDIC
assessed BIF-assessable and SAIF-assessable deposits to fund the repayment of
debt obligations of the Financing Corporation (“FICO”). FICO is a government
agency-sponsored entity that was formed to borrow the money necessary to carry
out the closing and ultimate disposition of failed thrift institutions by the
Resolution Trust Corporation. The current annualized rates established by the
FDIC for both BIF-assessable and SAIF-assessable deposits are 1.54 basis points
(hundredths of one percent).

Any significant increases in assessment rates or additional special assessments
by the FDIC, could have an adverse impact on the results of operations and
capital of M&T Bank or M&T Bank, N.A.

USA Patriot Act

The USA Patriot Act imposes additional obligations on U.S. financial
institutions, including banks and broker dealer subsidiaries, to implement
policies, procedures and controls which are reasonably designed to detect and
report instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. In
addition, provisions of the USA Patriot Act require the federal financial
institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial
institution’s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and
bank holding company acquisitions.

Regulatory Impact of Allfirst Acquisition

As described above under the caption “Acquisition of Allfirst Financial Inc.,”
AIB owns approximately 22.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of M&T common
stock and has representation on the M&T and M&T Bank boards of directors. As a
result, AIB has become M&T’s bank holding company under the BHCA and the
Banking Law and AIB’s relationship with M&T is subject to the statutes and
regulations governing bank holding companies described above. Among other
things, AIB will have to join M&T in applications by M&T for acquisitions and
new activities. The Reorganization Agreement requires AIB to join in such
applications at M&T’s request, subject to certain limitations. In addition,
because AIB is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (the “CBI”), the CBI
may assert jurisdiction over M&T as a company controlled by AIB. Additional
discussion of the regulatory implications of the Allfirst acquisition for M&T
is set forth above under the caption “Certain Post-Closing Bank Regulatory
Matters.”

Governmental Policies

The earnings of the Company are significantly affected by the monetary and
fiscal policies of governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve
Board. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve
Board to implement these objectives are open-market operations in U.S.
Government securities and federal funds, changes in the discount rate on member
bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank
deposits. These instruments of monetary policy are used in varying
combinations to influence the overall level of bank loans, investments and
deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits. The
Federal Reserve Board frequently uses these instruments of monetary policy,
especially its open-market operations and the discount rate, to influence the
level of interest rates and to affect the strength of the economy, the level of
inflation or the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The monetary
policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the
operating results of banking institutions in the past and are expected to
continue to do so in the future. It is not possible to predict the nature of
future changes in monetary and fiscal policies, or the effect which they may
have on the Company’s business and earnings.

Competition

The Company competes in offering commercial and personal financial services
with other banking institutions and with firms in a number of other industries,
such as thrift institutions, credit unions, personal loan companies, sales
finance companies, leasing companies, securities firms and insurance
companies. Furthermore, diversified financial services companies are able to
offer a combination of these services to their customers on a nationwide basis.
The Company’s operations are significantly impacted by state and federal
regulations applicable to the banking industry. Moreover, the provisions of
Gramm-Leach may increase competition among diversified financial services
providers, and the Interstate Banking Act and the Banking Law may further ease
entry into New York State by out-of-state banking institutions. As a result,
the number of financial services providers and banking institutions with which
the Company competes may grow in the future.

Other Legislative Initiatives

Proposals may be introduced in the United States Congress and in the New York
State Legislature and before various bank regulatory authorities which would
alter the powers of, and restrictions on, different types of banking
organizations and which would restructure part or all of the existing
regulatory framework for banks, bank holding companies and other providers of
financial services. Moreover, other bills may be introduced in Congress which
would further regulate, deregulate or restructure the financial services
industry. It is not possible to predict whether these or any other proposals
will be enacted into law or, even if enacted, the effect which they may have on
the Company’s business and earnings.

Item 2.

Properties.

Both M&T and M&T Bank maintain their executive offices at One M&T Plaza in
Buffalo, New York. This twenty-one story headquarters building, containing
approximately 278,000 rentable square feet of space, is owned in fee by M&T
Bank and was completed in 1967. M&T, M&T Bank and their subsidiaries occupy
approximately 73% of the building and the remainder is leased to non-affiliated
tenants. At December 31, 2003, the cost of this property (including
improvements subsequent to the initial construction), net of accumulated
depreciation, was $7.0 million.

In September 1992, M&T Bank acquired an additional facility in Buffalo, New
York with approximately 365,000 rentable square feet of space at a cost of
approximately $12 million. Approximately 89% of this facility, known as M&T
Center, is occupied by M&T Bank and its subsidiaries, with the remainder leased
to non-affiliated tenants. At December 31, 2003, the cost of this building
(including improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of accumulated
depreciation, was $12.8 million.

M&T Bank also owns and occupies two separate facilities in the Buffalo area
which support certain back-office and operations functions of the Company. The
total square footage of these facilities approximates 213,000 square feet and
their combined cost (including improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of
accumulated depreciation, was $16.1 million at December 31, 2003.

M&T Bank also owns a facility in Syracuse, New York with approximately 151,000
rentable square feet of space. Approximately 46% of this facility is occupied
by M&T Bank, with the remainder leased to non-affiliated tenants. At December
31, 2003, the cost of this building, net of accumulated depreciation, was $6.3
million.

As a result of the April 1, 2003 Allfirst acquisition, M&T Bank acquired
facilities in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and Millsboro, Delaware with
approximately 213,000 and 320,000 rentable square feet of space, respectively.
M&T Bank occupies approximately 39% and 94% of these respective facilities,
with the remainder leased to non-affiliated tenants. At December 31, 2003, the
cost of these buildings, net of accumulated depreciation, was $13.4 million and
$8.2 million, respectively.

No other properties owned by M&T Bank have more than 100,000 square feet of
space. The cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, of the
Company’s premises and equipment is detailed in note 6 of Notes to Financial
Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.” Of the 684 domestic banking offices of the Registrant’s
subsidiary banks at December 31, 2003, 295 are owned in fee and 389 are leased.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

M&T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course of business to
various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary
damages are asserted. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, does
not anticipate that the aggregate ultimate liability, if any, arising out of
litigation pending against M&T or its subsidiaries will be material to M&T’s
consolidated financial position, but at the present time is not in a position
to determine whether such litigation will have a material adverse effect on
M&T’s consolidated results of operations in any future reporting period.

Item 4.

Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

During the fourth quarter of 2003, no matters were submitted to a vote of M&T’s
security holders.

Directors’ Stock Plan.

M&T Bank Corporation maintains a plan for non-employee
members of the Board of Directors of M&T Bank Corporation and the members of
its Directors Advisory Council, and the non-employee members of the Board of
Directors of M&T Bank and the members of its regional Directors Advisory
Councils, which allows such directors, advisory directors and members of
regional Directors Advisory Councils to receive all or a portion of their
directorial compensation in shares of M&T common stock.

Deferred Bonus Plan.

M&T Bank Corporation maintains a deferred bonus plan
pursuant to which its eligible officers and those of its subsidiaries may elect
to defer all or a portion of their current annual incentive compensation awards
and allocate such awards to several investment options, including M&T common
stock. Participants may elect the timing of distributions from the plan. Such
distributions are payable in cash, with the exception of balances allocated to
M&T common stock, which are distributable in the form of common stock.

stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of $78.49 per share. M&T
resumed purchases of its common stock in January 2004 and completed the
5,000,000 repurchase plan in February 2004. The common stock was purchased
pursuant to such plan at an average cost of $82.11 per share. There were no
common stock repurchases in 2003.

- 31 -


In February 2004, M&T announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the
repurchase of up to 5,000,000 additional shares of its common stock. In
addition, M&T announced that its Board of Directors had declared a quarterly
cash dividend of $.40 per share on M&T Bank Corporation’s common stock, which
represents an increase of 33% over the most recent quarterly dividend rate of
$.30 per share. The dividend will be payable March 31, 2004 to stockholders of
record at the close of business on February 27, 2004.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.

Corporate Profile and Significant Developments

M&T Bank Corporation (“M&T”) is a bank holding company headquartered in
Buffalo, New York with consolidated assets of $49.8 billion at December 31,
2003. The consolidated financial information presented herein reflects M&T and
all of its subsidiaries, which are referred to collectively as “the Company.”
M&T’s wholly owned bank subsidiaries are Manufacturers and Traders Trust
Company (“M&T Bank”) and M&T Bank, National Association (“M&T Bank, N.A.”).

M&T Bank, with total assets of $49.2 billion at December 31, 2003, is a
New York-chartered commercial bank with 683 banking offices in New York State,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of
Columbia, and an office in the Cayman Islands. M&T Bank and its subsidiaries
offer a broad range of financial services to a diverse base of consumers,
businesses, professional clients, governmental entities and financial
institutions located in its markets. Lending is largely focused on consumers
residing in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, northern Virginia and
Washington, D.C., and on small and medium size businesses based in those areas.
Certain lending activities are also conducted in other states through various
subsidiaries. M&T Bank’s subsidiaries include: M&T Credit Corporation, a
consumer lending and commercial leasing and lending company; M&T Financial
Corporation, a commercial leasing company; M&T Mortgage Corporation, a
residential mortgage banking company; M&T Real Estate Trust, a commercial
mortgage lender; M&T Realty Capital Corporation, a multi-family commercial
mortgage lender; M&T Securities, Inc., a broker/dealer; MTB Investment
Advisors, Inc., which serves as investment advisor to the MTB funds, a family
of proprietary mutual funds, and other funds and institutional clients;
Highland Lease Corporation, a consumer leasing company; and Matthews, Bartlett
& Dedecker, Inc., an insurance agency.

M&T Bank, N.A., with total assets of $473 million at December 31, 2003, is
a national bank with an office in Oakfield, New York. M&T Bank, N.A. offers
selected deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis, largely through
telephone and direct mail marketing techniques. Insurance products are offered
by M&T Bank, N.A. through banking offices of M&T Bank.

On April 1, 2003, M&T completed the acquisition of Allfirst Financial Inc.
(“Allfirst”), a bank holding company headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, from
Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c. (“AIB”), Dublin, Ireland. Allfirst Bank, Allfirst’s
primary bank subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank on that date. Allfirst Bank
operated 269 banking offices in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and the
District of Columbia at the date of acquisition. The acquisition of Allfirst
represented a major geographic expansion by M&T and created a strong
Mid-Atlantic banking franchise. AIB received 26,700,000 shares

- 32 -


of M&T common stock and $886 million in cash in exchange for all
outstanding Allfirst common shares. Immediately after the completion of the
acquisition, AIB owned approximately 22.5% of the outstanding shares of M&T’s
common stock. The results of operations acquired in the Allfirst transaction
have been included in the Company’s financial results since April 1, 2003.
Table 1 provides a summary of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the
Company on April 1, 2003 in connection with the Allfirst transaction.

Merger-related expenses associated with the Allfirst acquisition incurred
during the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $60 million ($39 million after
tax effect). Such expenses were for professional services and temporary help
associated with the conversion of systems and/or integration of operations;
initial marketing and promotion expenses designed to introduce M&T Bank to
Allfirst’s customers; travel and relocation costs; and printing, supplies and
other costs of commencing operations in new markets and offices. The Company
does not expect to incur any significant additional merger-related expenses
relating to the Allfirst transaction. In accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”), included in the determination of goodwill
associated with the Allfirst merger were charges totaling $29 million, net of
applicable income taxes ($48 million before tax effect), for severance costs
for former Allfirst employees; investment banking and other professional fees;
and termination of Allfirst contracts for various services. As of December 31,
2003, the remaining unpaid portion of merger-related expenses and charges
included in the determination of goodwill were $1 million and $13 million,
respectively. The resolution of Allfirst’s preacquisition contingencies in
future periods could have an impact on the allocation of the purchase price and
the amount of goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition, however, management
does not presently expect that any such adjustments will be material to the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

In anticipation of the Allfirst acquisition, M&T Bank issued $400 million
of subordinated notes on March 31, 2003 to fund a portion of the cash
consideration paid to AIB and to maintain appropriate regulatory capital
ratios. The subordinated notes are included in regulatory capital of M&T and
M&T Bank. The notes pay interest semi-annually on April 1 and October 1. The
interest rate is fixed at 3.85% through March 31, 2008, with a floating rate
payable from April 1, 2008 through the maturity date based on the then
applicable U.S. dollar three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus
1.50%. The notes will mature on April 1, 2013. Beginning on April 1, 2008,
M&T Bank may, at its option and subject to prior regulatory approval, redeem
some or all of the subordinated notes on any interest payment date at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the redeemed principal, plus any accrued but
unpaid interest.

On February 9, 2001, M&T acquired Premier National Bancorp, Inc.
(“Premier”), a bank holding company headquartered in Lagrangeville, New York.
Premier National Bank, Premier’s bank subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank on
that date. Premier National Bank operated 34 banking offices in the mid-Hudson
Valley region of New York State. As of the merger date, assets acquired totaled
$1.8 billion, including $1.0 billion of loans and leases, and liabilities
assumed were $1.5 billion, including approximately $1.4 billion of deposits.
The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting
and, accordingly, the operations acquired from Premier have been included in
M&T’s financial results subsequent to the acquisition date. Premier’s
stockholders received $171 million in cash and 2,440,812 shares of M&T common
stock in exchange for the Premier shares outstanding at the time of the
acquisition. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded
approximately $178 million of goodwill and $32 million of core deposit
intangible. In 2001, the Company incurred expenses associated with systems
conversions and other costs of integrating and conforming the acquired
operations of Premier and of Keystone Financial Inc. (“Keystone”), which was
acquired on October 6, 2000, with and into the operations of M&T Bank. Such
merger-related expenses totaled approximately $8 million ($5 million after-tax)
during the year ended December 31, 2001.

The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of Notes
to Financial Statements. In applying those accounting policies, management of
the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the
methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized. Certain of the
critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some
cases may contribute to volatility in the Company’s reported financial
performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to
changes in circumstances. Some of the more significant areas in which
management of the Company applies critical assumptions and estimates include
the following:

•

Allowance for credit losses – The allowance for credit losses
represents the amount which, in management’s judgment, will be adequate
to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of
the balance sheet date. In estimating losses inherent in the loan and
lease portfolio, assumptions and judgment are applied to measure
expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to
determine the borrowers’ abilities to repay obligations. Historical
loss trends are also considered, as are economic conditions, industry
trends, portfolio trends and borrower-specific financial data. Changes
in the circumstances considered when determining management’s estimates
and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and
assumptions, which may result in adjustment of the allowance. A
detailed discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management
in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is
included herein under the heading “Provision for Credit Losses.”

•

Valuation methodologies – Management of the Company applies various
valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a
significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not
exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are
referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as
trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real estate
loans held for sale and related commitments. However, for those items
for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management
utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items.
Examples of these items include capitalized servicing assets, goodwill,
core deposit and other intangible assets, pension and other
postretirement benefit obligations, value ascribed to stock-based
compensation, estimated residual values of property associated with
commercial and consumer leases, and certain derivative and other
financial instruments. These valuations require the use of various
assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return
on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of
servicing and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions
could produce significantly different results, which could have
material positive or negative effects on the Company’s results of
operations. Specific discussion of assumptions and estimates utilized
by management are discussed in detail in this Financial Review and in
notes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 17, 18 and 19 of Notes to Financial
Statements.

•

Commitments, contingencies and off-balance sheet arrangements –
Information regarding the Company’s commitments and contingencies,
including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from
litigation, and their potential effects on the Company’s results of
operations is included in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. In
addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various
governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in
challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to
specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and
judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been
appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine
that management’s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and
adjustments required could have a material effect on the Company’s
results of operations. Information

- 34 -


regarding permanent and temporary income tax differences is presented in
note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. The recognition or
de-recognition in the Company’s consolidated financial statements of
assets and liabilities held in trusts or other so-called variable
interest entities is subject to the interpretation and application of
complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that require
management to estimate and assess the probability of financial outcomes
in future periods. Information relating to the Company’s involvement in
such entities and the accounting treatment afforded each such involvement
is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Overview

The Company’s net income in 2003 totaled $574 million or $4.95 of diluted
earnings per common share, up 26% and 4%, respectively, from $457 million or
$4.78 per diluted share in 2002. Basic earnings per common share rose 3% to
$5.08 in 2003 from $4.94 in 2002. The after-tax impact of merger-related
expenses associated with the Allfirst acquisition was $39 million ($60 million
pre-tax) or $.34 of diluted earnings per share and $.35 of basic earnings per
share in 2003. There were no significant similar expenses in 2002. Net income
in 2001 totaled $353 million, while diluted and basic earnings per share were
$3.58 and $3.69, respectively. The after-tax impact of merger-related expenses
associated with the Premier and Keystone acquisitions was $5 million ($8
million pre-tax) or $.05 of diluted and basic earnings per share in 2001.

Net income represented a return on average assets in 2003 of 1.27%,
compared with 1.43% in 2002 and 1.14% in 2001. The return on average common
stockholders’ equity was 11.62% in 2003, 15.09% in 2002 and 11.87% in 2001.
Excluding the impact of merger-related expenses, the rates of return on average
assets and average common equity were 1.35% and 12.41%, respectively, in 2003
and 1.16% and 12.03%, respectively, in 2001.

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company began recognizing expense for
stock-based compensation using the fair value method of accounting described in
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended. As a result, salaries and employee
benefits expense in 2003 included $43 million of stock-based compensation.
After tax effect, stock-based compensation lowered 2003’s net income by $32
million, or $.27 per diluted share. Using the retroactive restatement method
described in SFAS No. 148, which amended SFAS No. 123, financial information
for all prior periods presented in this annual report has been restated to
reflect the impact of recognizing expense for stock-based compensation in those
years as well. As a result, salaries and employee benefits expense in 2002 has
been restated to include $41 million of stock-based compensation, resulting in
a reduction of previously reported net income of $28 million. Diluted earnings
per share noted herein for 2002 have been reduced by $.29 from the amount
previously reported. For 2001, the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123 using the
retroactive restatement method was to increase salaries and employee benefits
expense by approximately $32 million, resulting in a reduction of previously
reported net income of $25 million or $.24 of diluted earnings per share.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets.” SFAS No. 142 revised accounting standards for all
purchased intangible assets, but not the accounting for internally developed
intangible assets. SFAS No. 142, as amended, requires that most goodwill not
be amortized, but rather that it periodically be tested for impairment. Other
intangible assets assumed to have been acquired but with finite lives, such as
core deposit intangible assets, are required to be amortized over their assumed
lives.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, effective January 1, 2002 the Company
ceased amortization of goodwill associated with corporate acquisitions.
Amortization of such goodwill in 2001, none of which was tax deductible, was

- 35 -


$62 million ($.62 per diluted share). The after-tax impact of
amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $48 million ($.41 per diluted share), $32
million ($.34 per diluted share) and $38 million ($.38 per diluted share),
respectively. Pro forma net income, diluted earnings per share and basic
earnings per share for 2001, computed as if SFAS No. 142 had been effective in
2001, were $415 million, $4.20 and $4.33, respectively, while pro forma
annualized returns on average assets and average common stockholders’ equity in
2001 were 1.35% and 13.95%, respectively.

Further information regarding the allocation of goodwill to the Company’s
reportable segments and results of impairment tests of such goodwill is
provided in note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Net interest income recorded on a taxable-equivalent basis increased 28%
to $1.62 billion in 2003 from $1.26 billion in 2002, reflecting higher average
earning assets, which increased 37% to $39.5 billion in 2003 from $28.9 billion
in 2002. The higher levels of average earning assets in 2003 as compared with
2002 were largely the result of loans, leases and investment securities
obtained in the Allfirst acquisition. Average loans and leases increased $8.5
billion, or 33%, to $34.0 billion in 2003 from $25.5 billion in 2002. Included
in the 2003 average was the nine-month impact of the $10.3 billion of
Allfirst-related loans and leases acquired on April 1, 2003. Partially
offsetting the impact of the higher levels of average earning assets in 2003
was a narrowing of the Company’s net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net
interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. Net
interest margin declined 27 basis points (hundredths of one percent) to 4.09%
in 2003 from 4.36% a year earlier, due largely to lower yielding portfolios of
loans and investment securities acquired in the Allfirst transaction. A
widening of the Company’s net interest margin and higher average earning
assets, which rose $1.1 billion or 4% from $27.8 billion in 2001, were the most
significant factors contributing to the increase in 2002’s taxable-equivalent
net interest income from $1.18 billion in 2001. Net interest margin in 2002
was 13 basis points higher than 4.23% in 2001, due to the full-year impact of
2001’s declining rate environment and further changes in rates and spreads in
2002. The 4% rise in average earning assets from 2001 to 2002 was the result
of growth in the consumer loan portfolio.

The provision for credit losses was $131 million in 2003, $122 million in
2002 and $104 million in 2001. Net charge-offs totaled $97 million in 2003,
compared with $108 million in 2002 and $75 million in 2001. Net charge-offs as
a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding were .28%, .42% and .31%
in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net charge-offs of loans acquired from
Allfirst were not significant during the final nine months of 2003. The
provision in each year reflects the result of management’s analysis of the
composition of the loan and lease portfolio and other factors, including
concern regarding uncertainty about economic conditions, both nationally and in
many of the markets served by the Company, and the impact of such conditions
and prospects on the abilities of borrowers to repay loans.

Noninterest income aggregated $831 million in 2003, 62% higher than $512
million in 2002 and up 74% from $477 million in 2001. Approximately $279
million of the increase from 2002 was attributable to revenues related to
operations or market areas associated with the former Allfirst franchise.
Higher mortgage banking revenues and service charges on deposit accounts also
contributed to the improvement. Increased revenues from providing deposit
account and mortgage banking services were significant contributors to the rise
in noninterest income from 2001 to 2002.

Noninterest expense in 2003 totaled $1.45 billion, 51% higher than $962
million in 2002 and up 48% from $981 million in 2001. Included in such amounts
are expenses considered to be “nonoperating” in nature, consisting of
amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $78 million, $51
million and $60 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively; amortization of
goodwill of $62 million in 2001; and merger-related expenses of $60 million and
$8 million in 2003 and 2001, respectively. There were no merger-related
expenses in 2002. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest

- 36 -


operating expenses aggregated $1.31 billion in 2003, compared with $910
million in 2002 and $851 million in 2001. Expenses related to operations
formerly associated with Allfirst significantly contributed to the higher level
of expenses in 2003 compared with 2002, along with higher expenses for salaries
and benefits, professional services and amortization of capitalized residential
mortgage servicing rights. Partially offsetting these higher expenses was a
$30 million decrease in the provision for possible impairment of capitalized
residential mortgage servicing rights, which was $2 million in 2003 and $32
million in 2002. The $32 million provision for the impairment of capitalized
residential mortgage servicing rights and higher costs for salaries, including
commissions and incentive compensation, were large contributors to the rise in
noninterest operating expenses in 2002 as compared with 2001.

The efficiency ratio expresses the relationship of operating expenses to
revenues. The Company’s efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses
divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest
income (exclusive of gains and losses from sales of bank investment
securities), was 53.6% in 2003, compared with 51.3% in 2002 and 51.5% in 2001.
The higher ratio in 2003 reflects the impact of the acquired Allfirst
operations that are now part of M&T.

Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations

M&T has accounted for substantially all of its business combinations using the
purchase method of accounting. As a result, the Company had recorded
intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible
assets totaling $3.1 billion at December 31, 2003, $1.2 billion at December 31,
2002 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2001. Included in such intangible assets
was goodwill of $2.9 billion at December 31, 2003, up from $1.1 billion at
December 31, 2002 and 2001 due to the Allfirst acquisition. Amortization of
core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, was $48 million,
$32 million and $38 million during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
higher level of such amortization in 2003 as compared with 2002 and 2001 was
due to the impact of core deposit and other intangible assets recorded as part
of the acquisition of Allfirst.

Since 1998 M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its
results on a “net operating” or “tangible” basis, from which M&T excludes the
after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets
(and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset
balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts, when calculating certain
performance ratios) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations
into the Company, because such expenses are considered by management to be
“nonoperating” in nature. Although “net operating income” as defined by M&T is
not a GAAP measure, M&T’s management believes that this information helps
investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results.

Net operating income rose 35% to $661 million in 2003 from $489 million in
2002. Diluted net operating earnings per share in 2003 increased 11% to $5.70
from $5.12 in 2002. In 2001, net operating income totaled $457 million and
diluted net operating earnings per share were $4.63.

A reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share with net
operating income and diluted net operating earnings per share is presented in
table 3.

Expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets, net operating
income was 1.55% in 2003 and 2001, compared with 1.59% in 2002. Net operating
return on average tangible common equity was 28.49% in 2003, compared with
26.71% and 26.76% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Including the effect of
merger-related expenses, net operating return on average tangible assets for
2003 and 2001 was 1.46% and 1.53%, respectively, and net operating return on
average tangible common equity was 26.80% and 26.48%, respectively.

and average tangible equity is presented in table 3.

Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities

Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose 28% to $1.62 billion in 2003 from
$1.26 billion in 2002. The improvement reflects a 37% increase in average
earning assets to $39.5 billion in 2003 from $28.9 billion in 2002, partially
offset by a narrowing of the Company’s net interest margin. The growth in
average earning assets was largely attributable to higher average loans and
leases outstanding, which totaled $34.0 billion in 2003, up 33% from 2002’s
average of $25.5 billion.

The most significant factor for the higher loan balances in 2003 was the
nine-month impact of the $10.3 billion of loans obtained in the Allfirst
acquisition on April 1, 2003. Such acquired loans were comprised of
approximately $4.5 billion of commercial loans and leases (including $314
million of leveraged leases and $230 million of loans to foreign borrowers),
$2.5 billion of commercial real estate loans, $383 million of residential real
estate loans and $2.9 billion of consumer loans and leases.

Average consumer loans and leases, excluding those acquired in the
Allfirst transaction, grew 20% to $8.2 billion in 2003 from $6.8 billion in
2002. Increases in the outstanding average balances of automobile loans and
leases of $1.0 billion and home equity lines of credit of $495 million were the
leading contributors to that growth.

Partially offsetting the growth noted above was a decline in the
residential real estate loan portfolio, due largely to customer repayments of
loans and the impact of two separate securitization transactions totaling $1.3
billion of such loans during 2003’s fourth quarter and the full-year impact of
a similar $1.1 billion securitization in the fourth quarter of 2002. In
connection with the first 2003 securitization transaction, the Company
transferred approximately $838 million of one-to-four family residential
mortgage loans to a qualified special purpose trust. The Company received $112
million in cash and retained approximately 87% of the resulting securities in
exchange for the loans. The Company realized a gain of $1 million on the
transaction which has been included in other revenues from operations. In
2003’s second securitization transaction, approximately $441 million of
one-to-four family residential mortgage loans were converted to mortgage-backed
securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”). All
of those mortgage-backed securities were retained by the Company and,
accordingly, no gain or loss was recognized. In total, approximately $1.2
billion of mortgage-backed securities resulting from 2003’s securitization
transactions were retained by the Company and included in the portfolio of
investment securities classified as available for sale.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income in 2002 was 7% higher than $1.18
billion in 2001, when average earning assets aggregated $27.8 billion. A 4%
increase in average loans and leases from 2001 to 2002, coupled with a widening
of the Company’s net interest margin, were the most significant factors for the
higher level of taxable-equivalent net interest income in 2002 as compared with
2001.

Average outstanding balances of consumer loans and leases rose $1.2
billion, or 21%, from 2001 to 2002. Such growth, predominantly in outstanding
home equity lines of credit and automobile loans, more than offset declines in
the commercial loan and lease and residential real estate loan portfolios. The
lower average balances of commercial loans and leases were due in part to the
sluggish economic conditions in the Company’s core markets. The residential
real estate loan portfolio’s decline was due largely to customer repayments of
loans and the impact of the November 2002 securitization of approximately $1.1
billion of such loans.

Similar to one of the securitizations already discussed, in connection
with

- 38 -


the 2002 securitization transaction, the Company transferred approximately
$1.1 billion of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans to a qualified
special purpose trust. The Company received $140 million in cash and retained
approximately 88% of the resulting securities in exchange for the loans. The
Company realized a gain of $5 million on the transaction which has been
included in other revenues from operations. In accordance with GAAP, the
qualified special purpose trusts related to the 2003 and 2002 mortgage loan
securitization transactions are not included in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements. Management believes that the resulting mortgage-backed
securities provide enhanced liquidity opportunities to the Company because the
securities may be more readily pledged to secure borrowings or sold than the
underlying loans could be. Additionally, under present regulatory risk-based
capital rules, the Company is generally required to maintain higher levels of
regulatory capital when directly investing in residential real estate loans
than when investing in government-guaranteed or highly-rated, privately-placed
mortgage-backed securities. Additional information about these transactions
and the qualified special purpose trusts is included in note 18 of Notes to
Financial Statements. Information about the Company’s regulatory capital
requirements is included in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. Table 4
summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in 2003 and percentage changes
in the major components of the portfolio over the past two years.

Commercial loans and leases, excluding loans secured by real estate,
totaled $9.2 billion at December 31, 2003, representing 26% of total loans and
leases. Table 6 presents such commercial loans and leases as of December 31,
2003 by geographic area, size, and whether the loans are secured by collateral
or unsecured. The Company provides financing for leases to commercial
customers, primarily for equipment.

As already mentioned, commercial loans and leases obtained in the Allfirst
transaction totaled $4.5 billion on April 1, 2003, including $314 million of
leveraged leases. Included in the Allfirst loan and lease portfolio were
certain business lines in which the Company has not traditionally been active.
An international maritime portfolio, which at April 1 and December 31, 2003
totaled $113 million and $71 million, respectively, was acquired. The Company
does not expect to grow this specialized business. Other international loans
attributable to Allfirst totaled $132 million and $145 million at April 1 and
December 31, 2003, respectively. The Company participates in the insurance and
guarantee programs of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. These
programs provide U.S. government repayment coverage of 90%-100% on loans
supporting foreign borrowers’ purchases of U.S. goods and services. The loans
generally range from $500 thousand to $10 million. The outstanding balance of
loans under this program at December 31, 2003 was $123 million. Commercial
leases obtained on April 1, 2003 from Allfirst totaled $610 million, and
consisted of general equipment leases with an emphasis on transportation
equipment, including railcars, tractors, trailers and commercial aircraft. The
Company does not expect to pursue growing the commercial aircraft component of
the lease portfolio. The Company’s commercial aircraft lease portfolio totaled
$99 million at December 31, 2003, including $70 million that was obtained from
Allfirst. Of the $9.2 billion of commercial loans and leases outstanding at
the 2003 year-end, approximately $7.2 billion, or 78%, were secured, while 46%,
26% and 12% were granted to businesses in New York State, Pennsylvania and
Maryland, respectively.

Loans secured by real estate, including outstanding balances of home
equity loans and lines of credit which the Company classifies as consumer
loans, represented approximately 58% of the loan and lease portfolio during
2003, compared with 63% in 2002 and 64% in 2001. At December 31, 2003, the
Company held approximately $12.4 billion of commercial real estate loans, $3.1
billion of consumer real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential
properties and $5.0 billion of outstanding balances of home equity loans and
lines of credit, compared with $9.7 billion, $3.2 billion and $2.7 billion,
respectively, at December 31, 2002. As of April 1, 2003, loans obtained in the
Allfirst acquisition that were secured by real estate aggregated $5.2 billion,
including $2.5 billion of commercial real estate loans, $383 million

- 39 -


of consumer real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential
properties and $2.3 billion of outstanding balances of home equity loans and
lines of credit.

A significant portion of commercial real estate loans originated by the
Company are secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area,
including areas in neighboring states generally considered to be within
commuting distance of New York City, and other areas of New York State where
the Company operates, including the Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany,
Hudson Valley and Southern Tier regions. Commercial real estate loans are also
originated through the Company’s offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland, northern
Virginia, Washington, D.C., Oregon and West Virginia. Commercial real estate
loans obtained in the Allfirst transaction were geographically centered in
Allfirst’s regional marketplace, with the majority of that portfolio secured by
properties in Maryland, south central Pennsylvania, northern Virginia and
Washington, D.C. Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company
include fixed-rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of
the remaining unpaid principal at maturity, in many cases five years after
origination. For borrowers in good standing, the terms of such loans may be
extended by the customer for an additional five years at the then current
market rate of interest. The Company also originates fixed-rate commercial
real estate loans with maturities of greater than five years, generally having
original maturity terms of approximately ten years, and adjustable-rate
commercial real estate loans, which represented approximately 45% of the
commercial real estate loan portfolio as of December 31, 2003. Table 7
presents commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of collateral
and size of the loans outstanding at December 31, 2003. Of the $4.3 billion of
commercial real estate loans in the New York City metropolitan area,
approximately 37% were secured by multifamily residential properties, 24% by
retail space and 10% by office space. The Company’s experience has been that
office space and retail properties tend to demonstrate more volatile
fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions
than do multifamily residential properties. Approximately 49% of the aggregate
dollar amount of New York City-area loans were for loans with outstanding
balances of $5 million or less, while loans of more than $10 million made up
approximately 32% of the total.

Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located in other parts
of New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and other areas tend to have a
greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant amount of
lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or business.
Approximately 74% of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial real estate
loans in New York State secured by properties located outside of the
metropolitan New York City area were for loans with outstanding balances of $5
million or less. Of the outstanding balance of commercial real estate loans in
Pennsylvania and Maryland, approximately 74% and 63%, respectively, were for
loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less.

Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of New
York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and areas of neighboring states considered
to be part of the New York City metropolitan area, comprised 10% of total
commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2003.

M&T Realty Capital Corporation, one of the Company’s commercial real
estate lending subsidiaries, participates in the FNMA Delegated Underwriting
and Servicing (“DUS”) program, pursuant to which commercial real estate loans
are originated in accordance with terms and conditions specified by third-party
investors and subsequently sold to such investors. The Company’s involvement
with the FNMA DUS program resulted from the Allfirst acquisition. At December
31, 2003, $1 million of commercial real estate loans were held for sale.

Commercial construction loans presented in table 7 totaled $940 million at
December 31, 2003, or approximately 3% of total loans and leases.

- 40 -


Real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties
totaled $3.1 billion at December 31, 2003, including approximately 43% secured
by properties located in New York State and 17% secured by properties located
in Pennsylvania. As already discussed, residential real estate loans obtained
in the Allfirst transaction totaled $383 million on April 1, 2003. At December
31, 2003, $723 million of residential real estate loans were held for sale,
compared with $1.1 billion at December 31, 2002. Loans to finance the
construction of or development projects related to one-to-four family
residential properties totaled $597 million at December 31, 2003, or
approximately 2% of total loans and leases. Included in such construction
loans were loans to residential real estate developers aggregating $246
million.

Consumer loans and leases represented approximately 30% of the average
loan portfolio during 2003, up from 27% during 2002 and 23% during 2001.
Automobile loans and leases and outstanding balances of home equity lines of
credit represent the largest components of the consumer loan portfolio.
Approximately 60% of home equity lines of credit outstanding at December 31,
2003 were secured by properties in New York State and 22% and 15% were secured
by properties in Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively. At December 31,
2003, 31% and 40% of the automobile loan and lease portfolio were to customers
residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, respectively. Automobile loans
and leases have generally been originated through dealers, however, all
applications submitted through dealers are subject to the Company’s normal
underwriting and loan approval procedures. Automobile loans and leases
represented approximately 12% of the Company’s average loan portfolio during
2003, while no other consumer loan product represented more than 8%. The
average outstanding balance of automobile leases was approximately $527 million
in 2003, $556 million in 2002 and $587 million in 2001. During 2003 the
Company decided to cease origination of automobile leases concentrating instead
on its larger automobile loan origination business. Given the growth in the
Company’s automobile loan portfolio, the decision to cease origination of new
auto leases did not have a significant negative impact on the Company’s results
of operations. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, outstanding automobile leases
totaled $425 million and $527 million, respectively.

Table 8 presents the composition of the Company’s loan and lease portfolio
at December 31, 2003, including outstanding balances to businesses and
consumers in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and other states.
Approximately 49% of total loans and leases at the 2003 year-end were to New
York State customers, while 25% and 11% were to Pennsylvania and Maryland
customers, respectively.

Investment securities averaged $5.3 billion in 2003, compared with $3.1
billion in 2002 and $3.3 billion in 2001. The previously discussed retention
of mortgage-backed securities related to the fourth quarter 2003 and 2002
securitizations of residential real estate loans of $1.2 billion and $1.1
billion, respectively, added approximately $817 million to average investment
securities in 2003. Investment securities obtained in the Allfirst transaction
totaled approximately $1.3 billion on April 1, 2003 and contributed
approximately $887 million of 2003’s average balance of investment securities.
The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential and
commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations,
debt securities issued by municipalities, debt and preferred equity securities
issued by government-sponsored agencies and certain financial institutions, and
shorter-term U.S. Treasury notes. When purchasing investment securities, the
Company considers its overall interest-rate risk profile as well as the
adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed, including prepayments.
In managing its investment securities portfolio, the Company occasionally sells
investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads,
actual or anticipated prepayments, or credit risk associated with a particular
security, or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio
following completion of a business combination. Average money-market assets,
which are comprised of interest-earning deposits at banks, interest-earning
trading account assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities,
totaled $216 million in 2003, compared with $291 million in 2002 and $80
million in 2001. The amounts of investment securities and money-market assets
held by the

- 41 -


Company are influenced by such factors as demand for loans, which
generally yield more than investment securities and money-market assets,
ongoing repayments, the level of deposits, and management of balance sheet size
and resulting capital ratios.

Core deposits represent the most significant source of funding for the
Company and are comprised of noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing
transaction accounts, nonbrokered savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic
time deposits under $100,000. The Company’s branch network is its principal
source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than
wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Certificates of deposit under
$100,000 generated on a nationwide basis by M&T Bank, N.A. are also included in
core deposits. Average core deposits were $25.8 billion in 2003 and $17.6
billion in 2002 and 2001. Core deposits assumed in connection with the
Allfirst acquisition totaled approximately $10.7 billion on April 1, 2003. Due
to the low interest rate environment, the Company experienced a significant
shift in the composition of core deposits throughout the past three years.
Reflecting a change in customer saving trends, average core savings and
noninterest-bearing deposits rose during that period, while average time
deposits under $100,000 decreased, exclusive of the impact of core deposits
obtained in the Allfirst acquisition. Average core deposits of M&T Bank, N.A.
were $267 million in 2003, $342 million in 2002 and $521 million in 2001.
Funding provided by core deposits represented 65% of average earning assets in
2003, compared with 61% in 2002 and 63% in 2001. Table 9 summarizes average
core deposits in 2003 and percentage changes in the components of such deposits
over the past two years.

The Company also obtains funding through domestic time deposits of
$100,000 or more, deposits originated through the Company’s offshore branch
office, and brokered deposits. Domestic time deposits over $100,000, excluding
brokered certificates of deposit, averaged $1.2 billion in 2003 and 2002,
compared with $2.0 billion in 2001. Offshore branch deposits, primarily
comprised of accounts with balances of $100,000 or more, averaged $1.4 billion
in 2003, compared with $569 million and $327 million in 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Brokered time deposits averaged $643 million in 2003, $1.9
billion in 2002 and $794 million in 2001, and totaled $827 million at December
31, 2003. The weighted-average remaining term to maturity of brokered time
deposits at December 31, 2003 was 19 months. Certain of these brokered
deposits have provisions that allow for early redemption. In connection with
the Company’s management of interest rate risk, interest rate swaps have been
entered into under which the Company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays
a variable rate and that have notional amounts and terms substantially similar
to the amounts and terms of $110 million of brokered time deposits. Beginning
in 2002, the Company also had brokered money-market deposit accounts, which
averaged $70 million in 2003 and $59 million in 2002. Offshore branch deposits
and brokered deposits have been used as an alternative to short-term
borrowings. Additional amounts of offshore branch deposits or brokered
deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions,
including demand by customers and other investors for such deposits, and the
cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time.

The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers, the
Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, Pittsburgh and Atlanta (together, the
“FHLB”), and others as sources of funding. Short-term borrowings averaged $4.3
billion in 2003, $3.1 billion in 2002 and $3.3 billion in 2001. Amounts
borrowed from the FHLB and included in short-term borrowings averaged $439
million in 2003, $904 million in 2002 and $814 million in 2001. Also included
in short-term borrowings is a $500 million revolving asset-backed structured
borrowing secured by automobile loans that were transferred to M&T Auto
Receivables I, LLC, a special purpose subsidiary of M&T Bank formed in November
2002. The subsidiary, the loans and the borrowings are included in the
consolidated financial statements of the Company. Additional information about
M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC and the revolving borrowing agreement is included
in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. The remaining short-term
borrowings were predominately comprised of unsecured federal funds borrowings,
which generally mature daily.

- 42 -


The average balance of long-term borrowings was $6.0 billion in 2003, $4.2
billion in 2002 and $3.5 billion in 2001. Included in average long-term
borrowings were amounts borrowed from the FHLB of $3.9 billion in 2003, $3.0
billion in 2002 and $2.4 billion in 2001, and subordinated capital notes of
$1.2 billion in 2003, $668 million in 2002 and $674 million in 2001. As
previously noted, in anticipation of the Allfirst acquisition, M&T Bank issued
$400 million of subordinated notes on March 31, 2003 to fund a portion of the
cash consideration paid to AIB and to maintain appropriate regulatory capital
ratios. Trust preferred securities associated with junior subordinated
debentures of M&T included in average long-term borrowings totaled $595 million
in 2003, compared with $318 million in 2002 and 2001. Subordinated capital
notes and trust preferred securities associated with junior subordinated
debentures obtained in the Allfirst acquisition on April 1, 2003 averaged $252
million and $277 million, respectively, in 2003. As described in notes 9 and
18 of Notes to Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2003 the Company
applied new accounting provisions promulgated by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) and removed the trusts that had issued the trust
preferred securities from its consolidated balance sheet. That change in
financial statement presentation had no economic impact on the Company, no
material or substantive impact on the Company’s financial statements as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2003, and no impact on 2003’s average balances
noted herein. Additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures,
as well as information regarding contractual maturities of long-term
borrowings, is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. Certain
interest rate swap agreements have been entered into by the Company as part of
its management of interest rate risk relating to long-term borrowings. Further
information on such interest rate swap agreements is provided in note 17 of
Notes to Financial Statements.

In addition to changes in the composition of the Company’s earning assets
and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates and spreads can
impact net interest income. Net interest spread, or the difference between the
yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was
3.81% in 2003, down from 4.03% in 2002. The yield on earning assets during
2003 was 5.42%, down 100 basis points from 6.42% in 2002, while the rate paid
on interest-bearing liabilities decreased 78 basis points to 1.61% from 2.39%
in 2002. Lower yielding portfolios of loans and investment securities obtained
in the Allfirst merger contributed to the reduced yields on earning assets in
2003 when compared with 2002 and were the leading cause for the lower
year-over-year net interest spread. The decreases in interest rates earned and
paid also reflect generally lower market interest rates in 2003 as compared
with 2002, including the impact of reductions by the Federal Reserve of its
benchmark overnight federal funds target rate of 50 basis points in November
2002 and 25 basis points in June 2003.

The Federal Reserve also took numerous actions throughout 2001 to lower
the level of interest rates by reducing its benchmark overnight federal funds
target rate by 475 basis points. In general, the full-year impact of such
actions combined with the 50 basis point reduction in November 2002 contributed
to a greater decline in 2002’s short-term rates on deposits and borrowings as
compared with the decline in yields on loans and other earning assets. As a
result, the impact of changing interest rates had a positive effect on the
Company’s net interest spread in 2002 as compared with 2001. The yield on the
Company’s earning assets decreased 120 basis points in 2002 from 7.62% in 2001,
while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities in 2002 was down 152 basis
points from 3.91%. The impact of the more rapid repricing of interest-bearing
liabilities than earning assets combined with the full-year impact of 2001’s
interest rate reductions led to a 32 basis point increase in the Company’s net
interest spread, from 3.71% in 2001 to 4.03% in 2002.

Net interest-free funds consist largely of noninterest-bearing demand
deposits and stockholders’ equity, partially offset by bank owned life
insurance and non-earning assets, including goodwill and core deposit and other
intangible assets. Average net interest-free funds totaled $6.8 billion in
2003, $4.0 billion in 2002 and $3.7 billion in 2001. The higher level of
average net interest-free funds in 2003 was due largely to the impact of the
Allfirst

- 43 -


acquisition, which provided, on average for 2003, noninterest-bearing deposits
of $2.8 billion and stockholders’ equity of $1.5 billion, partially offset by
goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets of $1.5 billion and bank
owned life insurance of $214 million. The increase in average net
interest-free funds in 2002 as compared with 2001 was largely the result of
higher levels of noninterest-bearing deposits and stockholders’ equity.
Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged $2.7 billion in
2003, $1.2 billion in 2002 and $1.3 billion in 2001. The cash surrender value
of bank owned life insurance averaged $858 million in 2003, $604 million in
2002 and $573 million in 2001. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank
owned life insurance are not included in interest income, but rather are
recorded in “other revenues from operations.” The contribution of net
interest-free funds to net interest margin was .28% in 2003, compared with .33%
in 2002 and .52% in 2001. The decline in the contribution to net interest
margin ascribed to net interest-free funds in 2003 and 2002 compared with 2001
resulted largely from the impact of lower interest rates on interest-bearing
liabilities used to value such contribution, offset, in part, by higher
balances of net interest-free funds. Reflecting the changes to the net
interest spread and the contribution of interest-free funds as described
herein, the Company’s net interest margin was 4.09% in 2003, compared with
4.36% in 2002 and 4.23% in 2001. As noted previously, lower yielding
portfolios of loans and investment securities obtained in the Allfirst
acquisition contributed to the lower net interest margin in 2003 as compared
with 2002. Nevertheless, the net interest margin declined in each quarter of
2003. As a result, the net interest margin of 3.96% in 2003’s fourth quarter
was the lowest quarterly net interest margin earned by the Company since the
first quarter of 2000.

The Company’s net interest income and net interest margin could be
adversely impacted by future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as
well as changes in the composition of the Company’s portfolios of earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads.
Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates
and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate
scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company utilizes interest rate
swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of
its portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Periodic
settlement amounts arising from these agreements are generally reflected in
either the yields earned on assets or, as appropriate, the rates paid on
interest-bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate swap
agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes as of
December 31, 2003 was $685 million. In general, under the terms of these swap
agreements, the Company receives payments based on the outstanding notional
amount of the swaps at fixed rates of interest and makes payments at variable
rates.

As of December 31, 2003, all of the Company’s interest rate swap
agreements entered into for risk management purposes had been designated as
fair value hedges. In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative
(the interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of the hedged
item are recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet with the
corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference
between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the
hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in “other
revenues from operations” in the Company’s consolidated statement of income.
In a cash flow hedge, unlike in a fair value hedge, the effective portion of
the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other
comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the
forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain
or loss is reported in “other revenues from operations” immediately. The
amounts of hedge ineffectiveness of both fair value and cash flow hedges
recognized in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were not material to the Company’s results of
operations. The estimated fair values of interest rate swap agreements
designated as fair value hedges represented a loss of approximately $1 million
at December 31, 2003, compared with a gain of $8 million at December 31, 2002.
The fair values of such swap agreements were substantially offset by changes in
the fair values of the hedged items. The estimated fair value of the

-44-


interest
rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges was a loss of
approximately $1 million at December 31, 2002. Net of applicable income
taxes, such loss was approximately $622 thousand and was included in
“accumulated other comprehensive income, net” in the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2002. The changes in the fair values of the
interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items result from the effects of
changing interest rates. The average notional amounts of interest rate swap
agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes, the related
effect on net interest income and margin, and the weighted-average rate paid or
received on those swaps are presented in table 10.

Provision For Credit Losses

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in management’s
judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio.
A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance
as deemed necessary by management. The provision for credit losses was $131
million in 2003, up from $122 million in 2002 and $104 million in 2001. Net
loan charge-offs were $97 million in 2003, compared with $108 million and $75
million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net loan charge-offs as a percentage
of average loans outstanding were .28% in 2003, compared with .42% in 2002 and
     .31% in 2001. Net charge-offs in 2003 of loans acquired from Allfirst were not
significant. A summary of loan charge-offs, provision and allowance for credit
losses is presented in table 11.

Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual and restructured loans and
aggregated $240 million or .67% of loans and leases outstanding at December 31,
2003, compared with $215 million or .84% at December 31, 2002 and $190 million
or .76% at December 31, 2001. The increase in the amount of loans classified
as nonperforming at December 31, 2003 as compared with a year earlier reflects
the inclusion of approximately $67 million of such loans obtained in the
Allfirst acquisition. The higher level of nonperforming loans at December 31,
2002 compared with December 31, 2001 was largely the result of the inclusion at
the 2002 year-end of three commercial loans totaling $49 million that were
classified as nonperforming during 2002. Outstanding balances relating to
those same three loans included in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2003
totaled $33 million, including a $17 million portion obtained in the
acquisition of Allfirst. That $17 million is included in the $67 million of
nonperforming loans noted above.

Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $155 million
or .43% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2003, compared with $154
million or .60% at December 31, 2002 and $147 million or .58% at December 31,
2001. Such loans at the recent year-end include $17 million of accruing loans
past due 90 days or more obtained in the Allfirst transaction. Accruing loans
past due 90 days or more also included $118 million, $123 million and $108
million at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, of one-to-four
family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company and repurchased from
the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”). The outstanding
principal balances of the repurchased loans are fully guaranteed by government
agencies. The loans were repurchased to reduce servicing costs associated with
them, including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that
had not been received from individual mortgagors. A summary of nonperforming
assets and certain past due loan data is presented in table 12.

Factors that influence the Company’s credit loss experience include
overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general,
and, due to the size of the Company’s commercial real estate loan portfolio,
real estate valuations, in particular. Commercial real estate valuations can
be highly subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions. Such values can
be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in
business climate, economic conditions, interest rates, and, in many cases, the
results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property.

Net charge-offs of commercial real estate loans in 2003 were $6 million,

-45-


compared with $7 million in 2002 and $5 million in 2001. Nonperforming
commercial real estate loans totaled $48 million at December 31, 2003,
compared with $49 million and $39 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Commercial real estate loans obtained in the acquisition of
Allfirst classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2003 were $4 million.

Commercial loans and leases charged off during 2003 and 2001, net of
recoveries, totaled $32 million, compared with $54 million in 2002. Included
in 2002’s net charge-offs was the entire $17 million outstanding balance of two
leases to a major airline company that filed for bankruptcy protection in the
third quarter of that year. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases totaled
$120 million at December 31, 2003, $102 million a year earlier and $85 million
at December 31, 2001. Commercial loans and leases obtained in the acquisition
of Allfirst classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2003 were $45 million.

During 2003 and 2002, net charge-offs of residential real estate loans
were $5 million, compared with $4 million in 2001. Residential real estate
loans classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2003 totaled $51 million,
compared with $37 million and $35 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more and
accruing interest totaled $141 million, $142 million and $135 million at
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. As already noted, a
substantial portion of such amounts relate to loans repurchased from GNMA which
are fully guaranteed by government agencies. Residential real estate loans
obtained in the Allfirst acquisition classified as nonperforming and past due
90 days or more and accruing interest aggregated $13 million and $7 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2003.

Net charge-offs of consumer loans and leases were $54 million in 2003,
representing .53% of average consumer loans and leases outstanding during the
year, compared with $42 million or .62% in 2002 and $34 million or .61% in
2001. Indirect automobile loans and leases represented the most significant
category of consumer loan charge-offs in each of the past three years. Net
indirect automobile loan and lease charge-offs during 2003 were $32 million,
compared with $21 million and $12 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Consumer loans and leases classified as nonperforming totaled $21 million or
     .19% of outstanding consumer loans and leases at December 31, 2003, compared
with $27 million or .37% at December 31, 2002 and $31 million or .51% at
December 31, 2001. Consumer loans and leases past due 90 days or more and
accruing interest totaled $3 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and $5
million at December 31, 2001. Consumer loans and leases obtained in the
Allfirst transaction classified as nonperforming and past due 90 days or more
and accruing interest totaled $5 million and $1 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2003.

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which it believes is
adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of each
respective balance sheet date. Management regularly assesses the adequacy of
the allowance by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease
portfolio, including such factors as the differing economic risks associated
with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers,
the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent
loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any
guarantees or indemnifications. Management evaluated the impact of changes in
interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to
meet repayment obligations when quantifying the Company’s exposure to credit
losses and assessing the adequacy of the Company’s allowance for such losses as
of each reporting date. Factors also considered by management when performing
its assessment, in addition to general economic conditions and the other
factors described above, included, but were not limited to: (i) the
concentration of commercial real estate loans in the Company’s loan portfolio,
particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in New York
State, in general, and in the New York City metropolitan area, in particular;
(ii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of
New York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in central
Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic

-46-


growth and vitality than the vast majority of other regions of the country;
(iii) significant growth in loans to individual consumers, which historically
have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding
than other loan types; and (iv) the large portfolios of loans obtained in the
acquisition of Allfirst which management continues to evaluate in accordance
with the Company’s policies and procedures for credit underwriting, loan
classification, and measurement of exposure to loss. The level of the
allowance for credit losses is adjusted based on the results of management’s
analysis.

Management cautiously and conservatively evaluated the allowance for
credit losses as of December 31, 2003 in light of (i) the uncertain status of
the overall economic recovery; (ii) the mixed economic indicators being
proffered by government economists and others; and (iii) given the relative
size of the acquired Allfirst loan portfolios, the status of management’s
ongoing detailed credit reviews of such portfolios. Although there are signs
that the national economy has improved and optimism about its future outlook is
growing, concerns exist about stagnant job growth, which could cause consumer
spending to slow; higher interest rates, which could adversely impact the
housing market; continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New York
and central Pennsylvania regions; and sluggish commercial loan demand.

In ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, the
Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits and also
estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases. The total allowance for
credit losses, therefore, includes both specific and inherent base level loss
components, as well as inherent unallocated loss components. The following
paragraphs describe these components.

The amount of specific loss components in the Company’s loan and lease
portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of all commercial and
commercial real estate loans which are in nonaccrual status. Specific loss
components are also established for certain classified commercial loans and
leases and commercial real estate loans greater than $250,000 when it is
determined that there is a differing risk of loss than otherwise prescribed
under the inherent base level loss component calculation. Measurement of the
specific loss components is typically based on expected future cash flows,
collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to
pay. Impaired loans, as defined in SFAS No. 114, “Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan,” as amended, are evaluated for specific loss components.
Except for consumer loans and leases and residential real estate loans that are
considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively,
the Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information
and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all
amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is
delinquent 90 days or more. Loans less than 90 days delinquent are deemed to
have a minimum delay in payment and are generally not considered to be
impaired.

The inherent base level loss components are generally determined by
applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and
management’s classification of such loans under the Company’s loan grading
system. The Company utilizes a loan grading system which is applied to all
commercial and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers are responsible
for continually assigning grades to these loans based on standards outlined in
the Company’s Credit Policy. Internal loan grades are also extensively
monitored by the Company’s loan review department to ensure consistency and
strict adherence to the prescribed standards.

Loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component
computations exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are
maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss component factors that reflect the
Company’s loss estimate for each group of loans and leases. Items considered
in assigning loan grades and loss component factors include borrower-specific
information related to expected future cash flows and operating results,
collateral value, financial condition, payment status, and other factors;
levels of and

-47-


trends in portfolio charge-offs and recoveries; levels of and
trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans; changes in the risk
profile of specific portfolios; trends in volume and terms of loans; national
and local economic conditions and trends; and observed trends and practices in
the banking industry.

The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss components
together comprise the total base level or “allocated” allowance for credit
losses. Such allocated portion of the allowance represents management’s
assessment of near-term charge-offs and losses existing in specific larger
balance loans that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other
loans that are not individually analyzed.

The inherent unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide
for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable. The inherent
unallocated allowance includes management’s subjective determination of amounts
necessary for such things as economic uncertainties; customer, industry and
geographic concentrations; and expansion into new products and market areas.
The unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable
losses that are not otherwise identifiable resulting from
(i) comparatively poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business
climate in many market regions served by the Company, specifically New York
State and central Pennsylvania, that resulted in such regions not having
experienced the same degree of economic growth in previous years as experienced
by much of the rest of the country; (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding
loan type, collateral type and geographic location, in particular the large
concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the New
York City metropolitan area and other areas of New York State; (iii) the effect
of expansion into new markets, including market areas entered through
acquisitions; (iv) the introduction of new loan and lease product types,
including loans and leases to foreign and domestic borrowers obtained through
acquisitions; (v) additional risk associated with growth in the Company’s
portfolio of consumer loans in recent years, in particular automobile loans and
leases, which generally have higher rates of loss than other types of
collateralized loans; (vi) the possible use of imprecise estimates in
determining the allocated portion of the allowance; and (vii) additional
uncertainty resulting from acquired loan portfolios to be fully analyzed by the
Company’s loan review department in order to become familiar with the
underlying characteristics of the portfolios and specific borrowers.

Commercial real estate valuations include many assumptions and, as a
result, can be highly subjective. Commercial real estate values in the New
York City metropolitan area can be significantly affected over relatively short
periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions and
interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and
other occupants of the real property. The tragic events of September 11, 2001
further dampened the economic outlook for the United States, which in 2001 and
2002 experienced its first significant downturn in many years. The economies
of New York State, and New York City in particular, were specifically damaged
by the events of September 11, 2001. Economic performance of the most
significant market regions served by the Company during 2003 was mixed.
Private sector job growth in the upstate New York market approximated the
national average (which was a slight decline from 2002). The
manufacturing-oriented metropolitan areas of Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse
continued to experience weakness, including announced corporate layoffs in
those areas. In the Hudson-Valley region of New York State, private sector job
growth was more than one full percentage point higher than the national average
(1.4% compared with job loss of .2% nationally). Also better than the national
average for private sector job growth were the Maryland, northern Virginia and
southeastern Pennsylvania regions, whereas the Binghamton, New York and eastern
Pennsylvania regions, largely manufacturing-oriented, lagged the national
average. These mixed signals on private sector job growth, combined with
concerns about higher interest rates, high levels of consumer indebtedness,
lack of population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania
regions and other factors, continue to indicate an environment of economic
uncertainty, both in the markets the Company serves and for the national
economy.

Table 13 presents a comparative allocation of the allowance for credit
losses for each of the past five year-ends. Amounts were allocated to specific
loan categories based on information available to management at the time of
each year-end assessment and using the methodology described herein.
Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percentage
of those loans reflect changes in management’s estimate of specific loss
components and inherent base level loss components. As described in note 4 of
Notes to Financial Statements, loans considered impaired pursuant to the
requirements of SFAS No. 114 were $164 million at both December 31, 2003 and
2002. The allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses related to
impaired loans was $26 million and $18 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was
equal to .29% and .19% of gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively. The increase in the unallocated allowance as a percentage
of loans from the 2002 year-end to December 31, 2003 reflects the factors
already described, including prolonged uncertainty about regional and national
economic conditions and the status of management’s ongoing credit reviews of
the loans obtained in the acquisition of Allfirst. As already noted,
management continues to evaluate the loan portfolios obtained in the Allfirst
transaction in accordance with the Company’s credit policies and procedures.
The slight decrease in the unallocated portion of the allowance from December
31, 2001 to December 31, 2002 reflects the modest impact of improving economic
conditions near 2002’s year-end. Given the Company’s high concentration of
commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in New York State, including
the upstate New York region, and central Pennsylvania, and considering the
other factors already discussed herein, management considers the allocated and
unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and
reasonable. Nevertheless, the Company’s allowance is general in nature and is
available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category.

Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at December 31,
2003 was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that
date. The allowance for credit losses was $614 million or 1.72% of total loans
and leases at December 31, 2003, compared with $436 million or 1.70% at
December 31, 2002 and $425 million or 1.69% at December 31, 2001. On the April
1, 2003 acquisition date, Allfirst had an allowance for credit losses of $146
million, or 1.43% of Allfirst’s loans then outstanding. Immediately following
the acquisition, the combined balance sheet of M&T and Allfirst included an
allowance for credit losses of $591 million, or 1.62% of the $36.5 billion of
then outstanding loans. The ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans at
the end of 2003, 2002 and 2001 was 256%, 203% and 223%, respectively. The
level of the allowance reflects management’s evaluation of the loan and lease
portfolio as of each respective date.

Commercial real estate loans secured by multifamily properties in the New
York City metropolitan area represented 4% of loans outstanding at December 31,
2003. The Company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific
industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2003. Outstanding
loans to foreign borrowers were $218 million at December 31, 2003, or .6% of
total loans and leases, of which $216 million were obtained in the Allfirst
transaction.

Assets acquired in settlement of defaulted loans totaled $20 million at
December 31, 2003, compared with $17 million a year earlier and $16 million at
the end of 2001.

Other Income

Other income grew 62

% to $

831 million in 2003 from $512 million in 2002.
Approximately $279 million of the increase was attributable to revenues related
to operations or market areas associated with the former Allfirst franchise.
Higher mortgage banking revenues and service charges on deposit accounts also
contributed to the improvement. Other income in 2002 was 7% higher than the
$477 million earned in 2001. Growth in revenues from providing deposit account
and mortgage banking services significantly contributed to that increase.

-49-


Mortgage banking revenues were $149 million in 2003, $116 million in 2002
and $103 million in 2001. Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both
residential and commercial mortgage banking activities. The Company’s
involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities are largely comprised of
the origination, sales and servicing of loans in conjunction with the FNMA DUS
program, which, as noted earlier, were operations acquired in the Allfirst
transaction.

Residential mortgage banking revenues, which are comprised of gains from
sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights, residential
mortgage loan servicing fees, and other residential mortgage loan-related fees
and income, rose 11% to $129 million in 2003 from $116 million in 2002.
Mortgage banking revenues in 2002 were 13% higher than $103 million in 2001.
The higher revenues in 2002 and 2003 were due to the impact of historically low
levels of interest rates that produced a favorable environment for loan
origination and refinancing activities by consumers. Residential mortgage
loans originated for sale to other investors totaled approximately $5.9 billion
in 2003, compared with $5.7 billion and $5.0 billion in 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan
servicing rights and unrealized gains from recording residential mortgage loans
held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell
loans at fair market value aggregated $65 million in 2003, $54 million in 2002
and $50 million in 2001. Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans
for others were $54 million in 2003, up from $53 million in 2002 and $44
million in 2001. Included in such servicing revenues were amounts related to
purchased servicing rights associated with small balance commercial mortgage
loans totaling $5 million, $4 million and $1 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled $13.6
billion at December 31, 2003, $12.6 billion at December 31, 2002 and $11.0
billion at December 31, 2001, including the small balance commercial mortgage
loans noted above of approximately $1.0 billion, $586 million and $222 million
at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Capitalized residential
mortgage servicing assets, net of a valuation allowance for possible
impairment, totaled $129 million at December 31, 2003, $103 million a year
earlier and $107 million at December 31, 2001. Included in capitalized
residential mortgage servicing assets were $8 million at December 31, 2003, $6
million a year earlier and $2 million at December 31, 2001 of purchased
servicing rights associated with the small balance commercial mortgage loans
noted above. Additional information about the Company’s capitalized
residential mortgage servicing assets is presented herein under the heading
“Other Expense” and in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements. Commitments to
sell residential mortgage loans and commitments to originate residential
mortgage loans for sale at pre-determined rates were $824 million and $459
million, respectively, at December 31, 2003, $1.5 billion and $825 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2002 and $1.3 billion and $714 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2001. Net unrealized gains on residential
mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to
originate loans for sale were $7 million, $15 million and $8 million at
December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Increases in such net
unrealized gains in 2002 and 2001 added $7 million and $8 million,
respectively, to mortgage banking revenues, while an $8 million decline in net
unrealized gains reduced mortgage banking revenues in 2003.

Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $20 million in 2003, including
$13 million of revenues from loan origination and sales activities and $7
million of mortgage loan servicing revenues. Commercial mortgage banking
revenues in 2003 were predominantly related to the business obtained in the
Allfirst acquisition. Capitalized commercial mortgage servicing assets totaled
$22 million at December 31, 2003. Commercial mortgage loans serviced for other
investors totaled $3.8 billion at December 31, 2003 and included $825 million
of loan balances for which investors had recourse to the Company if such
balances are ultimately uncollectible. At December 31, 2003, commitments to
sell commercial mortgage loans were $72 million, commitments to originate
commercial mortgage loans for sale were $71 million and commercial mortgage
loans held for sale were $1 million.

-50-


Service charges on deposit accounts rose 85% to $310 million in 2003 from
$168 million in 2002. Fees for deposit services provided to customers in areas
formerly served by Allfirst contributed $127 million to such revenue in 2003.
The remaining increase was largely attributable to increased fees for check
processing services on retail customer transaction accounts. Service charges
in 2002 were up 16% from $144 million in 2001. Higher transactional deposit
account balances, which generate higher levels of service charges than non-
transactional accounts, contributed to the higher service charge income
levels in 2002.

Trust income includes fees for trust and custody services provided to
personal, corporate and institutional customers, and investment management and
advisory fees that are often based on a percentage of the market value of
assets under management. Trust income rose 91% to $115 million in 2003 from
$60 million in 2002, and included $55 million of revenues associated with the
operations acquired in the Allfirst transaction. During 2003, increases in
market values of equity securities were offset by lower managed balances of
proprietary mutual funds. Reflecting general declines in market values of
equity securities, trust income declined 7% in 2002 from $64 million in 2001.
Total trust assets, which include assets under management and assets under
administration, were $134.5 billion at December 31, 2003, compared with $42.8
billion at December 31, 2002. Trust assets under management totaled $24.4
billion and $8.5 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale of mutual
funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees, totaled $51 million in 2003,
an increase of 18% from $43 million in 2002. The improvement was the result of
revenues from the former Allfirst regions. Higher revenues from sales of
annuity products contributed to a 10% increase in brokerage services income in
2002 from $39 million in 2001.

Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of $16
million in 2003, $3 million in 2002 and $4 million in 2001. The increased
gains in 2003 as compared with the prior years were due in part to higher
volumes of trading assets and liabilities in 2003 and reflect fees and market
value changes relating to interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange
contracts executed with customers formerly associated with Allfirst.
Offsetting trading positions are entered into by the Company to minimize the
risks involved with these transactions. Also contributing to the rise in such
gains in 2003 were market value increases of $6 million in trading assets held
in connection with deferred compensation plans. A largely offsetting expense
resulting from corresponding increases in deferred compensation-related
liabilities is included in other costs of operations. Trading account assets
held in connection with deferred compensation plans were $39 million and $12
million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company sold bank
investment securities resulting in gains of $2 million in 2003 and 2001,
compared with losses of $608 thousand in 2002.

Other revenues from operations were $188 million in 2003, up from $122
million in 2002 and $120 million in 2001. Included in the 2003 total was
approximately $58 million of revenues related to operations acquired from
Allfirst. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase were higher
revenues from merchant discount and credit card activities and letter of credit
and other credit-related fees. The previously described $5 million gain on the
sale of the 12% portion of the residential real estate loans that were
securitized in November 2002 offset, in part, by lower benefits income from
bank owned life insurance, contributed to the increase in other revenues from
operations from 2001 to 2002.

Other revenues from operations included $45 million ($12 million
Allfirst-related), $33 million and $35 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, of tax-exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance, which
includes increases in cash surrender value of life insurance policies and
benefits received. Revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees
totaled $26 million in 2003 ($7 million Allfirst-related), and $13 million in
2002 and 2001. Letter of credit and other credit-related fees were $54 million
($24 million Allfirst-related), $26 million and $24 million in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. Insurance-related sales commissions and other revenues
totaled

-51-


$18 million in 2003, compared with $15 million and $13 million in 2002
and 2001, respectively. ATM usage fees aggregated $19 million ($6 million
Allfirst-related) in 2003, compared with $12 million in 2002 and $11 million in
2001.

Other Expense

Other expense totaled $1.45 billion in 2003, 51% higher than $962 million in
2002 and up 48% from $981 million in 2001. Included in the amounts noted above
are expenses considered to be “nonoperating” in nature consisting of
amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $78 million, $51
million and $60 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively; amortization of
goodwill of $62 million in 2001; and merger-related expenses of $60 million and
$8 million in 2003 and 2001, respectively. There were no merger-related
expenses in 2002. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest
operating expenses aggregated $1.31 billion in 2003, up 44% from $910 million
in 2002. The April 1, 2003 acquisition of Allfirst was the predominant factor
contributing to the higher expense level in 2003. However, since the acquired
operations of Allfirst were integrated with the operations the Company
previously had throughout the last nine months of 2003, the Company’s higher
operating expenses cannot be precisely divided between or attributed directly
to the acquired operations of Allfirst or to the Company as it existed prior to
the transaction. Partially offsetting those higher expenses was a $30 million
decline in charges for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing
rights. Such impairment charges were $2 million in 2003 and $32 million in
2002. Noninterest operating expenses in 2002 were 7% higher than $851 million
in 2001. The $32 million provision for impairment of capitalized residential
mortgage servicing rights and higher costs for salaries, including commissions
and incentive compensation, largely contributed to the higher level of
noninterest operating expenses in 2002 as compared with the preceding year.
There was no provision for impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing rights
in 2001. Table 3 provides a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest
operating expense and a summary of merger-related expenses.

Salaries and employee benefits expense was $740 million in 2003, an
increase of 49% from $497 million in 2002. As already discussed, the Company
began recognizing expense for stock-based compensation effective January 1,
2003. As a result, salaries and employee benefits expense in 2003 included $43
million of stock-based compensation. Using the retroactive restatement method
prescribed by SFAS No. 148, salaries and employee benefits expense for 2002 and
2001 were restated to include $41 million and $32 million, respectively, of
stock-based compensation. Expenses related to the acquired operations of
Allfirst were the leading contributors to the rise in salaries and employee
benefits from 2002 to 2003. Also contributing to the higher expense level in
2003 were higher pension costs. Salaries and employee benefits expense in 2002
was 6% higher than $467 million in 2001. That higher level of expense was
largely the result of merit salary increases, higher commissions and incentive
compensation costs, the $9 million increase in stock-based compensation
referred to earlier, and higher pension costs. Pension benefit expense was $24
million in 2003, $6 million in 2002, and $2 million in 2001. Approximately $10
million of 2003’s expense was directly attributable to former Allfirst
employees working for the Company.

Investment returns on assets held by the Company’s qualified pension plans
improved significantly in 2003 reflecting the overall improvement in the equity
markets. However, largely as a result of a 50 basis point decline in the
discount rate used to value pension plan obligations from 6.75% at December 31,
2002 to 6.25% at December 31, 2003, the accumulated benefit obligation of
certain of the Company’s pension plans exceeded the fair value of the assets of
such plans by approximately $46 million at December 31, 2003. The lower
discount rate resulted from declines in market rates of return on high quality
fixed-income investments currently available and expected to be available
during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The Company estimates
that as of December 31, 2003, accumulated benefit obligations would increase by
approximately $19 million for an incremental 25 basis point reduction in the
assumed discount rate. According to the provisions of SFAS

-52-


No. 87, “Employers’
Accounting for Pensions,” the Company was required to have a recorded pension
liability that was at least equal to the $46 million noted above. As a result,
as of December 31, 2003 the Company increased its previously recorded pension
liability by $20 million with a corresponding reduction of other comprehensive
income that, net of applicable deferred taxes, was approximately $12 million.
The Company did not make any contributions to its qualified pension plans in
2003. In 2002, as a result of
poor investment performance, the Company contributed $19 million to its
qualified pension plans during that year’s fourth quarter. That was the first
pension plan contribution made by the Company since 1995. As a result of such
contribution, there was no excess of accumulated benefit obligation over the
fair value of assets held by the Company’s qualified pension plans as of
December 31, 2002. Information about the Company’s pension plans, including
significant assumptions utilized in completing actuarial calculations for the
plans, is included in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. Pension
expense for 2004 is estimated to be approximately $35 million. The number of
full-time equivalent employees was 13,305 at December 31, 2003, compared with
8,726 and 8,803 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Excluding the nonoperating expense items previously noted, nonpersonnel
operating expenses totaled $578 million in 2003, 40% higher than $413 million
in 2002. Nonpersonnel operating expenses were $384 million in 2001. The
impact of the Allfirst acquisition was the most significant contributor to the
higher nonpersonnel operating expense level in 2003 as compared with 2002.
Higher expenses for amortization of capitalized residential mortgage servicing
rights and professional services also contributed to the increased expenses in
2003. Partially offsetting the higher expenses were lower charges for
impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, which totaled
$2 million in 2003 and $32 million in 2002. The impairment charges resulted
from changes in the estimated fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing
rights that reflect the impact of changing interest rates on the expected rate
of residential mortgage prepayments. The most significant factor contributing
to the rise in nonpersonnel operating expenses in 2002 as compared with 2001
was the aforementioned $32 million provision for impairment of capitalized
residential mortgage servicing rights. There was no such provision during the
year ended December 31, 2001. Higher amortization of capitalized residential
mortgage servicing rights also contributed to the higher expense levels in 2002
as compared with 2001. Such amortization charges were $48 million in 2003, $40
million in 2002, and $32 million in 2001.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $277 million in 2003, compared with $219
million in 2002 and $199 million in 2001. The effective tax rates were 32.5%
in 2003, 32.4% in 2002 and 36.0% in 2001. The lower tax rates in 2003 and 2002
as compared with 2001 were the result of the Company ceasing to amortize
non-deductible goodwill in connection with the implementation of SFAS No. 142
effective January 1, 2002. A reconciliation of income tax expense to the
amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax
income is provided in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.

International Activities

The Company’s net investment in international assets was $229 million at
December 31, 2003 and $6 million at December 31, 2002. The increase in such
assets included $216 million of loans to foreign borrowers associated with
business activities obtained in the acquisition of Allfirst. Offshore deposits
totaled $2.2 billion at December 31, 2003 and $1.2 billion at December 31,
2002. The Company uses such deposits to facilitate customer demand and as an
alternative to short-term borrowings when the costs of such deposits seem
reasonable.

Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity

As a financial intermediary the Company is exposed to various risks, including
liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Company’s ability to ensure
that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current
and future financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit
withdrawals, operating costs, and other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk
arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in
assets and liabilities differ.

Core deposits have historically been the most significant funding source
for the Company and are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and
institutional customers, which over the past several years has become more
geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the
Company’s businesses. Nevertheless, in recent years the Company has faced
increased competition in offering services and products from a large array of
financial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds,
securities dealers and others. Core deposits financed 65% of the Company’s
earning assets at December 31, 2003, compared with 60% and 62% at December 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits with
various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds
purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered
certificates of deposit, offshore branch deposits and borrowings from the FHLB
and others. M&T Bank had short-term and long-term credit facilities with the
FHLB aggregating $6.2 billion at December 31, 2003. Outstanding borrowings
under these credit facilities totaled $3.1 billion and $4.2 billion at December
31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Such borrowings are secured by loans and
investment securities. M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. had available lines of
credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at December 31, 2003 totaling
approximately $2.2 billion. The amounts of these lines are dependent upon the
balance of loans and securities pledged as collateral. There were no
borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit at either December 31, 2003
or 2002.

As previously noted, in anticipation of the Allfirst acquisition, M&T Bank
issued $400 million of subordinated notes on March 31, 2003 to provide
liquidity to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to AIB and to
maintain appropriate regulatory capital ratios. As an additional source of
funding, in November 2002, the Company entered into a $500 million revolving
asset-backed structured borrowing which is collateralized by approximately $559
million of automobile loans and related assets. The automobile loans and
related assets have been transferred to a special purpose consolidated
subsidiary of M&T Bank. As existing automobile loans of the subsidiary pay
down, monthly proceeds, after payment of certain fees and debt service costs,
are used by the subsidiary to obtain additional automobile loans from M&T Bank
or another of its subsidiaries to replenish the collateral and maintain the
existing borrowing base. Additional information about this borrowing is
included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of funding are available to the
Company through various arrangements for unsecured short-term borrowings from a
wide group of banks and other financial institutions. Short-term federal funds
borrowings aggregated $3.5 billion and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively. In general, these borrowings were unsecured and matured on
the next business day.

Should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial
condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of short-term funding
become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets, the Company’s
ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could be negatively
impacted. The Company attempts to quantify such credit-event risk by modeling
scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a short-term
ratings downgrade over various grading levels. The Company estimates such
impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of
credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources

-54-


and securitizable
assets. Information about the credit ratings of M&T and M&T Bank is presented
in table 14. Additional information regarding the terms and maturities of all
of the Company’s short-term and long-term borrowings is provided in note 9 of
Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to deposits and borrowings, other
sources of liquidity include maturities of money-market assets and investment
securities, repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash generated
from operations, such as fees collected for services.

The Company serves in the capacity of remarketing agent for variable rate
demand bonds (“VRDBs”), in a line of business obtained in the Allfirst
acquisition. The VRDBs are enhanced by a direct-pay letter of credit provided
by M&T Bank. Holders of the VRDBs generally have the right to sell the bonds
to the remarketing agent with seven days notice, which could result in M&T Bank
owning the VRDBs for some period of time until such instruments are remarketed.
When this occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading assets in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet. The value of VRDBs in the Company’s trading
account totaled $22 million at December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the
total amount of VRDBs outstanding backed by an M&T Bank letter of credit was
$1.3 billion.

The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of
business which require future cash payments. As of December 31, 2003, the
contractual amounts and timing of those payments are summarized in table 15.
The Company also has off-balance sheet commitments to customers that may impact
liquidity, including commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit,
commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and indemnification
contracts, and commitments to sell real estate loans. Since many of these
commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the
contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further
discussion of these commitments is provided in note 20 of Notes to Financial
Statements. Table 15 summarizes the Company’s other commitments as of December
31, 2003 and the timing of the expiration of such commitments.

M&T’s primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, shareholder
dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of
dividends from its banking subsidiaries, which are subject to various
regulatory limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T are
limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current year
and the two preceding years. For purposes of the test, at December 31, 2003
approximately $696 million was available for payment of dividends to M&T from
banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval. These historic sources
of cash flow have been augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred
securities. Information regarding trust preferred securities and the related
junior subordinated debentures is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial
Statements. M&T also maintains a $30 million line of credit with an
unaffiliated commercial bank, of which there were no borrowings outstanding at
December 31, 2003. A similar $30 million line of credit was entirely available
for borrowing at December 31, 2002.

On an ongoing basis, management closely monitors the Company’s liquidity
position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available
sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs in the normal course of
business. Management does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either
currently or in the long-term, for which adequate funding would not be
available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at
either M&T or its subsidiary banks.

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices
and/or interest rates of the Company’s financial instruments. The primary
market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. The core banking
activities of lending and deposit-taking expose the Company to interest rate
risk, which occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times and
by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest
income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest
rates. The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability

-55-


of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios
using projected balances for earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and
derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Management’s philosophy toward
interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest
income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are
based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated
prepayments of loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of
investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a “value of equity”
model to supplement the modeling technique described above. Those supplemental
analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on-
and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to
reflect changes in interest rates and non-parallel shifts in the maturity curve
of interest rates and provide management with a long-term interest rate risk
metric. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help
manage exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2003, the aggregate
notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate
risk management purposes was $685 million. Information about interest rate
swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is
included herein under “Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities” and
in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company’s Asset-Liability Committee, which includes members of senior
management, monitors interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a computer model
that considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit-gathering activities,
as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of
financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on
expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, management has taken
actions, and intends to do so in the future, to mitigate exposure to interest
rate risk through the use of on- or off-balance sheet financial instruments.
Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of
loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and
interest-bearing liabilities, and modifying or terminating existing interest
rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for risk management
purposes.

Table 19 as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 displays the estimated impact on
net interest income from non-trading financial instruments resulting from
parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first
modeling year.

Many assumptions were utilized by the Company to calculate the impact that
changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more
significant assumptions related to the rate of prepayments of mortgage-related
assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for
non-trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit
maturities. The Company also assumed gradual changes in rates during a
twelve-month period, including incremental 100 and 200 basis point rate
changes. In the event that a 100 or 200 basis point rate change cannot be
achieved, the applicable rate changes are limited to lesser amounts such that
interest rates cannot be less than zero. These assumptions are inherently
uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of
changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ
significantly due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest
rates, market conditions, and interest rate differentials (spreads) between and
within maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as those
previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. In
light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process, the
amounts presented in the table and changes in such amounts are not considered
significant to the Company’s past or projected net interest income.

In accordance with industry practice, table 20 presents cumulative totals
of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a contractual basis within the
specified time frames, as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap
agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes. Management
believes that this measure does not appropriately depict interest

-56-


rate risk
since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of
earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities equally nor, as assumed in the
table, on the contractual maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this static
presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing
lending and deposit gathering activities, projected changes in balance sheet
composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the
Company is likely to implement.

The Company has historically engaged in trading activities to meet the
financial needs of customers, to fund the Company’s obligations under certain
deferred compensation plans and, to a limited extent, to profit from perceived
market opportunities. Financial instruments utilized in trading activities
have included forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies and
mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasury and other government securities,
mortgage-backed securities, mutual funds and interest rate contracts, such as
swap agreements. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and
interest rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into
offsetting trading positions. The amounts of gross and net trading positions
as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the Company are subject
to a well-defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by the
Asset-Liability Committee. However, as with any non-government guaranteed
financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with
counterparties to the Company’s trading activities.

The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading
purposes totaled $5.3 billion at December 31, 2003 and $1.3 billion at December
31, 2002. The notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and
futures contracts entered into for trading purposes were $548 million and $290
million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The notional amounts of
these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet.
However, the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading
activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of
all trading account assets and liabilities were $215 million and $139 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2003 and $52 million and $36 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2002. The higher amounts of trading account
assets and liabilities at December 31, 2003 reflect the fair values of interest
rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts executed with customers
associated with Allfirst and the related offsetting trading positions.
Included in trading account assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $39
million and $12 million, respectively, relating to deferred compensation plans.
Changes in the fair value of such assets are recorded as trading account and
foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income. Included in other
liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003 and 2002
were $49 million and $23 million, respectively, of liabilities related to
deferred compensation plans. Changes in the balances of such liabilities due
to the valuation of allocated investment options to which the liabilities are
indexed are recorded in other costs of operations in the consolidated
statement of income.

Given the Company’s policies, limits and positions, management believes
that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk
associated with trading activities was not material. Additional information
related to trading derivative contracts is included in note 17 of Notes to
Financial Statements.

Capital

Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2003 was $5.7 billion or 11.47% of total
assets, compared with $3.2 billion or 9.66% at December 31, 2002 and $3.0
billion or 9.40% at December 31, 2001. On a per share basis, stockholders’
equity increased 37% to $47.55 at the 2003 year-end from $34.82 at December 31,
2002, and was 51% higher than $31.54 at December 31, 2001. Tangible equity per
share, which excludes goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets and
applicable deferred tax balances, was $21.97 at December

-57-


31, 2003, compared
with $22.04 a year earlier and $18.54 at December 31, 2001. In the calculation
of tangible equity per common share, stockholders’ equity is reduced by the
carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net
of applicable deferred tax balances. A reconciliation of total stockholders’
equity and tangible equity as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is presented
in table 3. The ratio of average total stockholders’ equity to average total
assets was 10.89%, 9.48% and 9.65% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

To complete the acquisition of Allfirst on April 1, 2003, M&T issued
26,700,000 shares of common stock to AIB resulting in an addition to
stockholders’ equity of $2.0 billion. The value ascribed to the common shares
issued to AIB was based on the market value of M&T common stock at the
time the terms of the merger were agreed to and announced by M&T and AIB.

M&T also issued shares of common stock in 2001 to complete the acquisition
of Premier. On February 9, 2001, M&T issued 2,440,812 shares of common stock
to former holders of Premier common stock and assumed employee stock options to
purchase 224,734 shares of M&T common stock, resulting in an addition to
stockholders’ equity of $176 million.

Included in stockholders’ equity was accumulated other comprehensive
income which reflects the net after-tax impact of unrealized gains or losses on
investment securities classified as available for sale; unrealized fair value
gains or losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as
cash flow hedges; and minimum pension liability adjustments. Net unrealized
gains on available-for-sale investment securities were $38 million, or $.32 per
common share, at December 31, 2003, $55 million, or $.60 per common share, at
December 31, 2002 and $23 million, or $.25 per common share, at December 31,
2001. Such unrealized gains are generally due to changes in interest rates and
represent the difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the
estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as
available for sale. Net unrealized fair value losses associated with interest
rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges, were $622 thousand and
$298 thousand at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, representing less
than $.01 per share at those respective dates. There were no outstanding
interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges at December 31,
2003. The minimum pension liability adjustment, net of applicable tax effect,
reduced accumulated other comprehensive income by $12 million at December 31,
2003, or $.10 per share. There were no such adjustments at December 31, 2002
or 2001. Information about the funded status of the Company’s pension plans is
included in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Cash dividends paid in 2003 on M&T’s common stock were $135 million,
compared with $97 million and $96 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. M&T
increased its quarterly dividend on common stock in the fourth quarter of 2002
to $.30 per share from $.25 per share. Dividends per common share totaled
$1.20 in 2003, up from $1.05 in 2002 and $1.00 in 2001.

M&T repurchased 3,007,585 shares of its common stock in 2002 and 4,396,303
shares in 2001, at a cost of $240 million and $324 million, respectively. In
November 2001, M&T announced that it had been authorized by its Board of
Directors to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. Through
December 31, 2002, M&T had repurchased a total of 3,632,098 shares of common
stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of $78.49 per share. M&T
discontinued purchases of its common stock during the third quarter of 2002,
determining instead that it would use the Company’s internal generation of
capital to support the acquisition of Allfirst. There were no common stock
repurchases in 2003. However, M&T resumed purchases of its common stock in
January 2004, and completed the 5,000,000 share repurchase plan in February
2004. The common stock was purchased pursuant to such plans at an average cost
of $82.11 per share.

Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain
“core capital” and “total capital” ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively,
of risk-adjusted total assets. In addition to the risk-based measures, Federal
bank

-58-


regulators have also implemented a minimum “leverage” ratio guideline of
3% of the quarterly average of total assets. Core capital includes the $686
million carrying value of trust preferred securities as described in note 9 of
Notes to Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2003, total capital further
included $1.2 billion of subordinated notes.

The capital ratios of the Company and its banking subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002 are presented in note 22 of Notes to Financial
Statements.

The Company generates significant amounts of regulatory capital. The rate
of regulatory core capital generation, or net operating income (as previously
defined) less the sum of dividends paid and the after-tax effect of
merger-related expenses expressed as a percentage of regulatory “core
capital” at the beginning of each year, was 23.35% in 2003, 19.78% in 2002 and
19.43% in 2001.

Fourth Quarter Results

The Company’s net income totaled $167 million during the final quarter of 2003,
41% higher than $119 million in the corresponding quarter of 2002. Diluted and
basic earnings per share were $1.35 and $1.39, respectively, in 2003’s fourth
quarter, compared with $1.25 and $1.29, respectively, in the year-earlier
quarter. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets, net
income for the fourth quarter of 2003 was 1.35%, compared with 1.42% in 2002’s
final quarter. The annualized rate of return on average common stockholders’
equity for the last three months of 2003 was 11.77%, compared with 15.00% in
the similar 2002 period.

Net operating income in the fourth quarter of 2003 increased 44% to $182
million from $126 million in the last quarter of 2002. Diluted net operating
earnings per share rose 11% to $1.47 in the recently completed quarter from
$1.32 in the year-earlier quarter. The annualized net operating returns on
average tangible assets and average tangible common equity were 1.57% and
28.33%, respectively, in 2003’s final quarter, compared with 1.56% and 25.54%,
respectively, in the similar 2002 quarter. Amortization of core deposit and
other intangible assets, after tax effect, totaled $13 million ($.11 per
diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with $7 million ($.07
per diluted share) in the corresponding quarter of 2002. Merger-related
expenses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2003 totaled $2 million, after
applicable tax effect, or $.01 per diluted share. There were no significant
merger-related expenses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2002.
Reconciliations of GAAP results with non-GAAP results for the quarterly periods
of 2003 and 2002 are provided in table 22.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased to $426 million in the
recent quarter, 31% higher than $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. A
42% increase in average earning assets offset, in part, by a narrowing of the
Company’s net interest margin, resulted in the improvement. Reflecting the
impact of the Allfirst acquisition, average earning assets were $42.7 billion
in 2003’s fourth quarter, up from $30.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2002.
Average loans and leases for the recently completed three-month period totaled
$36.4 billion, an increase of 41% from $25.9 billion during the year-earlier
quarter. Average loan balances in 2003 and 2002 reflect fourth quarter
transactions in each year in which M&T converted residential real estate loans
of $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, into mortgage-backed
securities. Those transactions are described in “Net Interest Income/Lending
and Funding Activities” and in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. The
yield on earning assets was 5.16% in the last three months of 2003, down 92
basis points from 6.08% in the corresponding 2002 period. The rate paid on
interest-bearing liabilities was 1.48% in the fourth quarter of 2003, down 61
basis points from 2.09% in the like-period of 2002. The resulting net interest
spread was 3.68% in 2003’s final quarter, compared with 3.99% in the
year-earlier period. As a result, the Company’s net interest margin declined
to 3.96% in the fourth quarter of 2003 from 4.28% in the similar quarter of
2002. The decreases in net interest spread and margin were

-59-


due largely to the
impact of yields on earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing
liabilities obtained in the Allfirst acquisition.

The provision for credit losses was $28 million in the final quarter of
2003, compared with $33 million in the corresponding 2002 period. Net
charge-offs totaled $32 million in the recent quarter, compared with $31
million in 2002’s final quarter. Net charge-offs as an annualized percentage
of average loans and leases were .35% in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared
with .48% in the year-earlier period.

Other income rose 69

% to $

234 million in the final quarter of 2003 from
$138 million in 2002’s fourth quarter. The increase was attributable to
revenues related to operations or market areas associated with the former
Allfirst franchise.

Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2003 aggregated $378 million,
51% higher than $251 million in the year-earlier period. Included in such
amounts are expenses considered “nonoperating” in nature consisting of
amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $21 million and $12
million in the final quarters of 2003 and 2002, respectively, and
merger-related expenses of $3 million in 2003’s fourth quarter. Exclusive of
these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $354 million
in the recent quarter, 48

%

above the $239 million recorded in 2002’s fourth
quarter. The increase in operating expenses was largely attributable to
operations formerly related to Allfirst, partially offset by lower charges for
the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. Operating
expenses in the fourth quarter of 2003 reflect a $4 million reduction in total
expenses resulting from a partial reversal of the valuation allowance for
possible impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, while
a $13 million increase in the valuation allowance in 2002’s fourth quarter
added to total expenses. During the fourth quarter of 2003 and 2002, the
Company’s efficiency ratio was 53.9% and 51.7%, respectively. The higher ratio
in the recently completed quarter reflects the impact of the acquired Allfirst
operations. Table 22 includes a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest
operating expense for each of the quarters of 2003 and 2002.

Segment Information

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures About Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information,” the Company’s reportable segments
have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system,
which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business
units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the
nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution
of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are
Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio,
Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking.

The financial information of the Company’s segments was compiled utilizing
the accounting policies described in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements.
The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment
financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting,
are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported
segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not
necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial
institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation
methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment
financial data. Financial information about the Company’s segments is
presented in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products
and banking services for middle-market and large commercial customers, largely
within the markets the Company serves. Services provided by this segment
include commercial lending and leasing, deposit products, and cash management
services. Net income contributed by the Commercial Banking segment totaled $175

-60-


million in 2003, up 95% from $90 million in 2002. The favorable performance
from the prior year was predominately the result of the Allfirst acquisition,
which contributed to increases in net interest income on loans of $52 million,
service charges on deposit accounts of $36 million and credit-related fees of
$18 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $37 million. The
improvement was also aided by a decline in net charge-offs from 2002, largely
the result of a $17 million loss in 2002 related to two commercial leases to a
major airline company that filed for bankruptcy. Net charge-offs for the
commercial banking segment were $23 million in 2003 and $48 million in 2002.
Net income for this segment totaled $107 million in 2001. The decline in net
income in 2002 as compared with 2001 was attributable to the $17 million
charge-off described above and a $14 million decrease in net interest income,
due to a 25 basis point narrowing of the segment’s net interest margin.
Partially offsetting these decreases was a $4
million increase in deposit service charges. Net charge-offs in 2001 for
the commercial banking segment were $28 million.

The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit services to
its customers. Real estate securing loans in this segment is generally located
in the New York City metropolitan area, upstate New York, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the
northwestern portion of the United States. Commercial real estate loans may be
secured by apartment/multifamily buildings; office, retail and industrial
space; or other types of collateral. Activities of this segment also include
the origination, sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans through
the FNMA DUS program. The Commercial Real Estate segment’s net income was $119
million in 2003, up 29% from $92 million in 2002. The increase was due to
higher net interest income of $38 million, largely the result of average loan
balances acquired in the Allfirst transaction and a higher net interest margin
on loans in the non-Allfirst regions, and commercial mortgage banking revenues
of $20 million resulting largely from the Allfirst acquisition. Partially
offsetting these revenue increases were higher salaries and benefits and other
operating expenses that also resulted from the Allfirst acquisition. Net income
in 2002 for the Commercial Real Estate segment was 7% higher than the $87
million earned in 2001. That increase was due largely to an $11 million
increase in net interest income, the result of a 12 basis point widening of the
net interest margin on loans and a 5% increase in average loan balances
outstanding.

The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and trading
securities, residential mortgage loans and other assets; short-term and
long-term borrowed funds; brokered certificates of deposit and interest rate
swap agreements related thereto; and offshore branch deposits. This segment
also provides services to commercial customers and consumers that include
foreign exchange, securities trading and municipal bond underwriting and sales.
The Discretionary Portfolio segment recorded net income of $86 million in 2003,
34% higher than $64 million in 2002, primarily the result of higher net
interest income from investment securities, including securities acquired in
the Allfirst transaction. In 2001, this segment’s net income was $53 million.
The 20% increase in net income from 2001 to 2002 was predominantly due to an
$18 million increase in net interest income, largely the result of a 34 basis
point rise in the net interest margin on investment securities.

The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services
residential mortgage loans for consumers and sells substantially all of those
loans in the secondary market to investors or to bank subsidiaries of M&T. In
addition to the geographic regions served by or contiguous with the Company’s
branch network, the Company maintains mortgage loan origination offices in
several states in the western United States. The Company also periodically
purchases the rights to service residential mortgage loans. Residential
mortgage loans held for sale are included in this segment. The Residential
Mortgage Banking segment earned $66 million in 2003, up 75% from the $38
million earned in 2002. The 2003 results include a $34 million increase in
revenues from loan origination and sales activities, including gains from sales
of loans to the Company’s Discretionary Portfolio segment, and a $12 million
increase in net interest income, due largely to higher average

-61-


balances of
outstanding loans and deposits. Gains from sales of loans to the Company’s
Discretionary Portfolio segment were $22 million and $9 million in 2003 and
2002, respectively. Also contributing to the segment’s improved net income was
a decrease in the provision for impairment of capitalized mortgage loan
servicing rights, which was $30 million lower than in 2002. Partially
offsetting the revenue increases noted above were higher salaries and employee
benefits and other operating expenses of $29 million, exclusive of the impact
of changes in the provision for impairment of capitalized mortgage loan
servicing rights already noted. The segment’s net income in 2002 was 12% lower
than 2001’s total of $43 million. That decrease from 2001 was attributable to
a $29 million increase in the provision for impairment of capitalized
residential mortgage loan servicing rights and a $19 million increase in
salaries, commissions and other operating expenses. Mitigating the impact of
those higher expenses was a $27 million increase in net interest income, the
result of a higher loan net interest margin and higher average
loan balances outstanding; increased loan servicing revenues of $7
million, largely the result of purchased servicing rights; and a $6 million
increase in revenues from loan origination and sales activities. During 2001,
gains from sales of loans to the Company’s Discretionary Portfolio segment were
$10 million.

The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of services to consumers and
small businesses through several delivery channels which include traditional
and “in-store” banking offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking
and internet banking. The Company has banking offices in New York State,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, West Virginia and
Delaware. The Retail Banking segment also offers certain deposit and loan
products on a nationwide basis through M&T Bank, N.A. Credit services offered
by this segment include consumer installment loans, student loans, automobile
loans (originated both directly and indirectly through dealers), home equity
loans and lines of credit, and loans and leases to small businesses. The
segment also offers to its customers deposit products, including demand,
savings and time accounts; investment products, including mutual funds and
annuities; and other services. Net income for the Retail Banking segment
totaled $192 million in 2003, up 20% from $159 million in 2002. The favorable
variance was largely the result of higher net interest income of $180 million
and service charges on deposit accounts of $99 million, partially offset by
higher operating expenses of $231 million, all largely attributable to the
impact of the acquisition of Allfirst. In the non-Allfirst regions, a $62
million decrease in net interest income attributable to deposits, due to a 44
basis point decline in net interest margin, was partially offset by a $49
million increase in net interest income on loans, resulting from increases in
indirect automobile loan and home equity line of credit balances outstanding of
51% and 27%, respectively. Earnings for this segment declined 19% in 2002 from
$198 million in 2001. A $44 million reduction in net interest income was a
significant contributor to such decline. A lower deposit net interest margin
of 42 basis points, largely attributable to the impact of the year’s low
interest rate environment, and a 6% decrease in retail deposit balances led to
an $82 million decline in net interest income. Partially offsetting this
decline was higher loan net interest income of $38 million, primarily the
result of a 14% increase in average loan balances outstanding. Also
contributing to the lower earnings in 2002 was a $15 million increase in the
provision for credit losses and increased operating expenses of $23 million,
offset, in part, by an $18 million increase in service charges on deposit
accounts.

The “All Other” category reflects other activities of the Company that are
not directly attributable to the reported segments as determined in accordance
with SFAS No. 131, such as the M&T Investment Group, which
includes the
Company’s trust, brokerage and insurance businesses. Also reflected in this
category are the amortization of goodwill (in 2001) and core deposit and other
intangible assets, merger-related expenses resulting from acquisitions, and the
net impact of the Company’s allocation methodologies for internal funds
transfer pricing and the provision for credit losses. The various components
comprising the “All Other” category resulted in net losses of $64 million in
2003 and $134 million in 2001, and net income of $14 million in 2002. The net
loss in

-62-


2003 was largely the result of merger-related costs, core deposit
intangible amortization, and, largely as a result of the Allfirst acquisition,
higher operating expenses that under the Company’s cost allocation
methodologies were not allocated to the Company’s reportable segments. Also
contributing to the net loss were higher provisions for credit losses. The
improvement in 2002 from 2001 was due to the Company’s allocation methodologies
for internal funds transfer pricing, combined with the cessation of
amortization of goodwill resulting from the January 1, 2002 adoption of SFAS
No. 142.

Recent Accounting Developments

FASB Interpretation No. 45 (“FIN 45”), “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others,” was issued in November 2002. FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures
to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial
statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued.
It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception
of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in
issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement
provisions of FIN 45 were applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees
issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements were
effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after
December 15, 2002. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 45 as required,
and such adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46”),
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.” The FASB’s stated intent in
issuing FIN 46 was to clarify the application of Accounting Research Bulletin
No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements,” to certain entities in which
equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial
interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support from other
parties. FIN 46 requires an enterprise to consolidate a variable interest
entity (as defined in FIN 46) if that enterprise has a variable interest (or
combination of variable interests) that will absorb a majority of the entity’s
expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the entity’s expected
returns if they occur, or both. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised
FIN 46 (“FIN 46R”) which attempts to clarify the guidance in the original
interpretation. FIN 46 applies to variable interest entities created after
January 31, 2003. FIN 46 also applies to all variable interest entities
created prior to February 1, 2003 that are considered to be special-purpose
entities (as defined in FIN 46R) as of December 31, 2003. FIN 46R must be
applied to all variable interest entities no later than the end of the first
reporting period that ends after March 15, 2004. As described in note 18 of
Notes to Financial Statements, implementation of the new accounting provisions
related to investments in variable interest entities resulted in the removal of
trusts that had issued trust preferred securities from the Company’s
consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2003. Accordingly, at
December 31, 2003, the Company included the junior subordinated debentures
payable to such trusts as long-term borrowings in its consolidated balance
sheet. Prior to that date, the Company included the capital securities of the
trusts in its consolidated balance sheet as long-term borrowings, with
accumulated distributions on such securities included in interest expense.
That change in financial statement presentation had no economic impact on the
Company, had no material or substantive impact on the Company’s financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003, had no impact on
2003’s average balances noted herein, and resulted in the Company recognizing
$30 million in other assets for its “investment” in the common securities of
the trusts that had issued the trust preferred securities that will be
concomitantly repaid to M&T by the respective trusts from the proceeds of M&T’s
repayment of the junior subordinated debentures associated with preferred
capital securities described in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.

-63-


In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133
on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 149 amends and
clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 is generally effective for
contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and is effective for
hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. Provisions of SFAS No.
149 that relate to SFAS No. 133 implementation issues that had been effective
for fiscal quarters that began prior to June 15, 2003 should continue to be
applied in accordance with their respective dates. All provisions of SFAS No.
149 should be applied prospectively, except for paragraphs 7(a) and 23(a),
which relate to forward purchases or sales of “when-issued” securities or other
securities that do not yet exist, which
should be applied to both existing contracts and new contracts entered into
after June 30, 2003. The provisions of SFAS No. 149 did not have a material
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity.”
SFAS No. 150 established standards for how an issuer classifies and measures
certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and
equity. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the
first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, except for mandatorily
redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities. It is to be
implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the
statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of
adoption. Restatement is not permitted. The provisions of SFAS No. 150 did
not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In October 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), “Employers’
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,” (“SFAS No.
132R”), an amendment of SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions,” SFAS
No. 88, “Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined
Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits,” and SFAS No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,” and a
revision of SFAS No. 132. SFAS No. 132R revised employers’ disclosures about
pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It did not change the
measurement or recognition of those plans required by SFAS Nos. 87, 88 and 106.
While retaining the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 132, which it
replaced, SFAS No. 132R requires additional disclosures about assets,
obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit costs of defined benefit
plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. The provisions of SFAS
No. 132R are generally effective for financial statements with fiscal years
ending after December 15, 2003. The interim period disclosures required by
this statement are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15,
2003. The disclosures for earlier periods should be restated, or if it is not
practicable to obtain this information, the notes to the financial statements
should include all available information and identify information that is not
available. The Company has complied with the required provisions of SFAS No.
132R and included the appropriate information in note 11 of Notes to Financial
Statements.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Financial Review and other sections of this Annual Report contain
forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates
and projections about the Company’s business, management’s beliefs and
assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future
performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (“Future
Factors”) which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and
results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such
forward-looking statements.

-64-


Future Factors include changes in interest rates, spreads on earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity; credit
losses; sources of liquidity; common shares outstanding; common stock price
volatility; fair value of and number of stock options to be issued in future
periods; legislation affecting the financial services industry as a whole,
and/or M&T and its subsidiaries individually or collectively; regulatory
supervision and oversight, including required capital levels; increasing price
and product/service competition by competitors, including new entrants; rapid
technological developments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce
competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis; the
mix of products/services; containing costs and expenses; governmental and
public policy changes, including environmental regulations; protection and
validity of intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers;
technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large, multi-year
contracts; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental
proceedings; continued availability of financing; financial resources in the
amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support the Company’s future
businesses; and material differences in the actual financial results of
merger and acquisition activities compared to the Company’s expectations,
including the full realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue
enhancements. These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect
the outcome of the forward-looking statements. In addition, such statements
could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates,
general economic and political conditions, including interest rate and currency
exchange rate fluctuations, and other Future Factors.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

M&T Bank Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of M&T Bank
Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in
stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2003. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of M&T Bank
Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company changed the
manner in which it accounts for stock-based compensation as of January 1, 2003.
As discussed in Notes 1 and 8 to the financial statements, the Company changed
the manner in which it accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets as of
January 1, 2002.

M&T BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant accounting policies

M&T Bank Corporation (“M&T”) is a bank holding company headquartered in
Buffalo, New York. Through subsidiaries, M&T provides individuals,
corporations and other businesses, and institutions with commercial and retail
banking services, including loans and deposits, trust, mortgage banking, asset
management, insurance and other financial services. Banking activities are
largely focused on consumers residing in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland
and the District of Columbia and on small and medium-size businesses based in
those areas. Banking services are also provided in Delaware, Virginia and West
Virginia, while certain subsidiaries also conduct activities in other states.

The accounting and reporting policies of M&T and subsidiaries (“the
Company”) conform to generally accepted accounting principles and to general
practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The more significant accounting policies are as follows:

Consolidation

Except as described in note 18, the consolidated financial statements include
M&T and all of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions of consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in
consolidation. The financial statements of M&T included in note 24 report
investments in subsidiaries under the equity method.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

For purposes of this statement, cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and
agreements to resell securities are considered cash and cash equivalents.

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under
agreements to repurchase

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under
agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing transactions
and are recorded at amounts equal to the cash or other consideration exchanged.
It is generally the Company’s policy to take possession of collateral pledged
to secure agreements to resell.

Trading account

Financial instruments used for trading purposes are stated at fair value.
Realized gains and losses and unrealized changes in fair value of financial
instruments utilized in trading activities are included in trading account and
foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income.

Investment securities

Investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and stated at
amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold such
securities to maturity. Investments in other debt securities and equity
securities having readily determinable fair values are classified as available
for sale and stated at estimated fair value. Except for investment securities

-96-


M&T BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements, continued

1. Significant accounting policies, continued

Investment securities, continued

for which the Company has entered into a related fair value hedge, unrealized
gains or losses on investment securities available for sale are reflected in
accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes.

Other securities are stated at cost and include stock of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.

Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts for investment
securities available for sale and held to maturity are included in interest
income. The cost basis of individual securities is written down to estimated
fair value through a charge to earnings when declines in value below amortized
cost are considered to be other than temporary. Realized gains and losses on
the sales of investment securities are determined using the specific
identification method.

Loans

Interest income on loans is accrued on a level yield method. Loans are placed
on nonaccrual status and previously accrued interest thereon is charged against
income when principal or interest is delinquent 90 days, unless management
determines that the loan status clearly warrants other treatment. Loan
balances are charged off when it becomes evident that such balances are not
fully collectible. Loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are
deferred and recognized as an interest yield adjustment over the life of the
loan. Net deferred fees have been included in unearned discount as a reduction
of loans outstanding. Commitments to sell residential real estate loans are
utilized by the Company to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of
residential real estate loans held for sale. Hedged residential real estate
loans held for sale are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at estimated
fair market value. Valuation adjustments made on these loans are included in
mortgage banking revenues.

Except for consumer and residential mortgage loans that are considered
smaller balance homogenous loans and are evaluated collectively, the Company
considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events,
it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according
to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90
days. Impaired loans are classified as either nonaccrual or as loans
renegotiated at below market rates. Loans less than 90 days delinquent are
deemed to have an insignificant delay in payment and are generally not
considered impaired. Impairment of a loan is measured based on the present
value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest
rate, the loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of collateral if
the loan is collateral dependent. Interest received on impaired loans placed
on nonaccrual status is applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan or, if
principal is considered fully collectible, recognized as interest income.

Allowance for credit losses

The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in management’s
judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and
lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The adequacy of the allowance is
determined by management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on
such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan
category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic
environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans and the
value of any collateral.

Premises and equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation expense is computed principally using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Sales and securitizations of financial assets

Transfers of financial assets for which the Company has surrendered control of
the financial assets are accounted for as sales to the extent that
consideration other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets is
received in exchange. Retained interests in a sale or securitization of
financial assets are measured at the date of transfer by allocating the
previous carrying amount between the assets transferred and any retained
interests based on their relative estimated fair values. The fair values of
retained debt securities are generally determined through reference to
independent pricing information. The fair values of retained servicing rights
and any other retained interests are determined based on the present value of
expected future cash flows associated with those interests and by reference to
market prices for similar assets.

Capitalized servicing rights

Servicing assets purchased or servicing liabilities assumed that are not
recognized in connection with the sale or securitization of financial assets
are initially measured at fair value. Capitalized servicing assets are
included in other assets and amortized in proportion to and over the period of
estimated net servicing income.

To estimate the fair value of servicing rights, the Company considers
market prices for similar assets and the present value of expected future cash
flows associated with the servicing rights calculated using assumptions that
market participants would use in estimating future servicing income and
expense. Such assumptions include estimates of the cost of servicing loans,
loan default rates, an appropriate discount rate, and prepayment speeds. For
purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment of capitalized servicing
rights, the Company stratifies such assets based on predominant risk
characteristics of underlying financial instruments that are expected to have
the most impact on projected prepayments, cost of servicing and other factors
affecting future cash flows associated with the servicing rights. Such factors
may include financial asset or loan type, note rate and term. The amount of
impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the
capitalized servicing rights for a stratum exceeds estimated fair value.

Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair
value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Similar to goodwill, other
intangible assets, which include core deposit intangibles, also lack physical
substance but, as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 141, “Business Combinations,” have had portions of the cost of an
acquired entity assigned to such assets. Effective January 1, 2002, the
Company adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” SFAS No.
142 revised the accounting for purchased intangible assets and, in general,
requires that goodwill no longer be amortized, but rather that it be tested for
impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level, which is either at
the same level or one level below an operating segment. Other acquired
intangible assets with finite lives, such as core deposit intangibles, are
required to be amortized over their estimated lives. Prior to January 1, 2002,
substantially all of the Company’s goodwill was amortized using the
straight-line method over twenty years. Core deposit and other intangible
assets are amortized using accelerated methods over estimated useful lives of
five to ten years. The Company periodically assesses whether events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of core deposit and other
intangible assets may be impaired.

Derivative financial instruments

The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with
SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as
amended. SFAS No. 133 established accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity
recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet
and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a
derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to
changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized
firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a
forecasted transaction or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net
investment in a foreign operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, an
available for sale security, or a foreign currency denominated forecasted
transaction. Pursuant to SFAS No. 133, the accounting for changes in the fair
value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the
resulting designation. An entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is
required to establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use for
assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement
approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge. Those methods
must be consistent with the entity’s approach to managing risk.

The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of the
management of interest rate risk to modify the repricing characteristics of
certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities. For such agreements, amounts receivable or payable are recognized
as accrued under the terms of the agreement and the net differential is
recorded as an adjustment to interest income or expense of the related asset or
liability. Interest rate swap agreements are designated as either fair value
hedges or cash flow hedges. In a fair value hedge, the fair values of the
interest rate swap agreements and changes in the fair values of the hedged
items are recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet with the
corresponding gain or loss being recognized in current earnings. The difference
between changes in the fair values of interest rate swap agreements and the
hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in
“other revenues from operations” in the Company’s consolidated statement
of income. In a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s

Derivative financial instruments, continued

unrealized gain or loss is initially recorded as a component of other
comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the
forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the
unrealized gain or loss is reported in “other revenues from operations”
immediately. Prior to the January 1, 2001 adoption of SFAS No. 133, interest
rate swap agreements used to manage interest rate risk were not recorded at
fair value in the consolidated balance sheet.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell residential real estate loans to
hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of residential real estate
loans held for sale. Hedged residential real estate loans held for sale,
commitments to originate residential real estate loans to be held for sale, and
commitments to sell residential real estate loans are generally recorded in the
consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair market value. Prior to the
January 1, 2001 adoption of SFAS No. 133, residential real estate loans held
for sale and related commitments were carried at the lower of aggregate cost or
fair market value.

Derivative instruments, including financial futures commitments and
interest rate swap agreements, that do not satisfy the hedge accounting
requirements noted above are valued at fair value and are generally classified
as trading account assets or liabilities with resultant changes in fair value
being recognized in trading account and foreign exchange gains in the Company’s
consolidated statement of income.

Stock-based compensation

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company began recognizing expense for
stock-based compensation using the fair value method of accounting described in
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended. Under
SFAS No. 123, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the vesting
period of the stock-based grant based on the estimated grant date fair value of
the stock-based compensation that is expected to vest. Information on the
determination of the estimated value of stock options and stock purchase plan
rights used to calculate stock-based compensation expense under the provisions
of SFAS No. 123 is included in note 10.

The Company has chosen the retroactive restatement method described in
SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and
Disclosure,” which amended SFAS No. 123. As a result, financial information
for all prior periods presented have been restated to reflect the expense that
would have been recognized had the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 been
applied to all stock-based compensation granted to employees after January 1,
1995. The use of the retroactive restatement method resulted in the
restatement of previously reported balances of additional paid-in capital,
retained earnings and deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2000, previously
reported additional paid-in capital was increased by $69 million, retained
earnings were decreased by $55 million, and deferred tax assets were increased
by $14 million. As of December 31, 2001, previously reported additional
paid-in capital was increased by $99 million, retained earnings were decreased
by $80 million, and deferred tax assets were increased by $19 million. As of
December 31, 2002, previously reported additional paid-in capital was increased
by $135 million, retained earnings were decreased by $108 million, and deferred
tax assets were increased by $27 million.

Stock-based compensation, continued

Stock-based compensation expense is now included in salaries and employee
benefits expense and totaled $43 million in 2003, $41 million in 2002, and $32
million in 2001. After tax effect, stock-based compensation lowered 2003’s net
income by $32 million, diluted earnings per share by $.27, and basic earnings
per share by $.28. The impact of the Company’s decision to recognize expense
for stock-based compensation on previously reported net
income, basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for 2002 and

Income taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects
attributable to differences between the financial statement value of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and
laws.

Earnings per common share

Basic earnings per share exclude dilution and are computed by dividing income
available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding and common shares issuable under deferred compensation
arrangements during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue
common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the
issuance of common stock that then shared in earnings. Proceeds assumed to
have been received on such exercise or conversion are assumed to be used to
purchase shares of M&T common stock at the average market price during the
period, as required by the “treasury stock method” of accounting.

Treasury stock

Repurchases of shares of M&T common stock are recorded at cost as a reduction
of stockholders’ equity. Reissuances of shares of treasury stock are recorded
at average cost.

2. Acquisitions

On April 1, 2003, M&T completed the acquisition of Allfirst Financial Inc.
(“Allfirst”), a bank holding company headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, from
Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c. (“AIB”), Dublin, Ireland. Allfirst was merged with
and into M&T on that date. Allfirst Bank, Allfirst’s primary banking
subsidiary, was merged into Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T
Bank”), a wholly owned subsidiary of M&T, on that date. Allfirst Bank operated
269 banking offices in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and the District of
Columbia at the date of acquisition. The results of operations acquired in the
Allfirst transaction have been included in the Company’s financial results
since April 1, 2003. Acquired assets on April 1, 2003 totaled $16 billion,
including $10 billion of loans and leases, liabilities assumed aggregated $14
billion, including $11 billion of deposits, and $2 billion was added to
stockholders’ equity. AIB received 26,700,000 shares of M&T common stock
valued at $2 billion (based on the market value of M&T common stock at the time
the terms of the merger were agreed to and announced by M&T and AIB in
September 2002) and $886 million in cash in exchange for all outstanding
Allfirst common shares. See note 23 for further information on M&T’s
relationship with AIB.

The acquisition of Allfirst represented a major geographic expansion by
M&T and created a strong Mid-Atlantic banking franchise. Following the
acquisition, the Company offers a broad range of products and services through
its banking offices in six states and the District of Columbia. Management
expects that M&T will benefit from greater geographic diversity and the
benefits of scale associated with a larger company. As part of the purchase
price allocation at April 1, 2003, M&T recorded $1.8 billion of goodwill, $136
million of core deposit intangible and $64 million of other intangible assets.
The weighted-average amortization periods for newly acquired core deposit
intangible and other intangible assets were eight years and seven years,
respectively. Information regarding the allocation of goodwill recorded as a
result of the Allfirst acquisition to the Company’s reportable segments, as
well as the carrying amounts and amortization of core deposit and other
intangible assets, is provided in note 8.

On February 9, 2001, M&T completed the acquisition of Premier National
Bancorp, Inc. (“Premier”), a bank holding company headquartered in
Lagrangeville, New York. Following the merger, Premier National Bank,
Premier’s bank subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank. Premier National Bank
operated 34 banking offices in the mid-Hudson Valley region of New York State.
After application of the election, allocation, and proration procedures
contained in the merger agreement with Premier, M&T paid $171 million in cash
and issued 2,440,812 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for the Premier
shares outstanding at the time of acquisition. In addition, based on the
merger agreement and the exchange ratio provided therein, M&T converted
outstanding and unexercised stock options granted by Premier into options to
purchase 224,734 shares of M&T common stock. The purchase price was
approximately $347 million based on the cash paid to Premier shareholders, the
fair value of M&T common stock exchanged, and the estimated fair value of
Premier stock options converted into M&T stock options.

Acquired assets, loans and deposits of Premier on February 9, 2001 totaled
approximately $1.8 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The
transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and,
accordingly, operations acquired from Premier have been included in the
Company’s financial results since the acquisition date. In connection with the
acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $178 million of goodwill and
$32 million of core deposit intangible. The core deposit intangible is being
amortized over seven years using an accelerated

method. Through December 31, 2001, the goodwill was being amortized over
twenty years using the straight-line method.

The Company incurred merger expenses related to systems conversions and
other costs of integrating and conforming acquired operations with and into the
Company of approximately $60 million ($39 million net of applicable income
taxes) during 2003 and approximately $8 million ($5 million net of applicable
income taxes) during 2001. There were no significant similar expenses in 2002.
Expenses related to systems conversions and other costs of integration are
included in the consolidated statement of income for the years ended December
31, 2003 and 2001 as follows:

The expenses noted above consisted largely of professional services and

integration of operations; recruiting and other incentive compensation; initial
marketing and promotion expenses designed to introduce the Company to customers
of the acquired operations; travel and relocation costs; and printing, supplies
and other costs of commencing operations in new markets and offices.

Presented herein is certain unaudited pro forma information for 2003 as if
Allfirst had been acquired on January 1, 2003 and for 2002 as if Allfirst had
been acquired on January 1, 2002. These results combine the historical results
of Allfirst into the Company’s consolidated statement of income and, while
certain adjustments were made for the estimated impact of purchase accounting
adjustments and other acquisition-related activity, they are not necessarily
indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on the
indicated dates. In particular, expenses related to systems conversions and
other costs of integration are included in 2003 when such costs were incurred
and, additionally, the Company expects to achieve further operating cost
savings as a result of the acquisition which are not reflected in the pro forma
amounts presented. Further, pro forma net income amounts for the year ended
December 31, 2002 include $12,714,000 of expenses related to the fraudulent
foreign exchange trading activities announced by Allfirst on February 6, 2002.

Included
in the $22,370,000 of unrealized losses on investment securities
that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or
more are $15,381,000 of unrealized losses on five different preferred stock
issuances of government-sponsored entities with a cost basis of $112,857,000.
The Company concluded that the impairment of such securities as of December 31,
2003 was largely attributable to a temporary widening of rate of return spreads
associated with the securities required by market participants that resulted
from the recent financial reporting issues disclosed by those
government-sponsored entities. The investment ratings of the preferred stock
issuances were AA- at December 31, 2003. Such ratings have not been lowered
since the preferred stock was acquired by the Company. Furthermore, management
believes that the underlying government-directed business models, and therefore
the underlying economic performance associated with such business models, is
unchanged. Also included in the $22,370,000 noted above are $6,392,000 of
unrealized losses on thirteen different issuances of bank trust preferred
securities with a cost basis of $127,887,000. Periodic
distributions on each of those bank trust preferred securities varies based on
changes in interest rates. The decline in fair value of the securities is
largely due to a widening of interest spreads associated with the bank trust
preferred securities required by market participants. The Company concluded
that the impairment as of December 31, 2003 was temporary in nature because
management believes that all contractual amounts owed to the Company in
accordance with the terms of the bank trust preferred securities are
collectible and each of the securities continues to be investment grade. The
amortized cost basis of the trust preferred securities and their respective
investment ratings were as follows: $84,069,000 were rated A-; $15,602,000
were rated BBB+; and $28,216,000 were rated BBB. No securities comprising the
remainder of the impairments were individually significant and such impairments
were generally considered to be a function of the current interest rate
environment.

borrowings from various Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”), repurchase
agreements, governmental deposits and interest rate swap agreements.

Investment securities pledged by the Company to secure obligations whereby
the secured party is permitted by contract or custom to sell or repledge such
collateral totaled $580,265,000 at December 31, 2003. The pledged securities
are included in government issued or guaranteed mortgage-backed securities

At December 31, 2003, collateral accepted by the Company which by contract
or custom can be sold or repledged consisted of investment securities with a
fair value of $1,006,000 purchased under agreements to resell.

4. Loans and leases

Total gross loans and leases outstanding were comprised of the following:

One-to-four family residential mortgage loans held for sale were $723
million at December 31, 2003 and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2002.
One-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled
approximately $13.6 billion and $12.6 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. As of December 31, 2003, approximately $17 million of
one-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced for others had been sold
with recourse. Commercial mortgage loans serviced for others totaled
approximately $3.8 billion and $644 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. As of December 31, 2003 approximately $825 million of commercial
mortgage balances serviced for others had been sold with recourse in
conjunction with the Company’s participation in the Federal National Mortgage
Association (“FNMA”) Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (“DUS”) program,
which was acquired as part of the Allfirst transaction. At December 31, 2003,
the Company estimated that the recourse obligations described above were not
material to the Company’s consolidated financial position. There have been no
material losses incurred as a result of those recourse arrangements.

Nonperforming loans (loans on which interest was not being accrued or had
been renegotiated at below-market interest rates) totaled $240,292,000 at
December 31, 2003 and $215,290,000 at December 31, 2002. If nonaccrual and
renegotiated loans had been accruing interest at their originally contracted
terms, interest income on such loans would have amounted to $19,752,000 in 2003
and $17,555,000 in 2002. The actual amounts included in interest income during
2003 and 2002 on such loans were $5,312,000 and $6,483,000, respectively.

The recorded investment in loans considered impaired was $164,183,000 and
$164,497,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The recorded
investment in loans considered impaired for which there was a related valuation
allowance for impairment included in the allowance for credit losses and the
amount of such impairment allowance were $110,485,000 and $25,608,000,
respectively, at December 31, 2003 and $110,064,000 and $17,626,000,
respectively, at December 31, 2002. The recorded investment in loans
considered impaired for which there was no related valuation allowance for
impairment was $53,698,000 and $54,433,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The average recorded investment in impaired loans during 2003,
2002 and 2001 was $215,882,000, $143,118,000 and $116,841,000, respectively.
Interest income recognized on impaired loans totaled $5,664,000, $4,180,000 and
$3,310,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Borrowings by directors and certain officers of M&T and its banking
subsidiaries, and by associates of such persons, exclusive of loans aggregating
less than $60,000, amounted to $198,188,000 and $153,054,000 at December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2003, new borrowings by such persons
amounted to $91,977,000 (including borrowings of new directors or officers that
were outstanding at the time of their election) and repayments and other
reductions were $46,843,000.

At December 31, 2003, approximately $270 million of commercial mortgage
loans and $1.1 billion of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans were
pledged to secure outstanding borrowings.

During 2003 and 2002, provisions for impairment of $2,000,000 and
$32,450,000, respectively, were added to the valuation allowance because the
carrying value of certain strata of capitalized servicing assets exceeded
estimated fair value. There was no provision for impairment added to the
allowance for the year ended December 31, 2001. The estimated fair value of
capitalized servicing assets was approximately $161 million at December 31,
2003 and $115 million at December 31, 2002. In conjunction with the Allfirst
acquisition, the Company obtained capitalized servicing assets of approximately
$21 million, comprised primarily of commercial mortgage servicing rights. The
fair value of capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets was
estimated using discount rates ranging from 9.3% to 17.5% at December 31, 2003
and 8.6% to 16.2% at December 31, 2002, and contemporaneous prepayment
assumptions. The weighted-average discount rate was 11.6% and 9.6% at December
31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The estimated market value of capitalized
servicing rights may vary significantly in subsequent periods due to changing
interest rates and the effect thereof on prepayment speeds. An 18% discount
rate was used to estimate the fair value of capitalized commercial mortgage
servicing rights at December 31, 2003 with no prepayment assumptions because,
in general, the servicing agreements allow the Company to share in customer
loan prepayment fees and thereby recover the remaining carrying value of the
capitalized servicing rights associated with such loan. The Company’s ability
to realize the carrying value of capitalized commercial mortgage servicing
rights is more dependent on the borrowers’ abilities to repay the underlying
loans than on prepayments or changes in interest rates. Capitalized servicing
assets at December 31, 2003 included $129 million of capitalized residential
mortgage loan servicing rights, net of the valuation allowance for impairment,
and $22 million of capitalized commercial mortgage loan servicing rights. At
December 31, 2002 and 2001, capitalized servicing assets consisted
predominantly of capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing rights.

The key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of
capitalized servicing rights at December 31, 2003 and the sensitivity of such
value to changes in those assumptions are summarized in the table that follows.
Those calculated sensitivities are hypothetical and actual changes in the fair
value of capitalized servicing rights may differ significantly from the amounts
presented herein. The effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the
fair value of the servicing rights is calculated without changing any other
assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company ceased amortizing goodwill
associated with corporate acquisitions effective January 1, 2002. As
prescribed by SFAS No. 142, the following is a reconciliation of reported net
income and earnings per share and net income and earnings per share adjusted to
exclude the impact of amortization of goodwill for the year ended December 31,
2001:

The Company continues to amortize core deposit and other intangible assets
over the estimated life of each respective asset. Total amortizing intangible
assets were comprised of the following:

8. Goodwill and other intangible assets, continued

Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets was generally
computed using accelerated methods over original amortization periods of five
to ten years. The weighted-average original amortization period was
approximately eight years. The remaining weighted average amortization period
as of December 31, 2003 was approximately six years. Amortization expense for
core deposit and other intangible assets was $78,152,000, $51,484,000 and
$59,816,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Estimated amortization expense in future years for such intangible assets is

Also in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the Company
completed a transitional goodwill impairment test as of January 1, 2002 and
annual goodwill impairment tests as of October 1, 2002 and 2003. For purposes
of testing for impairment, the Company assigned all recorded goodwill to the
reporting units originally intended to benefit from past business combinations.
Goodwill was generally assigned based on the implied fair value of the
acquired goodwill applicable to the benefited reporting units at the time of
each respective acquisition. The implied fair value of the goodwill was
determined as the difference between the estimated incremental overall fair
value of the reporting unit and the estimated fair value of the net assets
assigned to the reporting unit as of each respective acquisition date. To test
for goodwill impairment at each evaluation date, the Company compared the
estimated fair value of each of its reporting units to their respective
carrying amounts and certain other assets and liabilities assigned to the
reporting unit, including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible
assets. The methodologies used to estimate fair values of reporting units as
of the acquisition dates and as of the evaluation dates were similar. For the
Company’s core customer relationship business reporting units, fair value was
estimated as the present value of the expected future cash flows of the
reporting unit. The Company’s non-relationship business reporting units were
individually analyzed and fair value was largely determined by comparisons to
market transactions for similar businesses. Based on the results of the
transitional and annual goodwill impairment tests, the Company concluded that
the amount of recorded goodwill was not impaired at the respective testing
dates.

The resulting goodwill from the Allfirst acquisition is not tax
deductible. A summary of goodwill assigned to each of the Company’s reportable
segments as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 for purposes of testing for
impairment is provided below:

The amounts and interest rates of short-term borrowings were as follows:

In general, federal funds purchased and short-term repurchase agreements
outstanding at December 31, 2003 matured within two days following year-end.
Other short-term borrowings included borrowings from the U.S. Treasury and
others having original maturities of one year or less. Other short-term
borrowings at December 31, 2003 and 2002 included a $500 million revolving
asset-backed structured borrowing with an unaffiliated conduit lender, which
was entered into in November 2002. Further information related to the
revolving asset-backed structured borrowing is provided in note 18. Other
short-term borrowings at December 31, 2002 included $750 million of borrowings
from the FHLB that matured in two days. There was no similar borrowing from
the FHLB at December 31, 2003.

The subordinated notes of M&T Bank are unsecured and are subordinate to
the claims of depositors and other creditors of M&T Bank. The subordinated
notes of M&T are unsecured and subordinate to the claims of general creditors
of M&T. The senior medium term notes were issued in 1997 and 1998 by Keystone
Financial Mid-Atlantic Funding Corp., now a wholly owned subsidiary of M&T that
was acquired in 2000. The notes provide for semi-annual interest payments at
fixed rates of interest and are guaranteed by M&T.

Long-term variable rate advances from the FHLB had contractual interest
rates that ranged from 1.10% to 1.22% at December 31, 2003 and from 1.38% to
1.80% at December 31, 2002. The weighted-average contractual interest rates
were 1.15% and 1.49% at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Long-term
fixed-rate advances from the FHLB had contractual interest rates ranging from
4.05% to 8.29% at December 31, 2003 and 2002. The weighted-average contractual
interest rates payable were 5.38% and 5.52% at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Advances from the FHLB mature at various dates through 2029 and
are secured by residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and
investment securities.

In 1997, M&T Capital Trust I (“Trust I”), M&T Capital Trust II (“Trust
II”), and M&T Capital Trust III (“Trust III”) issued $310 million of fixed rate
preferred capital securities. As a result of the Allfirst acquisition, M&T
assumed responsibility for $300 million of similar preferred capital securities
previously issued by special-purpose entities formed by Allfirst consisting of
$150 million of floating rate preferred capital securities issued by First
Maryland Capital I (“Trust IV”) in December 1996 and $150 million of floating
rate preferred capital securities issued by First Maryland Capital II (“Trust
V”) in January 1997. The distribution rates on the preferred capital
securities of Trust IV and Trust V adjust quarterly based on changes in the
three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and were 2.15% and 2.01%,
respectively, at December 31, 2003. Trust I, Trust II, Trust III, Trust IV and
Trust V are referred to herein collectively as the “Trusts.”

Other than the following payment terms (and the redemption terms described
below), the preferred capital securities issued by the Trusts (“Capital
Securities”) are substantially identical in all material respects:

The common securities of each Trust (“Common Securities”) are wholly owned
by M&T and are the only class of each Trust’s securities possessing general
voting powers. The Capital Securities represent preferred undivided interests
in the assets of the corresponding Trust. Under the Federal Reserve Board’s
current risk-based capital guidelines, the Capital Securities are includable in
the M&T’s Tier 1 capital.

The Junior Subordinated Debentures represent the sole assets of each Trust

subordinated debentures associated with preferred capital securities at
December 31, 2003 of Trust III, Trust IV, Trust V and of preferred capital
securities at December 31, 2002 of Trust III include the unamortized portions
of purchase accounting adjustments to reflect estimated fair value as of the
date of M&T’s acquisition of the common securities of each respective trust.
The interest rates payable on the Junior Subordinated Debentures of Trust IV
and Trust V were 2.15% and 2.01%, respectively, at December 31, 2003.

Holders of the Capital Securities receive preferential cumulative cash
distributions on each distribution date at the stated distribution rate unless
M&T exercises its right to extend the payment of interest on the Junior
Subordinated Debentures for up to ten semi-annual periods (in the case of Trust
I, Trust II and Trust III) or twenty quarterly periods (in the case of Trust IV
and Trust V), in which case payment of distributions on the respective Capital
Securities will be deferred for comparable periods. During an extended
interest period, M&T may not pay dividends or distributions on, or repurchase,
redeem or acquire any shares of its capital stock. The agreements governing
the Capital Securities, in the aggregate, provide a full, irrevocable and

unconditional guarantee by M&T of the payment of distributions on, the
redemption of, and any liquidation distribution with respect to the Capital
Securities. The obligations under such guarantee and the Capital Securities
are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all senior indebtedness of
M&T.

The Capital Securities will remain outstanding until the Junior
Subordinated Debentures are repaid at maturity, are redeemed prior to maturity
or are distributed in liquidation to the Trusts. The Capital Securities are
mandatorily redeemable in whole, but not in part, upon repayment at the stated
maturity dates of the Junior Subordinated Debentures or the earlier redemption
of the Junior Subordinated Debentures in whole upon the occurrence of one or
more events (“Events”) set forth in the indentures relating to the Capital
Securities, and in whole or in part at any time after the stated optional
redemption dates (January 15, 2007 in the case of Trust IV, February 1, 2007 in
the case of Trust I, Trust III and Trust V, and June 1, 2007 in the case of
Trust II) contemporaneously with the optional redemption of the related Junior
Subordinated Debentures in whole or in part. The Junior Subordinated
Debentures are redeemable prior to their stated maturity dates at M&T’s option
(i) on or after the stated optional redemption dates, in whole at any time or
in part from time to time, or (ii) in whole, but not in part, at any time
within 90 days following the occurrence and during the continuation of one or
more of the Events, in each case subject to possible regulatory approval. The
redemption price of the Capital Securities and the related Junior Subordinated
Debentures upon early redemption will be expressed as a percentage of the
liquidation amount plus accumulated but unpaid distributions. In the case of
Trust I, such percentage adjusts annually and ranges from 104.117% at February
1, 2007 to 100.412% for the annual period ending January 31, 2017, after which
the percentage is 100%, subject to a make-whole amount if the early redemption
occurs prior to February 1, 2007. In the case of Trust II, such percentage
adjusts annually and ranges from 104.139% at June 1, 2007 to 100.414% for the
annual period ending May 31, 2017, after which the percentage is 100%, subject
to a make-whole amount if the early redemption occurs prior to June 1, 2007. In
the case of Trust III, such percentage adjusts annually and ranges from
104.625% at February 1, 2007 to 100.463% for the annual period ending January
31, 2017, after which the percentage is 100%, subject to a make-whole amount if
the early redemption occurs prior to February 1, 2007. In the case of Trust IV
and Trust V, the redemption price upon early redemption will be equal to 100%
of the principal amount to be redeemed plus any accrued but unpaid
distributions to the redemption date.

As a result of the Allfirst acquisition, M&T also assumed responsibility
for $100 million of Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Subordinated Trust Enhanced
Securities (“SKATES”) that were issued by Allfirst Preferred Capital Trust
(“Allfirst Capital Trust”). Allfirst Capital Trust is a Delaware business
trust that was formed in June 1999 for the exclusive purposes of (i) issuing
the SKATES and common securities, (ii) purchasing Asset Preferred Securities
issued by Allfirst Preferred Asset Trust (“Allfirst Asset Trust”) and (iii)
engaging in only those other activities necessary or incidental thereto. M&T
holds 100% of the common securities of Allfirst Capital Trust. Allfirst Asset
Trust is a Delaware business trust that was formed in June 1999 for the
exclusive purposes of (i) issuing Asset Preferred Securities and common
securities, (ii) investing the gross proceeds of the Asset Preferred Securities
in junior subordinated debentures originally issued by Allfirst (and assumed by
M&T as part of its acquisition of Allfirst on April 1, 2003) and other
permitted investments and (iii) engaging in only those other activities
necessary or incidental thereto. M&T holds 100% of the common securities of
Allfirst Asset Trust and Allfirst Capital Trust holds 100% of the Asset
Preferred Securities of Allfirst Asset Trust. M&T currently has outstanding
$105.3 million aggregate liquidation amount Floating Rate Junior Subordinated
Debentures due July 15, 2029 that were originally issued by Allfirst and are
payable to Allfirst Asset Trust and that pay interest at a rate of 2.58% as of
December 31, 2003.

Distributions on the SKATES are non-cumulative. The distribution rate on
the SKATES and on the Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures is a rate
per annum of three month LIBOR plus 1.50% reset quarterly two business days
prior to the distribution dates of January 15, April 15, July 15, and October

each year. Distributions on the SKATES will be paid if, as and when Allfirst
Capital Trust has funds available for payment. The SKATES are subject to
mandatory redemption if the Asset Preferred Securities of Allfirst Asset Trust
are redeemed. Allfirst Asset Trust will redeem the Asset Preferred Securities
if the junior subordinated debentures of M&T held by Allfirst Asset Trust are
redeemed. M&T may redeem such junior subordinated debentures, in whole or in
part, at any time on or after July 15, 2009, subject to regulatory approval.
Allfirst Asset Trust will redeem the Asset Preferred Securities at par plus
accrued and unpaid distributions from the last distribution payment date. M&T
has guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, the payment in full of all
distributions and other payments on the SKATES and on the Asset Preferred
Securities to the extent that Allfirst Capital Trust and Allfirst Asset Trust,
respectively, have funds legally available. Under the Federal Reserve Board’s
current risk-based capital guidelines, the SKATES are includable in M&T’s Tier
I Capital.

As discussed in note 18, effective December 31, 2003 the Company applied
new accounting provisions promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) and removed the Trusts and Allfirst Asset Trust from the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Accordingly, at December 31, 2003, the
Company included the Junior Subordinated Debentures payable to the Trusts and
the Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures payable to the Allfirst Asset
Trust as long-term borrowings in its consolidated balance sheet. Prior to that
date the Company included the preferred capital securities of the Trusts and
the SKATES issued by Allfirst Capital Trust in its consolidated balance sheet
as long-term borrowings, with accumulated distributions on such securities
included in interest expense. That change in financial statement presentation
had no economic impact on the Company, had no material or substantive impact on
the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2003, and resulted in the Company recognizing $30 million in other
assets for its “investment” in the common securities of the trusts described
herein that will be concomitantly repaid to M&T by the respective trust from
the proceeds of M&T’s repayment of the junior subordinated debentures
associated with preferred capital securities described herein.

Stock option plans

M&T had two stock option plans at December 31, 2003. The 1983 Stock Option
Plan (“1983 Plan”) allowed the grant of stock options at prices which could not
be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant.
Except as described below, options granted under the 1983 Plan generally vest
over four years and are exercisable over terms not exceeding ten years and one
day from the date of grant. During 2001, the remaining shares available for
grant under the 1983 Plan were awarded. In 1999, the Company granted options
to substantially all employees who had not previously received awards under the
1983 Plan. The options granted under that award vested three years after the
grant date and are exercisable for a period of seven years thereafter.

dividend yields of 1.50% in 2003, 1.32% in 2002 and 1.52% in 2001 (representing
the approximate annualized cash dividend rate paid with respect to a share of
common stock at or near the grant date). Based on historical data and
projected employee turnover rates, the Company reduced the estimated value per
option by 10% to reflect an estimate of the probability of forfeiture prior to
vesting.

Stock purchase plan

The Company began offering a stock purchase plan to employees in 2002. The
stock purchase plan provides eligible employees of the Company with the right
to purchase shares of M&T common stock through accumulated payroll deductions.
Shares of M&T common stock will be issued at the end of an option period,
typically one year or six months. In connection with the employee stock
purchase plan, 1,000,000 shares of M&T common stock were authorized for
issuance, of which 82,483 shares have been issued.

Similar to the stock option plans, the Company used an option pricing
model to estimate the grant date present value of purchase rights under the
stock purchase plan. The estimated weighted-average value per right was $13.16
for 2003 and $12.47 for 2002, which were calculated using the following
weighted-average assumptions: a term of six months to one year (representing
the period between grant date and exercise date); a risk-free interest rate of
1.24% in 2003 and 1.62% in 2002 (representing the yield on a U.S. Treasury
security with a like term); expected volatility of 26% in 2003 and 24% in 2002;
and an estimated dividend yield of 1.41% in 2003 and 1.21% in 2002
(representing the approximate annualized cash dividend rate paid with respect
to a share of common stock at or near the grant date).

Deferred bonus plan

The Company provides a deferred bonus plan pursuant to which eligible employees
may elect to defer all or a portion of their current annual incentive
compensation awards and allocate such awards to several investment options,
including M&T common stock. Participants may elect the timing of distributions
from the plan. Such distributions are payable in cash with the exception of
balances allocated to M&T common stock which are distributable in the form of
M&T common stock. Shares of M&T common stock distributable pursuant to the
terms of the deferred bonus plan were 81,092 and 83,072 at December 31, 2003
and 2002, respectively. The obligation to issue shares is included in common
stock issuable in the consolidated balance sheet. In connection with the
deferred bonus plan, 150,000 shares of M&T common stock were authorized for
issuance, of which 54,828 shares have been issued.

Directors’ stock plan

The Company maintains a compensation plan for non-employee members of the
Company’s boards of directors and directors advisory councils that allows such
members to receive all or a portion of their compensation in shares of M&T
common stock. In connection with the directors’ stock plan, 100,000 shares of
M&T common stock were authorized for issuance, of which 50,827 shares have been
issued.

Through an acquisition, the Company assumed an obligation to issue shares
of M&T common stock related to a deferred directors compensation plan. Shares
of common stock issuable under such plan were 43,211 and 43,598 at December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. The obligation to issue shares is included in
common stock issuable in the consolidated balance sheet.

Management stock ownership program

Through an acquisition, M&T obtained loans that are secured by M&T common stock
purchased by former executives of the acquired entity. At December 31, 2003
and 2002, the loan amounts owed M&T were less than the fair value of the
financed stock purchased and totaled $4,578,000 and $4,601,000, respectively.
Such loans are classified as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in the
consolidated balance sheet. The amounts are due to M&T no later than October
5, 2010.

11. Pension plans and other postretirement benefits

The Company provides defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits
(including health care and life insurance benefits) to qualified retired
employees. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for all of its
plans.

Data relating to the funding position of the plans were as follows:

The Company has an unfunded supplemental pension plan for certain key
executives. The projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit
obligation included in the preceding data related to such plan was $40,502,000
and $40,500,000, respectively, as of December 31, 2003 and $21,981,000 and
$21,840,000, respectively, as of December 31, 2002.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans
was $550,313,000 and $270,184,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

As of December 31, 2003, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value
of plan assets for the pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in
excess of plan assets were $543,547,000 (including $40,500,000 related to the
unfunded supplemental pension plan) and $457,125,000,

respectively. As of December 31, 2002, only the unfunded supplemental pension
plan had an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets. The
amount of such accumulated benefit obligation was $21,840,000. At December 31,
2003, the Company recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment of
$20,423,000 that after applicable tax effect resulted in a reduction of
accumulated other comprehensive income of $12,458,000. There was no minimum
pension liability adjustment at December 31, 2002.

On April 1, 2003, pension and other benefit obligations were assumed as a
result of the acquisition of Allfirst. Initial liabilities and net costs were
determined using a 6.25% discount rate and other assumptions as noted above.

Weighted-average pension plan asset allocations based on the fair value of
such assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and target allocations for 2004, by
asset category, are as follows:

December 31

Target allocation

55-75

%

Debt securities

The expected long-term rate of return assumption as of each measurement
date was determined by taking into consideration asset allocations as of each
such date, historical returns on the types of assets held and current economic
factors. The Company’s investment policy for determining the asset allocation
targets was developed based on the desire to maximize total return while
placing a strong emphasis on preservation of capital. In general, it is hoped
that, in the aggregate, changes in the fair value of plan assets will be less
volatile than similar changes in appropriate market indices. Returns on
invested assets are periodically compared with target market indices for each
asset type to aid management in evaluating such returns.

Pension plan assets included common stock of M&T with a fair value of
$32,235,000 (7% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2003 and $26,021,000 (10%
of total plan assets) at December 31, 2002.

The Company makes contributions to its funded qualified pension plans as
required by government regulation or as deemed appropriate by management after
considering the fair value of plan assets, expected returns on such assets, and
the present value of benefit obligations of the plans. Subject to the impact
of actual events and circumstances that may occur in 2004, the Company does not
expect to make contributions to the funded qualified pension plans in 2004.
The Company’s contributions to the funded qualified pension plans were
$19,050,000 in 2002. There were no contributions to those plans in 2003. The
Company regularly funds the payment of benefit obligations for the supplemental
pension and postretirement benefit plans because such plans do not hold assets
for investment. Payments made by the Company for supplemental pension benefits
were $2,456,000 and $840,000 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Payments made by
the Company for postretirement benefits were $6,556,000 and $1,754,000 in 2003
and 2002, respectively.

For measurement of postretirement benefits, a 10% annual rate of increase
in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2004.
The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5% over 5 years and remain
constant thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant
effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. A one-percentage point
change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following

On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed into law
the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (“the
Act”). The Act provides for drug benefits under a new Medicare Part D program
and federal subsidies to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that
provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D.
On January 12, 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 106-1 that permits
plan sponsors to make a one-time election to defer recognition of the Act in a
sponsor’s postretirement benefit plan accounting until formal FASB guidance is
provided. The Company’s postretirement benefit plan does provide prescription
drug benefits. The Company has elected to defer the recognition of the
provisions of the Act until the FASB has issued formal guidance. Accordingly,
the accrued benefit liability and net postretirement benefits expense noted
herein do not reflect the effects of the Act on the Company’s postretirement
benefits plan. It is not possible to determine whether any guidance
subsequently issued by the FASB will result in any changes to the
postretirement benefit information presented herein.

The Company has a retirement savings plan (“Savings Plan”) that is a
defined contribution plan in which eligible employees of the Company may defer
up to 15% of qualified compensation via contributions to the plan. The Company
makes an employer matching contribution in an amount equal to 75% of an
employee’s contribution, up to 4.5% of the employee’s qualified compensation.
Employees’ accounts, including employee contributions, employer matching
contributions and accumulated earnings thereon, are at all times fully vested
and nonforfeitable. Employee benefits expense resulting from the Company’s
contributions to the Savings Plan totaled $14,929,000, $10,724,000 and
$10,103,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

12. Income taxes

The components of income tax expense (benefit) were as follows:

The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return reflecting
taxable income earned by all subsidiaries. In prior years, applicable federal
tax law allowed certain financial institutions the option of deducting as bad
debt expense for tax purposes amounts in excess of actual losses. In
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, such financial
institutions were not required to provide deferred income taxes on such excess.
Recapture of the excess tax bad debt reserve established under the previously
allowed method will result in taxable income if M&T Bank fails to maintain bank
status as defined in the Internal Revenue Code or charges are made to the
reserve for other than bad debt losses. At December 31, 2003, M&T Bank’s tax
bad debt reserve for which no federal income taxes have been provided was
$74,021,000. No actions are planned that would cause this reserve to become
wholly or partially taxable.

The portion of income taxes attributable to gains or losses on sales of
bank investment securities was an expense of $970,000 and $724,000 in 2003 and
2001, respectively, and a benefit of $221,000 in 2002. No alternative minimum
tax expense was recognized in 2003, 2002 or 2001.

Total income taxes differed from the amount computed by applying the
statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income as follows:

The Company engages in certain international activities consisting largely of
collecting Eurodollar deposits, engaging in foreign currency trading, providing
credit to support the international activities of domestic companies and
holding certain loans to foreign borrowers. Net assets identified with
international activities amounted to $228,741,000 and $6,258,000 at December
31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in such assets included
$215,580,000 of loans to foreign borrowers associated with business activities
obtained in the acquisition of Allfirst. Deposits at M&T Bank’s offshore
branch office were $2,209,451,000 and $1,160,716,000 at December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively. The Company uses such deposits to facilitate customer
demand and as an alternative to short-term borrowings when the costs of such
deposits seem reasonable.

17. Derivative financial instruments

The Company adopted SFAS No. 133, as amended, as of January 1, 2001. The
January 1, 2001 transition adjustment prescribed by SFAS No. 133 was not
material to the Company’s consolidated financial position or its results of
operations.

As part of managing interest rate risk, the Company has entered into
several interest rate swap agreements. The agreements modify the repricing
characteristics of certain portions of the Company’s portfolios of earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate swap agreements are
generally entered into with counterparties that meet established credit
standards and most contain collateral provisions protecting the at-risk party.
The Company considers the credit risk inherent in these contracts to be
negligible.

The Company designates interest rate swap agreements utilized in the
management of interest rate risk as either fair value hedges or cash flow
hedges as defined in SFAS No. 133. Fair value hedges are intended to protect
against exposure to changes in the fair value of designated assets or
liabilities. Cash flow hedges are intended to protect against the variability
in cash flows of designated assets or liabilities.

17.     Derivative financial instruments, continued

Information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest
rate risk management purposes summarized by type of financial instrument the
swap agreements were intended to hedge follows:

(a)

Under the terms of these agreements, the Company receives settlement
amounts at a fixed rate and pays at a variable rate.

(b)

Under the terms of these agreements, the Company receives settlement
amounts at a variable rate and pays at a fixed rate.

The estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements represents the
amount the Company would have expected to receive (pay) to terminate such
contracts. The estimated fair value of such swap agreements at December 31,
2003 and 2002 included gross unrealized gains of $3,896,000 and $8,103,000,
respectively, and gross unrealized losses of $4,743,000 and $1,032,000,
respectively. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the estimated fair values of
interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges were
substantially offset by unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in
the fair values of the hedged items. The estimated fair value of interest rate
swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges, net of applicable income taxes,
was included in “accumulated other comprehensive income, net” in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2002.

The net effect of interest rate swap agreements was to increase net
interest income by $17,327,000 in 2003, $8,822,000 in 2002 and $6,720,000 in
2001. The average notional amount of interest rate swap agreements impacting
net interest income which were entered into for interest rate risk management
purposes were $688,603,000 in 2003, $693,910,000 in 2002 and $522,730,000 in
2001. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness of both fair value and cash flow
hedges recognized in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was not material to the Company’s
results of operations.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell residential real estate loans to
hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of residential real estate
loans held for sale. Such commitments have been designated as fair value
hedges and, as a result, the commitments and the hedged loans are recorded at
estimated fair value. The Company also utilizes commitments to sell
residential real estate loans to offset the exposure to changes in the fair
value of certain commitments to originate residential real estate loans for
sale. As a result of these activities, at December 31, 2003 and 2002 net
unrealized pre-tax gains related to loans held for sale, commitments to
originate loans for sale, and commitments to sell loans were approximately $7
million and $15 million, respectively. Such unrealized gains are included in
mortgage banking revenues and, in general, are realized in subsequent periods
as the related loans are sold.

Derivative financial instruments used for trading purposes included
interest rate contracts, foreign exchange and other option contracts, foreign
exchange forward and spot contracts, and financial futures. Interest rate
contracts entered into for trading purposes had notional values and estimated
fair value gains of $5.3 billion and $9,977,000, respectively, at December 31,
2003 and notional values and estimated fair value gains of $1.3 billion and
$1,096,000, respectively, at December 31, 2002. Foreign exchange and other
option and futures contracts totaled approximately $548 million and $290
million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Such contracts were
valued at gains of $464,000 and $121,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Trading account assets and liabilities are recorded in the
consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair value. The following table

respectively.

18. Variable interest entities and asset securitizations

Variable interest entities

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46”),
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.” The FASB’s stated intent in
issuing FIN 46 was to clarify the application of Accounting Research Bulletin
No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements,” to certain entities in which
equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial
interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support from other
parties. FIN 46 requires an enterprise to consolidate a variable interest
entity (as defined in FIN 46) if that enterprise has a variable interest (or
combination of variable interests) that will absorb a majority of the entity’s
expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the entity’s expected
returns if they occur, or both. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised
FIN 46 (“FIN 46R”), which attempts to clarify the guidance in the original
interpretation. FIN 46 applies to variable interest entities created after
January 31, 2003. FIN 46 also applies to all variable interest entities created
prior to February 1, 2003 that are considered to be special-purpose entities
(as defined in FIN 46R) as of December 31, 2003. FIN 46R must be applied to
all variable interest entities no later than the end of the first reporting
period that ends after March 15, 2004. A description of variable interest
entities in which the Company holds a significant variable interest and the
impact of the new accounting provisions related to investments in variable
interest entities is described below.

M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC is a special purpose subsidiary of M&T Bank
formed for the purpose of borrowing $500 million in a revolving asset-backed
structured borrowing with an unaffiliated conduit lender. The revolving
asset-backed structured borrowing is secured by automobile loans and other
assets transferred to the special purpose subsidiary by M&T Bank or other of
its subsidiaries that totaled $559 million and $560 million at December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. The activities of M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC are
generally restricted to purchasing and owning automobile loans for the purpose
of securing this revolving borrowing arrangement. Proceeds from payments on
the automobile loans are required to be applied in priority order for fees,
principal and interest on the borrowing, and funding the monthly replenishment
of loans. Any remaining proceeds are available for distribution to M&T Bank.
The secured borrowing is prepayable, in whole or in part, at any time and is
non-recourse to M&T Bank and the Company. However, 80% of the borrowing can be
put back to M&T Bank upon demand. The Company’s maximum incremental exposure
to loss resulting from the structure of this borrowing arrangement is generally
restricted to the amount that such borrowing is overcollateralized. Management
currently estimates no material losses as a result of this borrowing
arrangement. The assets and liabilities of M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC have
been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements since November
2002 when the revolving structured borrowing arrangement was entered into.
Such accounting treatment did not change as a result of the new accounting
provisions for variable interest entities described above.

As part of the Allfirst transaction, M&T acquired a variable interest in a
trust that holds AIB American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) for the purpose of
satisfying options to purchase such shares granted by Allfirst to certain
employees. The trust purchased the AIB ADSs with the proceeds of a loan from

Variable interest entities, continued

Allfirst. The loan to the trust was assumed by M&T on the acquisition date.
Proceeds from option exercises and any dividends and other earnings on the
trust assets are used to repay the loan plus interest. Option holders have no
preferential right with respect to the trust assets and the trust assets are
subject to the claims of M&T’s creditors. The trust has been included in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements since April 1, 2003. As a result,
2,640,261 AIB ADSs with a carrying value of approximately $62 million were
included in investment securities available for sale at December 31, 2003.
Outstanding options granted to employees who have continued service with M&T
totaled 2,443,333 at December 31, 2003. All outstanding options were fully
vested and exercisable at December 31, 2003. The options expire at various
dates through June 2012. M&T’s maximum exposure to loss is $62 million at
December 31, 2003.

Prior to December 31, 2003, the Company included the Trusts and Allfirst
Capital Trust (see note 9) in its consolidated financial statements. As a
result of implementing the new accounting provisions for variable interest
entities, as of December 31, 2003 the Trusts and Allfirst Capital Trust were
removed from the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As a result, at
December 31, 2003, the Company included the Junior Subordinated Debentures
payable to the Trusts and the Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures
payable to the Allfirst Asset Trust as long-term borrowings in its consolidated
balance sheet. Prior to that date the Company included the preferred capital
securities of the Trusts and the Allfirst Capital Trust in its consolidated
balance sheet as long-term borrowings, with accumulated distributions on such
securities included in interest expense. That change in financial statement
presentation had no economic impact on the Company, had no material or
substantive impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2003, and resulted in the Company recognizing
$30 million in other assets for its “investment” in the common securities of
the Trusts and Allfirst Asset Trust that will be concomitantly repaid to M&T by
the respective trust from the proceeds of M&T’s repayment of the junior
subordinated debentures associated with preferred capital securities described
in note 9.

The Company facilitates certain customer borrowing arrangements by
providing credit support in the form of financial standby letters of credit.
Some of those customer borrowing arrangements utilize special purpose trusts.
In such cases, the trusts issue variable rate demand bonds and pass through the
resulting proceeds to the sponsoring customer that formed the trust. The
Company provides financial standby letters of credit to the trusts and may also
serve as remarketing agent and/or trustee in the arrangements. The Company
receives fees for each of those services, in addition to a structuring fee.
The Company’s maximum exposure to loss at December 31, 2003 as a result of its
involvement with these transactions is equal to the letter of credit amounts
totaling $1.3 billion, which approximates the amount of variable rate demand
bonds issued by the trusts. However, it is extremely unlikely that losses of
such magnitude will ever occur. The trusts referred to in this paragraph are
not included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Information
about the Company’s obligations under financial standby letters of credit and
other guarantees and indemnification contracts is presented in note 20.

The Company is a limited partner in various low-income housing investment
partnerships that collectively have approximately $250 million in
total assets. Those partnerships generally construct or acquire
properties to be used to provide housing to low-income individuals in
accordance with government guidelines. Such investments provide certain tax
credits and tax deductible losses to the partners. The partnership investments
also assist the Company in achieving its community reinvestment initiatives.

partner, there is no recourse to the Company by creditors of the partnerships.
However, the tax credits that result from the Company’s investments in such
partnerships are generally subject to a fifteen year recapture period should a
partnership fail to comply with the respective government regulations. At
December 31, 2003, the Company’s maximum exposure to loss of its investments in
such partnerships was $74 million, including $39 million of unfunded
commitments. Management currently estimates that no material losses are
probable as a result of the Company’s involvement with such entities. In
accordance with the new accounting provisions for variable interest entities,
the partnership entities are not included in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

Securitizations

In December 2003, the Company securitized approximately $441 million of
one-to-four family residential mortgage loans in a guaranteed mortgage
securitization with FNMA. The Company recognized no gain or loss on the
transaction as it retained all of the resulting securities and allocated $6
million of the carrying value of the loans to capitalized servicing assets.
All of the resulting securities were classified as investment securities
available for sale. The Company expects no credit-related losses on the
retained securities as a result of the guarantee by FNMA.

In November 2003, the Company transferred approximately $838 million of
one-to-four family residential mortgage loans to Manufacturers and Traders
Trust Company Mortgage Trust 2003-1 (“M&T 2003 Trust”), a qualified special
purpose trust, in a non-recourse securitization transaction. The Company
received $112 million in cash and retained approximately 87% of the resulting
securities in exchange for the loans. The Company realized a $1 million gain on
the transaction and allocated $715 million and $11 million of the carrying
value of the loans to the retained securities and to capitalized servicing
assets, respectively. All of the retained securities were classified as
investment securities available for sale.

In November 2002, the Company transferred approximately $1.1 billion of
one-to-four family residential mortgage loans to Manufacturers and Traders
Trust Company Mortgage Trust 2002-1 (“M&T 2002 Trust”), a qualified special
purpose trust, in a non-recourse securitization transaction similar to the
transaction described in the previous paragraph. The Company received $140
million in cash and retained approximately 88% of the resulting securities in
exchange for the loans. The Company realized a $5 million gain on the
transaction and allocated $977 million and $7 million of the carrying value of
the loans to the retained securities and to capitalized servicing assets,
respectively. All of the retained securities were classified as investment
securities available for sale.

As qualified special purpose trusts, neither M&T 2003 Trust nor M&T 2002
Trust are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Because
the transactions were non-recourse, the Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a
result of its association with the trusts is limited to realizing the carrying
value of the retained securities and servicing rights. The combined outstanding
principal amount of mortgage-backed securities issued by M&T 2003 Trust and M&T
2002 Trust at December 31, 2003 was $1.4 billion. The outstanding principal
amount of mortgage-backed securities issued by M&T 2002
Trust at December 31, 2002 was $1.1 billion. The principal amount of such
securities held by the Company was $1.2 billion and $937 million at December
31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, loans of the
trusts that were 30 or more days delinquent totaled $17 million and $11
million,

A summary of the fair values of retained subordinated interests resulting
from the Company’s residential mortgage loan securitization activities follows.
Although the estimated fair values of the retained subordinated interests were
obtained from independent pricing sources, the Company has modeled the
sensitivity of such fair values to changes in certain assumptions as summarized
in the table below. These calculated sensitivities are hypothetical and actual
changes in the fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented
herein. The effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair
values is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality,
changes in one factor may result in changes in another which may magnify or
counteract the sensitivities. The changes in assumptions are presumed to be
instantaneous. The hypothetical effect of adverse changes on the Company’s
retained capitalized servicing assets at December 31, 2003 is included in note
7.

The subordinated retained securities do not have pro rata participation in
loan principal prepayments for the first seven years of the securitization. The
assumed weighted-average discount rate is 168 basis points (hundredths of one
percent) higher than the weighted-average coupon of the underlying mortgage
loans at December 31, 2003.

19. Fair value of financial instruments

SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,” requires
disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments. Fair value is
generally defined as the price a willing buyer and a willing
seller would exchange for a financial instrument in other than a distressed
sale situation.

M&T BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements, continued

19. Fair value of financial instruments, continued

With the exception of marketable securities, certain off-balance sheet
financial instruments and one-to-four family residential mortgage loans
originated for sale, the Company’s financial instruments are not readily
marketable and market prices do not exist. The Company, in attempting to
comply with the provisions of SFAS No. 107, has not attempted to market its
financial instruments to potential buyers, if any exist. Since negotiated
prices in illiquid markets depend greatly upon the then present motivations of
the buyer and seller, it is reasonable to assume that actual sales prices could
vary widely from any estimate of fair value made without the benefit of
negotiations. Additionally, changes in market interest rates can dramatically
impact the value of financial instruments in a short period of time.

The estimated fair values of investments in readily marketable debt and
equity securities were calculated based on quoted market prices at the
respective year-end. In determining amounts to present for other financial
instruments, the Company generally used calculations based upon discounted cash
flows of the related financial instruments or assigned some other amount as
required by SFAS No. 107. Additional information about the assumptions and
calculations utilized is presented below.

The carrying amounts and calculated estimates for financial instrument
assets (liabilities) are presented in the following table.

M&T BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements, continued

19. Fair value of financial instruments, continued

The following assumptions and methods or calculations were used in determining
the disclosed value of financial instruments.

Cash and due from banks, money-market assets, short-term borrowings, accrued
interest receivable, accrued interest payable and trading account liabilities

Due to the nature of cash and due from banks and the near maturity of
money-market assets, short-term borrowings, accrued interest receivable,
accrued interest payable and trading account liabilities, the Company estimated
that the carrying amount of such instruments approximated estimated fair value.

Investment securities

Estimated fair values of investments in readily marketable debt and equity
securities were based on quoted market prices. Investment securities that were
not readily marketable were assigned amounts based on estimates provided by
brokers, discounted calculations of projected cash flows or, in the case of
other investment securities, which include capital stock of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, at an amount equal
to the carrying amount.

Loans and leases

In general, discount rates used to calculate values for loan products were
based on the Company’s pricing at the respective year end. A higher discount
rate was assumed with respect to estimated cash flows associated with
nonaccrual loans. The allowance for credit losses represents the Company’s
assessment of the overall level of credit losses inherent in the portfolio as
of the respective year end and may not be indicative of the credit-related
discount that a purchaser of the Company’s loans and leases would seek.

Deposits

SFAS No. 107 requires that the estimated fair value ascribed to
noninterest-bearing deposits, savings deposits and NOW accounts be established
at carrying value because of the customers’ ability to withdraw funds
immediately. Time deposit accounts are required to be revalued based upon
prevailing market interest rates for similar maturity instruments. As a
result, amounts assigned to time deposits were based on discounted cash flow
calculations using prevailing market interest rates for deposits with
comparable remaining terms to maturity.

The Company believes that deposit accounts have a value greater than that
prescribed by SFAS No. 107. The Company feels, however, that the value
associated with these deposits is greatly influenced by characteristics of the
buyer, such as the ability to reduce the costs of servicing the deposits and
deposit attrition which often occurs following an acquisition. Accordingly,
estimating the fair value of deposits with any degree of certainty is not
practical.

Long-term borrowings

The amounts assigned to long-term borrowings were based on quoted market
prices, when available, or were based on discounted cash flow calculations
using prevailing market interest rates for borrowings of similar terms.

19. Fair value of financial instruments, continued

Trading account assets and liabilities

Trading account assets and liabilities are carried in the consolidated balance
sheet at estimated fair value which, in general, is based on quoted market
prices. Trading account assets are included in money-market assets and totaled
$214,833,000 and $51,628,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Trading account liabilities are included in other liabilities and totaled
$137,665,000 and $34,834,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Commitments to originate real estate loans for sale and commitments to sell
real estate loans

As described in note 17, the Company enters into various commitments to
originate real estate loans for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans.
Such commitments are considered to be derivative financial instruments and,
therefore, are carried at estimated fair value on the consolidated balance
sheet. The estimated fair values of such commitments were generally calculated
based on quoted market prices for commitments to sell real estate loans to
certain government-sponsored entities and other parties.

Interest rate swap agreements used for interest rate risk management

The estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements used for interest
rate risk management represents the amount the Company would have expected to
receive or pay to terminate such agreements.

Other commitments and contingencies

As described in note 20, in the normal course of business, various commitments
and contingent liabilities are outstanding, such as loan commitments, credit
guarantees and letters of credit. The Company’s pricing of such financial
instruments is based largely on credit quality and relationship, probability of
funding and other requirements. Loan commitments often have fixed expiration
dates and contain termination and other clauses which provide for relief from
funding in the event of significant deterioration in the credit quality of the
customer. The rates and terms of the Company’s loan commitments, credit
guarantees and letters of credit are competitive with other financial
institutions operating in markets served by the Company. The Company believes
that the carrying amounts, which are included in other liabilities, are
reasonable estimates of the fair value of these financial instruments.

The Company does not believe that the estimated information presented
herein is representative of the earnings power or value of the Company. The
preceding analysis, which is inherently limited in depicting fair value, also
does not consider any value associated with existing customer relationships nor
the ability of the Company to create value through loan origination, deposit
gathering or fee generating activities.

Many of the estimates presented herein are based upon the use of highly
subjective information and assumptions and, accordingly, the results may not
be precise. Management believes that fair value estimates may not be
comparable between financial institutions due to the wide range of permitted
valuation techniques and numerous estimates which must be made. Furthermore,
since the disclosed fair value amounts were estimated as of the balance sheet
date, the amounts actually realized or paid upon maturity or settlement of the
various financial instruments could be significantly different.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers,
generally having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may
require payment of a fee. Standby and commercial letters of credit are
conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a
third party. Standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the
failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of the underlying
contract with the third party, whereas commercial letters of credit are issued
to facilitate commerce and typically result in the commitment being funded when
the underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and third party.
The credit risk associated with commitments to extend credit and standby and
commercial letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with
extending loans to customers and is subject to normal credit policies.
Collateral may be obtained based on management’s assessment of the customer’s
creditworthiness.

Financial guarantees and indemnification contracts are oftentimes similar
to standby letters of credit and include mandatory purchase agreements issued
to ensure that customer obligations are fulfilled, recourse obligations
associated with sold loans, and other guarantees of customer performance or
compliance with designated rules and regulations. Included in loans sold with
recourse are loans sold in conjunction with the Company’s involvement in
the FNMA DUS program. Under this program, the Company’s maximum credit risk
associated with loans sold with recourse is equal to one-third of each loan’s
original principal balance which, at December 31, 2003, totaled $825 million.

Since many loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and guarantees and
indemnification contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the
contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to hedge
exposure to changes in the fair value of real estate loans held for sale. Such
commitments are considered derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133 and
along with commitments to originate real estate loans to be held for sale and
hedged real estate loans held for sale are now generally recorded in the
consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair market value. Additional
information about such derivative financial instruments is included in note 17.

The Company occupies certain banking offices and uses certain equipment
under noncancellable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates over
the next 45 years. Minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating
leases are summarized in the following table:

The Company entered an agreement in 2003 with the Baltimore Ravens of the
National Football League whereby the Company obtained the naming rights to a
football stadium in Baltimore, Maryland for a fifteen year term. Under the
agreement, the Company paid $3 million in 2003 and is obligated to pay $3
million in 2004, $5 million per year from 2005 through 2013, and $6 million per
year from 2014 through 2017.

M&T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course of business to
various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary
damages are asserted. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, does
not anticipate that the aggregate ultimate liability, if any, arising out of
litigation pending against M&T or its subsidiaries will be material to the
Company’s consolidated financial position, but at the present time is not in a
position to determine whether such litigation will have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations in any future
reporting period.

21. Segment information

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures About Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information,” reportable segments have been
determined based upon the Company’s internal profitability reporting system,
which is organized by strategic business units. Certain strategic business
units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the
nature of the products and services, the type of customer and the distribution
of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are
Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio,
Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking.

The financial information of the Company’s segments has been compiled
utilizing the accounting policies described in note 1 with certain exceptions.
The more significant of these exceptions are described herein. The Company
allocates interest income or interest expense using a methodology that charges
users of funds (assets) interest expense and credits providers of funds
(liabilities) with income based on the maturity, prepayment and/or repricing
characteristics of the assets and liabilities. The net effect of this
allocation is recorded in the “All Other” category. A provision for credit
losses is allocated to segments in an amount based largely on actual net

-141-


M&T BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Financial Statements, continued

21. Segment information, continued

charge-offs incurred by the segment during the period plus or minus an amount
necessary to adjust the segment’s allowance for credit losses due to changes in
loan balances. In contrast, the level of the consolidated provision for credit
losses is determined using the methodologies described in note 1 to assess the
overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Indirect fixed and
variable expenses incurred by certain centralized support areas are allocated
to segments based on actual usage (for example, volume measurements) and other
criteria. Certain types of administrative expenses and bankwide expense
accruals (including amortization of goodwill and core deposit and other
intangible assets) are generally not allocated to segments. Income taxes are
allocated to segments based on the Company’s marginal statutory tax rate
adjusted for any tax-exempt income or non-deductible expenses. Equity is
allocated to the segments based on regulatory capital requirements and in
proportion to an assessment of the inherent risks associated with the business
of the segment (including interest, credit and operating risk).

The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling
segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial
accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to generally
accepted accounting principles. As a result, reported segment results are not
necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial
institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation
methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment
financial data. Information about the Company’s segments is presented in the
accompanying table.

The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products
and banking services to middle-market and large commercial customers, largely
within the markets the Company serves. Among the services provided by this
segment are commercial lending and leasing, letters of credit, deposit products
and cash management services. The Commercial Real Estate segment provides
credit services which are secured by various types of multifamily residential
and commercial real estate and deposit services to its customers. Activities of
this segment also include the origination, sales and servicing of commercial
real estate loans through the FNMA DUS program. The Discretionary Portfolio
segment includes securities, residential mortgage loans and other assets;
short-term and long-term borrowed funds; brokered certificates of deposit and
interest rate swap agreements related thereto; and offshore branch deposits.
This segment also provides services to commercial customers and consumers which
include foreign exchange, securities trading and municipal bond underwriting
and sales. The Residential Mortgage Banking
segment originates and services residential mortgage loans for consumers
and sells substantially all of those loans in the secondary market to investors
or to bank subsidiaries of M&T. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are
included in the Residential Mortgage Banking segment. The Retail Banking
segment offers a variety of services to consumers and small businesses through
several delivery channels that include traditional and “in-store” banking
offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and internet banking.
The “All Other” category includes other operating activities of the Company
that are not directly attributable to the reported segments as determined in
accordance with SFAS No. 131, the difference between the provision for credit
losses and the calculated provision allocated to the reportable segments,
goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from
acquisitions of financial institutions, the net impact of the Company’s
internal funds transfer pricing methodology, eliminations of transactions
between reportable segments, certain nonrecurring transactions, the residual

(a)  Net interest income is the difference between actual taxable-equivalent interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities by a segment and a funding charge (credit) based on the Company’s internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Segments are charged a cost to fund any assets (e.g. loans) and are paid a funding credit for any funds provided (e.g. deposits). The
taxable-equivalent adjustment aggregated $16,313,000 in 2003, $14,049,000 in 2002 and $17,513,000 in 2001 and is eliminated in “All Other” net interest income and income tax expense (benefit).

(b)  Including the impact in the “All Other” category of the merger-related expenses described in note 2.

(c)  During 2003, a strategic business unit which had previously been included in the “All Other” category was moved to the Commercial Banking segment for internal profitability reporting purposes. As a result, approximately $27 million of loans were transferred from the “All Other” category to the Commercial Banking segment. This strategic business unit contributed net losses of $12
million and $1 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Financial information for 2002 and 2001 has been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

The Company conducts substantially all of its operations in the United

result in revenues that exceed ten percent of consolidated total revenues.

22.     Regulatory matters

Payment of dividends by M&T’s banking subsidiaries is restricted by various
legal and regulatory limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T
are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current
year and the preceding two years. For purposes of this test, at December 31,
2003, approximately $695,873,000 was available for payment of dividends to M&T
from banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval.

Banking regulations prohibit extensions of credit by the subsidiary banks
to M&T unless appropriately secured by assets. Securities of affiliates are
not eligible as collateral for this purpose.

The bank subsidiaries are required to maintain noninterest-earning
reserves against certain deposit liabilities. During the maintenance periods
that included December 31, 2003 and 2002, cash and due from banks included a
daily average of $501,031,000 and $311,810,000, respectively, for such purpose.

Federal regulators have adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank
holding companies and banks. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by
regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on the Company’s
financial statements. Under the capital adequacy guidelines, the so-called
“Tier 1 capital” and “Total capital” as a percentage of risk-weighted assets
and certain off-balance sheet financial instruments must be at least 4% and 8%,
respectively. In addition to these risk-based measures, regulators also
require banking institutions that meet certain qualitative criteria to maintain
a minimum “leverage” ratio of “Tier 1 capital” to average total assets,
adjusted for goodwill and certain other items, of at least 3% to be considered
adequately capitalized. As of December 31, 2003, M&T and each of its banking
subsidiaries exceeded all applicable capital adequacy requirements. As of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, the most recent notifications from federal
regulators categorized each of M&T’s bank subsidiaries as well capitalized
under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be considered
well capitalized, a banking institution must maintain Tier 1 risk-based
capital, total risk-based capital and leverage ratios of at least 6%, 10% and
5%, respectively. Management is unaware of any conditions or events since the
latest notifications from federal regulators that have changed the capital
adequacy category of M&T’s bank subsidiaries.

23.     Relationship of M&T and AIB

As a result of M&T’s acquisition of Allfirst (see note 2), AIB acquired
approximately 22.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of M&T common stock on
April 1, 2003. While AIB maintains a significant ownership in M&T, the
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization by and among M&T, AIB and Allfirst
(“Reorganization Agreement”) includes several provisions related to the
corporate governance of M&T that provide AIB with representation on the M&T and
M&T Bank boards of directors and key board committees and certain protections
of its rights as a substantial M&T shareholder. In addition, AIB has rights
that will facilitate its ability to maintain its proportionate ownership
position in M&T.

23.     Relationship of M&T and AIB, continued

With respect to AIB’s right to have representation on the M&T and M&T Bank
boards of directors and key board committees, for as long as AIB holds at least
15% of M&T’s outstanding common stock, AIB is entitled to designate four
individuals, reasonably acceptable to M&T, on both the M&T and M&T Bank boards
of directors. In addition, one of the AIB designees to the M&T board of
directors will serve on each of the Executive, Nomination and Compensation, and
Audit committees. Also, as long as AIB holds at least 15% of M&T’s outstanding
common stock, neither the M&T nor the M&T Bank board of directors may consist
of more than 28 directors without the consent of the M&T directors designated
by AIB. AIB will continue to enjoy these rights if its holdings of M&T common
stock drop below 15%, but not below 12%, so long as AIB restores its ownership
percentage to 15% within one year. In the event that AIB holds at least 10%,
but less than 15%, of M&T’s outstanding common stock, AIB will be entitled to
designate at least two individuals on both the M&T and M&T Bank boards of
directors and, in the event that AIB holds at least 5%, but less than 10%, of
M&T’s outstanding common stock, AIB will be entitled to designate one
individual on both the M&T and M&T Bank boards of directors. M&T also has the
right to appoint one representative to the AIB board while AIB remains a
significant shareholder.

There are several other corporate governance provisions that serve to
protect AIB’s rights as a substantial M&T shareholder and are embodied in M&T’s
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which were both amended in connection
with the Allfirst acquisition to incorporate such provisions. These
protections include an effective consent right in connection with certain
actions by M&T, such as amending M&T’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws
in a manner inconsistent with AIB’s rights, engaging in activities not
permissible for a bank holding company or adopting any shareholder rights plan
or other measures intended to prevent or delay any transaction involving a
change in control of M&T. AIB has the right to limit, with the agreement of at
least one non-AIB designee on the M&T board of directors, other actions by M&T,
such as reducing M&T’s cash dividend policy such that the ratio of cash
dividends to net income is less than 15%, acquisitions and dispositions of
significant amounts of assets, and the appointment or election of the chairman
of the board of directors or the chief executive officer of M&T. The
protective provisions described above will cease to be applicable when AIB no
longer owns at least 15% of M&T outstanding common stock, calculated as
described in the Reorganization Agreement.

M&T assumed from Allfirst two floating rate notes payable to AIB. A $100
million floating rate note payable to AIB was repaid by M&T on June 3, 2003.
An additional $200 million floating rate note payable to AIB was repaid by M&T
on September 30, 2003. Interest expense related to the notes discussed above
aggregated $2 million 2003.
