Overview

The
Company is a global manufacturer and marketer of Dynamic Random Access Memory
(“DRAM”), Flash memory and CMOS image sensors. 
The Company has been in the DRAM business since 1980, and in recent
years it has been the second or third largest supplier of DRAM in the
world.  Flash memory and CMOS image
sensors have been added to the Company’s product portfolio in the last couple
of years.  The Company’s products are
used in a broad range of electronic devices, including personal computers, workstations,
servers, cell phones, digital still cameras, and other consumer and industrial
products.

The
Company’s products are offered in a wide variety of package and configuration
options, architectures, and performance characteristics tailored to meet
application and customer needs.  Individual
devices take advantage of the Company’s advanced silicon processing technology
and manufacturing expertise. The Company continually introduces new generations
of products that offer lower costs per megabit and improved performance
characteristics.

Products

Dynamic Random Access Memory
(“DRAM”)

DRAM products are high density,
low-cost-per-bit, random access memory devices that provide high-speed data
storage and retrieval.  DRAM products
constituted 92%, 96% and 95% of the Company’s net sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.  The Company offers DRAM
products with a variety of performance, pricing and other characteristics.  The Company’s DRAM products may be classified
as Core DRAM or Specialty memory.

Core DRAM

Core
DRAM consists of standardized, high-volume, products that are sold primarily
for use as main system memory in computers. 
With the development, introduction and acceptance in the marketplace of
new memory architectures, computer main memory has transitioned over time from
extended data out (“EDO”) DRAM to synchronous DRAM (“SDRAM”) and most recently
to Double Data Rate Synchronous DRAM (“DDR”) and DDR2.  As a result, the composition of the Company’s
Core DRAM products has also shifted over time. 
The Company’s Core DRAM products currently consist of DDR and DDR2.  EDO and SDRAM products are currently sold
primarily


for
use in applications other than computers, and are now classified as Specialty
memory.  DDR products constituted most of
the Company’s Core DRAM sales in 2004 and accounted for approximately 57%, 57%
and 20% of the Company’s net sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Next generation DDR2 products, which offer
increased performance characteristics such as greater clock frequency and
bandwidth, began shipping in 2004 and are expected to grow noticeably in 2005
as new applications designed to take advantage of their superior performance
are introduced.

In response to changes in the DRAM market, the
Company has broadened its Core DRAM product offerings in recent years.  The Company offers DDR products in 128 Meg,
256 Meg, 512 Meg and 1 Gig densities. 
The Company also offers 256 Meg and 512 Meg DDR2 products and has begun
sampling 1 Gig DDR2.  The Company offers
its DDR and DDR2 products in multiple configurations, speeds and package
types.  In 2004, most of the Company’s
Core DRAM products were 256 Meg density devices.  The Company expects 512 Meg devices to become
the predominant density by the end of 2005.

Specialty Memory

The Company’s Specialty memory products
include the Company’s legacy DRAM, pseudo-static RAM (“PSRAM”), mobile SDRAM
and reduced latency DRAM (“RLDRAM™”) products. 
Specialty memory products are generally targeted to applications with
specific performance characteristics and sold in lower volumes than Core DRAM
products.

Legacy DRAM

Legacy DRAM consists of SDRAM
and EDO products which are primarily used in consumer applications, such as
cell phones, handheld devices, computer peripherals and other communications
equipment.  SDRAM sales constituted 31%,
37% and 70% of the Company’s net sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
declining as personal computer manufacturers transitioned to DDR products.  The Company offers 64 Meg, 128 Meg, 256 Meg
and 512 Meg SDRAM products and 16 Meg and 64 Meg EDO products.

PSRAM

PSRAM products, marketed by the
Company under the name CellularRAM™, are DRAM products with an SRAM-like
interface.  PSRAM combines the minimal
power consumption of SRAM with a much lower cost-per-bit to create an
economical alternative to SRAM.  PSRAM
products are used primarily in cellular phone applications.  The Company offers PSRAM products in 16 Meg,
32 Meg, 64 Meg and 128 Meg densities. 
The Company began selling commercial volumes of PSRAM products in 2004
and sales are expected to increase significantly in 2005.

Mobile SDRAM

Mobile SDRAM products are specialty SDRAM memory devices designed for
applications that demand minimal power consumption, primarily handheld
electronic devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), smart phones,
GPS devices, and digital still cameras. 
The Company began selling commercial volumes of Mobile SDRAM products in
2004 and sales are expected to grow rapidly in 2005.

RLDRAM

RLDRAM products are low-latency
DRAM memory devices with high clock rates targeted at network
applications.  The Company began sampling
RLDRAM products in 2004 and expects to begin shipping commercial volumes in
2005.

Flash Memory

Flash
products are electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor devices that
retain memory content when power is turned off. 
Flash memory is used in networking applications, workstations, servers,
personal computers, and handheld electronic devices such as digital cellular
phones, digital still cameras and digital music players.  There are two primary types of flash memory:  NOR Flash and NAND Flash.  NOR Flash has a random access interface to data
that enables fast read speeds, making it ideal for storage of program code that
needs to be infrequently updated.  NAND
Flash only allows sequential access to data, which reduces read time for some
applications but offers faster erase and write times, higher density, and lower
cost per bit than NOR Flash.  In
addition, NAND Flash has significantly increased cycle endurance making it
ideal for mass-storage devices.

Through
2004, the Company’s commercial Flash memory offerings consisted solely of
NOR-based products.  The Company’s future
plans for Flash memory are focused on NAND Flash, which uses semiconductor
technology similar to DRAM.  The market
for NAND Flash products has grown rapidly and is expected to continue to grow
rapidly due to demand for removable and embedded storage devices.  Removable storage devices such as USB and
Flash memory cards are used with applications such as personal computers,
digital still cameras, MP3 players and mobile phones.  Embedded NAND-based storage devices are also
beginning to be utilized in mobile phones in addition to, or in lieu of,
NOR-based Flash storage.   The


Company has been developing NAND Flash
products and expects to begin shipping commercial volumes of its 2 Gig NAND
Flash products in 2005.

The
Company plans to leverage its DRAM product and process technologies to compete
in the NAND Flash memory market.  The
Company’s NAND Flash designs feature a small cell structure that enables higher
densities for demanding applications.  To
compete in the NAND Flash market, the Company must successfully introduce new
products, rapidly ramp production of products to commercial volumes and
manufacture products cost-efficiently.

Complementary Metal-Oxide
Semiconductor (“CMOS”) Image Sensors

CMOS
image sensors are semiconductor devices that capture and process images into
pictures or video for a variety of consumer and industrial applications.  The Company’s CMOS image sensors are used in
products such as cellular phone cameras, digital still cameras, pill cameras
for medical use, automotive and other emerging applications.  The Company offers image sensors in a range
of pixel resolutions from its VGA (video graphics array) products to its higher-end
3.1 megapixel products.  Image sensors
are sold either as individual components or combined with integrated circuitry
to create complete camera system-on-a-chip (“SOC”) solutions.  In 2004, the Company’s primary image sensor
product was a VGA SOC sensor.  The
Company began shipping commercial volumes of its higher resolution 1.3
megapixel, 2.0 megapixel and 3.1 megapixel image sensors in 2004.

The
Company’s CMOS image sensors incorporating its DigitalClarity™ technology have
many advantages over other CMOS image sensors and charge-coupled device (“CCD”)
sensors, which have dominated the image sensor market until recent periods.  Unlike CCD sensors, which rely on specialized
fabrication requiring dedicated, and costly manufacturing processes, CMOS image
sensors can be manufactured using standardized semiconductor processes
resulting in substantially lower costs. 
The Company’s low-leakage DRAM processes are particularly well suited
for the manufacture of CMOS image sensors. 
The Company’s CMOS image sensors employ an “active-pixel” design
architecture that enables them to achieve performance comparable to high-end
CCD devices and higher than competitor’s CMOS image sensors.  The Company’s CMOS image sensors consume
substantially less power than CCD devices, a critical advantage in the
battery-dependent portable device applications where most image sensors are
used.  The market for image sensors is
expected to increase significantly over the next several years due to the
growth forecasted for applications such as phone cameras and digital still
cameras.

Manufacturing

The
Company’s manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, Italy,
Japan, Puerto Rico, Scotland and Singapore. 
The Company’s manufacturing facilities operate 24 hours per day, 7 days
per week.

The
Company’s process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex,
involving a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly,
burn-in and final test.  Efficient
production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced
semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these
techniques across multiple facilities. 
The primary determinants of manufacturing cost are die size, number of
mask layers, number of fabrication steps and number of acceptable die produced
on each wafer.  Other factors that
contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size, cost and sophistication of
manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw
materials, labor productivity, package type and cleanliness of the
manufacturing environment.  The Company
is continuously enhancing production processes, reducing die sizes and
transitioning to higher density products. 
In 2004, the Company substantially completed the migration of its
manufacturing operations to its 110 nanometer (“nm”) line-width process
technology.  The Company expects to begin
transitioning its manufacturing operations to 95nm line-width process
technology in 2005.

Wafer
fabrication occurs in a highly controlled, clean environment to minimize dust
and other yield- and quality-limiting contaminants.  Despite stringent manufacturing controls,
dust particles, equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in
photomasks and circuit design marginalities or other problems cause wafers to
be scrapped or individual circuits to be nonfunctional.  Success of the Company’s manufacturing operations
depends largely on minimizing defects and thereby maximizing yield of
high-quality circuits.  In this regard,
the Company employs rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing,
screening and testing processes.  The
Company is able to recover many nonstandard devices by testing and grading them
to their highest level of functionality.

After
fabrication, silicon wafers are separated into individual die.  Functional die are sorted, connected to
external leads and encapsulated in plastic packages.  The Company assembles products in a variety
of packages, including TSOP (thin small outline package), TQFP (thin quad flat
package) and FBGA (fine pitch ball grid array). 
Each completed package is then inspected and tested.  The Company also sells semiconductor products
in unpackaged die form.  The Company
tests its products at various stages in the manufacturing process, performs
high temperature burn-in on finished products and conducts numerous quality
control inspections throughout the entire production flow.  In addition, the Company uses its proprietary


AMBYX™ line of intelligent test and burn-in
systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of DRAM die during the burn-in
process, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and
cost.

A
significant portion of the Company’s memory products are assembled into memory
modules for sale to customers.  Memory
modules consist of an array of memory components attached to printed circuit
boards (“PCBs”) that connect to computer systems or other electronic devices.  Memory components are attached to PCBs in a
soldering process performed by screen printing machines and high speed
automated pick and place machines. 
Completed modules are tested by custom equipment and visually inspected.

In
2004, the Company qualified its first product at its 300mm wafer fabrication
plant in Virginia.  The 512 Meg DDR
device was produced on the Company’s 110nm process technology and is the
industry’s first memory device in production to utilize copper interconnects.  The Company is ramping production at the
Virginia wafer fabrication facility.  As
of the end of 2004, production at the Virginia facility had not reached levels
necessary to achieve mature product yield and cost-efficient utilization of the
facility.  The Company is assessing which
of its other facilities will be converted to 300mm wafer fabrication and when
those facilities will be converted.

TECH Semiconductor Singapore Pte.
Ltd. (“TECH”)

TECH is a memory manufacturing joint venture
in Singapore among Micron Technology, Inc., the Singapore Economic Development
Board, Canon Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Company. 
TECH’s semiconductor manufacturing facilities use the Company’s product
and process technology.  Subject to
specific terms and conditions, the Company has agreed to purchase all of the
products manufactured by TECH.  TECH
supplied approximately 30%, 30% and 20% of the total megabits of memory
produced by the Company in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  The Company generally purchases semiconductor
memory products from TECH at prices determined quarterly, based on a discount
from average selling prices realized by the Company for the immediately
preceding fiscal quarter.  The Company
performs assembly and test services on product manufactured by TECH.  The Company also provides certain technology,
engineering and training to support TECH. 
All of these transactions with TECH are recognized as part of the net
cost of products purchased from TECH.

Availability of Raw Materials

The Company’s production
processes require raw materials that meet exacting standards, including several
that are customized for, or unique to, the Company.  The Company generally has multiple sources of
supply; however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering
certain raw materials that meet the Company’s standards.  Various factors could reduce the availability
of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, lead
frames, molding compound and other materials. 
In addition, any transportation problems could delay the Company’s
receipt of raw materials.  Although raw
materials shortages or transportation problems have not interrupted the
Company’s operations in the past, shortages may occur from time to time in the
future.  Also, lead times for the supply
of raw materials have been extended in the past.  If the Company’s supply of raw materials is
interrupted, or lead times are extended, results of operations could be
adversely affected.

Marketing and Customers

The
Company’s products are sold into computing and consumer, networking and telecommunications,
and imaging markets.  Approximately 75%
of the Company’s net sales for 2004 were to the computing market.  Sales to both Dell Computer Corporation and
Hewlett-Packard Company exceeded 10% of the Company’s net sales in 2004, 2003
and 2002, and aggregated 27%, 28% and 28% of the Company’s net sales in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

The
Company markets its semiconductor products primarily through its own direct
sales force.  The Company maintains
inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to
facilitate rapid delivery of product shipments. 
The Company’s products are also offered through independent sales
representatives, distributors and Crucial Technology, the Company’s web-based
customer direct sales division.  The
Company’s products are offered under the Micron, SpecTek and Crucial brand
names, and under other private labels. 
The Company maintains sales offices in all of its primary markets around
the world.  Independent sales
representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by the Company and
are compensated on a commission basis. 
The Company makes shipments against these orders directly to the
customer.  Distributors carry the
Company’s products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor
products, including competitors’ products.

Segmentation
of the DRAM market continues, with diverse memory needs being driven by the
different requirements of desktop and notebook personal computers, servers,
workstations, handheld devices, and communications, industrial and other
applications that demand specific memory solutions.  Many of the Company’s customers require a
thorough review or


qualification of semiconductor products,
which may take several months.  As the
Company further diversifies its product lines and reduces the die sizes of
existing memory products, more products become subject to qualification which
may delay volume introduction of specific devices by the Company.

Backlog

Volatile
industry conditions make customers reluctant to enter into long-term,
fixed-price contracts.  Accordingly, new
order volumes for the Company’s semiconductor products fluctuate significantly.  Orders are typically accepted with
acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at
the date of shipment.  Customers can
change delivery schedules or cancel orders without significant penalty.  For these reasons, the Company does not
believe that its order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable
indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period.

Product Warranty

Because
the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly
complex, it is possible that the Company may produce products that do not
comply with customer specifications, contain defects or are otherwise
incompatible with end uses.  In accordance with industry practice, the
Company generally provides a limited warranty that its products are in
compliance with Company specifications existing at the time of delivery. 
Under the Company’s general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain
failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to
repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect
to, amounts paid for such items.  Under certain circumstances the Company
may provide more extensive limited warranty coverage and general legal
principles may impose more extensive liability than that provided under the
Company’s general terms and conditions.

Competition

The
Company faces intense competition from a number of companies, including Elpida
Memory, Inc., Hynix Semiconductor Inc., Infineon Technologies AG and Samsung
Electronics Co., Ltd.  Additionally, the
Company faces competition from emerging companies in Taiwan and China who have
announced plans to significantly expand the scale of their operations.  Some of the Company’s competitors are large
corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand
downturns in the semiconductor markets in which the Company competes, invest in
technology and capitalize on growth opportunities.  The Company’s competitors seek to increase
silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in
their product designs.  These factors
have significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressure on
prices.

Historically,
various governments have provided economic assistance to international
competitors, which has enabled, or artificially supported, competitors’ production
of semiconductor memory, particularly DRAM. 
This factor may continue to affect the supply of DRAM and other
semiconductor products in future periods.

Research and Development

To
compete in the semiconductor memory industry, the Company must continue to
develop technologically advanced products and processes.  The Company believes that expansion of its
semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for
specific memory solutions.  The Company
has several product design centers around the world, the largest located at its
corporate headquarters in Boise, Idaho. 
In addition, the Company has a facility at its Boise site to develop
leading edge photolithography mask technology.

R&D
expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the
cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development,
and personnel costs.  Because of the lead
times necessary to manufacture the Company’s products, the Company typically
begins to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability
testing.  The Company deems development
of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested
for performance and reliability and is internally qualified for sale to
customers.  R&D expenses can vary
significantly depending on the timing of product qualification.  Product development costs are recorded as
R&D expense.  The Company’s R&D
expenses were $754.9 million, $656.4 million and $561.3 million in 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.


The
Company’s process technology R&D efforts are focused primarily on
development of 95nm and 78nm and smaller line-width process technologies, which
are designed to facilitate the Company’s transition to next generation
products.  Additional R&D efforts
include process development to support the Company’s 300mm wafer manufacturing,
CMOS image sensors, Flash memory, Specialty memory products including PSRAM and
RLDRAM and new memory manufacturing materials. 
Efforts toward the design and development of new products are
concentrated on the Company’s 512 Meg and 1 Gig DDR, DDR2 and DDR3 DRAM
products as well as NAND Flash memory, CMOS image sensors and Specialty memory
products.

International Sales

Sales
to customers outside the United States totaled $2.6 billion for 2004 and
included $863.7 million in sales to Europe, $559.8 million in sales to China,
$354.8 million in sales to Japan and $632.9 million in sales to the rest of the
Asia Pacific region, excluding China and Japan. 
International sales totaled $1.7 billion for 2003 and $1.4 billion for
2002.  (See “Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
Geographic Information.”)

Patents and Licenses

As
of September 2, 2004, the Company owned approximately 11,300 U.S. patents and
1,000 foreign patents.  In addition, the
Company has numerous U.S. and foreign patent applications pending.  The Company’s patents have terms expiring through
2023.

The
Company has a number of patent and intellectual property license
agreements.  Some of these license
agreements require the Company to make one time or periodic payments.  The Company may need to obtain additional
patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future.  The Company is unable to predict whether
these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms.

Employees

As
of September 2, 2004, the Company had approximately 17,900 employees, including
approximately 11,900 in the United States, 2,700 in Singapore, 1,700 in Italy,
1,100 in Japan and 300 in the United Kingdom. 
The Company’s employees in Italy are represented by labor organizations
that have entered into national and local labor contracts with the
Company.  The Company’s employment levels
can vary depending on market conditions and the level of the Company’s
production, research and product and process development.  Many of the Company’s employees are highly
skilled, and the Company’s continued success depends in part upon its ability
to attract and retain such employees. 
The loss of key Company personnel could have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.

Environmental Compliance

Government
regulations impose various environmental controls on discharges, emissions and
solid wastes from the Company’s manufacturing processes.  In 2004, the Company’s wafer fabrication
facilities continued to conform to the requirements of ISO 14001
certification.  To continue
certification, the Company met annual requirements in environmental policy,
compliance, planning, management, structure and responsibility, training,
communication, document control, operational control, emergency preparedness
and response, record keeping and management review.  While the Company has not experienced any
materially adverse effects on its operations from environmental regulations,
changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures,
modification of operations or other compliance actions.

Legal
Proceedings

On
August 28, 2000, the Company filed a complaint against Rambus, Inc. (“Rambus”)
in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware seeking monetary damages
and declaratory and injunctive relief. 
Among other things, the Company’s complaint (as amended) alleges
violation of federal antitrust laws, breach of contract, fraud, deceptive trade
practices, and negligent misrepresentation. 
The complaint also seeks a declaratory judgment (a) that certain Rambus
patents are not infringed by the Company, are invalid, and/or are unenforceable
(b) that the Company has an implied license to those patents and (c) that
Rambus is estopped from enforcing those patents against the Company.  On February 15, 2001, Rambus filed an answer
and counterclaim in Delaware denying that the Company is entitled to relief,
alleging infringement of the eight Rambus patents named in the Company’s
declaratory judgment claim, and seeking monetary damages and injunctive
relief.  A number of other suits are
currently pending in Europe alleging that certain of the Company’s SDRAM and
DDR SDRAM products infringe various of Rambus’ country counterparts to its
European patent 525 068, including:  on
September 1, 2000, Rambus filed suit against Micron Semiconductor (Deutschland)
GmbH in the District Court of Mannheim, Germany; on September 13, 2000, Rambus
filed suit against Micron Europe Limited in the High Court of Justice, Chancery
Division in London, England;  on
September 22, 2000, Rambus filed a complaint against the Company and Reptronic
(a distributor of the Company’s products) in Court of First Instance of Paris,
France; on September 29, 2000, the Company filed suit against Rambus in the
Civil Court of Milan, Italy, alleging invalidity and non-infringement.  In addition, on December 29, 2000, the
Company filed suit against Rambus in the Civil Court of Avezzano, Italy,
alleging invalidity and non-infringement of the Italian counterpart to European
patent 1 004 956.  On August 10, 2001,
Rambus filed suit against the Company and Assitec (an electronics retailer) in the
Civil Court of Pavia, Italy, alleging that certain DDR SDRAM products infringe
the Italian counterpart to European patent 1 022 642.  In the European suits against the Company,
Rambus is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief.  These lawsuits pertain to certain of the
Company’s SDRAM and DDR DRAM products, which account for a significant portion
of the Company’s net sales.

The Company is unable to predict the outcome
of these suits.

On
January 8, 2004, Motorola, Inc. (“Motorola”) filed suit against the Company in
the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas (Austin) alleging
infringement of ten Motorola patents.  On
March 15, 2004, the Company filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging
infringement of seventeen of the Company’s patents.  Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., a subsidiary
of Motorola (“Freescale”), was later added as a party with Motorola.  On March 30, 2004, the Company filed a
separate action against Motorola in the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Wisconsin (Madison) alleging infringement of six additional of the
Company’s patents, and the Company added a seventh patent in an amended
complaint filed on April 23, 2004.  On
June 10, 2004, the Wisconsin court granted Motorola’s motion to transfer the
case to Texas, and the two cases subsequently were consolidated.  These lawsuits pertain to certain of the
Company’s SDRAM and DDR DRAM products, which account for a significant portion
of the Company’s net sales.

The Company is unable to predict the outcome
of these suits.

A
court determination that the Company’s products or manufacturing processes
infringe the product or process intellectual property rights of others could
result in significant liability and/or require the Company to make material
changes to its products and/or manufacturing processes.  Any of the foregoing results could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or
financial condition.


On
June 17, 2002, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California seeking information
regarding an investigation by the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (the “DOJ”) into possible antitrust violations in the “Dynamic Random
Access Memory” or “DRAM” industry.  The
Company is cooperating fully and actively with the DOJ in its
investigation.  Subsequent to the
commencement of the DOJ investigation, a number of purported class action
lawsuits were filed against the Company and other DRAM suppliers.  Sixteen cases were filed between June 21,
2002, and September 19, 2002, in the following federal district courts:  one in the Southern District of New York,
five in the District of Idaho and ten in the Northern District of
California.  The foregoing federal
district court cases were transferred to the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California (San Francisco) for consolidated
proceedings.  On October 6, 2003, the
plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint.  The consolidated amended complaint purports
to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who purchased DRAM
directly from the various DRAM suppliers during the period from approximately
November 1, 2001 through at least June 30, 2002.  The consolidated amended complaint alleges
price-fixing in violation of the Sherman Act and seeks treble monetary damages,
costs, attorneys’ fees, and an injunction against the allegedly unlawful
conduct.  Eight additional cases were
filed between August 2, 2002, and March 11, 2003, in the following California
state superior courts:  five in San
Francisco County, one in Santa Clara County, one in Los Angeles County and one
in Humboldt County.  The foregoing
California state cases were transferred to San Francisco County Superior Court
for consolidated proceedings.  On October
15, 2003, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action
complaint.  The consolidated amended
complaint purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who
purchased DRAM indirectly from the various DRAM suppliers during the period
from November 1, 2001 through June 30, 2002. 
The consolidated amended complaint alleges violations of California’s
Cartwright Act and state unfair competition law and unjust enrichment and seeks
treble monetary damages, costs, attorneys’ fees, and an injunction against the
allegedly unlawful conduct.  On March 16,
2004, a related case was filed in state court in Salem, Massachusetts.  It purports to be on behalf of a class of
individuals and entities who indirectly purchased DRAM in Massachusetts between
November 1, 2001 and June 30, 2002.  The
complaint alleges unjust enrichment relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM
products and seeks an unspecified amount of restitution.  The case was removed to the Massachusetts
federal district court and transferred to the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California (San Francisco) for consolidated
proceedings.  However, a motion by the
plaintiff to remand the case to Massachusetts is still pending.  On May 25, 2004, a related case was filed in
state court in Collier County, Florida. 
It purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who
indirectly purchased DRAM in Florida and nineteen other states between November
1, 2001 and June 30, 2002.  The complaint
alleges violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act and
unjust enrichment relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM products and seeks
compensatory damages, costs, attorneys’ fees, and disgorgement or restitution.  On August 19, 2004, a related case was filed
in state court in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  It purports to be on behalf of a class of
individuals and entities who indirectly purchased DRAM in Massachusetts between
September 1, 2001 and June 30, 2002.  The
complaint alleges violations of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act
relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM products and seeks treble monetary
damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees.  On
September 29, 2004, a related case was filed in state court in Brooke County,
West Virginia.  It purports to be on
behalf of a class of individuals and entities who indirectly purchased DRAM in
West Virginia from at least 1999 through the filing of the complaint.  The complaint alleges violations of the West
Virginia Antitrust Act relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM products and
seeks treble monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees.  On October 4, 2004, a related case was filed
in state court in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.  It purports to be on behalf of a class of
individuals and entities who indirectly purchase DRAM and/or products
containing DRAM in North Carolina between at least 1999 and the filing of the
complaint.  The complaint alleges
violations of the North Carolina Statutes for Antitrust and Unfair Competition
relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM products and seeks actual damages,
treble damages, interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees.  On October 5, 2004, a related case was filed
in state court in Wayne County, Michigan. 
It purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who
indirectly purchase DRAM and/or products containing DRAM in Michigan from at
least 1999 through the filing of the complaint. 
The complaint alleges violations of the Michigan Antitrust Reform Act
relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM products and seeks treble monetary
damages, costs, interest, and attorneys’ fees. 
On October 6, 2004, a related case was filed in state court in Broward
County, Florida.  It purports to be on
behalf of a class of individuals and entities who indirectly purchase DRAM in
Florida from at least July 1999 through at least June of 2002.  The complaint alleges violations of Florida
Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act relating to the sale and pricing of
DRAM products and seeks monetary damages, restitution, costs, and attorneys’
fees.  Based upon the Company’s analysis
of the claims made and the nature of the DRAM industry, the Company believes
that class treatment of these cases is not appropriate and that any purported
injury alleged by plaintiffs would be more appropriately resolved on a
customer-by-customer basis.  The Company
is unable to predict the outcome of these suits.  A court determination against the Company
could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.

On
May 5, 2004, Rambus filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of
California (San Francisco County) against the Company and other DRAM suppliers.  The complaint alleges certain causes of
action under California state law including a conspiracy to restrict output and
fix prices on Rambus DRAM (“RDRAM”), a conspiracy to monopolize various
relevant markets, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage
relating to RDRAM, and unfair competition to


disadvantage RDRAM.  The complaint seeks treble damages, punitive
damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, and a permanent injunction enjoining the
defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint.  The Company is unable to predict the outcome
of the suit.  A court determination
against the Company could result in significant liability and could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or
financial condition.

Overview

The
Company is a global manufacturer and marketer of semiconductor memory devices,
principally DRAM and Flash, and CMOS image sensor devices.  Its products are used in a broad range of
electronic applications including personal computers, workstations, servers,
cell phones, digital still cameras, and other consumer and industrial products.  The Company’s customers are principally
original equipment manufacturers and memory module retailers located around the
globe.

The
markets for the Company’s products behave in a manner similar to commodity
markets as the products are generally standardized with selling prices that fluctuate
based on industry-wide relationships of supply and demand.  Enhancing operating results and strengthening
financial condition in these types of markets is likely dependent upon leading
the industry in low cost production, capital efficiency and return on research
and development investments. 
Historically, the semiconductor memory market has been subject to
subsidization, thereby leading to the entry of new competitors and, at times,
excess supply.

The
Company’s proprietary product and process technology allows sophisticated
semiconductor memory and imaging devices to be manufactured with progressively
smaller die sizes.  Historically, the
Company has been able to reduce the cost of its memory products by implementing
new product and process technologies. 
These new technologies enable the Company to produce more megabits of
memory on each wafer, primarily by reducing the size of the circuits
(“shrinking”) that make up each memory cell. 
In 2004, the Company introduced products featuring its 6F² Hypershrink™
array architecture technology that enables it to further increase megabits
produced per wafer.  This 6F² technology
reduces the size of memory cells approximately 20% from industry standard 8F²
products without significant additional investment in equipment.  The Company continually introduces new
generations of products that offer lower costs per megabit and improved
performance characteristics such as higher data transfer rates, reduced package
size per megabit and lower power consumption.

The Company has made substantial investments
in its manufacturing facilities in the United States, Europe and Asia.  A significant portion of semiconductor
manufacturing equipment is replaced every three to five years with more
advanced equipment to process leading edge technology and reduce cost per
part.  Because the Company owns most of
its manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of the Company’s operating
costs are fixed.  In general, these costs
do not vary with changes in the Company’s utilization of its manufacturing
capacity and, accordingly, margins fluctuate with utilization.  The Company must generate sufficient cash
flow from operations for reinvestment in manufacturing capability or obtain
external financing.  Historically, the
Company has accessed external markets to fund a portion of its cash
requirements.

Maximizing
returns from investments in research and development (“R&D”) is dependent
on developing process technology that effectively reduces production costs,
leveraging required investments across a substantial scale of production, and
designing new products that can be successfully brought to market.  The Company must invest heavily in R&D to
expand its product offering and enable development of leading-edge product and
process technologies.  The Company has
made significant R&D investments in recent periods to develop products that
will enable it to enter new markets.


In
recent years, approximately 80% of the Company’s products were sold into
computer and computer peripheral markets. 
The computing market for a number of decades has had an extremely high
growth rate.  As with any maturing
market, it is likely that future growth rates will more closely parallel
broader macroeconomic trends.

The
Company is strategically diversifying its business into semiconductor products
other than Core DRAM.  The Company’s
non-Core DRAM products include Specialty memory, Flash memory and CMOS image
sensors.  These products leverage the
Company’s competencies in semiconductor memory manufacturing and product and
process technology.  Non-Core DRAM
products are typically of lower density and are manufactured in lower volumes
than Core DRAM, and allow the Company to use prior generation processes and
equipment.  Unlike Core DRAM, these
products are typically used in electronic devices other than computers and in
many cases the Company can differentiate them from competitor’s products based
on performance characteristics.

Markets
for some of the Company’s non-DRAM products are expected to grow rapidly, in
particular the markets for NAND Flash and CMOS image sensors.  The Company believes that its product and
process technology and manufacturing competencies position it well to compete
in these markets.  Accordingly, the
Company plans to allocate an increasing portion of its manufacturing capacity
to these products in 2005.  Success in
these markets is dependent in part on the Company’s ability to timely develop
new products that are well received by customers and gain sufficient market
share.

Results of Operations

The
Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday
closest to August 31.  The Company’s
fiscal 2004 contained 53 weeks.

Net Sales

Net
sales for 2004 increased by 42% as compared to 2003 primarily due to a 20%
increase in megabits sold and a 16% increase in average per megabit selling
prices for the Company’s memory products as a result of generally improved
market conditions.  During 2004, the
Company increased its allocation of manufacturing capacity to Specialty memory
products, including pseudo-static RAM (“PSRAM”), CMOS image sensors and legacy
DRAM products.  The shift in product mix
contributed to the increase in average per megabit selling prices for 2004 as Specialty
memory products and legacy DRAM products on average had higher selling prices
per megabit than the Company’s Core DRAM products.  The Company’s overall megabit production for
2004 increased approximately 23% from 2003 primarily due to manufacturing
efficiencies.  The growth rate in megabit
production for 2004 was constrained in part by the allocation of wafers to CMOS
image sensors, Specialty memory products and legacy DRAM products which do not
require leading edge process technology and therefore inherently have a lower
production growth rate than the Company’s advanced Core DRAM products.  Megabit output per wafer is also lower for
Specialty memory and legacy DRAM products because of their relatively lower
density and greater complexity.  Further,
the Company’s diversification of product mix and prioritization of Specialty
memory products necessitated production changes to optimize long-term wafer
process efficiency that resulted in a temporary reduction of wafer output in
2004.  DDR products constituted 57% of
the Company’s net sales for both 2004 and 2003 and 20% of net sales in
2002.  For 2004, megabit production was
slightly higher than megabit sales. 
Finished goods inventories at the end of 2004 remained at relatively low
levels.

The
Company expects to achieve significant growth in megabit production during 2005
from manufacturing efficiencies and increased wafer output resulting from the
production ramp of its 300mm wafer fabrication facility.  Growth in future megabit production over the
next several quarters, however, is expected to be adversely affected by an
increased allocation of wafers to the manufacture of DDR2 products, which have
a relatively larger die size, CMOS image sensors, Specialty memory products and
Flash memory.


Net
sales for 2003 increased by 19% as compared to 2002, primarily due to a 44%
increase in megabits of memory sold. 
This increase was partially offset by a 17% decrease in average selling
prices in 2003 as compared to 2002 for the Company’s semiconductor memory
products.  Megabits produced increased
43% in 2003 as compared to 2002, principally due to manufacturing efficiencies.

Gross
Margin

The
Company’s reported gross margin percentage for 2004 increased to 30% from a
negative 1% for 2003 primarily due to the 16% increase in average per megabit
selling prices and reduced costs per megabit. 
In addition, compared to 2003, reported gross margin for 2004 benefited
from relatively higher margins on sales of products purchased from the
Company’s TECH joint venture.  The
Company reduced its overall average cost per megabit for 2004 as compared to
2003 through manufacturing efficiencies achieved by improving product yields
and continuing its transition to products utilizing 110nm process technology
and 6F² technology.  The Company’s 6F²
technology enables it to produce approximately 20% more potential die per wafer
than standard products, which use 8F² technology.  Per megabit cost reductions in the near term
will be limited by the effects of increased production of DDR2 products and
Specialty memory products but the Company expects that average selling prices
per megabit for these products will be higher than its primary DDR
product.  Per megabit cost reductions
will also be limited by higher costs associated with the limited volumes of
production at the Company’s 300mm manufacturing facility in Virginia.

The
Company’s reported gross margin for 2003 improved as compared to 2002,
primarily due to a decrease in per megabit manufacturing costs, partially
offset by the 17% decrease in average selling prices for the Company’s
semiconductor products and the net effects of inventory write-downs.  The Company was able to significantly reduce
per megabit manufacturing costs in 2003 through improvements in manufacturing
efficiencies.  During 2003, the Company
completed its migration to 130nm process technology and continued to transition
to 110nm technology.

Inventory write-downs:

The Company
records charges to cost of goods sold in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles to write down the carrying values of work in process and
finished goods inventories when they exceed their estimated market values.  The inventory write-downs reflect estimates
of future market pricing relative to the costs of production and inventory
carrying values and projected timing of product sales.  Many of the Company’s semiconductor
components have characteristics similar to commodities that are generally
standardized products with selling prices that fluctuate significantly based on
industry-wide relationships of supply and demand.  In recent years, a combination of global
economic conditions and a slowing growth rate in demand for personal computers,
coupled with worldwide increases in semiconductor production capacity, caused
significant declines in average selling prices for semiconductor
components.  In all quarters of fiscal
2002 and 2003, market values of products held in finished goods and work in
process inventories at a quarter end date were below the Company’s
manufacturing cost of these products and the Company recognized a charge to
cost of goods sold to write down the carrying value of inventories to their
estimated market values.  As such charges
are recorded in advance of when inventory subject to the write-down is sold,
gross margins in the period of sale are higher than they would be absent the
effect of the previous write-downs.  No
write-down was necessary for 2004 and, as of September 2, 2004, only a de
minimis amount of previous write-downs remains in ending inventory.  As a result, write-downs of inventories prior
to 2004 will not have a significant effect on operating results in future
periods.

The
following table sets forth adjusted gross margins absent the inventory
write-downs and the estimated effect of previous write-downs.  These write-downs may not be infrequent or
nonrecurring in nature but are a result of significant market-driven declines
in average selling prices.  The
presentation of these adjusted amounts vary from numbers presented in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to amounts
reported by other companies.  However,
the Company believes this information is significant to understanding the
Company’s gross margins and analyzing the Company’s gross margin trends.  This non-GAAP information is important to
analyzing the Company’s cost of goods sold since the effect of inventory
write-downs must be separated from the manufacturing cost component in order to
have a reasonable basis for understanding trends in cost of goods sold.  When evaluating performance and making
decisions on how to allocate Company resources, management uses this non-GAAP
data and believes investors should have access to similar data when making
their investment decisions.


“Inventory
write-downs” are calculated based on estimates of future market pricing
relative to the Company’s costs of production and inventory carrying values and
the projected timing of product sales. 
The reduction in cost of goods sold resulting from sales of written-down
inventory is reflected as the “Estimated effect of previous write-downs” in the
table above.  The estimated effect of
previous write-downs is calculated by computing cost of goods sold for each
applicable period as if no write-downs had been recorded and comparing it to
cost of goods sold as calculated in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.  In calculating
the estimated effect of previous write-downs, the Company uses the same
judgments and estimates that are used to calculate cost of goods sold.

TECH Semiconductor Singapore Pte. Ltd. (“TECH”):

The TECH joint venture supplied approximately 30%, 30% and 20% of the
total megabits of memory produced by the Company in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.  The Company generally
purchases memory products from TECH at prices determined quarterly, based on a
discount from average selling prices realized by the Company for the
immediately preceding quarter.  Depending
on market conditions, the gross margin from the sale of TECH products may be
higher or lower than the gross margin from the sale of products manufactured by
the Company’s wholly-owned operations. 
In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company realized higher gross margin
percentages on sales of TECH products than for products manufactured by its wholly-owned
operations.

Selling,
General and Administrative

Selling,
general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for 2004 were 7% lower than
for 2003 primarily due to lower costs associated with outstanding legal matters
and reduced depreciation costs, partially offset by higher levels of performance-based
compensation expense and other personnel costs. 
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for 2003 were
8% higher than for 2002 primarily due to higher costs associated with
outstanding legal matters.  SG&A
expenses for the first quarter of 2005 are expected to approximate $90 million.

Research
and Development

Research
and development (“R&D”) expenses vary primarily with the number of
development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new
product and process development, and personnel costs.  Because of the lead times necessary to
manufacture the Company’s products, the Company typically begins to process
wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing.  The Company deems development of a product
complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for
performance and reliability.  R&D
expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product
qualification.

R&D expenses for 2004 increased 15% from 2003 principally due to an
increase in development wafers processed during 2004 as the Company increased
its product diversification and ramped production at its 300mm wafer
fabrication facility, which primarily ran development wafers in 2004.  Higher R&D costs in 2004 also reflect a
higher level of expenses related to CMOS image sensors, Flash memory and
Specialty memory products.  R&D
expenses for 2003 increased 17% from 2002 primarily due to an increase in
development wafers processed as the Company expanded its product development
efforts and began ramping production of 300mm development wafers.  R&D expenses for the first quarter of
2005 are expected to approximate $175 million.

The
Company’s process technology R&D efforts are focused primarily on
development of 95nm, 78nm and smaller line-width process technologies, which
are designed to facilitate the Company’s transition to next generation
products.  Additional R&D efforts
include process development to support the Company’s 300mm wafer manufacturing,
CMOS image sensors, Flash memory, Specialty memory products including PSRAM and
reduced latency DRAM (“RLDRAM”) and new manufacturing materials.  Efforts toward the design and development of
new products are concentrated on the Company’s 512 Meg and 1 Gig DDR, DDR2 and
DDR3 DRAM products as well as NAND Flash memory, CMOS image sensors and
Specialty memory products.

Restructure
and Other Charges

In
the second quarter of 2003 the Company announced a plan to restructure its
operations.  The restructure plan
included the shutdown of the Company’s 200mm production line in Virginia, the
discontinuance of certain memory products, including SRAM and TCAM products,
and an approximate 10% reduction of the Company’s worldwide workforce.  In connection with the plan, the Company
recorded $109.2 million of restructure charges and additional
restructure-related charges of $7.1 million, which are included in cost of
goods sold for 2003.  The credit to
restructure in 2004 primarily reflects gains on sales of equipment associated
with operations shut down in the restructure. 
The generally higher equipment sales prices reflect improved market
conditions across the semiconductor industry. 
The Company has substantially completed the restructure plan.  As of August 28, 2003, the Company’s accounts
payable and accrued expenses included $3.1 million for remaining costs


accrued in connection with the restructure
plan.  Through September 2, 2004, the
Company had paid essentially all of the severance and other termination
benefits and other costs incurred in connection with the restructure plan.  The components of the restructure charge and
additional restructure related charges were as follows:

Other Operating Expense, Net

Other
operating expense for 2004 includes losses of $17.2 million from changes in
currency exchange rates.  Other operating
income for 2004 includes $7.2 million from the Commonwealth of Virginia for
meeting investment commitments at the Virginia wafer fabrication facility and
net gains of $3.9 million on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment.  Other operating expense for 2003 includes net
losses on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment of $41.5 million
and losses of $10.7 million from changes in currency exchange rates.  Other operating expense for 2003 is net of
$14.4 million in receipts from the U.S. government in connection with
anti-dumping tariffs.  Other operating
expense for 2002 includes net losses on write-downs and disposals of
semiconductor equipment of $27.3 million.

Income Taxes

Income
taxes for 2004, 2003 and 2002 primarily reflect taxes on the Company’s non-U.S.
operations.  U.S. operating results are
not expected to reflect an income tax provision, until such time as the Company
utilizes a substantial portion of its U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and
unused tax credits, as any such provision is substantially offset by a
corresponding reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance.  As of September 2, 2004, the Company had
aggregate U.S. tax net operating loss carryforwards of $2.8 billion and unused
U.S. tax credits of $106.7 million, which expire through 2024.  The Company also has unused state tax net
operating loss carryforwards of $1.7 billion for tax purposes which expire
through 2024 and unused state tax credits of $123.9 million for tax and financial
reporting purposes which expire through 2018.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The
Company’s liquidity is highly dependent on average selling prices for its
semiconductor memory products and the timing of capital expenditures, both of
which can vary significantly from period to period.  As of September 2, 2004, the Company had cash
and marketable investments totaling $1,231.0 million compared to $921.8 million
as of August 28, 2003.

Operating Activities:

For
2004, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,158.8 million primarily
reflecting improved average selling prices for semiconductor memory
products.  Cash generated from operations
in 2004 principally reflects the Company’s $157.2 million of income adjusted by
$1,217.5 million for non-cash depreciation and amortization expense partially
offset by a $160.5 million increase in inventories consisting primarily of work
in process inventories resulting from transitions in the Company’s product mix
and a $130.9 million increase in accounts receivable associated with the
Company’s higher level of sales.

Investing Activities:

For
2004, net cash used by investing activities was $1,312.7 million including
expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $1,080.7 million.  The Company believes that to develop new
product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating
efficiencies and maintain product quality, it must continue to invest in
manufacturing technology, facilities and capital equipment, research and
development, and product and process technology.  The Company expects 2005 capital spending to
approximate $1.5 billion.  As of
September 2, 2004, the Company had commitments extending into 2006 of
approximately $360 million for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment.


Financing Activities:

For
2004, net cash provided by financing activities was $69.7 million including
$450 million received from Intel Corporation (“Intel”).  Payments on equipment purchase contracts and
debt were $450.6 million for 2004.  In
2004, the Company received $101.1 million in net proceeds from the issuance of
notes payable and sales-leaseback transactions. 
In the first quarter of 2004, the Company paid $67.5 million to Toshiba
Corporation to redeem the 1.5 million shares of common stock issued in
connection with the acquisition of the Company’s Virginia facility from
Toshiba.

In
the first quarter of 2004, the Company received $450 million from Intel in
exchange for the issuance of stock rights exchangeable into approximately 33.9
million shares of the Company’s common stock. 
In conjunction with the issuance of the stock rights, the Company agreed
to achieve operational objectives through May 2005, including certain levels of
DDR2 production and 300mm wafer processing capacity.  In the event the Company fails to achieve
certain 2005 milestones and the Company’s common stock price is then below
Intel’s per share purchase price of $13.29, the Company could be obligated to
pay Intel amounts not to exceed $135 million, a substantial portion of which is
payable, at the Company’s election, in the Company’s common stock.

In
the second quarter of 2003, the Company issued $632.5 million of 2.5%
Convertible Subordinated Notes (the “Notes”). 
Holders of the Notes may convert all or some of their Notes at any time
prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into the
Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 84.8320 shares for each $1,000
principal amount of the Notes.  This
conversion rate is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $11.79 per
share.  The Company may redeem the Notes
at any time after February 6, 2006, at declining premiums to par.

Concurrent
with the issuance of the Notes, the Company purchased call spread options (the
“Call Spread Options”) covering 53.7 million shares of the Company’s common
stock, which is the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes in
full.  The Call Spread Options have a
lower strike price of $11.79, a higher strike price of $18.19, may be settled
at the Company’s option either in cash or net shares and expire on January 29,
2008.  Settlement of the Call Spread
Options in cash on January 29, 2008, would result in the Company receiving an
amount ranging from zero if the market price per share of the Company’s common
stock is at or below $11.79 to a maximum of $343.4 million if the market price
per share of the Company’s common stock is at or above $18.19.

During
the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company received $480.2 million from the
issuance of warrants to purchase 29.1 million shares of the Company’s common
stock.  The warrants entitle the holders
to exercise their warrants and purchase shares of Common Stock for $56.00 per
share (the “Exercise Price”) at any time through May 15, 2008 (the “Expiration
Date”).  Warrants exercised prior to the
Expiration Date will be settled on a “net share” basis, wherein investors
receive common stock equal to the difference between $56.00 and the average
closing sale price for the common shares over the 30 trading days immediately
preceding the Exercise Date.  At
expiration, the Company may elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis
or for cash, provided certain conditions are satisfied.  As of September 2, 2004, there have been no
exercises of warrants and all warrants issued remain outstanding.

Access
to capital markets has historically been important to the Company.  Depending on market conditions, the Company
may, from time to time, issue registered or unregistered securities to raise
capital to fund a portion of its operations.

Contractual Obligations:

The
following table summarizes the Company’s significant contractual obligations at
September 2, 2004, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the
Company’s liquidity and cash flows in future periods.

The obligations disclosed
above do not include contractual obligations recorded on the Company’s balance
sheet as current liabilities except for the current portion of long-term
debt.  The expected timing of payment
amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current
information.  Timing of payments and
actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods
or services, market prices or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some
obligations.


Purchase obligations include
all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum
quantity that meet any of the following criteria: (1) they are noncancelable,
(2) the Company would incur a penalty if the agreement was cancelled, or (3)
the Company must make specified minimum payments even if it does not take
delivery of the contracted products or services (“take-or-pay”).  If the obligation to purchase goods or
services is noncancelable, the entire value of the contract was included in the
above table.  If the obligation is
cancelable, but the Company would incur a penalty if cancelled, the dollar
amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation.  Contracted minimum amounts specified in
take-or-pay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent
the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment.

The Company has an agreement
with its TECH joint venture to purchase all of TECH’s output of semiconductor
memory components subject to specific terms and conditions.  As the purchase quantities are based on
qualified production output, the agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum
purchase quantity and therefore the Company did not include the agreement in
its purchase obligations.  In addition to
purchase quantities, the TECH purchase obligation fluctuates based on average
selling prices for semiconductor memory components which can change
significantly from period to period.  In
2004, the net cost of semiconductor components purchased from TECH was $453.8
million.

Recently Issued Accounting
Standards

In
December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a
revised Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities –
an interpretation of ARB No. 51,” which provides guidance on the identification
of and reporting for variable interest entities.  The Company adopted Interpretation No. 46 in
the third quarter of 2004.  Adoption of
Interpretation No. 46 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s
results of operations or financial condition.

Critical Accounting Policies

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related
disclosures.  Estimates and judgments are
based on historical experience, forecasted future events and various other
assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances.  Estimates and judgments
may vary under different assumptions or conditions.  The Company evaluates its estimates and
judgments on an ongoing basis. 
Management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the
portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and
require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments.

Contingencies:

The
Company is subject to the possibility of losses from various
contingencies.  Considerable judgment is
necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such
contingencies.  An accrual is made when
it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired
and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  The Company accrues a liability and charges
operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted
and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date.

Income taxes:

The Company is
required to estimate its provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately
payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world.  Estimates involve interpretations of
regulations and are inherently complex. 
Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not
be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year.  The Company is also required to evaluate the
realizability of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, which requires the assessment of the Company’s performance and other
relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with
respect to these deferred tax assets. 
Realizability of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company’s
ability to generate future taxable income.

Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the
lower of average cost or market value. 
Cost includes labor, material and overhead costs, including product and
process technology costs.  Determining
market value of inventories involves numerous judgments, including projecting
average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to
complete products in work in process inventories.  To project average selling prices and sales
volumes, the Company reviews recent sales volumes, existing customer orders,
current contract prices, industry analysis of supply and demand, seasonal
factors, general economic trends and other information.  When these analyses reflect estimated market
values below the Company’s manufacturing costs, the Company records a charge to
cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold.  Differences in forecasted average selling
prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in
significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product
inventories and accordingly the amount of write-down recorded.  Due to the volatile


nature of the semiconductor memory industry,
actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected
prices and volumes and, as a result, the timing of when product costs are
charged to operations can vary significantly.

U.S.
GAAP provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare
costs to market values.  The amount of
any inventory write-down can vary significantly depending on the determination
of inventory categories.  The Company’s
inventory has been categorized as semiconductor memory products or CMOS image
sensors.  The major characteristics the
Company considers in determining inventory categories are product type and
markets.

Product and process technology:

Costs
incurred to acquire product and process technology or to patent technology
developed by the Company are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis
over periods currently ranging up to 10 years. 
The Company capitalizes a portion of costs incurred based on its
analysis of historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents
filed.  Capitalized product and process
technology costs are amortized over the shorter of (i) the estimated useful
life of the technology, (ii) the patent term or (iii) the term of the
technology agreement.

Property, plant and equipment:

The Company reviews the carrying value of property, plant and equipment
for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future
cash flows expected to result from its use and/or disposition.  In cases where undiscounted expected future
cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized
equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair
value of the assets.  The estimation of
future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by the
Company, including, but not limited to, future use of the assets for Company
operations versus sale or disposal of the assets, future selling prices for the
Company’s products and future production and sales volumes.  In addition, judgment is required by the
Company in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are
separately performed.

Research and development:

Costs
related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are
expensed as research and development when incurred.  Determining when product development is
complete requires judgment by the Company. 
The Company deems development of a product complete once the product has
been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability.

Certain Factors

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in
this Form 10-K, the following are important factors which could cause actual
results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-
looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.

We have experienced dramatic declines in average selling
prices for our memory products which have adversely affected our business.

In
several recent years, we experienced annual decreases in per megabit average
selling prices for our semiconductor memory products including:  17% in 2003, 53% in 2002, 60% in 2001, 37% in
1999, 60% in 1998 and 75% in 1997.  At
times, average selling prices for our semiconductor products have been below
our costs.  If average selling prices for
our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per megabit costs, our
business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely
affected.

Increased worldwide DRAM production or lack of demand for
DRAM could lead to further declines in average selling prices for DRAM.

The
transition to smaller line-width process technologies and 300mm wafers in the
industry could, depending upon the rate of transition, lead to a significant
increase in the worldwide supply of DRAM. 
Increases in worldwide supply of DRAM also result from DRAM fab capacity
expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization or
reallocation of other semiconductor production to DRAM production.  Several of our competitors have announced
plans to increase production through construction of new facilities or
expansion of existing facilities. 
Increases in worldwide supply of DRAM, if not offset by increases in
demand, could lead to further declines in average selling prices for our
products and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations
or financial condition.


As the computer industry matures and the growth rate of
computers sold or growth rate of the amount of semiconductor memory included in
each computer decreases, sales of our semiconductor products could decrease.

We
are dependent on the computing market as most of the semiconductor products we
sell are used in computers, servers or peripheral products.  Approximately 75% of our sales of
semiconductor products for 2004 were to the computing market.  DRAMs are the most widely used semiconductor
memory components in computers.  In
recent years, the growth rate of computers sold has slowed or declined largely
due to the maturation of the computer industry. 
The reduction in the growth rate of computers sold or growth rate of the
average amount of semiconductor memory included in each computer could reduce
sales of our semiconductor products and our business, results of operations or
financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

We may be unable to reduce our per megabit manufacturing
costs at the same rate as we have in the past.

Historically,
we have decreased per megabit manufacturing costs through improvements in our
manufacturing processes, including reducing the die size of our existing
products.  In future periods, we may be
unable to reduce our per megabit manufacturing costs or reduce costs at
historical rates.  We manufacture
products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced
equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance.  Each generation of new products adds
complexity to the manufacturing process and the initial production of new
products is typically characterized by relatively high costs due to lower
product yields, reduced wafer throughput and less efficient use of assets.  Reduction of per megabit manufacturing costs
in future periods is dependent on our ability to:

•

successfully develop product and process
technology, including future transitions to 95nm and smaller line-width process
technologies;

•

ramp product and process technology
improvements rapidly and effectively to commercial volumes across facilities;

•

achieve acceptable levels of manufacturing
wafer output and yields, which may decrease as we implement more complex
technologies, including our transition to 300mm wafer processing; and

•

offset increases in per megabit manufacturing
costs resulting from shifts in product mix to CMOS image sensors, Specialty
memory products and Flash memory.

If we are unable to timely and efficiently convert our
manufacturing operations to 300mm wafer processing, our business, results of
operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

In 2004, we began ramping production of 300mm wafers at our wafer
fabrication facility in Virginia.  As of
the end of 2004, production at the Virginia facility had not reached levels
necessary to achieve mature product yield and cost-efficient utilization of the
facility.  Until such time that
production at the Virginia facility reaches mature product yields and
significant volume with regards to capacity utilization, it will adversely
affect our results of operations.  We are
assessing which of our other facilities will be converted to 300mm wafer
fabrication and when those facilities will be converted.   We may also experience disruptions in
manufacturing operations, reduced wafer output and reduced yields during our
conversion of other facilities to 300mm wafers.

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund
our operations and make adequate capital investments.

Our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of
semiconductor memory sold, average selling prices and per megabit manufacturing
costs.  To develop new product and
process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and
maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in
manufacturing technology, facilities and capital equipment, research and
development, and product and process technology.  In addition to cash provided by operations,
we have from time to time utilized external sources of financing.  Depending on general market and economic
conditions or other factors, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash
flows to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments or access
capital markets for funds on acceptable terms.

The semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive.

We face intense competition from a number of companies, including
Elpida Memory, Inc., Hynix Semiconductor Inc., Infineon Technologies AG and
Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. 
Additionally, we face competition from emerging companies in Taiwan and
China who have announced plans to significantly expand the scale of their
operations.  Some of our competitors are
large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to
withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets


in which we compete, invest in technology and
capitalize on growth opportunities.  Our
competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size
and minimize mask levels in their product designs.  These factors have significantly increased
worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices.

Historically, various governments have provided economic assistance to
international competitors, which has enabled, or artificially supported,
competitors’ production of semiconductor memory, particularly DRAM.  This factor may continue to increase the
supply of DRAM and other semiconductor products in future periods.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially
adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and
are reported in U.S. dollars.  Across our
multi-national operations there are transactions and balances denominated in
other currencies, primarily the Japanese yen and euro.  In the event that the U.S. dollar weakens
significantly compared to the Japanese yen or euro, reported results of
operations or financial condition will be adversely affected.

Current economic and political conditions may harm our
business.

Throughout most of the 1980s and 1990s, industry revenue for the DRAM
market grew at a much faster rate than the overall economy, driven by both
growth in sales of computers and the amount of memory included in each computer
sold.  In recent years, the DRAM market
has grown at a significantly slower rate as the computer industry has continued
to mature.  As a result, we expect that
trends in the DRAM and computer industries will more closely parallel broader
macroeconomic events and trends.  Global
economic conditions and the effects of military or terrorist actions may cause
significant disruptions to worldwide commerce. 
If these disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer
orders, a decrease in corporate spending on information technology or our
inability to effectively market, manufacture or ship our products, our
business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely
affected.  If, for any reason, we are
unable to access the capital markets over an extended period of time, we may be
unable to make property, plant and equipment expenditures, implement our
research and development efforts or fund our operations, which could materially
adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

If our TECH joint venture experiences financial difficulty,
or if our supply of semiconductor products from TECH is disrupted, our
business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially
adversely affected.

TECH supplied approximately 30% of our total megabits of memory
produced in 2004.  We have agreements to
purchase all of the products manufactured by TECH subject to specific terms and
conditions.  In recent periods, we have
realized higher margins on products purchased from TECH than products
manufactured by our wholly-owned facilities. 
Any reduction in supply could materially adversely affect our business,
results of operations or financial condition. 
As of September 2, 2004, we had intangible assets with a net book value
of $62.0 million relating to the supply arrangement to purchase product from
TECH.  In the event that our supply of
semiconductor products from TECH is reduced or eliminated, we may be required
to write off part or all of these assets and our revenues and results of
operations would be adversely affected.

If we are unable to respond to customer demand for
diversified semiconductor memory products or are unable to do so in a
cost-effective manner, we may lose market share and our business, results of
operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

In recent periods, the semiconductor memory market has become
increasingly segmented, with diverse memory needs being driven by the different
requirements of desktop and notebook computers, servers, workstations, handheld
devices, and communications, industrial and other applications that demand
specific memory solutions.  We offer
customers a variety of semiconductor memory products, including DDR, DDR2,
SDRAM, EDO, Flash and PSRAM.

We need to dedicate significant resources to product design and
development to respond to customer demand for the continued diversification of
semiconductor products.  If we are unable
to invest sufficient resources to meet the diverse memory needs of customers,
we may lose market share.  In addition,
as we diversify our product lines we may encounter difficulties penetrating
certain markets, particularly markets where we do not have existing
customers.  If we are unable to respond
to customer demand for market diversification in a cost-effective manner, our
business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially
adversely affected.


An adverse determination that our products or manufacturing
processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially
adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

As is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology
industries, from time to time, others have asserted, and may in the future
assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their
intellectual property rights.  We are
engaged in litigation with Rambus, Inc. (“Rambus”) relating to certain of
Rambus’ patents and certain of our claims and defenses.  On August 28, 2000, we filed a complaint
(amended) against Rambus in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware
seeking monetary damages and declaratory and injunctive relief.  Among other things, our amended complaint
alleges violation of federal antitrust laws, breach of contract, fraud,
deceptive trade practices, and negligent misrepresentation.  The complaint also seeks a declaratory judgment
(a) that certain Rambus patents are not infringed by us, are invalid, and/or
are unenforceable (b) that we have an implied license to those patents and (c)
that Rambus is estopped from enforcing those patents against us.  On February 15, 2001, Rambus filed an answer
and counterclaim in Delaware denying that we are entitled to relief, alleging
infringement of the eight Rambus patents named in our declaratory judgment
claim, and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief.  A number of other suits are currently pending
in Europe alleging that certain of our SDRAM and DDR SDRAM products infringe
various of Rambus’ country counterparts to its European patent 525 068,
including:  on September 1, 2000, Rambus
filed suit against Micron Semiconductor (Deutschland) GmbH in the District
Court of Mannheim, Germany; on September 13, 2000, Rambus filed suit against
Micron Europe Limited in the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division in
London, England;  on September 22, 2000,
Rambus filed a complaint against us and Reptronic (a distributor of our
products) in Court of First Instance of Paris, France; on September 29, 2000,
we filed suit against Rambus in the Civil Court of Milan, Italy, alleging
invalidity and non-infringement.  In
addition, on December 29, 2000, we filed suit against Rambus in the Civil Court
of Avezzano, Italy, alleging invalidity and non-infringement of the Italian
counterpart to European patent 1 004 956. 
On August 10, 2001, Rambus filed suit against us and Assitec (an
electronics retailer) in the Civil Court of Pavia, Italy, alleging that certain
DDR SDRAM products infringe the Italian counterpart to European patent 1 022
642.  In the European suits against us,
Rambus is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief.  We also are engaged in litigation with
Motorola, Inc. (“Motorola”) and Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., a subsidiary of
Motorola (“Freescale”), relating to certain of our patents and certain of
Freescale’s patents.  On January 8, 2004,
Motorola filed suit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Texas (Austin) alleging infringement of ten Motorola patents.  On March 15, 2004, we filed an answer and a
counterclaim alleging infringement of seventeen of our patents.  Freescale was later added as a party with Motorola.  On March 30, 2004, we filed a separate action
against Motorola in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Wisconsin (Madison) alleging infringement of six additional of our patents, and
we added a seventh patent in an amended complaint filed on April 23, 2004.  On June 10, 2004, the Wisconsin court granted
Motorola’s motion to transfer the case to Texas, and the two cases subsequently
were consolidated.  The above lawsuits
pertain to certain of our SDRAM and DDR DRAM products, which account for a
significant portion of our net sales.

We are unable to predict
the outcome of these suits.  A court
determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the
intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability
and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing
processes.  Any of the foregoing results
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

We have a number of patent and intellectual property license
agreements.  Some of these license
agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments.  We may need to obtain additional patent
licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future.  We are unable to predict whether these
license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms.

Allegations of antitrust violations.

On June 17, 2002, we received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California seeking information
regarding an investigation by the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (the “DOJ”) into possible antitrust violations in the “Dynamic Random
Access Memory” or “DRAM” industry.  We are cooperating fully and actively
with the DOJ in its investigation of the DRAM industry.

Subsequent to the commencement of the DOJ investigation, a number of
purported class action lawsuits were filed against us and other DRAM
suppliers.  Sixteen cases were filed between June 21, 2002, and September
19, 2002, in the following federal district courts:  one in the Southern
District of New York, five in the District of Idaho and ten in the Northern
District of California.  The foregoing federal district court cases
were transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California (San Francisco) for consolidated proceedings.  On October 6,
2003, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint. 
The consolidated amended complaint purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals
and entities who purchased DRAM directly from the various DRAM suppliers during
the period from approximately November 1, 2001 through at least June 30,
2002.  The consolidated amended complaint alleges price-fixing in
violation of the Sherman Act and seeks treble monetary damages, costs,
attorneys’ fees, and an injunction against the allegedly unlawful
conduct.  Eight additional cases were filed between August 2, 2002, and
March 11, 2003, in the following California state superior courts:  five
in San Francisco County, one in Santa Clara County, one in Los Angeles County
and one in Humboldt County.  Each of the California


state cases purports to be on behalf of a
class of individuals and entities who indirectly purchased DRAM during a
specified time period commencing December 1, 2001.  The complaints allege
violations of California’s Cartwright Act and state unfair competition law and
unjust enrichment and seek treble monetary damages, restitution, costs, attorneys’
fees, and an injunction against the allegedly unlawful conduct.  The
foregoing California state cases were transferred to San Francisco County
Superior Court for consolidated proceedings.  On October 15, 2003, the
plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint.  The
consolidated amended complaint purports to be on behalf of a class of
individuals and entities who purchased DRAM indirectly from the various DRAM
suppliers during the period from November 1, 2001 through June 30, 2002. 
The consolidated amended complaint alleges violations of California’s
Cartwright Act and state unfair competition law and unjust enrichment and seeks
treble monetary damages, costs, attorneys’ fees, and an injunction against the
allegedly unlawful conduct.  On March 16, 2004, a related case was filed
in state court in Salem, Massachusetts.  It purports to be on behalf of a
class of individuals and entities who indirectly purchased DRAM in
Massachusetts between November 1, 2001 and June 30, 2002.  The complaint
alleges unjust enrichment relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM products and
seeks an unspecified amount of restitution.  The case was removed to the
Massachusetts federal district court and transferred to the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of California (San Francisco) for consolidated
proceedings.  However, a motion by the
plaintiff to remand the case to Massachusetts is still pending.  On May 25, 2004, a related case was filed in
state court in Collier County, Florida. 
It purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who
indirectly purchased DRAM in Florida and nineteen other states between November
1, 2001 and June 30, 2002.  The complaint
alleges violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act and
unjust enrichment relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM products and seeks
compensatory damages, costs, attorneys’ fees, and disgorgement or
restitution.  On August 19, 2004, a
related case was filed in state court in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  It purports to be on behalf of a class of
individuals and entities who indirectly purchased DRAM in Massachusetts between
September 1, 2001 and June 30, 2002.  The
complaint alleges violations of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act
relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM products and seeks treble monetary
damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees.  On
September 29, 2004, a related case was filed in state court in Brooke County,
West Virginia.  It purports to be on
behalf of a class of individuals and entities who indirectly purchase DRAM in
West Virginia from at least 1999 through the filing of the complaint.  The complaint alleges violations of the West
Virginia Antitrust Act relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM products and
seeks treble monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees.  On October 4, 2004, a related case was filed
in state court in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.  It purports to be on behalf of a class of
individuals and entities who indirectly purchase DRAM and/or products containing
DRAM in North Carolina between at least 1999 and the filing of the
complaint.  The complaint alleges
violations of the North Carolina Statutes for Antitrust and Unfair Competition
relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM products and seeks actual damages,
treble damages, interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees.  On October 5, 2004, a related case was filed
in state court in Wayne County, Michigan. 
It purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who
indirectly purchase DRAM and /or products containing DRAM in Michigan from at
least 1999 through the filing of the complaint. 
The complaint alleges violations of the Michigan Antitrust Reform Act
relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM products and seeks treble monetary
damages, costs, interest, and attorneys’ fees. 
On October 6, 2004, a related case was filed in state court in Broward
County, Florida.  It purports to be on
behalf of a class of individuals and entities who indirectly purchase DRAM in
Florida from at least July 1999 through at least June of 2002.  The complaint alleges violations of Florida
Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act relating to the sale and pricing of
DRAM products and seeks monetary damages, restitution, costs, and attorneys’
fees.  We are unable to predict the
outcome of these suits.  Based upon our analysis of the claims made and
the nature of the DRAM industry, we believe that class treatment of these cases
is not appropriate and that any purported injury alleged by plaintiffs would be
more appropriately resolved on a customer-by-customer basis.  We can give
no assurance that final resolution of these civil suits will not result in
significant liability and will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial condition.

Allegations of anticompetitive conduct.

On May 5, 2004, Rambus filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the
State of California (San Francisco County) against us and other DRAM
suppliers.  The complaint alleges certain
causes of action under California state law including conspiracy to restrict
output and fix prices on Rambus DRAM (“RDRAM”), conspiracy to monopolize
various relevant markets, intentional interference with prospective economic
advantage relating to RDRAM, and unfair competition to disadvantage RDRAM.  The complaint seeks treble damages, punitive
damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, and a permanent injunction enjoining the
defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint.  We are unable to predict the outcome of the
suit.  A court determination against us
could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations or financial condition.


New product development may be unsuccessful.

We are developing new products that complement our traditional memory
products or leverage their underlying design or process technology.  We anticipate expending significant resources
for new semiconductor product development over the next several years.  There can be no assurance that our product
development efforts will be successful, that we will be able to
cost-effectively manufacture these new products, that we will be able to
successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these
products will recover costs of development efforts.

We face risks associated with our international sales and
operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

Sales to customers outside the United States approximated 59% of our
consolidated net sales for 2004.  In
addition, we have manufacturing operations in Italy, Japan, Puerto Rico,
Scotland and Singapore.  Our
international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:

•

currency exchange rate fluctuations,

•

export duties, changes to import and export
regulations, and restrictions on the transfer of funds,

•

political and economic instability,

•

problems with the transportation or delivery
of our products,

•

issues arising from cultural or language
differences and labor unrest,

•

longer payment cycles and greater difficulty
in collecting accounts receivable, and

•

compliance with trade and other laws in a
variety of jurisdictions.

These factors may materially adversely affect our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

If our manufacturing process is disrupted, our business,
results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely
affected.

We manufacture products using highly complex processes that require
technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve
yields and performance.  Difficulties in
the manufacturing process can reduce yields or disrupt production and may
increase our per megabit manufacturing costs. 
From time to time, we have experienced minor disruptions in our
manufacturing process as a result of power outages or equipment failures.  If production at a fabrication facility is
disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we
may be unable to meet our customers’ requirements and they may purchase
products from other suppliers.  This
could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of
revenues or damage to customer relationships, which could materially adversely
affect our business results of operations or financial condition.

Disruptions in our supply of raw materials could materially
adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards.  We generally have multiple sources of supply
for our raw materials.  However, only a
limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials
that meet our standards.  Various factors
could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers,
photomasks, chemicals, gases, lead frames and molding compound.  Shortages may occur from time to time in the
future.  In addition, any transportation
problems could delay our receipt of raw materials.  Lead times for the supply of raw materials
have been extended in the past.  If our
supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business,
results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely
affected.


If we fail to achieve certain milestones, we could be
obligated to pay Intel Corporation amounts up to $135 million.

In conjunction with the issuance of stock rights to Intel in September
2003, we agreed to achieve operational objectives through May 2005, including
certain levels of DDR2 production and 300mm wafer processing capacity.  If
we fail to achieve certain 2005 milestones and our common stock price is then
below Intel’s purchase price of $13.29, we could be obligated to pay Intel
amounts up to $135 million, a substantial portion of which is payable, at our
election, in our common stock.

Products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or
are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise
incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise
materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

Because the design and production process for semiconductor memory is
highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply
with customer specifications, contain defects or are otherwise incompatible
with end uses.  If, despite design
review, quality control and product qualification procedures, problems with
nonconforming, defective or incompatible products occur after we have shipped
such products, we could be adversely affected in the following ways:

•

we may replace product or otherwise
compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or
incompatible product, and

•

we may encounter adverse publicity, which
could cause a decrease in sales of our products.

We expect to make future acquisitions where advisable, which
involve numerous risks.

We expect to make future acquisitions where we believe it is advisable
to enhance shareholder value. 
Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:

•

increasing our exposure to changes in average
selling prices for semiconductor memory products,

•

difficulties in integrating the operations,
technologies and products of the acquired companies,

•

increasing capital expenditures to upgrade
and maintain facilities,

•

increasing debt to finance any acquisition,

•

diverting management’s attention from normal
daily operations,

•

managing larger operations and facilities and
employees in separate geographic areas, and

•

hiring and retaining key employees.

Mergers
and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky, and future
acquisitions may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations or financial condition.


Item
7A.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

Substantially
all of the Company’s investments are at fixed interest rates; therefore, the
fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest
rates.  The Company believes that the
market risk arising from its holdings of investments is minimal as the
Company’s investments generally mature within one year.

Substantially
all of the Company’s debt is at fixed interest rates; therefore, the fair value
of the debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates.  The estimated fair market value of the
Company’s debt approximated $1.2 billion as of September 2, 2004 and $1.3
billion as of August 28, 2003.  The
Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the “Swap”) that
effectively converted, beginning August 29, 2003, the 2.5% fixed interest rate
on the Company’s $632.5 million Convertible Subordinated Notes (the “Notes”) to
a variable interest rate based on the 3-month London Interbank Offering Rate
(“LIBOR”) less 65 basis points.  The Swap
qualifies as a fair-value hedge under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities.”  The
gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the Swap is expected to be
highly effective at offsetting the gain or loss from changes in the fair value
of the Notes attributable to changes in interest rates.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The functional currency for
substantially all of the Company’s operations is the U.S. dollar.  The Company held aggregate cash and other
assets in foreign currency valued at U.S. $118.9 million as of September 2,
2004, and U.S. $203.1 million as of August 28, 2003 (including deferred income
tax assets denominated in Japanese yen valued at U.S. $52.4 million as of
September 2, 2004, and U.S. $105.4 million as of August 28, 2003).  The Company also held aggregate foreign
currency liabilities valued at U.S. $403.6 million as of September 2, 2004, and
U.S. $513.2 million as of August 28, 2003 (including debt denominated in
Japanese yen valued at U.S. $113.1 million as of September 2, 2004, and U.S.
$170.5 million as of August 28, 2003). 
Foreign currency receivables and payables as of September 2, 2004, were
comprised primarily of Japanese yen, euros, Singapore dollars and British
pounds.  The Company estimates that,
based on its assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S.
dollar as of September 2, 2004, a 1% change in the exchange rate versus the
U.S. dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of approximately
$2 million for the Japanese yen and $1 million for the euro.

Significant
Accounting Policies

Basis of presentation:

Micron Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to
collectively as the “Company”) manufacture and market DRAMs, Flash memory, CMOS
image sensors and other semiconductor components.  The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries.  All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

The
Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday
closest to August 31.  The Company’s
fiscal year 2004, which ended on September 2, 2004, contained 53 weeks and its
first quarter of fiscal 2004 contained 14 weeks.  Fiscal years 2003 and 2002 each contained 52
weeks and ended on August 28, 2003, and August 29, 2002, respectively.  All period references are to the Company’s
fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated.

Reclassifications:

Certain
reclassifications have been made, none of which affected results of operations,
to present the financial statements on a consistent basis.

Use of estimates:

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures.  Estimates and judgments are based on
historical experience, forecasted future events and various other assumptions
that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Estimates and judgments may differ under
different assumptions or conditions.  The
Company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.  Actual results could differ from estimates.

Certain concentrations:

Approximately 75% of the Company’s net sales for 2004 were to the
computing market.  Sales to one customer
were 14.1 %, 14.9% and 16.5% of the Company’s net sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.  Sales to another customer
were 13.2%, 13.2% and 12.0% of the Company’s net sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.  Certain components used by
the Company in manufacturing semiconductor products are available from a
limited number of suppliers.

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of cash, investment securities and trade accounts
receivable.  The Company invests through
high-credit-quality financial institutions and, by policy, limits the
concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single
obligor.  A concentration of credit risk
may exist with respect to trade receivables as a substantial portion of the
Company’s customers are affiliated with the computing industry.  The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of customers worldwide and generally does not require collateral
from its customers.  Historically, the
Company has not experienced significant losses on receivables.

Product warranty:

The
Company generally provides a limited warranty that its products are in
compliance with Company specifications existing at the time of delivery. 
Under the Company’s general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain
failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to
repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect
to, amounts paid for such items.  Under certain circumstances, the Company
may provide more extensive limited warranty coverage and general legal
principles may impose upon the Company more extensive liability than that
provided under the Company’s general terms and conditions.  The Company’s warranty obligations are not
material.

Revenue recognition:

The Company recognizes revenue when
persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the
price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.  Because of frequent changes in market prices
for the Company’s products, sales made under agreements allowing pricing
protection or rights of return (other than for product warranty) are deferred
until customers have sold the product.

Advertising:

Advertising costs are charged
to operations as incurred.  The Company
incurred $5.2 million, $11.1 million and $13.6 million of advertising costs in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Research and development:

Costs
related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are
expensed as research and development as incurred.  Determining when product development is
complete requires judgment by the Company. 
The Company deems development of a product complete once the product has
been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability.  Subsequent to product qualification, product
costs are valued in inventory.


Segment information:

The Company has determined,
based on the nature of its operations and products offered to customers, that
its only reportable segment is Semiconductor Operations.  The Semiconductor Operations segment’s
primary product is DRAM.

Stock-based compensation:

Employee stock plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method
prescribed by APB No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.”  The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option
valuation model to value stock options for pro forma presentation of income and
per share data as if the fair value-based accounting method in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” had been used to account for stock-based compensation.  The following presents the Black-Scholes
based pro forma loss and per share data:

Stock-based
employee compensation expense in the above presentation does not reflect a
benefit for income taxes, which is consistent with the Company’s treatment of
income or loss from its U.S. operations. 
(See “Income Taxes” note.)

Functional currency:

The
U.S. dollar is the Company’s functional currency for substantially all of its
operations.

Earnings per share:

Basic earnings
per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares and
stock rights outstanding.  Diluted
earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding plus the dilutive effects of stock options, warrants and
convertible notes.  Potential common
shares that would increase earnings per share amounts or decrease loss per
share amounts are antidilutive and are, therefore, excluded from earnings per
share calculations.  Basic and diluted
earnings per share computations reflect the effect of accretion of, and fair
value adjustment to, redeemable common stock.

Financial instruments:

Cash
equivalents include highly liquid short-term investments with original
maturities of three months or less, readily convertible to known amounts of
cash.  Investments with original
maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one
year are classified as short-term investments. 
Investments with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified
as other noncurrent assets.  Securities
classified as available-for-sale are stated at market value.  The carrying value of investment securities
sold is determined using the specific identification method.

The
amounts reported as cash and equivalents, short-term investments, receivables,
other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and equipment purchase
contracts approximate their fair values. 
The estimated fair value of the Company’s debt as of September 2, 2004,
and August 28, 2003, was $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.  The fair value estimates presented herein
were based on market interest rates and other market information available to
management as of each balance sheet date presented.  The use of different market assumptions and/or
estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair
value amounts.  The approximate fair
values do not take into consideration expenses that could be incurred in an
actual settlement.


Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the
lower of average cost or market value. 
Cost includes labor, material and overhead costs, including product and
process technology costs.  Determining
market value of inventories involves numerous judgments, including projecting
average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to
complete products in work in process inventories.  As a result of these analyses, when market
values are below the Company’s costs, the Company records a charge to cost of
goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold.

Product and process technology:

Costs
incurred to acquire product and process technology or to patent technology
developed by the Company are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis
over periods currently ranging up to 10 years. 
The Company capitalizes a portion of costs incurred based on its
analysis of historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents
filed.  Capitalized product and process
technology costs are amortized over the shorter of (i) the estimated useful
life of the technology, (ii) the patent term or (iii) the term of the
technology agreement.  Fully-amortized
costs are removed from product and process technology and accumulated
amortization.

Property, plant and equipment:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 5 to 30 years for
buildings, 2 to 20 years for equipment and 2 to 5 years for software.  Assets held for sale are carried at the lower
of cost or estimated fair value and are included in other noncurrent
assets.  When property or equipment is
retired or otherwise disposed of, the net book value of the asset is removed
from the Company’s accounts and any net gain or loss is included in the
Company’s results of operations.

The
Company capitalizes interest on borrowings during the active construction
period of major capital projects. 
Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and
is amortized over the useful lives of the assets.  The Company capitalized interest costs of
$1.1 million, $3.4 million and $10.2 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, in connection with various capital projects.

Recently issued accounting standards:

In
December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a
revised Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities –
an interpretation of ARB No. 51,” which provides guidance on the identification
of and reporting for variable interest entities.  The Company adopted Interpretation No. 46 in
the third quarter of 2004.  Adoption of
Interpretation No. 46 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s
results of operations or financial condition.


Supplemental Balance Sheet Information

Gross
unrealized gains and losses as of the end of the periods shown above were de
minimis as were gross realized gains and losses in 2004, 2003 and 2002.  Debt securities of $1,056.9 million held by
the Company as of September 2, 2004, have contractual maturities within one
year.

The
Company recognized write-downs aggregating $307.0 million and $376.1 million in
2003 and 2002, respectively, to record work in process and finished goods
inventories at their estimated market values.

Intangible Assets

During
2004, the Company capitalized $37.0 million for product and process technology
with a weighted average useful life of ten years.  During 2003, the Company capitalized $32.8
million for product and process technology and $2.5 million for other
intangible assets with weighted average useful lives of ten and three years,
respectively.  As part of a restructure
plan announced in the second quarter of 2003, the Company wrote off net carrying
values of $16.1 million of product and process technology and $2.5 million of
other intangible assets associated with discontinued products, including SRAM
and TCAM products.  (See “Restructure and
Other Charges” note.)


Amortization
expense for intangible assets was $50.3 million, $51.1 million and $47.1
million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
Annual amortization expense is estimated to be $49.3 million for 2005,
$47.6 million for 2006, $45.8 million for 2007, $45.0 million for 2008 and
$34.0 million for 2009.

Depreciation
expense was $1,166.3 million, $1,157.8 million and $1,127.5 million for 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

The
Company has manufacturing facilities in Virginia and Utah that are only
partially utilized.  As of September 2,
2004, the Virginia and Utah facilities had net book values of $663.3 million
and $743.4 million, respectively.  A
portion of the Virginia facility is being used for 300mm wafer fabrication and
a portion of the Utah facility is being used for component test
operations.  The Company is depreciating
substantially all assets at the Virginia and Utah facilities other than $195.3
million of construction in progress in Utah as of September 2, 2004.  Increased utilization of these facilities is
dependent upon market conditions, including, but not limited to, worldwide
market supply of, and demand for, semiconductor products and the Company’s
operations, cash flows and alternative capacity utilization opportunities.

As
part of a restructure plan announced in the second quarter of 2003, the Company
recorded impairment charges of $42.6 million in 2003 to writedown the carrying
value of certain assets used in the Company’s 200mm production line in
Virginia, which was shut down as part of the restructure plan.  (See “Restructure and Other Charges” note.)

As
of September 2, 2004, notes payable and capital lease obligations of $111.7
million and $1.4 million, respectively, denominated in Japanese yen, were at
weighted average interest rates of 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively.


In
February 2003, the Company issued $632.5 million of 2.5% Convertible
Subordinated Notes due February 1, 2010 (the “Notes”).  The issuance costs associated with the Notes
totaled $16.6 million and the net proceeds to the Company from the offering of
the Notes were $615.9 million.  Holders
of the Notes may convert all or some of their Notes at any time prior to
maturity, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into the Company’s common
stock at a conversion rate of 84.8320 shares for each $1,000 principal amount
of Notes.  This conversion rate is
equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $11.79 per share.  The Company may redeem the notes at any time
after February 6, 2006, at declining premiums to par.

Certain
notes payable are collateralized by property, plant and equipment with a
carrying value of $150.5 million as of September 2, 2004.  Equipment under capital leases and
accumulated amortization thereon were $108.1 million and $38.0 million,
respectively, as of September 2, 2004, and $72.5 million and $19.2 million,
respectively, as of August 28, 2003.

As
of September 2, 2004, maturities of notes payable and future minimum lease
payments under capital lease obligations were as follows:

Call Spread Options

Concurrent
with the issuance of the Notes, the Company purchased call spread options (the
“Call Spread Options”) covering 53.7 million shares of the Company’s common
stock, which is the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes in
full.  The Call Spread Options have a
lower strike price of $11.79, a higher strike price of $18.19, may be settled
at the Company’s option either in cash or net shares and expire on January 29,
2008.  Settlement of the Call Spread
Options in cash on January 29, 2008, the expiration date, would result in the
Company receiving an amount ranging from zero if the market price per share of
the Company’s common stock is at or below $11.79 to a maximum of $343.4 million
if the market price per share of the Company’s common stock is at or above
$18.19.  Settlement of the Call Spread
Options in net shares on the expiration date would result in the Company
receiving a number of shares of the Company’s common stock, not to exceed 18.9
million shares, with a value equal to the amount otherwise receivable on cash
settlement.  Should there be an early
unwind of the Call Spread Options, the amount of cash or net shares potentially
received by the Company will be dependent upon then existing overall market
conditions, and on the Company’s stock price, the volatility of the Company’s
stock and the amount of time remaining on the Call Spread Options.  The Call Spread Options therefore have the
potential of limiting the dilution associated with the conversion of the Notes
from 53.7 million shares to as few as 34.8 million shares.  The Call Spread Option transactions,
including fees and costs of $109.1 million, are accounted for as capital transactions.

Interest Rate Swap

The
Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the “Swap”) that
effectively converted, beginning August 29, 2003, the fixed interest rate on
the Notes to a variable interest rate based on the 3-month London Interbank
Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) less 65 basis points (average rate of 0.56% for
2004).  The Swap qualifies as a
fair-value hedge under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.”  The gain or loss
from changes in the fair value of the Swap is expected to be highly effective
at offsetting the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the Notes
attributable to changes in interest rates. 
The Company measures the effectiveness of the Swap using regression
analysis.  The Company recognizes changes
in the fair value of the Swap and changes in the fair value of the Notes since
inception of the Swap in the consolidated balance sheets.  In 2004, the Company recognized a net gain of
$0.2 million, which is included in other non-operating income, representing the
difference between the change in the fair value of the Notes and the change in
the fair value of the Swap.  As of
September 2, 2004, the Company had pledged $25.8 million as collateral for the
Swap, which is included in restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet.  The amount of collateral
fluctuates based on the fair value of the Swap. 
The Swap will terminate if the closing price of the Company’s common
stock is at or exceeds $14.15 after February 6, 2006.


Commitments

As
of September 2, 2004, the Company had commitments of approximately $360.0
million for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment.  The Company leases certain facilities,
equipment and software under operating leases. 
Total rental expense on all operating leases was $21.1 million, $24.6
million and $16.2 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Minimum future rental commitments under
operating leases aggregated $62.5 million as of September 2, 2004, and are
payable as follows:  $16.3 million in
2005, $12.7 million in 2006; $3.7 million in 2007; $3.3 million in 2008; $2.7
million in 2009; and $23.8 million in 2010 and thereafter.

Contingencies

As
is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time
to time, others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that the Company’s
products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property
rights.  The Company is engaged in
litigation with Rambus, Inc. (“Rambus”) relating to certain of Rambus’ patents
and certain of the Company’s claims and defenses.  Lawsuits between Rambus and the Company are
pending in the United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and
Italy.  The Company also is engaged in
litigation with Motorola, Inc. (“Motorola”) and Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.,
a subsidiary of Motorola (“Freescale”), relating to certain of the Company’s
patents and certain of Freescale’s patents. 
A lawsuit between Motorola and Freescale and the Company is pending in
the U.S. District Courts for the Western District of Texas (Austin).  The above lawsuits pertain to certain of the
Company’s SDRAM and DDR DRAM products, which account for a significant portion
of net sales.

The Company is unable to predict the outcome
of these suits or of other assertions of infringement made against the
Company.  A court determination that the
Company’s products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property
rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require the
Company to make material changes to its products and/or manufacturing
processes.  Any of the foregoing results
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of
operations or financial condition.

On
June 17, 2002, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California seeking information
regarding an investigation by the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (the “DOJ”) into possible antitrust violations in the “Dynamic Random
Access Memory” or “DRAM” industry.  The
Company is cooperating fully and actively with the DOJ in its
investigation.  Subsequent to the
commencement of the DOJ investigation, thirty-one purported class action
lawsuits were filed against the Company and other DRAM suppliers in various
federal and state courts alleging violations of the Sherman Act, violations of
state unfair competition law and consumer protection law, and unjust enrichment
relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM products.  The complaints seek treble damages for the
alleged damages sustained by purported class members, in addition to
restitution, costs and attorneys’ fees, as well as an injunction against the
allegedly unlawful conduct.  The Company
is unable to predict the outcome of these suits.  Based upon the Company’s analysis of the
claims made and the nature of the DRAM industry, the Company believes that
class treatment of these cases is not appropriate and that any purported injury
alleged by plaintiffs would be more appropriately resolved on a
customer-by-customer basis.  The final
resolution of these alleged violations of federal or state antitrust laws could
result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.

On
May 5, 2004, Rambus filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of
California (San Francisco County) against the Company and other DRAM
suppliers.  The complaint alleges certain
causes of action under California state law including conspiracy to restrict
output and fix prices on Rambus DRAM (“RDRAM”), conspiracy to monopolize
various relevant markets, intentional interference with prospective economic
advantage relating to RDRAM, and unfair competition to disadvantage RDRAM.  The complaint seeks treble damages, punitive
damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, and a permanent injunction enjoining the
defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint.  The Company is unable to predict the outcome
of the suit.  A court determination
against the Company could result in significant liability and could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or
financial condition.

The
Company has accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs
of adjudication or settlement of various asserted and unasserted claims
existing as of the balance sheet date. 
The Company is currently a party to other legal actions arising out of
the normal course of business, none of which is expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial
condition.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is a party to a variety of
agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other
party.  It is not possible to predict the
maximum potential amount of future payments under these types of agreements due
to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and
circumstances involved in


each particular agreement.  Historically, payments made by the Company
under these types of agreements have not had a material effect on the Company’s
business, results of operations or financial condition.

Redeemable Common Stock

In
connection with the Company’s acquisition on April 22, 2002, of substantially
all of the assets of Toshiba Corporation’s (“Toshiba”) DRAM business as
conducted by Dominion Semiconductor L.L.C., the Company issued Toshiba 1.5
million shares of common stock and granted Toshiba an option to require the
Company to repurchase the shares for $67.5 million in cash.  During the first quarter of 2004, Toshiba
exercised its option and the Company redeemed the 1.5 million shares.

Shareholders’ Equity

Stock Rights

On
September 24, 2003, the Company received $450.0 million, which is included in
additional capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, from Intel
Corporation (“Intel”) in exchange for the issuance of stock rights exchangeable
into approximately 33.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock.  In conjunction with the issuance of the stock
rights, the Company agreed to achieve operational objectives through May 2005,
including certain levels of DDR2 production and 300mm wafer processing
capacity.  In the event the Company fails
to achieve certain 2005 milestones and the Company’s common stock price is then
below Intel’s purchase price of $13.29, the Company could be obligated to pay
Intel amounts not to exceed $135 million, a substantial portion of which is
payable, at the Company’s election, in the Company’s common stock.  The shares issuable pursuant to the stock
rights are considered outstanding common shares in the computations of basic
and diluted earnings per share.

Common Stock
Warrants

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company
received $480.2 million from the issuance of warrants to purchase 29.1 million
shares of the Company’s common stock. 
The warrants entitle the holders to exercise their warrants and purchase
shares of Common Stock for $56.00 per share (the “Exercise Price”) at any time
through May 15, 2008 (the “Expiration Date”). 
Warrants exercised prior to the Expiration Date will be settled on a
“net share” basis, wherein investors receive common stock equal to the
difference between $56.00 and the average closing sale price for the common
shares over the 30 trading days immediately preceding the Exercise Date.  At expiration, the Company may elect to
settle the warrants on a net share basis or for cash, provided certain
conditions are satisfied.  As of
September 2, 2004, there have been no exercises of warrants and all warrants
issued remain outstanding.

Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, consists of the following as of
the end of the periods shown below:


Employee Stock Plans

Stock Option
Plans

As
of September 2, 2004, the Company had an aggregate of 148.4 million shares of
its common stock reserved for issuance under its various stock option plans, of
which 106.4 million shares are subject to outstanding options and 42.0 million
shares are available for future grants. 
Options are subject to terms and conditions as determined by the
Company’s Board of Directors.  Stock
options granted after June 16, 1999, are generally exercisable in increments of
25% during each year of employment beginning one year from the date of
grant.  Stock options granted prior to
June 16, 1999, are generally exercisable in increments of 20% during each year
of employment beginning one year from the date of grant.  Stock options issued prior to January 19,
1998, expire six years from the date of grant and stock options granted through
September 2, 2004, expire ten years from the date of grant.

Option
activity under the Company’s stock option plans is summarized as follows:

The
following table summarizes information about options outstanding as of
September 2, 2004:

Stock Purchase
Plan

The
Company’s 1989 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) allows eligible employees
to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock through payroll
deductions.  The shares can be purchased
for 85% of the lower of the beginning or ending closing stock prices of each
offering period and can be resold when purchased.  Purchases are limited to 20% of an employee’s
eligible compensation.  As of September
2, 2004, 22.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock had been issued
under the ESPP and 3.5 million shares were available for future issuance under
the plan.

Non-Employee
Director Stock Incentive Plan

As
of September 2, 2004, 18,568 shares of the Company’s common stock had been
issued under the 1998 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan (“DSIP Plan”)
and 481,432 shares were reserved for future issuance under the plan.  Shares are issued under the DSIP plan as
compensation to non-employee directors of the Company.


Stock-Based Compensation

Assumptions
used in the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the value of the
Company’s options included in pro forma amounts are presented below:

The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable.  In addition, the
Black-Scholes model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the
expected stock price volatility and estimated option life.  Because the Company’s stock options granted
to employees have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate, in management’s opinion, existing models do not
provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Company’s stock options
granted to employees.  For purposes of
this valuation model, no dividends have been assumed.

Employee Savings Plan

The
Company has a 401(k) retirement plan (“RAM Plan”) under which U.S. employees
may contribute up to 45% of their eligible pay to various savings alternatives,
none of which include direct investment in the Company’s common stock.  The Company’s contribution provides for an
annual match of the first $1,500 of eligible employee contributions, in
addition to contributions based on the Company’s financial performance.  Contribution expense for the Company’s RAM
Plan was $13.7 million, $12.5 million and $12.8 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Restructure and Other Charges

In the second quarter of
2003, the Company announced a plan to restructure its operations.  The restructure plan included the shutdown of
the Company’s 200mm production line in Virginia, the discontinuance of certain
memory products, including SRAM and TCAM products, and an approximate 10%
reduction of the Company’s worldwide workforce. 
In connection with the plan, the Company recorded $109.2 million of
restructure charges and additional restructure related charges of $7.1 million,
which are included in cost of goods sold, in 2003.  The credit to restructure in 2004 primarily
reflects gains on sales of equipment associated with operations shut down in
the restructure.  The generally higher
equipment sales prices were reflective of improved market conditions across the
semiconductor industry.  The Company has
substantially completed the restructure plan. 
As of August 28, 2003, the Company’s accounts payable and accrued expenses
included $3.1 million for remaining costs accrued in connection with the
restructure plan.  Through September 2,
2004, the Company had paid essentially all of the severance and other
termination benefits and other costs incurred in connection with the
restructure plan.  The components of the
restructure charge and additional restructure related charges in 2004 and 2003
were as follows:


Other Operating Expense, Net

Other
operating expense for 2004 includes losses of $17.2 million from changes in
currency exchange rates.  Other operating
income for 2004 includes $7.2 million from the Commonwealth of Virginia for meeting
investment commitments at the Virginia wafer fabrication facility and net gains
of $3.9 million on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment.  Other operating expense for 2003 includes net
losses on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment of $41.5 million
and losses of $10.7 million from changes in currency exchange rates.  Other operating expense for 2003 is net of
$14.4 million in receipts from the U.S. government in connection with anti-dumping
tariffs.  Other operating expense for
2002 includes net losses on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor
equipment of $27.3 million.

Income Taxes

Income
tax (provision) benefit consists of:

A
reconciliation between income tax (provision) benefit computed using the U.S.
federal statutory rate and the Company’s income tax (provision) benefit is as
follows:


State
taxes reflect investment tax credits of $9.1 million, $16.8 million and $23.6
million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax
purposes.  The Company’s deferred tax
assets and liabilities consist of the following as of the end of the periods
shown below:

The
Company currently records a valuation allowance against substantially all of
its U.S. net deferred tax assets.  As of
September 2, 2004, the Company had aggregate U.S. tax net operating loss
carryforwards of $2.8 billion and unused U.S. tax credit carryforwards of
$106.7 million which expire through 2024. 
The Company also has unused state tax net operating loss carryforwards
of $1.7 billion for tax purposes which expire through 2024 and unused state tax
credits of $123.9 million for tax and financial reporting purposes which expire
through 2018.

The
changes in valuation allowance of $11.2 million and $561.6 million in 2004 and
2003, respectively, are primarily due to uncertainties of realizing certain
U.S. net operating losses and certain tax credit carryforwards.  The change in the valuation allowance in 2004
and 2003 includes $2.3 million and $2.2 million, respectively, for stock plan
deductions, which will be credited to additional capital if realized.

Provision
has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S.
subsidiaries to the extent that dividend payments from such companies are
expected to result in additional tax liability. 
Remaining undistributed earnings of $614.1 million have been indefinitely
reinvested; therefore, no provision has been made for taxes due upon remittance
of these earnings.  Determination of the
amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is
not practicable.

Earnings (Loss) Per Share


On
September 24, 2003, the Company issued stock rights to Intel which are
exchangeable into approximately 33.9 million shares of the Company’s common
stock.  The shares issuable pursuant to
the stock rights are considered outstanding common shares in the computations
of basic and diluted earnings per share. 
(See “Shareholders’ Equity – Stock Rights” note.)

Listed
below are the potential common shares, as of the end of the periods shown
below, that could dilute basic earnings per share in the future that were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because to do so would
have been antidilutive:

Joint Venture

Since
1998, the Company has participated in TECH Semiconductor Singapore Pte. Ltd.
(“TECH”), a semiconductor memory manufacturing joint venture in Singapore among
the Company, the Singapore Economic Development Board, Canon Inc. and
Hewlett-Packard Company.  As of September
2, 2004, the Company had a 39.12% ownership interest in TECH.  Significant financing, investment and
operating decisions for TECH typically require approval from TECH’s Board of
Directors.  The shareholders’ agreement
for the TECH joint venture expires in 2011. 
The Company adopted Interpretation No. 46 in the third quarter of
2004.  Under the provisions of
Interpretation No. 46, TECH is a variable interest entity for which
consolidation in the Company’s financial statements is not required.

TECH’s
semiconductor manufacturing facilities use the Company’s product and process
technology.  Subject to specific terms
and conditions, the Company has agreed to purchase all of the products
manufactured by TECH.  The Company
generally purchases semiconductor memory products from TECH at prices
determined quarterly, based on a discount from average selling prices realized
by the Company for the immediately preceding quarter.  The Company performs assembly and test
services on product manufactured by TECH. 
The Company also provides certain technology, engineering and training
to support TECH.  All of these
transactions with TECH are recognized as part of the net cost of products
purchased from TECH.  The net cost of
products purchased from TECH amounted to $453.8 million, $318.2 million and
$182.3 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Amortization expense resulting from the TECH
supply arrangement, included in the cost of products purchased from TECH, was
$11.8 million, $9.6 million and $10.1 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.  Receivables from TECH were
$23.8 million and payables to TECH were $56.8 million as of September 2,
2004.  Receivables from TECH were $53.1
million and payables to TECH were $102.5 million as of August 28, 2003.  TECH supplied approximately 30% of the total
megabits of memory produced by the Company in 2004.  As of September 2, 2004, the Company had
intangible assets with a net book value of $62.0 million relating to the supply
arrangement to purchase product from TECH. 
During 2004 and 2002, the Company sold semiconductor equipment to TECH
for $0.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively.

On
August 30, 2004, TECH refinanced its existing credit facility.  In connection therewith, the $100.0 million
previously pledged by the Company as cash collateral was no longer restricted
as to withdrawal or use.  As of August
28, 2003, the unamortized portion of the fair value of the Company’s guarantee
of TECH’s then existing credit facility was $6.0 million.
