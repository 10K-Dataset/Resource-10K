Participation
in, and ultimately success in, the semiconductor memory industry is dependent upon a number of factors, including: ownership or access to design and process technology,
cost effective silicon processing capability, employment and retention of key personnel, and sufficient access to capital. The Company is one of the most cost-efficient memory suppliers in
the industry.

Weak
market conditions led to the Company's decision in 2003 to restructure its operations. On February 18, 2003, the Company announced a series of cost-reduction
initiatives, including the shutdown of its 200 mm wafer fabrication line in Virginia, the discontinuance of certain product lines, including SRAM and TCAM products, and an approximate 10% reduction in
its worldwide workforce. (See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Restructure and Other Charges.")

Products

The Company offers semiconductor products with a wide variety of packaging and configuration options, architectures and performance characteristics to meet
customer needs.

Dynamic Random Access Memory

DRAM products are high density,
low-cost-per-bit, random access memory devices that provide high-speed data storage and retrieval. DRAM is the Company's primary product and is the most
widely used semiconductor memory component in computer systems. DRAM sales represented approximately 96%, 95% and 87% of the Company's net sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In
recent years, the Company has broadened its DRAM product line as the market has become more diverse. The Company offers 128 Meg, 256 Meg and 512 Meg Double Data Rate Synchronous DRAM
("DDR") and SDRAM in multiple configurations, speeds and package types. In 2003, DDR


replaced
SDRAM as the Company's highest volume type of semiconductor memory products sold. DDR accounted for 66%, 21% and 1% of the Company's DRAM sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. DDR is
used in computing and networking applications and in a variety of other consumer electronics. The 256 Meg DDR was the Company's primary product in 2003, accounting for 60% of net sales. The Company
began shipping commercial volumes of 512 Meg and 1 Gig DDR in 2003.

Although
market demand has shifted from SDRAM to DDR devices for computing and other applications, demand for SDRAM continues for many consumer applications, such as cell phones, hand
held devices and other communications equipment. The Company also provides key customers with
legacy DRAM products such as extended data out ("EDO") and fast page mode ("FPM") and lower density products such as the 16 Meg and 64 Meg DRAM. The Company continues to design and develop next
generation products, including DDR2, GDDR3 and certain other products, including reduced latency DRAM ("RLDRAM") and Cellular RAM.

Flash Memory

Flash products are non-volatile semiconductor devices that retain memory
content when the power is turned off, and are electrically re-writeable. Flash is used in networking applications, workstations, servers, PCs, and handheld electronic devices such as
digital cellular phones, digital cameras, and digital music players. Sales of Flash devices represented approximately 1%, 2% and 3% of the Company's net sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Currently, the Company's Flash offerings are comprised of NOR-based products.

Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor ("CMOS") Image Sensors

Image sensors are semiconductor
devices that capture images and process them into pictures or video for a variety of consumer and industrial applications. The Company's CMOS image sensors are used in products such as cellular phone
cameras, digital cameras, consumable pill cameras for medical use, automotive headlight dimming and motion tracking systems. CMOS imaging is a new market for the Company. The CMOS imaging market is
expected to grow significantly over the next several years. Sales for CMOS image sensors accounted for less than 1% of the Company's net sales in 2003.

Manufacturing

The Company is a leading global provider of semiconductor products with manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Italy, Japan, Puerto Rico,
Singapore and Scotland. The Company's manufacturing facilities operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

The
Company's process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex, involving a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly, burn-in and final test.
Efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities. The
primary determinants of manufacturing cost are die size, number of mask layers and yield of acceptable die produced on each wafer. Other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size,
number of fabrication steps, cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type and cleanliness of
the manufacturing environment. The Company is continuously enhancing production processes, reducing the die size of existing products and transitioning to higher density products. In 2003, the Company
completed the migration of its manufacturing operations to its 130 nanometer ("nm") line-width process technology and transitioned a portion of its manufacturing operations to its 110 nm
line-width process technology. The Company expects to transition a majority of its manufacturing operations to 110 nm line-width process technology in 2004.

Wafer
fabrication occurs in a highly controlled, clean environment to minimize dust and other yield-and quality-limiting contaminants. Despite stringent manufacturing controls, dust
particles, equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks and circuit design marginalities or other problems cause wafers to be scrapped or individual circuits to be
nonfunctional. Success of the


Company's
manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects and thereby maximizing yield of high-quality circuits. In this regard, the Company employs rigorous quality
controls throughout the manufacturing, screening and testing processes. The Company is able to recover many nonstandard devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality.

After
fabrication, silicon wafers are separated into individual die. Functional die are sorted, connected to external leads and encapsulated in plastic packages. The Company assembles
products in a variety of packages, including TSOP (thin small outline package), TQFP (thin quad flat package) and FBGA (fine pitch ball grid array). Each completed package is then inspected and
tested. The Company also sells semiconductor products in unpackaged die form. The Company tests its products at various stages in the manufacturing process, performs high temperature
burn-in on finished products and conducts numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow. In addition, the Company uses its proprietary AMBYX™ line
of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of DRAM die during the burn-in process, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing
testing time and cost.

A
significant portion of the Company's memory products are assembled into memory modules for sale to customers. Memory modules consist of an array of memory components attached to
printed circuit boards ("PCBs") that connect to computer systems or other electronic devices. Memory components are attached to PCBs in a soldering process performed by screen printing machines and
high speed automated pick and place machines. Completed modules are tested by custom equipment and visually inspected.

The
Company has established a 300 mm production line at its Virginia facility and expects to qualify its 512 Meg DDR product from that facility for production by the end of calendar
2003. The Company expects to ramp this wafer fabrication facility towards a capacity of 10,000 wafer outs per week over the next two years.

TECH Semiconductor Singapore Pte. Ltd. ("TECH")

TECH is a memory manufacturing joint venture
in Singapore among Micron Technology, Inc., the Singapore Economic Development Board, Canon Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Company. TECH's semiconductor manufacturing facilities use the
Company's product and process technology. Subject to specific terms and conditions, the Company has agreed to purchase all of the products manufactured by TECH. TECH supplied approximately 30%, 20%
and 25% of the total megabits of memory produced by the Company in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company generally purchases semiconductor memory products from TECH at prices determined
quarterly, based on a discount from average selling prices realized by the Company for the immediately preceding quarter. The Company performs assembly and test services on product manufactured by
TECH. The Company also provides certain technology, engineering and training to support TECH. All of these transactions with TECH are recognized as part of the net cost of products purchased from
TECH.

Availability of Raw Materials

The Company requires raw materials that meet exacting standards, including several custom materials. The Company generally has multiple sources of supply;
however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet the Company's standards. Various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as
silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, lead frames and molding compound. In addition, any transportation problems could delay the Company's receipt of raw materials. Although raw materials
shortages or transportation problems have not interrupted the Company's operations in the past, shortages may occur from time to time in the future. Also, lead times for the supply of raw materials
have been extended in the past. If the Company's supply of raw materials is interrupted, or lead times are extended, results of operations could be adversely affected.


Marketing and Customers

Markets for the Company's products are categorized into computing and consumer, networking and telecommunications, and imaging. Approximately 82% of the Company's
net sales for 2003 were to the computing market. Sales to both Dell Computer Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Company (including sales to Compaq Computer Corporation before the merger with
Hewlett-Packard Company) exceeded 10% of the Company's net sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001, and aggregated 28%, 28% and 24% of the Company's net sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The
Company markets its semiconductor products primarily through its own direct sales force. The Company maintains inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to
facilitate rapid delivery of product shipments. The Company's products are also offered through independent sales representatives, distributors and Crucial Technology, the Company's
web-based customer direct sales division. The Company's products are offered under the Micron, SpecTek and Crucial brand names, and under other private labels. The Company maintains sales
offices in North America, Europe, Asia and Japan. Sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by the Company and are compensated on a commission basis. The Company makes shipments
against these orders directly to the customer. Distributors carry the Company's products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors' products.

The
semiconductor memory industry is characterized by volatile market conditions, declining average selling prices, rapid technological change, frequent product introductions and
enhancements, difficult product transitions and relatively short product life cycles. Technology transitions, resulting from changing market demand, can make it very difficult to optimize product mix.
In addition, diversification of the DRAM market continues, with diverse memory needs being driven by the different requirements of desktop and notebook PCs, servers, workstations, handheld devices,
and communications, industrial and other applications that demand specific memory solutions. Many of the Company's customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products, which
may take several months. As the Company further diversifies its product lines and reduces the die sizes of existing memory products, more products become subject to qualification. There can be no
assurance that new products will be qualified for purchase by existing or potential customers.

Backlog

Volatile industry conditions make customers reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts. Accordingly, new order volumes for the Company's
semiconductor products fluctuate significantly. Orders are typically accepted with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment. Customers can
change delivery schedules or cancel orders without significant penalty. For these reasons, the Company does not believe that its order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of
actual sales for any succeeding period.

Product Warranty

Because the design and production process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that the Company may produce products that do not comply
with customer specifications, contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. In accordance with industry practice, the Company generally provides a limited warranty that its products are
in compliance with Company specifications existing at the time of delivery. Under the Company's general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty
period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. Under certain circumstances the Company may provide more
extensive limited warranty coverage and general legal principles may impose more extensive liability than that provided under the Company's general terms and conditions.


Competition

The Company faces intense competition from a number of companies, including Elpida Memory, Inc., Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Infineon Technologies AG
and Samsung Electronics, Inc. Some of these competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which the
Company competes, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities. These competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their
product designs. These factors have significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices.

Historically,
various governments have provided economic assistance to international competitors, which has enabled, or artificially supported, competitors' production of semiconductor
memory, particularly DRAM. This factor is expected to lead to a continued increase in the supply of DRAM and other semiconductor products in future periods.

Research and Development

To compete in the semiconductor memory industry, the Company must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. The Company believes that
expansion of its semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions.

Research
and development ("R&D") expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development,
and personnel costs. The Company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability and is internally qualified for sale
to customers. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture the Company's products, the Company typically begins to process a significant volume of product before it is internally qualified. As a
result, R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. Product development costs are recorded as R&D expense. The Company's R&D expenses were
$656.4 million, $561.3 million and $489.5 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The
Company's process technology R&D efforts are focused on its 110 nm, 95 nm and 80 nm line-width process technologies, which are designed to facilitate the Company's
transition to next generation products. Additional R&D efforts include processes to support 300 mm wafer manufacturing, Flash, CMOS imagers, and new memory manufacturing materials. In addition to its
process technology efforts, the Company continues to emphasize product designs that utilize advanced process technology. The Company has several product design centers around the world, the largest
located at its headquarters in Boise, Idaho. Efforts toward the design and development of new products are concentrated on the Company's 512 Meg and 1 Gig DDR, DDR2, GDDR3, Flash memory products, CMOS
imagers and other DRAM products, including reduced latency DRAM ("RLDRAM")
and Cellular RAM. In addition, the Company has a facility at its Boise, Idaho site to develop leading edge photolithography mask technology.

International Sales

Sales to customers outside the United States totaled $1.7 billion for 2003 and included $736.9 million in sales to the Asia Pacific region,
$612.4 million in sales to Europe and $260.1 million in sales to Japan. International sales totaled $1.4 billion for 2002 and $1.8 billion for 2001. (See "Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Geographic Information.")


Patents and Licenses

The Company owns approximately 9,600 United States patents and 700 foreign patents. In addition, the Company has numerous United States and foreign patent
applications pending. The Company's patents have terms expiring from 2003 through 2022.

As
is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time, others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that the Company's products or processes
infringe their product or process technology rights. The Company is currently engaged in litigation with Rambus, Inc. ("Rambus") relating to certain of Rambus' patents and certain of the
Company's claims and defenses. Lawsuits between Rambus and the Company are pending in the United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of
the Rambus suits or of other assertions of infringements made against the Company. A court determination that the Company's manufacturing processes or products infringe the product or process rights
of others could result in significant liability and/or require the Company to make material changes to its products and/or manufacturing processes. Any of the foregoing results could have a material
adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.

The
Company has a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements. Some of these license agreements require the Company to make one time or periodic payments. The Company
may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. The Company is unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on
acceptable terms.

Employees

As of August 28, 2003, the Company had approximately 16,600 employees, including approximately 10,900 in the United States, 2,700 in the Asia Pacific
region, 1,900 in Europe and 1,100 in Japan. The Company's employees in Italy are represented by labor organizations that have entered into national and local labor contracts with the Company. The
Company's employment levels can vary depending on market conditions and the level of the Company's production, research and product and process development. Many of the Company's employees are highly
skilled, and the Company's continued success depends in part upon its ability to attract and retain such employees. The loss of key Company personnel could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.

Environmental Compliance

Government regulations impose various environmental controls on discharges, emissions and solid wastes from the Company's manufacturing processes. In 2003, the
Company's wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of ISO 14001 certification. To continue certification, the Company met requirements in environmental policy, compliance,
planning, management, structure and responsibility, training, communication, document control, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, record keeping and management review. While the
Company has not experienced any materially adverse effects on its operations from environmental or other government regulations, changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital
expenditures, modification of operations or other compliance actions.

Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant

Officers of the Company are appointed annually by the Board of Directors. Directors of the Company are elected annually by the shareholders of the Company. Any
directors appointed by the Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the Board serve until the next election by the shareholders. All


officers
and directors serve until their successors are duly chosen or elected and qualified, except in the case of earlier death, resignation or removal.

As
of August 28, 2003, the following executive officers and directors of the Company were subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange

among other reasons, Rambus' fraudulent conduct in misusing and enforcing those patents, (b) that the Company has an implied license to those patents and (c) that Rambus is estopped from
enforcing those patents against the Company because of its conduct in the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council, a standard-setting organization; and (3) damages and declaratory relief for
Rambus' breach of contract, fraud, deceptive trade practices, negligent misrepresentation, and conduct requiring the application of equitable estoppel. On February 15, 2001, Rambus filed an
answer and counterclaim against the Company in Delaware denying the Company is entitled to relief, alleging infringement of the eight Rambus patents named in the Company's declaratory judgment claim,
and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. A number of other suits between Rambus and the Company have been filed in Europe. On September 1, 2000, Rambus filed suit against Micron
Semiconductor (Deutschland) GmbH in the District Court of Mannheim, Germany, alleging that certain SDRAM and DDR SDRAM products infringe German patent and utility model counterparts to European patent
525 068. On September 13, 2000, Rambus filed suit against Micron Europe Limited in the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division in London, England, alleging that certain SDRAM and DDR SDRAM
products infringe the U.K. counterpart to European patent 525 068. On September 22, 2000, Rambus filed a complaint against the Company and Reptronic (a distributor of the Company's


products)
in Court of First Instance of Paris, France, alleging that certain SDRAM and DDR SDRAM products infringe the French counterpart to European patent 525 068. On September 29, 2000, the
Company filed suit against Rambus in the Civil Court of Milan, Italy, alleging invalidity and non-infringement of the Italian counterpart to European patent 525 068. On
September 29, 2000, Rambus filed a preliminary proceeding against the Company and EBV (a distributor of the Company's products) in the Civil Court of Monza, Italy, alleging that certain SDRAM
products infringe the Italian counterpart to European patent 525 068, and seeking the seizure of certain materials and the entry of a preliminary injunction as to products manufactured at the
Company's Avezzano, Italy, site. On December 21, 2000, an appeals panel of the Court of Monza held that the Monza trial court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the seizure matter. The Monza
trial court order that technical review proceedings continue with respect to the issue of preliminary injunction. On May 24, 2001, the trial court rejected Rambus' assertions of infringement
and denied its request for a preliminary injunction. Rambus' appeal from the trial judge's ruling was rejected by the Monza appeals panel on July 18, 2001. On December 29, 2000, the
Company filed suit against Rambus in the Civil Court of Avezzano, Italy, alleging invalidity and non-infringement of the Italian counterpart to European patent 1 004 956. On
August 10, 2001, Rambus filed suit against the Company and Assitec (an electronics retailer) in the Civil Court of Pavia, Italy, alleging that certain DDR SDRAM products infringe the Italian
counterpart to European patent 1 022 642. In its various European suits against the Company, Rambus is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of
these suits. A court determination that the Company's manufacturing processes or products infringe the product or process rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require the
Company to make material changes to its products and/or
manufacturing processes. Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.

On
June 17, 2002, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking information regarding an investigation by
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ") into possible antitrust violations in the "Dynamic Random Access Memory" or "DRAM" industry. The Company is cooperating fully and
actively with the DOJ in its investigation. Subsequent to the commencement of the DOJ investigation, a number of purported class action lawsuits were filed against the Company and other DRAM
suppliers. Sixteen cases were filed between June 21, 2002, and September 19, 2002, in the following federal district courts: one in the Southern District of New York, five in the
District of Idaho and ten in the Northern District of California. Each of the federal district court cases purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who purchased DRAM directly
from the various DRAM suppliers during a specified time period commencing on or after October 1, 2001. The complaints allege price-fixing in violation of the Sherman Act and seek treble
monetary damages, costs, attorneys' fees, and an injunction against the allegedly unlawful conduct. The foregoing federal district court cases have been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California (San Francisco) for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. Eight additional cases were filed between August 2, 2002, and March 11, 2003, in the
following California state superior courts: five in San Francisco County, one in Santa Clara County, one in Los Angeles County and one in Humbolt County. Each of the California state cases purports to
be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who indirectly purchased DRAM during a specified time period commencing December 1, 2001. The complaints allege violations of California's
Cartwright Act and state unfair competition law and unjust enrichment and seek treble monetary damages, restitution, costs, attorneys' fees, and an injunction against the allegedly unlawful conduct.
The foregoing California state cases have been transferred to San Francisco County Superior Court for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of
these suits. Based upon the Company's analysis of the claims made and the nature of the DRAM industry, the Company believes that class treatment of these cases is not appropriate and that any
purported injury alleged by plaintiffs would be more appropriately resolved on a customer-by-customer basis. The Company can give no assurance that the final resolution will
not result in significant liability


and
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.

Item 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion contains trend information and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements such as those made in "Gross Margin" regarding manufacturing cost reductions in future periods, the estimated amount of
write-down remaining in inventory at the end of the first quarter of 2004 and relative gross margins on TECH products in the first quarter of 2004; in "Research and Development" regarding
expenses related to, and initial product qualifications of, the Company's 300 mm production line; in "Restructure and Other Charges" regarding the effect of the restructure and the estimated cost
savings in future periods; "Income Taxes" regarding taxes from the Company foreign operations and in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" regarding achievement of certain milestones associated with the
Intel investment and regarding capital spending in 2004. The Company's actual results could differ materially from the Company's historical results and those discussed in the forward-looking
statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, those identified in "Certain Factors." This discussion should be read in conjunction with the
Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions.

The Company's fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 each
contained 52 weeks and ended on August 28, 2003, August 29, 2002, and August 30, 2001, respectively. The Company's fiscal 2004, which ends on September 2, 2004, contains 53
weeks and the first quarter of fiscal 2004, which ends on December 4, 2003, contains 14 weeks. All period references are to the Company's fiscal periods unless otherwise
indicated.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience,
forecasted future events and various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions.
The Company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results
of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments.

Contingencies:

The Company is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to
estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss
can be reasonably estimated. The Company accrues a liability and charges operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance
sheet date.

Income taxes:

The Company is required to estimate its provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or
recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world. Estimates involve interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions
may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year. The Company is also required to evaluate the realizability of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with U.S.
GAAP, which requires the assessment of the Company's performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets. Realizability
of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income.


Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value. Cost includes labor, material and overhead
costs, including product and process technology costs. Determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments, including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future
periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories. To project average selling prices and sales volumes, the Company reviews recent sales volumes, existing customer orders, current
contract prices, industry analysis of supply and demand, seasonal factors, general economic trends and other information. When these analyses reflect estimated market values below the Company's
manufacturing costs, the Company records a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold. Differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of
cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of write-down recorded. Due to the
volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry, actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and, as a result, the timing of when product costs
are charged to operations can vary significantly. For example, a 5% variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated fair value of the Company's inventory by approximately
$35 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2003.

U.S.
GAAP provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values. The amount of any inventory write-down can vary significantly
depending on the determination of inventory categories. A majority of the Company's inventory has been categorized as volatile (primarily DRAM) or non-volatile (Flash). The major
characteristics the Company considers in determining inventory categories are product type and markets.

Product and process technology:

Costs incurred to acquire product and process technology or to patent technology developed by
the Company are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over periods currently ranging up to 10 years. The Company capitalizes a portion of costs incurred based on its
analysis of historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents filed. Capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of (i) the estimated useful
life of the technology, (ii) the patent term or (iii) the term of the technology agreement.

Property, plant and equipment:

The Company reviews for impairment the carrying value of property, plant and equipment when
events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and/or disposition.
In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair
value of the assets. The estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by the Company, including, but not limited to, future use of the assets for Company
operations versus sale or disposal of the assets, future selling prices for the Company's products and future production and sales volumes. In addition, judgment is required by the Company in
determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed.

Research and development:

Costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as
research and development when incurred. Determining when product development is complete requires judgment by the Company. The Company deems development of a product complete once the product has been
thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability and is internally qualified for sale to customers. Subsequent to product qualification, product costs are valued in inventory.

The
Company's operating results in recent periods have been significantly affected by the timing of inventory write-downs and restructure charges. In the second quarter of 2003, the
Company announced a series of cost-reduction initiatives including the shutdown of its 200 mm wafer fabrication line in Virginia, the discontinuance of certain product lines, including
SRAM and TCAM products, and an approximate 10% reduction in its worldwide workforce. In connection with its restructure plan, the Company's results of operations for 2003 include restructure and
related charges of $116.3 million. (See "Restructure and Other Charges" and "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements—Restructure and Other Charges.")

The
following table summarizes the Company's operating losses absent the inventory write-downs and the estimated aggregate effects of previous write-downs and restructure charges. These
adjusted amounts have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, however the Company believes this information may be useful in assessing the effects of inventory
write-downs and the restructure and related charges on the Company's operating loss and analyzing the Company's operating loss trends.

The
Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Toshiba Corporation's ("Toshiba") DRAM business as conducted by Dominion Semiconductor L.L.C. in Virginia on April 22,
2002. The Company's results of operations include results from these acquired operations after the acquisition date. The total purchase price of $327.9 million included cash and
1.5 million shares of the Company's common stock. The Company granted Toshiba an option to require the Company to repurchase on October 21, 2003, all of these shares for
$67.5 million cash. Toshiba has exercised the option and the Company will redeem these shares in the first quarter of 2004. (See "Item 8. Financial Statements—Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements—Redeemable Common Stock, and Acquisition of Toshiba Corporation DRAM Assets.")

Net Sales

Net sales for 2003 increased by 19% as compared to 2002, primarily due to a 44% increase in megabits of memory sold. This increase was partially offset by a 17%
decrease in average selling prices in 2003 as compared to 2002 for the Company's semiconductor memory products following a 53% decrease in average selling prices in 2002 as compared to 2001. The
average selling price for the Company's primary product, the 256 Meg DDR, decreased approximately 30% comparing the fourth


quarter
of 2003 to the fourth quarter of 2002. DDR products constituted 61% of the Company's megabits sold in 2003. Megabits produced increased 43% in 2003 compared to 2002 principally due to
completion of the Company's process technology migration to 130 nanometer ("nm") and continuing transition to 110 nm geometries and improved manufacturing yields. Megabits sold in 2003 slightly
outpaced production resulting in lower levels of finished goods inventories at the end of 2003 as compared to the end of 2002. Average selling prices for the fourth quarter of 2003 increased by
approximately 15% as compared to the third quarter of 2003.

Net
sales for 2002 decreased by 34% as compared to 2001, primarily due to the 53% decline in average selling prices for the Company's semiconductor products. Megabits sold increased by
approximately 45% in 2002 as compared to 2001.

Gross Margin

The Company's gross margin has been significantly affected by the timing of inventory write-downs. In recent periods, average selling prices for the Company's
semiconductor products have been below costs, and accordingly, the Company's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition have been adversely affected. If the estimated market values of
products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarter end date are below the Company's manufacturing cost of these products, the Company recognizes a charge to cost of goods
sold to write down the carrying value of inventories to their estimated market values. In recent years, the Company recorded charges to cost of goods sold to write down the carrying value of its
inventories to their estimated market values. As these charges are recorded in advance of when inventory subject to the write-down is sold, gross margins in the period of sale are higher
than they would be absent the effect of the previous write-downs.

The
following table sets forth adjusted gross margins absent the inventory write-downs and the estimated net effect of previous write-downs. These adjusted amounts have not been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, however the Company believes this
information may be useful in assessing the effects of inventory write-downs on the Company's gross margin and analyzing the Company's gross margin trends.

The
Company's reported gross margin for 2003 improved as compared to 2002, primarily due to a decrease in per megabit manufacturing costs, partially offset by the 17% decrease in average
selling prices for the Company's semiconductor products and the net effects of current and previous period inventory write-downs. The Company was able to significantly reduce per megabit manufacturing
costs in 2003 through improvements in manufacturing efficiencies. During 2003, the Company completed its migration to 130 nm process technology and continued to transition to 110 nm technology. The
Company expects to achieve further manufacturing cost reductions over the next several quarters in connection with the continued transition to 110 nm devices. The Company's gross margin for the fourth
quarter of 2003 of $169.5 million benefited from the approximate 15% increase in average selling prices as compared to the third quarter of 2003. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company
recognized a write-down of $4.2 million to record work in process and finished goods inventories, consisting primarily of Flash products, at their estimated market values.


The
Company's reported gross margin for 2002 decreased as compared to 2001, primarily due to the 53% decrease in average selling prices per megabit of memory, partially offset by the
effects of inventory write-downs and reductions in per megabit manufacturing costs for the Company's semiconductor products.

Of
the cumulative inventory write-downs recognized, the Company estimates that approximately $65 million is associated with product remaining in inventory as of August 28,
2003. The Company estimates that approximately half of this amount will remain in inventory at the end of the first quarter of 2004.

Subject
to specific terms and conditions, the Company has agreed to purchase all of the products manufactured by its joint venture memory manufacturing operation, TECH Semiconductor
Singapore Pte. Ltd. ("TECH"). TECH supplied approximately 30%, 20% and 25% of the total megabits of memory produced by the Company in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company generally
purchases semiconductor memory products from TECH at prices determined quarterly, based on a discount from average selling price realized by the Company for the immediately preceding quarter. The
Company performs assembly and test services on product manufactured by TECH. The Company also provides certain technology, engineering and training support to TECH. All of these transactions with TECH
are recognized as part of the net cost of products purchased from TECH.

Depending
on market conditions, the gross margin from the sale of TECH products may be higher or lower than the gross margin from the sale of products manufactured by the Company's
wholly-owned facilities. The Company realized significantly higher gross margin percentages on sales of TECH products than for products manufactured by its wholly-owned facilities in 2003 and 2002 and
lower gross margins on sales of TECH products for 2001. The Company expects gross margins on sales of TECH products in the first quarter of 2004 to be higher than gross margins realized on products
manufactured by the Company's wholly-owned facilities.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased in 2003 as compared to 2002, primarily due to costs associated with outstanding legal matters.
SG&A decreased in 2002 as compared to 2001. SG&A for 2001 included a contribution charge of $94.1 million for the market value of the Company's equity interest in Interland, which was
contributed to the Micron Technology Foundation, and $62.6 million from the Company's Web-hosting Operations, which were disposed of in August 2001. In addition, technical
and professional fees associated with the implementation of the Company's business software and legal costs were lower in 2002 as compared to 2001. (See "Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Contingencies.")

Research and Development

Research and development ("R&D") expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product
and process development, and personnel costs. The Company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability and is
internally qualified for sale to customers. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture the Company's products, the Company typically begins to process a significant volume of product before it
is internally qualified. As a result, R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. Product development costs are recorded as R&D expense. The Company's R&D
expenses were $656.4 million, $561.3 million and $489.5 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. R&D expenses related to the Company's 300 mm production line are expected to
increase in the first quarter of 2004 as additional development wafers are processed. R&D expenses related to the Company's 300 mm production line


are
expected to decrease after initial product qualification, which is expected to occur by the end of calendar 2003.

The
Company's process technology R&D efforts are focused on its 110 nm, 95 nm and 80 nm line-width process technologies, which are designed to facilitate the Company's
transition to next generation products. Additional R&D efforts include processes to support 300 mm wafer manufacturing, Flash, CMOS imagers, and new memory manufacturing materials. In addition to its
process technology efforts, the Company continues to emphasize product designs that utilize advanced process technology. Efforts toward the design and development of new products are concentrated on
the Company's 512 Meg and 1 Gig DDR, DDR2, GDDR3, Flash memory products, CMOS imagers and other DRAM products, including reduced latency DRAM ("RLDRAM") and Cellular RAM.

Restructure and Other Charges

As a result of the prolonged downturn in the semiconductor memory industry and the Company's recent operating losses, in the second quarter of 2003 the Company
announced a plan to restructure its operations. The restructure plan included the shutdown of the Company's 200 mm production line in Virginia, the discontinuance of certain memory products, including
SRAM and TCAM products, and an approximate 10% reduction of the Company's worldwide workforce. In connection with the plan, the Company recorded a restructure charge of $109.2 million in 2003.
In addition, the Company recorded other restructure-related charges of $7.1 million to write down the carrying value of raw materials and work in process inventories associated with
discontinued products. These other charges are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated summary of operations. The Company has substantially completed the restructure plan. The
components of the restructure and other charges were as follows:

Restructure charge:

Through
August 28, 2003, the Company had paid essentially all of the severance and other termination benefits and $1.0 million of other costs incurred in connection with
the restructure plan. As of August 28, 2003, the Company's accounts payable and accrued expenses included $3.1 million for remaining costs accrued in connection with the restructure
plan.

The
Company expects its restructure efforts to result in a lower overall cost structure, to provide better focus on products with greater potential for growth and profitability and to
allow continuing investment in new technology. The Company expects to realize annualized cost savings in excess of $250 million as a result of this restructure plan.

Other Operating Expense

Other operating expense for 2003 includes losses net of gains on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment of $41.5 million and losses from
changes in currency exchange rates of $10.7 million. Other operating expense for 2003 is net of $14.4 million in receipts from the U.S. government in connection with
anti-dumping tariffs. Other operating expense for 2002 includes losses net of gains on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment of $27.3 million. Other


operating
expense for 2001 includes losses of $44.2 million from the write-off of certain costs related to the Company's Lehi facility and losses net of gains on write-downs and
disposals of semiconductor equipment of $19.6 million.

Income Taxes

The income tax provision for 2003 was $73.0 million, which primarily reflects taxes on non-U.S. operations. Income tax benefit for 2002 and
2001 was $91.5 million and $446.0 million, respectively. The Company recognized no tax benefit on its domestic net operating losses in 2003. In 2002, the Company recorded a
$347.8 million charge to the provision for income taxes to establish a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.

As
of August 28, 2003, the Company had aggregate U.S. tax net operating loss carryforwards of $2.8 billion and unused U.S. tax credits of $95.0 million, which expire
in various years through 2023. The Company also has unused state tax net operating loss carryforwards of $1.9 billion for tax purposes which expire in various years through 2023 and unused
state tax credits of $132.0 million for tax and financial reporting purposes which expire in various years through 2017. Until the Company utilizes these net operating loss carryforwards and
unused tax credits, the Company expects its income tax provision will primarily reflect taxes from the Company's non-U.S. operations.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 150, "Accounting for
Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." SFAS No. 150 requires that certain financial instruments, which under previous guidance could be accounted
for as equity, be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and is
otherwise effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2004. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 150 to have a significant impact on the Company's future results of
operations or financial condition.

In
January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities—an interpretation of ARB No. 51," which provides
guidance on the identification of and reporting for variable interest entities. Interpretation No. 46 expands the criteria for consideration in determining whether a variable interest entity
should be consolidated. Interpretation No. 46 is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an
enterprise obtains an interest after that date. Interpretation No. 46 is effective for the Company in the second quarter of 2004 for variable interest entities acquired before
February 1, 2003. The Company is currently assessing the impact of Interpretation No. 46 on its future results of operations and financial condition.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of August 28, 2003, the Company had cash and marketable investments totaling $921.8 million, compared to $1,145.4 million as of
August 29, 2002, which included $159.7 million of marketable investments with maturities of more than one year. During 2003, the Company received net financing proceeds of
$615.9 million from the issuance of 2.5% seven-year convertible subordinated notes (the "Notes") and net proceeds of $94.9 million from the issuance of other debt. In
conjunction with the issuance of the Notes, the Company spent $109.1 million to purchase call spread options. During 2003, expenditures for property, plant and equipment were
$821.5 million and payments on equipment purchase contracts and debt were $249.2 million. The Company received income tax refunds of $108.9 million in the first quarter of 2003.


On
September 24, 2003, the Company received $450.0 million from Intel Corporation ("Intel") in exchange for the issuance of stock rights exchangeable into approximately
33.9 million shares of the Company's common stock. In conjunction with the issuance of the stock rights, the Company agreed to achieve operational objectives through May 2005, including
certain levels of DDR2 production and 300 mm wafer processing capacity, and dedication of resources to advanced product development. In the event the Company fails to achieve certain 2005 milestones
and the Company's common stock price is
then below Intel's purchase price of $13.29, the Company could be obligated to pay Intel amounts not to exceed $135 million, a substantial portion of which is payable, at the Company's
election, in the Company's common stock. The operational objectives are in line with the Company's business plans and currently the Company is confident that each associated milestone will be met.

The
Company believes that to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality, it must continue to invest
in manufacturing technology, facilities and capital equipment, research and development, and product and process technology. The Company expects capital spending to approximate $1.3 billion in
2004. Capital spending estimates include expenditures for ongoing equipment upgrades and expenditures for the Company's 300 mm production line. As of August 28, 2003, the Company had
commitments extending into 2004 of approximately $335 million for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment.

The
Company has historically utilized external sources of financing to fund a portion of operations and since April 2000 has had a shelf registration statement in place pursuant
to which the Company may from time to time issue debt or equity securities of up to $1 billion. The Company may also seek to raise funds through issuing securities not covered by the existing
shelf registration statement, by increasing the size of the existing shelf registration statement or pursuing other external sources of financing.

The
Company has pledged $100 million as cash collateral for TECH's credit facility. In the event the cash collateral is used to discharge obligations of TECH that are unpaid and
due under the TECH credit facility, certain shareholders of TECH have agreed to indemnify the Company for approximately one-half of the amount of the cash collateral used to satisfy such
obligations.

In
connection with the acquisition of the Virginia facility from Toshiba, the Company issued 1.5 million shares of common stock. The Company granted Toshiba an option to require
the Company to repurchase on October 21, 2003, all of these shares for $67.5 million cash. Toshiba has exercised the option and the Company will redeem these shares in the first quarter
of fiscal 2004.

In
February 2003, the Company issued $632.5 million of Notes. The issuance costs associated with the Notes totaled $16.6 million and the net proceeds to the Company
from the offering of the Notes were $615.9 million. Holders of the Notes may convert all or some of their Notes at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into
the Company's common stock at a conversion rate of 84.8320 shares for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes. This conversion rate is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $11.79 per share.
The Company may redeem the notes at any time after February 6, 2006, at declining premiums to par.

Concurrent
with the issuance of the Notes, the Company purchased call spread options (the "Call Spread Options") covering 53.7 million shares of the Company's common stock, which
is the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes in full. The Call Spread Options have a lower strike price of $11.79, a higher strike price of $18.19, may be settled at the Company's
option either in cash or net shares and expire on January 29, 2008. Settlement of the Call Spread Options in cash on January 29, 2008, the expiration date, would result in the Company
receiving an amount ranging from zero if the market price per share of the Company's common stock is at or below $11.79 to a maximum of $343.4 million if the market price per share of the
Company's common stock is at or above $18.19. Settlement of the Call Spread Options in net shares on the expiration date would result in the Company receiving a number of shares of the Company's
common stock, not to exceed 18.9 million


shares,
with a value equal to the amount otherwise receivable on cash settlement. Should there be an early unwind of the Call Spread Options, the amount of cash or net shares potentially received by
the Company will be dependent upon then existing overall market conditions, and on the Company's stock price, the volatility of the Company's stock and the amount of time remaining on the Call Spread
Options. The Call Spread Options therefore have the potential of limiting the dilution associated with the conversion of the Notes from 53.7 million shares to as few as 34.8 million
shares. The Call Spread Option transactions, including fees and costs of $109.1 million, are accounted for as capital transactions.

Certain Factors

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following are important factors which could cause
actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.

We have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our memory products which have adversely affected our business.

In six of the last seven fiscal years, we experienced decreases in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products as follows: 17% in 2003, 53% in
2002, 60% in 2001, 37% in 1999, 60% in 1998 and 75% in 1997. In recent periods, average selling prices for our semiconductor products have been below our costs. If average selling prices for our
memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per megabit costs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

If average selling prices of semiconductor products do not improve relative to our costs, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and make
adequate capital investments.

Our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold, average selling prices and per megabit manufacturing costs. In recent
periods, average selling prices have been below our costs. To develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality, we must
make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, facilities and capital equipment, research and development, and product and process technology. If average selling prices do not
improve relative to our costs, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations or make adequate capital investments. In addition to cash provided by operations, we have
historically utilized external sources of financing. However, depending on general market and economic conditions or other factors, we may not be able to access capital markets for funds on acceptable
terms.

Increased worldwide DRAM production or lack of demand for semiconductor products could lead to further declines in average selling prices for DRAM.

The transition to smaller geometries and 300 mm wafers in the industry could, depending upon the rate of transition, lead to a significant increase in the
worldwide supply of DRAM. Increases in worldwide supply of DRAM also result from DRAM fab capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other
semiconductor production to DRAM production. Some of our competitors may receive government support to withstand downturns in the semiconductor memory market and to invest in technology resulting in
higher levels of worldwide supply than would otherwise exist. Increases in worldwide supply of DRAM, if not offset by increases in demand, could lead to further declines in average selling prices for
our products and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Depressed pricing for semiconductor memory products may lead to future losses and inventory write-downs.

We recorded inventory write-downs aggregating $307.0 million in 2003, $376.1 million in 2002 and $726.9 million in 2001 as a result of the
significant decreases in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products. If average selling prices are below our costs in future periods, we expect to continue to incur losses on product
sales and our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. If the estimated market values of products held in finished goods and work in process
inventories at a quarter end date are below the manufacturing cost


of
these products, we recognize charges to cost of goods sold to write down the carrying value of our inventories to market value.

If the growth rate of either computers sold or the amount of semiconductor memory included in each computer decreases, sales of our semiconductor products could decrease.

We are dependent on the computing market as most of the semiconductor products we sell are used in computers, servers or peripheral products. Approximately 82% of
our sales of semiconductor products for 2003 was to the computing market. DRAMs are the most widely used semiconductor components in computers. In recent years, the growth rate of computers
sold has slowed or declined. If we experience a sustained reduction in the growth rate of either computers sold or the average amount of semiconductor memory included in each computer, sales of our
semiconductor products could decrease, and our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

The semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive.

We face intense competition from a number of companies, including Elpida Memory, Inc., Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Infineon Technologies AG and
Samsung Electronics, Inc. Some of these competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we
compete, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities. These competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product
designs. These factors have significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices.

Historically,
various governments have provided economic assistance to international competitors, which has enabled, or artificially supported, competitors' production of semiconductor
memory, particularly DRAM. This factor is expected to lead to a continued increase in the supply of DRAM and other semiconductor products in future periods.

Current economic and political conditions may harm our business.

Global economic conditions and the effects of military or terrorist actions may cause significant disruptions to worldwide commerce. If these disruptions result
in delays or cancellations of customer orders, a decrease in corporate spending on information technology or our inability to effectively market, manufacture or ship our products, our business,
results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. If, for any reason, we are unable to access the capital markets over an extended period of time, we may be unable
to make property, plant and equipment expenditures, implement our research and development efforts or fund our operations, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations
or financial condition.

If any one of our major computing customers significantly reduces its purchases of DRAM from us, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially
adversely affected.

Aggregate sales to two of our computing customers approximated 28% of our net sales in 2003. If any one of our major computing customers significantly reduces its
purchases of DRAM from us, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

If our TECH joint venture experiences financial difficulty, or if our supply of semiconductor products from TECH is disrupted, our business, results of operations or financial
condition could be materially adversely affected.

TECH supplied approximately 30%, 20% and 25% of our total megabits of memory produced in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We have agreements to purchase all of
the products manufactured by


TECH
subject to specific terms and conditions. Any reduction in supply could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We have pledged $100 million
as cash collateral for TECH's credit facility. In the event the cash collateral is used to discharge obligations of TECH that are unpaid and due under the TECH credit facility, certain shareholders of
TECH have agreed to indemnify us for approximately one-half of the amount of the cash collateral used to satisfy such obligations. As of August 28, 2003, we had remaining
unamortized costs of $73.8 million in intangible assets relating to the supply arrangement to purchase product from TECH. In the event that our supply of semiconductor products from TECH is
reduced or eliminated, we may be required to write off part or all of these assets and our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected.

We may be unable to maintain or reduce per megabit manufacturing costs at the same rate as we have in the past.

Historically, we have decreased per megabit manufacturing costs through improvements in our manufacturing processes, including reducing the die size of our
existing products. In future periods, we may be unable to maintain our per megabit manufacturing costs or reduce costs at historical rates. Our ability to maintain or reduce per megabit manufacturing
costs in future periods may be affected by:

•

our
ability to successfully implement product and process technology upgrades, specifically our ongoing transition to 110 nm process technologies and future transitions to
95 nm and 80 nm process technologies,

•

our
manufacturing wafer output or yields, which may decrease as we implement more complex technologies, including our transition to 300 mm wafer processing, and

•

our
ability to ramp the latest reduced die size versions of existing devices or new generation devices.

If we are unable to respond to customer demand for diversified semiconductor memory products or are unable to do so in a cost-effective manner, we may lose market
share and our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

In recent periods, the semiconductor memory market has become relatively segmented, with diverse memory needs being driven by the different requirements of
desktop and notebook computers, servers, workstations, handheld devices, and communications, industrial and other applications that demand specific memory solutions. We currently offer customers a
variety of products, including DDR, SDRAM, Flash and CMOS image sensors. In addition, we are designing and developing other semiconductor products, including DDR2, GDDR3, reduced latency DRAM,
CellularRAM and CMOS image sensors.

We
need to dedicate significant resources to product design and development to respond to customer demand for the continued diversification of semiconductor products. If we are unable to
invest sufficient resources to meet the diverse memory needs of customers, we may lose market share. In addition, as we diversify our product lines we may encounter difficulties penetrating certain
markets, particularly markets where we do not have existing customers. If we are unable to respond to customer demand for market diversification in a cost-effective manner, our business,
results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

An adverse determination that our products and processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

As is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time, others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products
or processes infringe their product or


process
technology rights. We are currently engaged in litigation with Rambus, Inc. ("Rambus") relating to certain of Rambus' patents and certain of our claims and defenses. On
August 28, 2000, we filed a declaratory judgment action against Rambus, Inc. ("Rambus") in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. On February 1, 2001, we amended our
complaint. Pursuant to our amended complaint, we are seeking: (1) relief under the federal antitrust laws for violations by Rambus of Section 2 of the Sherman Act; (2) a
declaratory judgment (a) that certain Rambus patents are not infringed by us, are invalid, and/or are unenforceable due to, among other reasons, Rambus' fraudulent conduct in misusing and
enforcing those patents, (b) that we have an implied license to those patents and (c) that Rambus is estopped from enforcing those patents against us because of its conduct in the Joint
Electron Device Engineering Council, a standard-setting organization; and (3) damages and declaratory relief for Rambus' breach of contract, fraud, deceptive trade practices, negligent
misrepresentation, and conduct requiring the application of equitable estoppel. On February 15, 2001, Rambus filed an answer and counterclaim against us in Delaware denying we are entitled to
relief, alleging infringement of the eight Rambus patents named in our declaratory judgment claim, and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. A number of other suits between Rambus and us
have been filed in Europe. On September 1, 2000, Rambus filed suit against Micron Semiconductor (Deutschland) GmbH in the District Court of Mannheim, Germany, alleging that certain SDRAM and
DDR SDRAM products infringe German patent and utility model counterparts to European patent 525 068. On September 13, 2000, Rambus filed suit against Micron Europe Limited in the High Court of
Justice, Chancery Division in London, England, alleging that certain SDRAM and DDR SDRAM products infringe the U.K. counterpart to European patent 525 068. On September 22, 2000, Rambus filed a
complaint against us and Reptronic (a distributor of our products) in Court of First Instance of Paris, France, alleging that certain SDRAM and DDR SDRAM products infringe the French counterpart to
European patent 525 068. On September 29, 2000, we filed suit against Rambus in the Civil Court of Milan, Italy, alleging invalidity and non-infringement of the Italian counterpart
to European patent 525 068. On September 29, 2000, Rambus filed a preliminary proceeding against us and EBV (a distributor of our products) in the Civil Court of Monza, Italy, alleging that
certain SDRAM products infringe the Italian counterpart to European patent 525 068, and seeking the seizure of certain materials and the entry of a preliminary injunction as to products manufactured
at our Avezzano, Italy, site. On December 21, 2000, an appeals panel of the Court of Monza held that the Monza trial court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the seizure matter. The Monza trial
court order that technical review proceedings continue with respect to the issue of preliminary injunction. On May 24, 2001, the trial court rejected Rambus' assertions of infringement and
denied its request for a preliminary injunction. Rambus' appeal from the trial judge's ruling was rejected by the Monza appeals panel on July 18, 2001. On December 29, 2000, we filed
suit against Rambus in the Civil Court of Avezzano, Italy, alleging invalidity and non-infringement of the Italian counterpart to European patent 1 004 956. On August 10, 2001,
Rambus filed suit against us and Assitec (an electronics retailer) in the Civil Court of Pavia, Italy, alleging that certain DDR SDRAM products infringe the Italian counterpart to European patent 1
022 642. In its various European suits against us, Rambus is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. We are unable to predict the outcome of these suits. A court determination that our
manufacturing processes or products infringe the product or process rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes
to its products and/or manufacturing processes. Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

We
have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements. Some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments. We may need to obtain
additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms.


Allegations of anticompetitive practices.

On June 17, 2002, we received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking information regarding an
investigation by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ") into possible antitrust violations in the "Dynamic Random Access Memory" or "DRAM" industry. We are cooperating fully
and actively with the DOJ in its investigation. Subsequent to the commencement of the DOJ investigation, a number of purported class action lawsuits were filed against us and other DRAM suppliers.
Sixteen cases were filed between June 21, 2002, and September 19, 2002, in the following federal district courts: one in the Southern District of New York, five in the District of Idaho
and ten in the Northern District of California. Each of the federal district court cases purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who purchased DRAM directly from the various
DRAM suppliers during a specified time period commencing on or after October 1, 2001. The complaints allege price-fixing in violation of the Sherman Act and seek treble monetary damages, costs,
attorneys' fees, and an injunction against the allegedly unlawful conduct. The foregoing federal district court cases have been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California (San Francisco) for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. Eight additional cases were filed between August 2, 2002, and March 11, 2003, in the following California
state superior courts: five in San Francisco County, one in Santa Clara County, one in Los Angeles County and one in Humbolt County. Each of the California state cases purports to be on behalf of a
class of individuals and entities who indirectly purchased DRAM during a specified time period commencing December 1, 2001. The complaints allege violations of California's Cartwright Act and
state unfair competition law and unjust enrichment and seek treble monetary damages, restitution, costs, attorneys' fees, and an injunction against the allegedly unlawful conduct. The foregoing
California state cases have been transferred to San Francisco County Superior Court for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. We are unable to predict the outcome of these suits. Based
upon our analysis of the claims made and the nature of the DRAM industry, we believe that class treatment of these cases is not appropriate and that any purported injury alleged by plaintiffs would be
more appropriately resolved on a customer-by-customer basis. We can give no assurance that the final resolution will not result in significant liability and will not have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

If we are unable to successfully transition our operations to 300 mm wafer processing at the appropriate time, our business, results of operations or financial condition could
be materially adversely affected.

We have in the past reduced our per megabit manufacturing costs by transitioning to larger wafer sizes. By transitioning to larger wafers, we should be able to
produce significantly more die for each wafer, ultimately resulting in substantially reduced costs for each die. Our transition to 300 mm wafer processing across a significant portion of our
operations will require us to make substantial capital investments, which will depend on our ability to generate funds from operations or to obtain additional funds from external sources. We may also
experience disruptions in manufacturing operations and reduced yields during our transition to larger wafer sizes. If we are unable to successfully transition to 300 mm wafer processing at the
appropriate time, we could be at a cost disadvantage with respect to our competitors and our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

New product development may be unsuccessful.

We are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. We anticipate expending
significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years. There can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful, that we will be able to
cost-effectively manufacture


these
new products, that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will recover costs of development efforts.

We face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Sales to customers outside the United States approximated 57% of our consolidated net sales in 2003. In addition, we have or support manufacturing operations in
Italy, Japan, Puerto Rico, Scotland and Singapore. Our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:

•

currency
exchange rate fluctuations, export duties, changes to import and export regulations, and restrictions on the transfer of funds,

•

political
and economic instability,

•

problems
with the transportation or delivery of our products,

•

issues
arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest,

•

longer
payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, and

•

compliance
with trade and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions.

These
factors may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

If our manufacturing process is disrupted, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

We
manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the
manufacturing process can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per megabit manufacturing costs. From time to time, we have experienced minor disruptions in our manufacturing
process as a result of power outages. If production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers'
requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. This could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships, which
could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition.

Disruptions in our supply of raw materials could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials. However, only a limited
number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards. Various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks,
chemicals, gases, lead frames and molding compound. Shortages may occur from time to time in the future. In addition, any transportation problems could delay our receipt of raw materials. Lead times
for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. If our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations or financial condition could
be materially adversely affected.

If we fail to achieve certain milestones, we could be obligated to pay Intel Corporation amounts up to $135 million.

In conjunction with the issuance of stock rights to Intel in September 2003, we agreed to achieve operational objectives through May 2005, including
certain levels of DDR2 production and 300 mm


wafer
processing capacity, and dedication of resources to advanced product development. If we fail to achieve certain 2005 milestones and our common stock price is then below Intel's purchase price of
$13.29, we could be obligated to pay Intel amounts up to $135 million, a substantial portion of which is payable, at our election, in our common stock.

Products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose
significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Because the design and production process for semiconductor memory is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer
specifications, contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. If, despite design review, quality control and product qualification procedures, problems with nonconforming, defective or
incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products, we could be adversely affected in the following ways:

•

we
may need to replace product or otherwise compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product, and

•

we
may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products.

We expect to make future acquisitions where advisable, which involve numerous risks.

We expect to make future acquisitions where we believe it is advisable to enhance our market position. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:

•

increasing
our exposure to changes in average selling prices for semiconductor memory products,

•

difficulties
in integrating the operations, technologies and products of the acquired companies,

•

increasing
capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities,

•

increasing
debt to finance any acquisition,

•

diverting
management's attention from normal daily operations,

•

managing
larger operations and facilities and employees in separate geographic areas, and

•

hiring
and retaining key employees.

Mergers
and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky, and future acquisitions may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business,
results of operations or financial condition.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

Substantially all of the Company's investments are at fixed interest rates; therefore, the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market
interest rates. The Company believes that the market risk arising from its holdings of investments is minimal as the Company's investments generally mature within one year.

All
of the Company's debt is at fixed interest rates; therefore, the fair value of the debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates. The estimated fair market value of the
Company's debt as of August 28, 2003 and August 29, 2002, approximated $1.3 billion and $430 million, respectively. The Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement
(the "Swap") that effectively converts, beginning August 29, 2003, the 2.5% fixed interest rate on the Company's $632.5 million convertible subordinated notes (the "Notes") to a variable
interest rate based on the 3-month London Interbank


Offering
Rate ("LIBOR") less 65 basis points. The Swap qualifies as a fair-value hedge under SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." The gain
or loss from changes in the fair value of the Swap is expected to be highly effective at offsetting the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the Notes attributable to changes in interest
rates.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The functional currency for substantially all of the Company's operations is the U.S. dollar. The Company held aggregate cash and other assets in foreign currency
valued at U.S. $203.1 million as of August 28, 2003, and U.S. $220.4 million as of August 29, 2002 (including deferred income tax assets denominated in Japanese Yen valued
at U.S. $105.4 million as of August 28, 2003, and U.S. $164.7 million as of August 29, 2002). The Company also held aggregate foreign currency liabilities
valued at U.S. $513.2 million as of August 28, 2003, and U.S. $434.0 million as of August 29, 2002 (including debt denominated in Japanese Yen valued at U.S.
$170.5 million as of August 28, 2003, and U.S. $233.1 million as of August 29, 2002). Foreign currency receivables and payables as of August 28, 2003, were comprised
primarily of Japanese Yen, Euros, Singapore Dollars and British Pounds. The Company estimates that, based on its assets and liabilities denominated in Japanese Yen as of August 28, 2003, a one
Yen change in the exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of approximately $2 million.

MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All tabular amounts in millions except per share amounts)

Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of presentation:

Micron Technology, Inc., and its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to collectively as the
"Company") manufacture and market DRAMs, Flash memory, CMOS image sensors and other semiconductor components. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The
Company's fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 each contained 52 weeks and ended on
August 28, 2003, August 29, 2002, and August 30, 2001, respectively. The Company's fiscal year 2004, which ends on September 2, 2004, contains 53 weeks and the first
quarter of fiscal year 2004, which ends on December 4, 2003, contains 14 weeks. All period references are to the Company's fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated.

On
August 6, 2001, Micron Electronics, Inc. ("MEI"), a former subsidiary of the Company, completed a merger with Interland, Inc. in a
stock-for-stock acquisition (the "Interland Merger"). Upon completion of the Interland Merger, MEI changed its name to Interland, Inc. ("Interland"), and the Company's
ownership interest was reduced from 61% to 43% of MEI's outstanding common stock. On August 30, 2001, the Company contributed all of its shares of Interland common stock to the Micron
Technology Foundation (the "Foundation"). The Foundation's results are not consolidated with the Company's results. MEI's 2001 financial results are included in the Company's consolidated financial
statements for eleven months through the date of the Interland Merger. As a result of MEI's disposal of its PC Operations in 2001, the Company's consolidated financial statements present the net
effect of discontinued PC Operations separate from the results of the Company's continuing operations.

Reclassifications:

Certain reclassifications have been made, none of which affected results of operations, to present the
financial statements on a consistent basis.

Use of estimates:

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U. S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Estimates and judgments
are based on historical experience, forecasted future events and various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may differ under
different assumptions or conditions. The Company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ from estimates.

Certain concentrations:

Approximately 82% of the Company's net sales for 2003 were to the computing market. Semiconductor
Operations sales to one customer were 14.9%, 16.5% and 10.8% of the Company's net sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Semiconductor Operations sales to another customer were 13.2%, 12.0% and
13.1% of the Company's net sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Certain components used by the Company in manufacturing semiconductor products are available from a limited number of suppliers.

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, investment securities and trade accounts receivable. The Company
invests through high-credit-quality financial institutions and, by policy, limits the concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single obligor. A concentration
of credit risk may exist with respect to trade receivables as a substantial portion of the Company's customers are affiliated with the computing industry. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of customers worldwide and generally does


not
require collateral from its customers. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on receivables.

Product warranty:

The Company generally provides a limited warranty that its products are in compliance with Company
specifications existing at the time of delivery. Under the Company's general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited
to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. Under certain circumstances the Company may provide more extensive limited warranty
coverage and general legal principles may impose upon the Company more extensive liability than that provided under the Company's general terms and conditions. The Company's warranty obligations are
not material.

Revenue recognition:

Revenue from product sales to direct customers is recognized when title transfers to the customer,
primarily upon shipment. The Company defers recognition of sales to certain customers that have rights of return and price protection until such customers have sold the products.

Advertising:

Advertising costs are charged to operations as incurred. The Company incurred $11.1 million,
$13.6 million and $24.1 million of advertising costs in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Research and development:

Costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as
research and development when incurred. Determining when product development is complete requires judgment by the Company. The Company deems development of a product complete once the product has been
thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability and is internally qualified for sale to customers. Subsequent to product qualification, product costs are valued in inventory.

Stock-based compensation:

Employee stock plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option valuation model to value stock options for pro forma
presentation of income and per share data as if the fair value-based accounting method in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," had been used to account for stock-based compensation. The following presents


pro
forma loss and per share data as if a fair value-based accounting method had been used to account for stock-based compensation:

Stock-based
employee compensation expense determined under a fair value-based method in 2003 and 2002 does not reflect a benefit for income taxes, which is consistent with the Company's
treatment of net operating losses from its U.S. operations. Stock-based compensation expense in 2001 is net of an assumed benefit for income taxes of $92.0 million.

Functional currency:

The U.S. dollar is the Company's functional currency for substantially all of its operations.

Earnings per share:

Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effects of stock options, stock warrants and convertible notes. Basic and diluted earnings per share computations reflect the effect of accretion
of redeemable common stock.

Financial instruments:

Cash equivalents include highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of
three months or less, readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Investments with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as
short-term investments. Investments with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as other noncurrent assets. Securities classified as
available-for-sale are stated at market value. The carrying value of investment securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.

The
amounts reported as cash and equivalents, short-term investments, receivables, other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and equipment purchase contracts
approximate their fair values. The estimated fair value of the Company's debt as of August 28, 2003, and August 29, 2002, was $1.3 billion and $430 million, respectively.
The fair value estimates presented herein were based on market interest rates and other market information available to management as of each balance sheet date presented. The use of different market
assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The approximate fair values do not take into consideration expenses that could be incurred
in an actual settlement.


Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value. Cost includes labor, material and overhead
costs, including product and process technology costs. Determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments, including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future
periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories. As a result of these analyses, the Company records a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually
sold when market values are below the Company's costs.

Product and process technology:

Costs incurred to acquire product and process technology or to patent technology developed by
the Company are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over periods currently ranging up to 10 years. The Company capitalizes a portion of costs incurred based on its
analysis of historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents filed. Capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of (i) the estimated useful
life of the technology, (ii) the patent term or (iii) the term of the technology agreement. Fully-amortized costs are removed from product and process technology and accumulated
amortization.

Property, plant and equipment:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 5 to 30 years for buildings, 2 to 20 years for equipment and 2 to 5 years for software. Assets held for sale
are carried at the lower of
cost or estimated fair value and are included in other noncurrent assets. When property or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the net book value of the asset is removed from the Company's
accounts and any net gain or loss is included in the Company's results of operations.

The
Company capitalizes interest on borrowings during the active construction period of major capital projects. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and is
amortized over the useful lives of the assets. The Company capitalized interest costs of $3.4 million, $10.2 million and $9.8 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, in
connection with various capital projects.

Recently issued accounting standards:

In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS
No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." SFAS No. 150 requires that certain financial instruments, which under
previous guidance could be accounted for as equity, be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003, and is otherwise effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2004. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 150 to have a significant
impact on the Company's future results of operations or financial condition.

In
January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities—an interpretation of ARB No. 51," which provides
guidance on the identification of and reporting for variable interest entities. Interpretation No. 46 expands the criteria for consideration in determining whether a variable interest entity
should be consolidated. Interpretation No. 46 is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an
enterprise obtains an interest after that date. Interpretation No. 46 is effective for the Company in the second quarter of 2004 for variable interest entities acquired before
February 1, 2003. The Company is currently assessing the impact of Interpretation No. 46 on its future results of operations and financial condition.

During
2003, the Company capitalized $32.8 million for product and process technology and $2.5 million for other intangible assets with weighted average useful lives of
10 years and 3 years,


respectively.
During 2002, the Company capitalized $52.7 million for product and process technology and $9.4 million for other intangible assets with weighted average useful lives of
9 years and 5 years, respectively. As part of a restructure plan announced in the second quarter of 2003, the Company wrote off net carrying values of $16.1 million of product and
process technology and $2.5 million of other intangible assets associated with discontinued products, including SRAM and TCAM products. (See "Restructure and Other Charges" note.)

The
Company has guaranteed a portion of the credit facility of its joint venture, TECH Semiconductor Singapore Pte. Ltd. ("TECH"). In accordance with FASB Interpretation
No. 45, the Company estimated the fair value of its guarantee of TECH's credit facility to be $7.0 million, which was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities in the third quarter of
2003 with an offsetting amount as an increase in the value of the TECH supply arrangement. The amount recorded pursuant to Interpretation No. 45 is being amortized using the
straight-line method through the June 2006 term of the new TECH credit facility. (See "Joint Venture" note.)

Amortization
expense for intangible assets was $51.1 million, $47.1 million and $49.2 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Annual amortization expense for
intangible assets held as of August 28, 2003, is estimated to be $48.8 million in 2004, $45.6 million in 2005, $43.9 million in 2006, $42.1 million in 2007 and

The
Company has manufacturing facilities in Virginia and Utah that are only partially utilized. As of August 28, 2003, the Virginia and Utah facilities had net book values of
$332.1 million and $824.1 million, respectively. A portion of the Virginia facility is currently being used for 300 mm wafer fabrication and a portion of the Utah facility is being used
for component test operations. The Company is depreciating all assets at the Virginia and Utah facilities other than $196.2 million of construction in progress in Utah as of August 28,
2003. Increased utilization of these facilities is dependent upon market conditions, including, but not limited to, worldwide market supply of, and demand for, semiconductor products and the Company's
operations, cash flows and alternative capacity utilization opportunities.

As
part of a restructure plan announced in the second quarter of 2003, the Company recorded impairment charges of $42.6 million in 2003 to write down the carrying value of certain
assets used in


the
Company's 200 mm production line in Virginia, which was shut down as part of the restructure plan. (See "Restructure and Other Charges" note.)

average interest rates of 1.5% and 1.8%, respectively.

In
February 2003, the Company issued $632.5 million of 2.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due February 1, 2010 (the "Notes"). The issuance costs associated with the
Notes totaled $16.6 million and the net proceeds to the Company from the offering of the Notes were $615.9 million. Holders of the Notes may convert all or some of their Notes at any
time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into the Company's common stock at a conversion rate of 84.8320 shares for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes. This conversion
rate is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $11.79 per share. The Company may redeem the notes at any time after February 6, 2006, at declining premiums to par.

Certain
notes payable are collateralized by property, plant and equipment with a total cost of $180.6 million and accumulated depreciation of $118.0 million as of
August 28, 2003. Equipment under capital leases and accumulated amortization thereon were $72.5 million and $19.2 million, respectively, as of August 28, 2003, and
$14.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively, as of August 29, 2002.

Call Spread Options

Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, the Company purchased call spread options (the "Call Spread Options") covering 53.7 million shares of the
Company's common stock, which is the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes in full. The Call Spread Options have a lower strike price of $11.79, a higher strike price of $18.19, may
be settled at the Company's option either in cash or net shares and expire on January 29, 2008. Settlement of the Call Spread Options in cash on January 29, 2008, the expiration date,
would result in the Company receiving an amount ranging from zero if the market price per share of the Company's common stock is at or below $11.79 to a maximum of $343.4 million if the market
price per share of the Company's common stock is at or above $18.19. Settlement of the Call Spread Options in net shares on the expiration date would result in the Company receiving a number of shares
of the Company's common stock, not to exceed 18.9 million shares, with a value equal to the amount otherwise receivable on cash settlement. Should there be an early unwind of the Call Spread
Options, the amount of cash or net shares potentially received by the
Company will be dependent upon then existing overall market conditions, and on the Company's stock price, the volatility of the Company's stock and the amount of time remaining on the Call Spread
Options. The Call Spread Options therefore have the potential of limiting the dilution associated with the conversion of the Notes from 53.7 million shares to as few as 34.8 million
shares. The Call Spread Option transactions, including fees and costs of $109.1 million, are accounted for as capital transactions.

Interest Rate Swap

The Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the "Swap") that effectively converts, beginning August 29, 2003, the fixed interest rate on the
Notes to a variable interest rate based on the 3-month London Interbank Offering Rate ("LIBOR") less 65 basis points. The Swap qualifies as a fair-value hedge under SFAS
No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." The gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the Swap is expected to be highly effective at offsetting the gain or
loss from changes in the fair value of the Notes attributable to changes in interest rates. In connection with the Swap, the Company pledged $20.2 million as collateral in
September 2003. The amount of collateral will fluctuate based on the fair value of the Swap. The Swap will terminate if the closing price of the Company's common stock is at or exceeds $14.15
after February 6, 2006.

Commitments

As of August 28, 2003, the Company had commitments of $335.4 million for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment. The Company leases
certain facilities, equipment and software under


operating
leases. Total rental expense on all operating leases was $24.6 million, $16.2 million and $25.0 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Minimum future rental
commitments under operating leases aggregated $83.9 million as of August 28, 2003, and are payable as follows: $20.3 million in 2004; $17.6 million in 2005;
$15.0 million in 2006; $3.3 million in 2007; $3.1 million in 2008; and $24.6 million in 2009 and thereafter.

Contingencies

As is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time, others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that the Company's
products or processes infringe their product or process technology rights. The Company is currently engaged in litigation with Rambus, Inc. ("Rambus") relating to certain of Rambus' patents and
certain of the Company's claims and defenses. Lawsuits between Rambus and the Company are pending in the United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy. The Company is unable to predict
the outcome of the Rambus suits or of
other assertions of infringements made against the Company. A court determination that the Company's manufacturing processes or products infringe the product or process rights of others could result
in significant liability and/or require the Company to make material changes to its products and/or manufacturing processes. Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.

On
June 17, 2002, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking information regarding an investigation by
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ") into possible antitrust violations in the "Dynamic Random Access Memory" or "DRAM" industry. The Company is cooperating fully and
actively with the DOJ in its investigation. Subsequent to the commencement of the DOJ investigation, twenty-four purported class action lawsuits were filed against the Company and other
DRAM suppliers in various federal and state courts alleging violations of the Sherman Act and state unfair competition law relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM products. The complaints seek treble
damages for the alleged damages sustained by purported class members, in addition to restitution, costs and attorneys' fees, as well as an injunction against the allegedly unlawful conduct. The
Company is unable to predict the outcome of these suits. Based upon the Company's analysis of the claims made and the nature of the DRAM industry, the Company believes that class treatment of these
cases is not appropriate and that any purported injury alleged by plaintiffs would be more appropriately resolved on a customer-by-customer basis. The final resolution of these
alleged violations of federal or state antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial
condition.

The
Company has accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of various asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance
sheet date. The Company is currently a party to other legal actions arising out of the normal course of business, none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
results of operations or financial condition.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party. It is not possible to predict the
maximum potential amount of future payments under these types of agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company's obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each
particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the Company under these types of agreements have not had a material effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.


Redeemable Common Stock

In connection with the issuance of the 1.5 million shares of common stock for the Toshiba DRAM Acquisition, the Company granted Toshiba Corporation an
option to require the Company to repurchase on October 21, 2003, all of these shares for $67.5 million in cash. Toshiba has exercised the option and the Company will redeem these shares
in the first quarter of 2004. The carrying value of the redeemable common stock is accreted to its redemption amount of $67.5 million by a charge directly to retained earnings and is included
in the computations of earning per share. Accretion of redeemable common stock was $6.3 million in 2003 and $2.1 million in 2002. (See "Acquisitions—Toshiba Corporation DRAM
Assets" note.)

Shareholders' Equity

Stock Rights

On September 24, 2003, the Company received $450.0 million from Intel Corporation ("Intel") in exchange for the issuance of stock rights
exchangeable into approximately 33.9 million shares of the Company's common stock. In conjunction with the issuance of the stock rights, the Company agreed to achieve operational objectives
through May 2005, including certain levels of DDR2 production and 300 mm wafer processing capacity, and dedication of resources to advanced product development. In the event the Company fails
to achieve certain 2005 milestones and the Company's common stock price is then below Intel's purchase price of $13.29, the Company could be obligated to pay Intel amounts not to exceed
$135 million, a substantial portion of which is payable, at the Company's election, in the Company's common stock.

Common Stock Warrants

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company received $480.2 million from the issuance of warrants to purchase 29.1 million shares of the
Company's common stock. The warrants entitle the holders to exercise their warrants and purchase shares of Common Stock for $56.00 per share (the "Exercise Price") at any time through May 15,
2008 (the "Expiration Date"). Warrants exercised prior to the Expiration Date will be settled on a "net share" basis, wherein investors receive common stock equal to the difference between $56.00 and
the average closing sale price for the common shares over the 30 trading days immediately preceding the Exercise Date. At expiration, the Company may elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis
or for cash, provided certain conditions are satisfied. As of August 28, 2003, there have been no exercises of warrants and all warrants issued remain outstanding.

Stock Purchase Plan

The Company's 1989 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company's common stock through payroll deductions.
The shares can be purchased for 85% of the lower of the beginning or ending closing stock prices of each offering period and can be resold when purchased. Purchases are limited to 20% of an employee's
eligible compensation. As of August 28, 2003, 19.6 million shares of the Company's common stock had been issued under the ESPP and 0.9 million shares were available for future
issuance under the plan.

Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan

As of August 28, 2003, 16,991 shares of the Company's common stock had been issued under the 1998 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan
("DSIP Plan") and 483,009 shares were reserved for future issuance under the plan. Shares are issued under the DSIP plan as compensation to non-employee directors of the Company.

The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
the Black-Scholes model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility and
option life. Because the Company's stock options granted to employees have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, existing models do not provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Company's stock options granted to employees. For
purposes of this valuation model, no dividends have been assumed.

Employee Savings Plan

The Company has a 401(k) retirement plan ("RAM Plan") under which U.S. employees may contribute up to 45% of their eligible pay to various savings alternatives,
none of which include direct investment in the Company's common stock. The Company's contribution provides for an annual match of the first $1,500 of eligible employee contributions, in addition to
contributions based on the Company's financial performance. Contribution expense for the Company's RAM Plan was $12.5 million, $12.8 million and $16.9 million in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively.


Restructure and Other Charges

As a result of the prolonged downturn in the semiconductor memory industry and the resulting operating losses, in the second quarter of 2003 the Company announced
a plan to restructure its operations. The restructure plan included the shutdown of the Company's 200 mm production line in Virginia, the discontinuance of certain memory products, including SRAM and
TCAM products, and a 10% reduction of the Company's worldwide workforce. In connection with the plan, the Company recorded a restructure charge of $109.2 million in 2003. In addition, the
Company recorded other restructure-related charges of $7.1 million to write down the carrying value of raw materials and work in process inventories associated with discontinued products. These
other charges are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company has substantially completed the restructure plan. The components of the
restructure and other charges were as follows:

Restructure charge:

Through
August 28, 2003, the Company had paid essentially all of the severance and other termination benefits and $1.0 million of other costs incurred in connection with
the restructure plan. As of August 28, 2003, the Company's accounts payable and accrued expenses included $3.1 million for remaining costs accrued in connection with the restructure
plan.

Other Operating Expense

Other operating expense for 2003 includes losses net of gains on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment of $41.5 million and losses from
changes in currency exchange rates of $10.7 million. Other operating expense for 2003 is net of $14.4 million in receipts from the U.S. government in connection with
anti-dumping tariffs. Other operating expense for 2002 includes losses net of gains on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment of $27.3 million. Other operating expense
for 2001 includes losses of $44.2 million from the write-off of certain costs related to the Company's Lehi facility and losses net of gains on write-downs and disposals of
semiconductor equipment of $19.6 million.

Other Non-Operating Income (Expense)

Other non-operating expense for 2001 includes a charge of $92.4 million to write down the carrying value of the Company's equity interest in
Interland to market value. Selling, general and administrative expense for 2001 includes a charge of $94.1 million for the market value of the Interland stock contributed to the Foundation. As
of August 30, 2001, the Company no longer held an investment in Interland. Other non-operating expense for 2001 also includes charges totaling $11.6 million for market value
adjustments to long-term fixed-price derivative financial instruments to purchase electricity and natural gas.

As
of August 28, 2003, the Company had aggregate U.S. tax net operating loss carryforwards of $2.8 billion and unused U.S. tax credit carryforwards of $95.0 million,
which expire in various years through 2023. The Company also has unused state tax net operating loss carryforwards of $1.9 billion for tax purposes which expire in various years through 2023
and unused state tax credits of $132.0 million for tax and financial reporting purposes which expire in various years through 2017.

The
changes in valuation allowance of $561.6 million and $344.1 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, are primarily due to uncertainties of realizing certain U.S. net
operating losses and certain tax credit carryforwards. The change in the valuation allowance in 2003 and 2002 includes $2.2 million and $14.0 million, respectively, for stock plan
deductions, which will be credited to additional capital if realized.

Provision
has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that dividend payments from such companies are expected to result
in additional tax liability. Remaining undistributed earnings of $472.8 million have been indefinitely reinvested; therefore, no provision has been made for taxes due upon remittance of these
earnings. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable.

Discontinued PC Operations

On May 31, 2001, MEI completed the disposition of its PC business to Gores Technology Group ("GTG"). In connection with the disposal, GTG received assets,
including $76.5 million in cash, and


assumed

Acquisitions

Toshiba Corporation DRAM Assets

On April 22, 2002, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Toshiba Corporation's ("Toshiba") DRAM business as conducted by Dominion
Semiconductor L.L.C., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Toshiba located in Virginia (the "Toshiba DRAM Acquisition"). The total purchase price of $327.9 million included cash and 1.5 million shares of the Company's common stock,
which was valued at $58.1 million on the date of acquisition. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. In connection
with the purchase, the Company recorded total assets of $363.3 million, including property, plant and equipment of $292.8 million and intangible assets of $7.8 million, and total
liabilities of $35.4 million. (See "Redeemable Common Stock" note.)

KMT Semiconductor Limited

Through April 30, 2001, the Company participated in KMT Semiconductor Limited ("KMT"), a joint venture between the Company and Kobe Steel, Ltd.
("KSL") and purchased all of KMT's production at prices generally based on a discount from the Company's average selling prices. The Company was also party to various agreements with
KMT whereby the Company provided assembly and test services, and technology, engineering and training support to KMT. The net cost of products purchased from KMT amounted to $293.3 million in
2001.

On
April 30, 2001, the Company acquired KSL's 75% interest in KMT in a transaction (the "KMT Acquisition") that resulted in KMT becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company. The KMT Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the purchase method of accounting. The purchase price of $31.3 million, which includes $25.0 million
cash paid to KSL for land and KSL's equity interest in KMT, is net of $37.7 million cash acquired and was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their
estimated fair values. In connection with the KMT Acquisition, the Company recorded total assets of $408.1 million, net of cash acquired, including deferred income tax assets of
$204.6 million and property, plant and equipment of $103.6 million, and total liabilities of $376.8 million, including debt and capital lease obligations totaling
$296.4 million. The results of operations of KMT have been included in the accompanying financial statements from the date of acquisition. On April 1, 2002, KMT's name was changed to
Micron Japan, Ltd.

The
following unaudited pro forma information presents the consolidated results of operations of the Company as if the KMT Acquisition had taken place at the beginning of 2001. The pro
forma information does not necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred nor is it necessarily indicative of future results of operations.

Joint Venture

TECH Semiconductor Singapore Pte. Ltd. ("TECH") is a memory manufacturing joint venture in Singapore among Micron Technology, Inc., the Singapore
Economic Development Board, Canon Inc.


and
Hewlett-Packard Company. TECH's semiconductor manufacturing facilities use the Company's product and process technology. Subject to specific terms and conditions, the Company has agreed to
purchase all of the products manufactured by TECH. The Company generally purchases semiconductor memory products from TECH at prices determined quarterly, based on a discount from average selling
prices realized by the Company for the immediately preceding quarter. The Company performs assembly and test services on product manufactured by TECH. The Company also provides certain technology,
engineering and training to support TECH. All of these transactions with TECH are recognized as part of the net cost of products purchased from TECH. The net cost of products purchased from TECH
amounted to $318.2 million, $182.3 million and $726.0 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Amortization expense resulting from the TECH supply arrangement, included in
the cost of product purchased from TECH, was $9.6 million, $10.1 million and $10.6 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Receivables from TECH were $53.1 million
and payables to TECH were $102.5 million as of August 28, 2003. Receivables from TECH were $10.5 million and payables to TECH were $52.8 million as of August 29,
2002. During 2002 and 2001, the Company sold semiconductor equipment to TECH for $1.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively.

In
November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness
of Others." Interpretation No. 45 requires an entity, at the time it issues a guarantee, to recognize an initial liability for the fair value of obligations assumed under the guarantee and
elaborates on existing disclosure requirements. On March 13, 2003, TECH refinanced its then existing credit facility by entering into a
new $250 million credit facility. In connection therewith, $50.0 million previously pledged by the Company as cash collateral with respect to TECH's credit facility was
re-pledged and supplemented with an additional $50.0 million. In the event the cash collateral is used to discharge obligations of TECH that are unpaid and due under the TECH credit
facility, certain shareholders of TECH have agreed to indemnify the Company for approximately one-half of the amount of the cash collateral used to satisfy such obligations. In accordance
with Interpretation No. 45, the Company estimated the fair value of its guarantee of TECH's credit facility to be $7.0 million, which was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities in the
third quarter of 2003 with an offsetting amount recorded as an addition to the value of the TECH supply arrangement. The amount recorded pursuant to Interpretation No. 45 is being amortized
using the straight-line method through the June 2006 term of the new TECH credit facility.

Operating Segment Information

The Company's reportable segments have been determined based on the nature of its operations and products offered to customers. Through 2001, the Company's two
reportable segments were Semiconductor Operations and Web-hosting Operations. As a result of the Interland Merger on August 6, 2001, the Company's only reportable segment is
Semiconductor Operations. The Semiconductor Operations segment's primary product is DRAM. The Web-hosting Operations segment provided web-hosting and other internet products
and services.


Segment

Controls and Procedures

An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that those disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms.

There
were no significant changes in the Company's internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation. There
were no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses noted during the evaluation, and therefore no corrective actions were taken.
