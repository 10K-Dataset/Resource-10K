Overview

The
        Company is a global manufacturer
        and marketer of semiconductor devices, principally DRAM and NAND Flash memory
        and CMOS image sensors.  The Company’s products are offered in a wide
        variety of package and configuration options, architectures and performance
        characteristics tailored to meet application and customer
        needs.  Individual devices take advantage of the Company’s advanced
        semiconductor processing technology and manufacturing expertise.  The
        Company aims to continually introduce new generations of products that offer
        lower costs per unit and improved performance characteristics.  The
        Company operates in two segments, Memory and Imaging.  (See “Item 8.
        Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial
        Statements – Segment Information.”)

Memory

:  The
        Memory segment’s primary products are DRAM and NAND Flash, which are key
        components used in a broad array of electronic applications, including personal
        computers, workstations, network servers, mobile phones, Flash memory cards,
        USB
        storage devices, MP3/4 players and other consumer electronics
        products.  The Company sells primarily to original equipment
        manufacturers, distributors and retailers located around the world.

In
        recent years, the Company has taken
        several steps towards establishing a significant presence in the NAND Flash
        market.  The Company has partnered with Intel Corporation (“Intel”) to
        form two NAND Flash manufacturing joint ventures (collectively “IM Flash”) that
        are consolidated subsidiaries of the Company.  In 2007, IM Flash
        ramped production at two 300mm wafer fabrication facilities which greatly
        increased the Company’s output of NAND Flash.  The Company expects its
        NAND Flash output will continue to increase significantly in 2008 at these
        facilities.  IM Flash began construction of a third 300mm wafer
        fabrication facility in 2007, which is expected to ramp production in late
        2009.  In June 2006, the Company acquired Lexar Media, Inc. (“Lexar”),
        a designer, developer, manufacturer and marketer of NAND Flash memory products,
        which broadened the Company’s NAND Flash product offering, enhanced the
        Company’s retail presence and strengthened its intellectual property
        portfolio.


Imaging:

The
        Imaging segment’s primary products are CMOS image sensors, which are key
        components used in a broad array of electronic applications, including mobile
        phones, digital still cameras, webcams and other consumer, security and
        automotive applications.  The Company’s primary customers are camera
        module integrators located around the world.  The Company is exploring
        business model alternatives for its Imaging business including partnering
        arrangements.  Under any of the alternatives being considered, the
        Company expects that it will continue to manufacture CMOS image
        sensors.

Products

Memory:

The
        Company’s Memory segment has two primary product types:  DRAM and NAND
        Flash.  Sales of Memory products were 88%, 86% and 94% of the
        Company’s total net sales in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Dynamic
        Random Access Memory
        (“DRAM”)

:

DRAM products are
        high-density, low-cost-per-bit, random access memory devices that provide
        high-speed data storage and retrieval.  DRAM products were 65%, 76%
        and 87% of the Company’s total net sales in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
        respectively.  The Company offers DRAM products with a variety of
        performance, pricing and other characteristics.

DDR
        and
        DDR2:

DDR and DDR2 are standardized, high-density,
        high-volume, DRAM products that are sold primarily for use as main system
        memory
        in computers and servers.  DDR and DDR2 products offer high speed and
        high bandwidth at a relatively low cost compared to other DRAM
        products.  DDR and DDR2 products were the highest volume parts in the
        DRAM market in 2007.  DDR products were 15%, 26% and 44% of the
        Company’s total net sales in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  DDR2
        products were 32%, 25% and 14% of the Company’s total net sales in 2007, 2006
        and 2005, respectively.

In
        response to changes in the DRAM
        market, the Company has broadened its DDR and DDR2 product offerings in recent
        years.  The Company offers DDR products in 128 megabit (“Mb”), 256 Mb,
        512 Mb and 1 gigabit (“Gb”) densities.  The Company offers DDR2
        products in 256 Mb, 512 Mb, 1 Gb and 2 Gb densities.  The Company
        expects that these densities will be necessary to meet future customer demands
        for a broad array of products.  The Company also offers its DDR and
        DDR2 products in multiple configurations, speeds and package
        types.  The Company has begun sampling next-generation DDR3
        products.

Synchronous
        DRAM
        (“SDRAM”):

In 2007, 2006 and 2005, SDRAM was primarily used
        in networking devices, servers, consumer electronics, communications equipment
        and computer peripherals as well as memory upgrades to legacy
        computers.  Sales of SDRAM products were 11%, 16% and 20% of the
        Company’s total net sales in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  SDRAM
        sales have declined as personal computer manufacturers have transitioned
        to DDR
        and DDR2 products.  The decline has been partially offset by increased
        usage of SDRAM products in other applications.  The Company offers 64
        Mb, 128 Mb, 256 Mb and 512 Mb SDRAM products.

Other
        Specialty Memory
        Products:

The Company also offers other specialty memory
        products including Mobile DRAM, Pseudo-static RAM (“PSRAM”) and Reduced Latency
        DRAM (“RLDRAM”).  Mobile DRAM products are specialty DRAM memory
        devices designed for applications that demand minimal power consumption,
        such as
        personal digital assistants (PDAs), smart phones, GPS devices, digital still
        cameras and other handheld electronic devices.  The Company sells
        SDRAM and DDR mobile memory products in 64 Mb, 128 Mb, 256 Mb, 512 Mb and
        1Gb
        densities.  The Company’s mobile DRAM products feature its proprietary
        Endur-IC™ technology, which the Company believes provides distinct advantages to
        its customers in terms of low power, high quality and high
        reliability.  PSRAM products, marketed by the Company under the
        proprietary brand name CellularRAM™, are DRAM products with an SRAM-like
        interface.  PSRAM combines the minimal power consumption of SRAM with
        a much lower cost-per-bit to provide an economical alternative to
        SRAM.  PSRAM products are used primarily in cellular phone
        applications.  RLDRAM products are low-latency DRAM memory devices
        with high clock rates targeted at network applications.


NAND
        Flash Memory
        (“NAND”)

:

NAND products are
        electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices that
        retain
        content when power is turned off.  NAND sales were 23% and 6% of the
        Company’s total net sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively.  NAND is
        ideal for mass-storage devices due to its faster erase and write times, higher
        density, and lower cost per bit than NOR Flash, which is the primary competing
        Flash architecture.  The market for NAND products has grown rapidly
        and the Company expects it to continue to grow due to demand for removable
        and
        embedded storage devices.  Removable storage devices such as USB and
        Flash memory cards are used with applications such as personal computers,
        digital still cameras, MP3/4 players and mobile phones.  Embedded
        NAND-based storage devices are utilized in MP3/4 players, mobile phones,
        computers and other personal and consumer applications.  The Company
        also expects new product lines such as solid-state disk to experience
        significant demand growth in future periods.

NAND
        and DRAM share common
        manufacturing processes, enabling the Company to leverage its product and
        process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure.  The Company’s
        NAND designs feature a small cell structure that allows for higher densities
        for
        demanding applications.  The Company offers Single-Level Cell (“SLC”)
        products and Multi-Level Cell (“MLC”) NAND products, which have double the bit
        density of SLC products.  In 2007, the Company offered SLC NAND
        products in 1 Gb, 2 Gb, and 4 Gb densities.  In 2007, the Company
        offered 8 Gb MLC NAND products and began sampling 16 Gb MLC NAND
        products.  The Company expects to introduce 32 Gb MLC NAND products in
        2008.

As
        a result of its acquisition of Lexar
        in the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company began selling high-performance
        digital media products and other flash-based storage products through retail
        and
        original equipment manufacturing (OEM) channels.  The Company’s
        digital media products include a variety of Flash memory cards with a range
        of
        speeds, capacities and value-added features.  The Company’s digital
        media products also include its JumpDrive™ products, which are high-speed,
        portable USB flash drives for consumer applications that serve a variety
        of
        uses, including floppy disk replacement and digital media accessories such
        as
        card readers and image rescue software.

The
        Company offers Flash memory cards
        in all major media formats currently used by digital cameras and other
        electronic host devices, including:  CompactFlash, Memory Stick,
        Secure Digital Card and the xD Picture Card.  Many of CompactFlash,
        Memory Stick and Memory Stick PRO products sold by the Company incorporate
        its
        patented controller technology.  Other products, including Secure
        Digital Card Flash memory cards and some JumpDrive products, incorporate
        third
        party controllers.  The Company also resells Flash memory products
        that are purchased from suppliers.  The Company offers Flash memory
        cards in a variety of speeds and capacities.  The Company sells
        products under its Lexar™ brand and also manufactures products that are sold
        under other brand names.  The Company has a multi-year agreement with
        Eastman Kodak to sell digital media products under the Kodak brand
        name.

Imaging:

Complementary
        Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (“CMOS”) image sensors are the primary product of the
        Company’s Imaging segment.  CMOS image sensors are semiconductor
        devices that capture and process images into pictures or video for a variety
        of
        consumer and industrial applications.  The Company’s CMOS image
        sensors are used in products such as cellular phone cameras, digital still
        cameras, pill cameras for medical use, and in automotive and other emerging
        applications.  The Company offers image sensors in a range of pixel
        resolutions from its VGA (video graphics array) products to its higher
        resolution 8-megapixel products.  The Company manufactures a number of
        CMOS image sensors featuring a leading-edge pixel size of 1.75 square microns
        that enable a smaller form factor product.  Image sensors are sold
        either as individual components or combined with integrated circuitry to
        create
        complete camera system-on-a-chip (“SOC”) solutions.

The
        Company’s CMOS image sensors
        incorporating its DigitalClarity™ technology offered many advantages over other
        CMOS image sensors and charge-coupled device (“CCD”) sensors, which enabled the
        Company to maintain its leadership position.  The Company’s
        DigitalClarity™ technology features “active pixels” enabling better sensor
        performance that produces higher-quality images at faster frame
        rates.  The Company’s low-leakage DRAM processes are particularly
        well-suited for the manufacture of CMOS image sensors.  The Company’s
        CMOS image sensors consume substantially less power than CCD devices, providing
        an advantage in battery-dependent portable device applications where most
        image
        sensors are used.  By combining all camera functions on a single chip,
        from the capture of photons to the output of digital bits, CMOS image sensors
        reduce the part-count of a digital camera system, which in turn increases
        reliability, eases miniaturization, and enables on-chip programming of frame
        size, windowing, exposure and other camera parameters.  The Company’s
        CMOS image sensors are also capable of producing high-quality images in
        low-light conditions.  In 2007, the Company’s CMOS image sensors’
active-pixel design architecture enabled the Company to achieve CMOS imager
        performance that was comparable to high-end CCD sensors.

Sales
        of Imaging products were 12%, 14%
        and 6% of the Company’s total net sales in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
        respectively.  The overall market for image sensors is expected to
        increase over the next several years due to the growth forecasted for
        applications such as phone cameras and digital still cameras and CMOS image
        sensors are expected to capture an increasing percentage of the overall image
        sensor market.


Manufacturing

The
        Company’s manufacturing facilities
        are located in the United States, China, Italy, Japan, Puerto Rico and
        Singapore.  The Company’s manufacturing facilities generally operate
        24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Semiconductor manufacturing is
        extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated
        facilities and equipment.  Most semiconductor equipment must be
        replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced
        equipment.

The
        Company’s process for manufacturing
        semiconductor products is complex, involving a number of precise steps,
        including wafer fabrication, assembly and test.  Efficient production
        of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor
        manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across
        multiple facilities.  The primary determinants of manufacturing cost
        are die size, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps and number
        of
        good die produced on each wafer.  Other factors that contribute to
        manufacturing costs are wafer size, cost and sophistication of manufacturing
        equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials,
        labor productivity, package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing
        environment.  The Company is continuously enhancing production
        processes, reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density
        products.  In 2007, the Company manufactured most of its DRAM products
        using its 95 nanometer (“nm”) and 78nm line-width process
        technology.  The Company expects to continue to transfer more of its
        DRAM production to 78nm and 68nm line-width process technology in
        2008.  In 2007, the Company manufactured most of its NAND Flash memory
        products using its 72nm line-width process technology and began transferring
        its
        NAND production to 50nm line-width process technology.  The Company
        expects that in 2008 most of its NAND Flash memory products will be manufactured
        using its 50nm line-width process technology.

Wafer
        fabrication occurs in a highly
        controlled, clean environment to minimize dust and other yield- and
        quality-limiting contaminants.  Despite stringent manufacturing
        controls, dust particles, equipment errors, minute impurities in materials,
        defects in photomasks and circuit design marginalities or defects can lead
        to
        wafers being scrapped and individual circuits being
        nonfunctional.  Success of the Company’s manufacturing operations
        depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of high-quality
        circuits.  In this regard, the Company employs rigorous quality
        controls throughout the manufacturing, screening and testing
        processes.  The Company is able to recover many nonstandard devices by
        testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality.

After
        fabrication, silicon wafers are
        separated into individual die.  The Company sells semiconductor
        products in both packaged and unpackaged (i.e. “bare die”) forms.  For
        packaged products, functional die are sorted, connected to external leads
        and
        encapsulated in plastic packages.  The Company assembles products in a
        variety of packages, including TSOP (thin small outline package), TQFP (thin
        quad flat package) and FBGA (fine pitch ball grid array).  Bare die
        products address customer requirements for smaller form factors and higher
        memory densities and provide superior flexibility.  Bare die products
        are used in packaging technologies such as systems-in-a-package (SIPs) and
        multi-chip packages (MCPs), which reduce the board area required.

The
        Company tests its products at
        various stages in the manufacturing process, performs high temperature burn-in
        on finished products and conducts numerous quality control inspections
        throughout the entire production flow.  In addition, the Company uses
        its proprietary AMBYX™ line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform
        simultaneous circuit tests of DRAM die during the burn-in process, capturing
        quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost.

The
        Company assembles a significant
        portion of its memory products into memory modules.  Memory modules
        consist of an array of memory components attached to printed circuit boards
        (“PCBs”) that insert directly into computer systems or other electronic
        devices.  The Company’s Lexar subsidiary contracts with an independent
        foundry and assembly and testing organizations to manufacture flash media
        products such as memory cards and USB devices.

The
        Company is exploring alternatives
        to reduce its assembly, test and module assembly costs including relocation
        of
        current operations to lower cost locations and outsourcing.  These
        alternatives could affect the Company’s manufacturing processes in future
        periods.

In
        2007, the Company significantly
        increased its 300mm wafer production as IM Flash ramped production at two
        300mm
        wafer fabrication facilities and the Company’s TECH joint venture began to
        convert its DRAM production to 300mm wafers.  The Company expects that
        its 300mm wafer production in 2008 will continue to increase significantly
        at
        these facilities.


In
        recent years the Company has
        produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products, which enhances the
        Company’s ability to allocate resources to its most profitable products but
        increases the complexity of the manufacturing process.  Although new
        product lines such as NAND Flash, CMOS image sensors and specialty memory
        can be
        manufactured using processes that are very similar to the processes for the
        Company’s predominant DRAM products, frequent conversions to new products and
        the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume
        parts
        can affect the Company’s cost efficiency.

NAND
        Flash Joint Ventures
        with Intel Corporation (“IM Flash”):

The Company has
        formed two joint ventures with Intel to manufacture NAND Flash memory products
        for the exclusive benefit of the partners:  IM Flash Technologies, LLC
        and IM Flash Singapore LLP (collectively, “IM Flash”).  IM Flash
        manufactures NAND Flash memory products pursuant to NAND Flash designs developed
        by the Company and Intel and licensed to the Company.  The parties
        share the output of IM Flash generally in proportion to their investment
        in IM
        Flash.  The Company owned a 51% interest in IM Flash at August 30,
        2007.  IM Flash’s financial results are included in the consolidated
        financial statements of the Company.  In 2007, IM Flash began
        construction of a new 300mm wafer fabrication facility in Singapore, which
        is
        expected to ramp in late 2009.  (See “Item 8. Financial Statements and
        Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Joint Ventures
– NAND Flash Joint Ventures with Intel.”)

TECH
        Semiconductor
        Singapore Pte. Ltd. (“TECH”):

TECH is a memory
        manufacturing joint venture in Singapore among Micron Technology, Inc., Canon
        Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Company.  The Company owned an approximate
        73% interest in TECH at August 30, 2007.  TECH’s semiconductor
        manufacturing facilities use the Company’s product and process
        technology.  Subject to specific terms and conditions, the Company has
        agreed to purchase all of the products manufactured by TECH.  TECH
        supplied approximately 15% of the total megabits of memory produced by the
        Company in 2007 (reflecting approximately 40% of total DRAM
        megabits).  In 2007, TECH began converting its manufacturing
        production from 200mm to 300mm wafers.  The conversion is expected to
        be completed in 2008.  TECH’s financial results were included in the
        consolidated financial statements of the Company beginning in the third quarter
        of 2006.  (See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data –
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Joint Ventures – TECH Semiconductor
        Singapore Pte. Ltd.”)

MP
        Mask Technology Center,
        LLC (“MP Mask”):

The Company produces photomasks for
        leading-edge and advanced next generation semiconductors through MP Mask,
        a
        joint venture with Photronics, Inc. (“Photronics”).  The Company and
        Photronics have 50.01% and 49.99% interest, respectively, in MP
        Mask.  The Company and Photronics also have supply arrangements
        wherein the Company purchases a substantial majority of the reticles produced
        by
        MP Mask.  The financial results of MP Mask are included in the
        consolidated financial results of the Company.

Availability
        of Raw Materials

The
        Company’s production processes
        require raw materials that meet exacting standards, including several that
        are
        customized for, or unique to, the Company.  The Company generally has
        multiple sources of supply; however, only a limited number of suppliers are
        capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet the Company’s
        standards.  Various factors could reduce the availability of raw
        materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, lead frames,
        molding compound and other materials.  In addition, any transportation
        problems could delay the Company’s receipt of raw materials.  Although
        raw materials shortages or transportation problems have not interrupted the
        Company’s operations in the past, shortages may occur from time to time in the
        future.  Also, lead times for the supply of raw materials have been
        extended in the past.  If the Company’s supply of raw materials is
        interrupted, or lead times are extended, results of operations could be
        adversely affected.

Marketing
        and Customers

The
        Company’s products are sold into
        computing, consumer, networking, telecommunications, and imaging
        markets.  Approximately 50% of the Company’s net sales for 2007 were
        to the computing market, including desktop PCs, servers, notebooks and
        workstations.  Sales to Hewlett-Packard Company were 10% of the
        Company’s net sales in 2007.


The
        Company’s products are offered
        under the Micron, Lexar, SpecTek and Crucial brand names, and private
        labels.  The Company markets its semiconductor products primarily
        through its own direct sales force and maintains sales offices in its primary
        markets around the world.  The Company maintains inventory at
        locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid
        delivery of product shipments.  The Company’s Lexar subsidiary sells
        NAND Flash memory products through retail and OEM channels and its Crucial
        Technology division sells memory products through a web-based customer direct
        sales channel.  The Company’s products are also offered through
        independent sales representatives and distributors.  Independent sales
        representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by the Company
        and are
        compensated on a commission basis.  The Company makes shipments
        against these orders directly to the customer.  Distributors carry the
        Company’s products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other
        semiconductor products, including competitors’ products.

The
        Company offers products designed to
        meet the diverse needs of computing, server, automotive, networking, security,
        commercial/industrial, consumer electronics, medical and mobile
        applications.  Many of the Company’s customers require a thorough
        review or qualification of semiconductor products, which may take several
        months.  As the Company further diversifies its product lines and
        reduces the die sizes of existing products, more products become subject
        to
        qualification which may delay volume introduction of specific devices by
        the
        Company.

Backlog

Because
        of volatile industry conditions
        customers are reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price
        contracts.  Accordingly, new order volumes for the Company’s
        semiconductor products fluctuate significantly.  Orders are typically
        accepted with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market
        conditions at the date of shipment.  Customers can change delivery
        schedules or cancel orders without significant penalty.  For these
        reasons, the Company does not believe that its order backlog as of any
        particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding
        period.

Product
        Warranty

Because
        the design and manufacturing
        process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that
        the
        Company may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications,
        contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses.  In
        accordance with industry practice, the Company generally provides a limited
        warranty that its products are in compliance with Company specifications
        existing at the time of delivery.  Under the Company’s general terms
        and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during
        a
        stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective
        items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such
        items.  Under certain circumstances the Company may provide more
        extensive limited warranty coverage and general legal principles may impose
        more
        extensive liability than that provided under the Company’s general terms and
        conditions.

Competition

The
        Company faces intense competition
        in the semiconductor memory markets from a number of companies, including
        Elpida
        Memory, Inc.; Hynix Semiconductor Inc.; Qimonda AG ADS; Samsung Electronics
        Co.,
        Ltd; SanDisk Corporation; Toshiba Corporation and emerging companies in Taiwan
        and China.  Some of the Company’s competitors are large corporations
        or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in
        the
        semiconductor markets in which the Company competes, invest in technology
        and
        capitalize on growth opportunities.  The Company’s competitors seek to
        increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask
        levels in their product designs.  These factors have significantly
        increased worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices.

The
        Company faces competition in the
        image sensor market from a number of suppliers of CMOS image sensors including
        MagnaChip Semiconductor Ltd.; OmniVision Technologies, Inc.; Samsung Electronics
        Co., Ltd; Sony Corporation; STMicroelectronics NV; Toshiba Corporation and
        from
        a number of suppliers of CCD image sensors including Matsushita Electric
        Industrial Co., Ltd.; Sharp Corporation and Sony Corporation.  In
        recent periods, a number of new companies have entered the CMOS image sensor
        market.  Competitors include many large domestic and international
        companies that may have greater presence in key markets, better access to
        certain customer bases, greater name recognition and more established strategic
        and financial relationships than the Company.


Research
        and Development

To
        compete in the semiconductor memory
        industry, the Company must continue to develop technologically advanced products
        and processes.  The Company believes that expansion of its
        semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand
        for
        specific memory and imaging solutions.  The Company has several
        product design centers around the world, the largest located at its corporate
        headquarters in Boise, Idaho.  In addition, the Company develops
        leading edge photolithography mask technology at its MP Mask joint venture
        facility in Boise.

Research
        and development (“R&D”)
        expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed,
        the
        cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development,
        and
        personnel costs.  Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture
        its products, the Company typically begins to process wafers before completion
        of performance and reliability testing.  The Company deems development
        of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested
        for performance and reliability.  R&D expenses can vary
        significantly depending on the timing of product qualification.  The
        Company and Intel share R&D process and design costs for NAND Flash
        equally.  Product development costs are recorded as R&D
        expense.

The
        Company’s process technology
        R&D efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller
        line-width process technologies which are designed to facilitate the Company’s
        transition to next generation memory products and CMOS image
        sensors.  Additional process technology R&D efforts focus on
        advanced computing and mobile memory architectures and new manufacturing
        materials.  Product design and development efforts are concentrated on
        the Company’s 1 Gb and 2 Gb DDR2 and DDR3 products as well as high density and
        mobile NAND Flash memory (including MLC technology), CMOS image sensors and
        specialty memory products.  The Company’s R&D expenses were $805
        million, $656 million and $604 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
        respectively.

Geographic
        Information

Sales
        to customers outside the United
        States totaled $4.0 billion for 2007 and included $1.1 billion in sales to
        China, $666 million in sales to Europe, $477 million in sales to Japan and
        $1.5
        billion in sales to the rest of the Asia Pacific region, excluding China
        and
        Japan.  International sales totaled $3.6 billion for 2006 and $3.2
        billion for 2005.  As of August 30, 2007, the Company had net
        property, plant and equipment of $6.5 billion in the United States, $1.2
        billion
        in Singapore, $268 million in Italy, $226 million in Japan and $28 million
        in
        other countries.  (See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
        Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Geographic Information” and
“Item 1A. Risk Factors.”)

Patents
        and Licenses

In
        recent years, the Company has been
        recognized as a leader in volume and quality of patents issued.  As of
        August 30, 2007, the Company owned approximately 16,400 U.S. patents and
        2,000
        foreign patents.  In addition, the Company has numerous U.S. and
        foreign patent applications pending.  The Company’s patents have terms
        expiring through 2026.

The
        Company has a number of patent and
        intellectual property license agreements.  Some of these license
        agreements require the Company to make one time or periodic
        payments.  The Company may need to obtain additional patent licenses
        or renew existing license agreements in the future.  The Company is
        unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed
        on
        acceptable terms.

In
        recent years, the Company has
        recovered some of its investment in technology through sales of intellectual
        property rights to joint venture partners and other third
        parties.  The Company is pursing further opportunities to recover its
        investment in intellectual property through partnering
        arrangements.


Employees

As
        of August 30, 2007, the Company had
        approximately 23,500 employees, including approximately 13,700 in the United
        States, 5,700 in Singapore, 2,000 in Italy, 1,500 in Japan and 300 in the
        United
        Kingdom.  The Company’s employees include 2,500 employees in its TECH
        joint venture that are located in Singapore and 1,400 employees in its IM
        Flash
        joint ventures that are primarily located in the United
        States.  Approximately 400 of the Company’s employees in Italy are
        represented by labor organizations that have entered into national and local
        labor contracts with the Company.  The Company’s employment levels can
        vary depending on market conditions and the level of the Company’s production,
        research and product and process development.  Many of the Company’s
        employees are highly skilled, and the Company’s continued success depends in
        part upon its ability to attract and retain such employees.  The loss
        of key Company personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
        business, results of operations or financial condition.

Environmental
        Compliance

Government
        regulations impose various
        environmental controls on raw materials and discharges, emissions and solid
        wastes from the Company’s manufacturing processes.  In 2007, the
        Company’s wafer wholly-owned fabrication facilities continued to conform to the
        requirements of ISO 14001 certification.  To continue certification,
        the Company met annual requirements in environmental policy, compliance,
        planning, management, structure and responsibility, training, communication,
        document control, operational control, emergency preparedness and response,
        record keeping and management review.  While the Company has not
        experienced any materially adverse effects on its operations from environmental
        regulations, changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital
        expenditures, modification of operations or other compliance
        actions.

Directors
        and Executive Officers of the Registrant

Officers
        of the Company are appointed
        annually by the Board of Directors.  Directors of the Company are
        elected annually by the shareholders of the Company.  Any directors
        appointed by the Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the Board serve
        until
        the next election by the shareholders.  All officers and directors
        serve until their successors are duly chosen or elected and qualified, except
        in
        the case of earlier death, resignation or removal.

As
        of August 30, 2007, the following
        executive officers and directors of the Company were subject to the reporting

Risk Factors

In
        addition to the factors discussed
        elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following are important factors which could
        cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained
        in any
        forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.

We
        have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our
        semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our
        business.

In
        2007, average selling prices for
        DRAM products and NAND Flash products decreased 23% and 56%, respectively,
        as
        compared to 2006.  In recent years, we have also experienced annual
        decreases in per megabit average selling prices for our memory products
        including: 34% in 2006, 24% in 2005, 17% in 2003, 53% in 2002 and 60% in
        2001.  At times, average selling prices for our memory products have
        been below our costs.  If average selling prices for our memory
        products decrease faster than we can decrease per megabit costs, as they
        recently have, our business, results of operations or financial condition
        could
        be materially adversely affected.

The
        semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive.

We
        face intense competition in the
        semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including Elpida
        Memory,
        Inc.; Hynix Semiconductor Inc.; Qimonda AG ADS; Samsung Electronics Co.,
        Ltd.;
        SanDisk Corporation; Toshiba Corporation and from emerging companies in Taiwan
        and China, who have significantly expanded the scale of their
        operations.  Some of our competitors are large corporations or
        conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the
        semiconductor markets in which we compete, invest in technology and capitalize
        on growth opportunities.

Our
        competitors seek to increase
        silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels
        in
        their product designs.  The transitions to smaller line-width process
        technologies and 300mm wafers in the industry have resulted in significant
        increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and will likely
        lead
        to future increases.  Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor
        memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions, either
        by
        way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization or reallocation of
        other
        semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production.  We and
        several of our competitors have significantly increased production in recent
        periods through construction of new facilities or expansion of existing
        facilities.  Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory, if
        not accompanied with commensurate increases in demand, would lead to further
        declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially
        adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial
        condition.

We
        may be unable to reduce our per megabit manufacturing costs at the same rate
        as
        we have in the past.

Our
        gross margins are dependent upon
        continuing decreases in per unit manufacturing costs achieved through
        improvements in our manufacturing processes, including reducing the die size
        of
        our existing products.  In future periods, we may be unable to reduce
        our per unit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to increase gross margins
        due to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix,
        the
        increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, changes in process
        technologies or products which inherently may require relatively larger die
        sizes.  Per unit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the
        relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of
        Imaging and certain specialty memory products.

Depressed
        pricing for semiconductor memory products may lead to future losses and
        inventory write-downs.

We
        recorded an inventory write-down of
        $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of the significant
        decreases in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory
        products.  If average selling prices are below our costs in future
        periods, we expect to incur losses on product sales and our business, results
        of
        operations or financial condition could be materially adversely
        affected.  If the estimated market values of products held in finished
        goods and work in process inventories at a quarter end date are below the
        manufacturing cost of these products, we recognize charges to cost of goods
        sold
        to write down the carrying value of our inventories to market
        value.  Future charges for inventory write-downs could be
        significantly larger than the $20 million recorded in 2007.


Our
        plans to significantly increase our NAND Flash memory production and sales
        have
        numerous risks.

We
        plan to significantly increase our
        NAND Flash production and sales in future periods.  As part of this
        plan, we have formed several manufacturing joint ventures with Intel and
        made
        substantial investments in capital expenditures for equipment, new facilities
        and research and development.  Our plans also require significant
        investments in capital expenditures and research and development.  We
        currently expect our capital spending for 2008 to approximate $2.5 billion,
        with
        a majority of the expenditures being made to support our NAND
        operations.  These investments involve numerous risks.  In
        addition, we are required to devote a significant portion of our existing
        semiconductor manufacturing capacity to the production of NAND Flash instead
        of
        the Company's other products.  We are party to a contract with Apple
        Inc. to provide NAND Flash products for an extended period of time at
        contractually determined prices.  We currently have a relatively small
        share of the world-wide market for NAND Flash.

Our
        NAND Flash strategy involves
        numerous risks, and may include the following:

·

increasing
                  our exposure to changes in average selling prices for NAND
                  Flash;

·

difficulties
                  in establishing new production operations at multiple
                  locations;

·

increasing
                  capital expenditures to increase production capacity and modify
                  existing
                  processes to produce NAND Flash;

·

raising
                  funds or increasing debt to finance future
                  investments;

·

diverting
                  management’s attention from DRAM and CMOS image sensor
                  operations;

·

managing
                  larger operations and facilities and employees in separate geographic
                  areas; and

·

hiring
                  and retaining key employees.

Our
        NAND Flash strategy may not be
        successful and could materially adversely affect our business, results of
        operations or financial condition.

The
        future success of our Imaging business will be dependent on continued market
        acceptance of our products and the development, introduction and marketing
        of
        new Imaging products.

We
        face competition in the image sensor
        market from a number of suppliers of CMOS image sensors including MagnaChip
        Semiconductor Ltd.; OmniVision Technologies, Inc.; Samsung Electronics Co.,
        Ltd;
        Sony Corporation; STMicroelectronics NV; Toshiba Corporation and from a number
        of suppliers of CCD image sensors including Matsushita Electric Industrial
        Co.,
        Ltd.; Sharp Corporation and Sony Corporation.  In recent periods, a
        number of new companies have entered the CMOS image sensor
        market.  Competitors include many large domestic and international
        companies that have greater presence in key markets, better access to certain
        customer bases, greater name recognition and more established strategic and
        financial relationships than the Company.

Our
        Imaging net sales and gross margins
        decreased in 2007 and we faced increased competition.  There can be no
        assurance that we will be able to grow or maintain our market share or gross
        margins for Imaging products in the future.  The success of our
        Imaging business will depend on a number of factors, including:

·

development
                  of products that maintain a technological advantage over the products
                  of
                  our competitors;

·

accurate
                  prediction of market requirements and evolving standards, including
                  pixel
                  resolution, output interface standards, power requirements, optical
                  lens
                  size, input standards and other
                  requirements;

·

timely
                  completion and introduction of new Imaging products that satisfy
                  customer
                  requirements;

·

timely
                  achievement of design wins with prospective customers, as manufacturers
                  may be reluctant to change their source of components due to the
                  significant costs, time, effort and risk associated with qualifying
                  a new
                  supplier; and


·

efficient,
                  cost-effective manufacturing as we transition to new products and
                  higher
                  volumes.

The
        Company is exploring business model
        alternatives for its Imaging business including partnering
        arrangements.  To the extent we form a partnering arrangement; the
        resulting business model may not be successful and the Imaging operations
        revenues and margins could be adversely affected.  We may incur
        significant costs to convert Imaging operations to a new business structure
        and
        operations could be disrupted.  If our efforts to restructure the
        Imaging business are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations or
        financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

We
        may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and
        make
        adequate capital investments.

Our
        cash flows from operations depend
        primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and CMOS image sensors sold,
        average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs.  To develop
        new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating
        efficiencies and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital
        investments in manufacturing technology, facilities and capital equipment,
        research and development, and product and process technology.  We
        expect capital spending for 2008 to approximate $2.5 billion.  Cash
        and investments of IM Flash and TECH are generally not available to finance
        our
        other operations.  In addition to cash provided by operations, we have
        from time to time utilized external sources of financing.  Access to
        capital markets has historically been very important to us.  Depending
        on market conditions, we may issue registered or unregistered securities
        to
        raise capital to fund a portion of our operations.  There can be no
        assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund
        our
        operations, make adequate capital investments or access capital markets on
        acceptable terms, and an inability to do so could have a material adverse
        effect
        on our business and results of operations.

We
        expect to make future acquisitions and alliances, which involve numerous
        risks.

Acquisitions
        and the formation of
        alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve
        numerous risks including the following:

·

difficulties
                  in integrating the operations, technologies and products of acquired
                  or
                  newly formed entities,

·

increasing
                  capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain
                  facilities,

·

increasing
                  debt to finance any acquisition or formation of a new
                  business,

·

diverting
                  management’s attention from normal daily
                  operations,

·

managing
                  larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees
                  in separate
                  geographic areas, and

·

hiring
                  and retaining key employees.

Acquisitions
        of, or alliances with,
        high-technology companies are inherently risky, and any future transactions
        may
        not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business, results
        of
        operations or financial condition.

We
        may not realize the expected benefits of new initiatives to reduce costs
        and
        increase revenue across our operations.

We
        are pursuing a number of initiatives
        to reduce costs and increase revenue across our operations. These initiatives
        include workforce reductions in certain areas as we realign our
        business.  Additional initiatives include establishing certain
        operations closer in location to our global customers, evaluating functions
        more
        efficiently performed through partnerships or other outside relationships
        and
        reducing our overhead costs to meet or exceed industry benchmarks.  We
        are also exploring opportunities to leverage our technology and diversified
        product portfolio to increase revenue and shareholder value.  In the
        fourth quarter of 2007, we incurred a restructure charge of $19 million
        consisting primarily of employee severance and related costs resulting from
        a
        reduction in our workforce.  We anticipate that we will incur some
        level of restructure charges through the end of 2008 as we continue to implement
        these initiatives.  We may not realize the expected benefits of these
        new initiatives.  As a result of these initiatives, we expect to incur
        restructuring or other infrequent charges and we may experience disruptions
        in
        our operations, loss of key personnel and difficulties in delivering products
        timely.


Our
        net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be
        limited.

We
        have significant net operating loss
        and tax credit carryforwards.  We have provided significant valuation
        allowances against the tax benefit of such losses as well as certain tax
        credit
        carryforwards.  Utilization of these net operating losses and credit
        carryforwards is dependent upon us achieving sustained
        profitability.  As a consequence of prior business acquisitions,
        utilization of the tax benefits for some of the tax carryforwards is subject
        to
        limitations imposed by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and some
        portion
        or all of these carryforwards may not be available to offset any future taxable
        income.  The determination of the limitations is complex and requires
        significant judgment and analysis of past transactions.

Changes
        in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our
        business, results of operations or financial condition.

Our
        financial statements are prepared
        in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are reported in U.S. dollars.  Across
        our multi-national operations, there are transactions and balances denominated
        in other currencies, primarily the euro, yen and Singapore dollar.  We
        estimate that, based on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies
        other than U.S. dollar as of August 30, 2007, a 1% change in the exchange
        rate
        versus the U.S. dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of
        approximately U.S. $3 million for the Singapore dollar, U.S. $2 million for
        the
        euro and U.S. $1 million for the yen.  In the event that the U.S.
        dollar weakens significantly compared to the Singapore dollar, euro or yen,
        our
        results of operations or financial condition will be adversely
        affected.

New
        product development may be unsuccessful.

We
        are developing new products that
        complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design
        or process technology.  We have made significant investments in
        product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources
        for new semiconductor product development over the next several
        years.  The process to develop NAND Flash, Imaging and certain
        specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality
        and
        performance, many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production,
        in
        order to secure design wins with our customers.  There can be no
        assurance that our product development efforts will be successful, that we
        will
        be able to cost-effectively manufacture these new products, that we will
        be able
        to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales
        of
        these products will recover costs of development efforts.

An
        adverse determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe
        the
        intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect
        our
        business, results of operations or financial condition.

As
        is typical in the semiconductor and
        other high technology industries, from time to time, others have asserted,
        and
        may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe
        their intellectual property rights.  In this regard, we are engaged in
        litigation with Rambus, Inc. ("Rambus") relating to certain of Rambus' patents
        and certain of our claims and defenses.  On August 28, 2000, we filed
        a complaint (subsequently amended) against Rambus in the U.S. District Court
        for
        the District of Delaware seeking monetary damages and declaratory and injunctive
        relief.  Among other things, our amended complaint alleges violation
        of federal antitrust laws, breach of contract, fraud, deceptive trade practices,
        and negligent misrepresentation.  The complaint also seeks a
        declaratory judgment (a) that certain Rambus patents are not infringed by
        us,
        are invalid, and/or are unenforceable, (b) that we have an implied license
        to
        those patents, and (c) that Rambus is estopped from enforcing those patents
        against us.  On February 15, 2001, Rambus filed an answer and
        counterclaim in Delaware denying that we are entitled to relief, alleging
        infringement of the eight Rambus patents named in our declaratory judgment
        claim, and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief.  A number
        of other suits are pending in Europe alleging that certain of our SDRAM and
        DDR
        SDRAM products infringe various of Rambus' country counterparts to its European
        patent 525 068, including: on September 1, 2000, Rambus filed suit against
        Micron Semiconductor (Deutschland) GmbH in the District Court of Mannheim,
        Germany; on September 22, 2000, Rambus filed a complaint against us and
        Reptronic (a distributor of our products) in the Court of First Instance
        of
        Paris, France; and on September 29, 2000, we filed suit against Rambus in
        the
        Civil Court of Milan, Italy, alleging invalidity and
        non-infringement.  In addition, on December 29, 2000, we filed suit
        against Rambus in the Civil Court of Avezzano, Italy, alleging invalidity
        and
        non-infringement of the Italian counterpart to European patent 1 004
        956.  Additionally, other suits are pending alleging that certain of
        our DDR SDRAM products infringe Rambus' country counterparts to its European
        patent 1 022 642, including: on August 10, 2001, Rambus filed suit against
        us
        and Assitec (an electronics retailer) in the Civil Court of Pavia, Italy;
        and on
        August 14, 2001, Rambus filed suit against Micron Semiconductor (Deutschland)
        GmbH in the District Court of Mannheim, Germany.  In the European
        suits against us, Rambus is seeking monetary damages and injunctive
        relief.  Subsequent to the filing of the various European suits, the
        European Patent Office declared Rambus' 525 068 and 1 004 956 European patents
        invalid and revoked the patents.  On January 13, 2006, Rambus filed a
        lawsuit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
        California alleging infringement of eighteen Rambus patents.  We are
        also engaged in litigation with Mosaid Technologies, Inc.
        ("Mosaid").  On July 24, 2006, we


filed
        a
        declaratory judgment action against Mosaid in the U.S. District Court for
        the
        Northern District of California seeking, among other things, a court
        determination that fourteen Mosaid patents are invalid, not enforceable,
        and/or
        not infringed.  On July 25, 2006, Mosaid filed a lawsuit against us
        and others in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging
        infringement of nine Mosaid patents.  On August 31, 2006, Mosaid filed
        an amended complaint adding two additional Mosaid patents.  On October
        23, 2006, the California Court dismissed our declaratory judgment suit based
        on
        lack of jurisdiction.  We have appealed that decision to the U.S.
        Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

Among
        other things, the above lawsuits
        pertain to certain of our SDRAM, DDR SDRAM, DDR2 SDRAM, RLDRAM, and image
        sensor
        products, which account for a significant portion of our net sales.

A
        court determination that our products
        or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others
        could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material
        changes
        to our products and/or manufacturing processes.  We are unable to
        predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against
        us.  Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our
        business, results of operations or financial condition.

We
        have a number of patent and
        intellectual property license agreements.  Some of these license
        agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments.  We may
        need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements
        in the future.  We are unable to predict whether these license
        agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms.

Allegations
        of anticompetitive conduct.

On
        June 17, 2002, we received a grand
        jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
        California seeking information regarding an investigation by the Antitrust
        Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ") into possible antitrust
        violations in the "Dynamic Random Access Memory" or "DRAM"
        industry.  We are cooperating fully and actively with the DOJ in its
        investigation of the DRAM industry.  Our cooperation is pursuant to
        the terms of the DOJ's Corporate Leniency Policy, which provides that in
        exchange for our full, continuing and complete cooperation in the pending
        investigation, we will not be subject to prosecution, fines or other penalties
        from the DOJ.

Subsequent
        to the commencement of the
        DOJ investigation, a number of purported class action lawsuits have been
        filed
        against us and other DRAM suppliers.  Four cases have been filed in
        the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California asserting
        claims
        on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that indirectly
        purchased DRAM and/or products containing DRAM from various DRAM suppliers
        during the time period from April 1, 1999 through at least June 30,
        2002.  The complaints allege price fixing in violation of federal
        antitrust laws and various state antitrust and unfair competition laws and
        seek
        treble monetary damages, restitution, costs, interest and attorneys'
        fees.  In addition, at least sixty-four cases have been filed in
        various state and federal courts (five of which have been dismissed) asserting
        claims on behalf of a purported class of indirect purchasers of
        DRAM.  Cases have been filed in the following states: Arkansas,
        Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Maine,
        Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota,
        Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Ohio,
        Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin,
        and
        West Virginia, and also in the District of Columbia and Puerto
        Rico.  The complaints purport to be on behalf of individuals and
        entities that indirectly purchased DRAM and/or products containing DRAM in
        the
        respective jurisdictions during various time periods ranging from April 1999
        through at least June 2002.  The complaints allege violations of
        various jurisdictions' antitrust, consumer protection and/or unfair competition
        laws relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM products and seek treble monetary
        damages, restitution, costs, interest and attorneys' fees.  A number
        of these cases have been removed to federal court and transferred to the
        U.S.
        District Court for the Northern District of California (San Francisco) for
        consolidated proceedings.  On June 1, 2007, the Court granted in part
        and denied in part our motion to dismiss the consolidated
        complaint.  Plaintiffs subsequently have filed an amended
        complaint.

Additionally,
        three cases have been
        filed in the following Canadian courts: Superior Court, District of Montreal,
        Province of Quebec; Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Ontario; and Supreme
        Court of British Columbia, Vancouver Registry, British Columbia.  The
        substantive allegations in these cases are similar to those asserted in the
        cases filed in the United States.


In
        addition, various states, through
        their Attorneys General, have filed suit against us and other DRAM
        manufacturers.  On July 14, 2006, and on September 8, 2006 in an
        amended complaint, the following states filed suit in the U.S. District Court
        for the Northern District of California: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California,
        Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana,
        Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska,
        Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,
        Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah,
        Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and the Commonwealth
        of
        the Northern Mariana Islands.  The amended complaint alleges, among
        other things, violations of the Sherman Act, Cartwright Act, and certain
        other
        states' consumer protection and antitrust laws and seeks damages, and injunctive
        and other relief.  Additionally, on July 13, 2006, the State of New
        York filed a similar suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
        of New York.  That case was subsequently transferred to the U.S.
        District Court for the Northern District of California for pre-trial
        purposes.  Three states, Ohio, New Hampshire, and Texas, subsequently
        have withdrawn from the complaint.

In
        February and March 2007, All
        American Semiconductor, Inc., Jaco Electronics, Inc., and the DRAM Claims
        Liquidation Trust each filed suit against the Company and other DRAM suppliers
        in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California after
        opting-out of a direct purchaser class action suit that was
        settled.  The complaints allege, among other things, violations of
        federal and state antitrust and competition laws in the DRAM industry, and
        seek
        damages, injunctive relief, and other remedies.

On
        October 11, 2006, we received a
        grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
        of
        California seeking information regarding an investigation by the DOJ into
        possible antitrust violations in the "Static Random Access Memory" or "SRAM"
        industry.  We believe that we are not a target of the investigation
        and we are cooperating with the DOJ in its investigation of the SRAM
        industry.

Subsequent
        to the issuance of subpoenas
        to the SRAM industry, a number of purported class action lawsuits have been
        filed against us and other SRAM suppliers.  Six cases have been filed
        in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California asserting
        claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that purchased
        SRAM directly from various SRAM suppliers during the period from January
        1, 1998
        through December 31, 2005.  Additionally, at least seventy-four cases
        have been filed in various U.S. District Courts asserting claims on behalf
        of a
        purported class of individuals and entities that indirectly purchased SRAM
        and/or products containing SRAM from various SRAM suppliers during the time
        period from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2005.  The complaints
        allege price fixing in violation of federal antitrust laws and state antitrust
        and unfair competition laws and seek treble monetary damages, restitution,
        costs, interest and attorneys' fees.

In
        September 2007, a number of memory
        suppliers confirmed that they had received grand jury subpoenas from the
        U.S.
        District Court for the Northern District of California seeking information
        regarding an investigation by the DOJ into possible antitrust violations
        in the
        "Flash" industry.  We have not received a subpoena and believe that we
        are not a target of the investigation.

At
        least thirty-four purported class
        action lawsuits have been filed against the Company and other suppliers of
        Flash
        memory products in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
        California and other federal district courts.  These cases assert
        claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that purchased
        Flash memory directly or indirectly from various Flash memory suppliers during
        the period from January 1, 1999 through the date the various cases were
        filed.  The complaints generally allege price fixing in violation of
        federal antitrust laws and various state antitrust and unfair competition
        laws
        and seek monetary damages, restitution, costs, interest, and attorneys'
        fees.

On
        May 5, 2004, Rambus filed a
        complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California (San Francisco
        County) against us and other DRAM suppliers.  The complaint alleges
        various causes of action under California state law including conspiracy
        to
        restrict output and fix prices on Rambus DRAM ("RDRAM"), and unfair
        competition.  The complaint seeks treble damages, punitive damages,
        attorneys' fees, costs, and a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants
        from
        the conduct alleged in the complaints.

We
        are unable to predict the outcome of
        these lawsuits and investigations.  The final resolution of these
        alleged violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability
        and
        could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
        or
        financial condition.


Allegations
        of violations of securities laws.

On
        February 24, 2006, a putative class
        action complaint was filed against us and certain of our officers in the
        U.S.
        District Court for the District of Idaho alleging claims under Section 10(b)
        and
        20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5
        promulgated thereunder.  Four substantially similar complaints
        subsequently were filed in the same Court.  The cases purport to be
        brought on behalf of a class of purchasers of our stock during the period
        February 24, 2001 to February 13, 2003.  The five lawsuits have been
        consolidated and a consolidated amended class action complaint was filed
        on July
        24, 2006.  The complaint generally alleges violations of federal
        securities laws based on, among other things, claimed misstatements or omissions
        regarding alleged illegal price-fixing conduct.  The complaint seeks
        unspecified damages, interest, attorneys' fees, costs, and
        expenses.

In
        addition, on March 23, 2006 a
        shareholder derivative action was filed in the Fourth District Court for
        the
        State of Idaho (Ada County), allegedly on behalf of and for our benefit,
        against
        certain of our current and former officers and directors.  We were
        also named as a nominal defendant.  An amended complaint was filed on
        August 23, 2006.  The complaint is based on the same allegations of
        fact as in the securities class actions filed in the U.S. District Court
        for the
        District of Idaho and alleges breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control,
        gross
        mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, and insider
        trading.  The complaint seeks unspecified damages, restitution,
        disgorgement of profits, equitable and injunctive relief, attorneys' fees,
        costs, and expenses.  The complaint is derivative in nature and does
        not seek monetary damages from us.  However, we may be required,
        throughout the pendency of the action, to advance payment of legal fees and
        costs incurred by the defendants.  On May 29, 2007, the Court granted
        our motion to dismiss the complaint but provided plaintiffs leave to file
        an
        amended complaint.  On September 6, 2007, plaintiffs filed an amended
        complaint.

In
        March 2006, following our
        announcement of a definitive agreement to acquire Lexar Media, Inc. ("Lexar")
        in
        a stock-for-stock merger, four purported class action complaints were filed
        in
        the Superior Court for the State of California (Alameda County) on behalf
        of
        shareholders of Lexar against Lexar and its directors.  Two of the
        complaints also name us as a defendant.  The complaints allege that
        the defendants breached, or aided and abetted the breach of, fiduciary duties
        owed to Lexar shareholders by, among other things, engaging in self-dealing,
        failing to engage in efforts to obtain the highest price reasonably available,
        and failing to properly value Lexar in connection with a merger transaction
        between Lexar and us.  The plaintiffs seek, among other things,
        injunctive relief preventing, or an order of rescission reversing, the merger,
        compensatory damages, interest, attorneys' fees, and costs.  On May
        19, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking
        to
        block the merger.  On May 31, 2006, the Court denied the
        motion.  An amended consolidated complaint was filed on October 10,
        2006.  On June 14, 2007, the Court granted Lexar's and our motions to
        dismiss the amended complaint but allowed plaintiffs leave to file a further
        amended complaint.  On July 16, 2007, plaintiffs filed an amended
        complaint.

We
        are unable to predict the outcome of
        these cases.  A court determination in any of the class actions
        against us could result in significant liability and could have a material
        adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
        condition.

We
        face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could
        materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial
        condition.

Sales
        to customers outside the United
        States approximated 70% of our consolidated net sales for 2007.  In
        addition, we have manufacturing operations in China, Italy, Japan, Puerto
        Rico
        and Singapore.  Our international sales and operations are subject to
        a variety of risks, including:

·

currency
                  exchange rate fluctuations,

·

export
                  and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, and
                  restrictions on the transfer of
                  funds,

·

political
                  and economic instability,

·

problems
                  with the transportation or delivery of our
                  products,

·

issues
                  arising from cultural or language differences and labor
                  unrest,

·

longer
                  payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable,
                  and

·

compliance
                  with trade and other laws in a variety of
                  jurisdictions.


These
        factors may materially adversely
        affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

If
        our manufacturing process is disrupted, our business, results of operations
        or
        financial condition could be materially adversely
        affected.

We
        manufacture products using highly
        complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous
        modification to improve yields and performance.  Difficulties in the
        manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce
        yields or disrupt production and may increase our per megabit manufacturing
        costs.  Additionally, our control over operations at our IM Flash,
        TECH and MP Mask joint ventures may be limited by our agreements with our
        partners.  From time to time, we have experienced minor disruptions in
        our manufacturing process as a result of power outages or equipment
        failures.  If production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for
        any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable
        to meet our customers' requirements and they may purchase products from other
        suppliers.  This could result in a significant increase in
        manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships,
        which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations
        or
        financial condition.

Disruptions
        in our supply of raw materials could materially adversely affect our business,
        results of operations or financial condition.

Our
        operations require raw materials
        that meet exacting standards.  We generally have multiple sources of
        supply for our raw materials.  However, only a limited number of
        suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our
        standards.  Various factors could reduce the availability of raw
        materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, lead frames
        and
        molding compound.

Shortages
        may occur from time to time
        in the future.  In addition, disruptions in transportation lines could
        delay our receipt of raw materials.  Lead times for the supply of raw
        materials have been extended in the past.  If our supply of raw
        materials is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results
        of
        operations or financial condition could be materially adversely
        affected.

Disruptions
        in our supply of raw materials could materially adversely affect our business,
        results of operations or financial condition.

Products
        that do not meet
        specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain,
        defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose
        significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business,
        results of operations or financial condition.

Because
        the design and production
        process for semiconductor memory is highly complex, it is possible that we
        may
        produce products that do not comply with customer specifications, contain
        defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses.  If, despite
        design review, quality control and product qualification procedures, problems
        with nonconforming, defective or incompatible products occur after we have
        shipped such products, we could be adversely affected in several ways, including
        the following:

·

we
                  may replace product or otherwise compensate customers for costs
                  incurred
                  or damages caused by defective or incompatible product,
                  and

·

we
                  may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in
                  sales of
                  our products.

Economic
        and political conditions may harm our business.

Global
        economic conditions and the
        effects of military or terrorist actions may cause significant disruptions
        to
        worldwide commerce.  If these disruptions result in delays or
        cancellations of customer orders, a decrease in corporate spending on
        information technology or our inability to effectively market, manufacture
        or
        ship our products.  Global economic conditions may also affect
        consumer demand for devices that incorporate our products such as mobile
        phones,
        personal computers, Flash memory cards and USB devices.  As a result,
        our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially
        adversely affected.

The
        Company’s corporate headquarters
        are located in Boise, Idaho.  The following is a summary of the

Legal
        Proceedings

On
        August 28, 2000, the Company filed a
        complaint against Rambus, Inc. (“Rambus”) in the U.S. District Court for the
        District of Delaware seeking monetary damages and declaratory and injunctive
        relief.  Among other things, the Company’s complaint (as amended)
        alleges violation of federal antitrust laws, breach of contract, fraud,
        deceptive trade practices, and negligent misrepresentation.  The
        complaint also seeks a declaratory judgment (a) that certain Rambus patents
        are
        not infringed by the Company, are invalid, and/or are unenforceable, (b)
        that
        the Company has an implied license to those patents, and (c) that Rambus
        is
        estopped from enforcing those patents against the Company.  On
        February 15, 2001, Rambus filed an answer and counterclaim in Delaware denying
        that the Company is entitled to relief, alleging infringement of the eight
        Rambus patents named in the Company’s declaratory judgment claim, and seeking
        monetary damages and injunctive relief.  A number of other suits are
        currently pending in Europe alleging that certain of the Company’s SDRAM and DDR
        SDRAM products infringe various of Rambus’ country counterparts to its European
        patent 525 068, including: on September 1, 2000, Rambus filed suit against
        Micron Semiconductor (Deutschland) GmbH in the District Court of Mannheim,
        Germany; on September 22, 2000, Rambus filed a complaint against the Company
        and
        Reptronic (a distributor of the Company’s products) in the Court of First
        Instance of Paris, France; on September 29, 2000, the Company filed suit
        against
        Rambus in the Civil Court of Milan, Italy, alleging invalidity and
        non-infringement.  In addition, on December 29, 2000, the Company
        filed suit against Rambus in the Civil Court of Avezzano, Italy, alleging
        invalidity and non-infringement of the Italian counterpart to European patent
        004 956.  Additionally, other suits are pending alleging that certain
        of our DDR SDRAM products infringe Rambus’ country counterparts to its European
        patent 1 022 642, including: on August 10, 2001, Rambus filed suit against
        the
        Company and Assitec (an electronics retailer) in the Civil Court of Pavia,
        Italy; and on August 14, 2001, Rambus filed suit against Micron Semiconductor
        (Deutschland) GmbH in the District Court of Mannheim, Germany.  In the
        European suits against the Company, Rambus is seeking monetary damages and
        injunctive relief.  Subsequent to the filing of the various European
        suits, the European Patent Office declared Rambus’ 525 068 and 1 004 956
        European patents invalid and revoked the patents.  On January 13,
        2006, Rambus filed a lawsuit against the Company in the U.S. District Court
        for
        the Northern District of California alleging infringement of eighteen Rambus
        patents.


On
        July 24, 2006, the Company filed a
        declaratory judgment action against Mosaid Technologies, Inc. (“Mosaid”) in the
        U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking, among
        other
        things, a court determination that fourteen Mosaid patents are invalid, not
        enforceable, and/or not infringed.  On July 25, 2006, Mosaid filed a
        lawsuit against the Company and others in the U.S. District Court for the
        Eastern District of Texas alleging infringement of nine Mosaid
        patents.  On August 31, 2006, Mosaid filed an amended complaint adding
        two additional Mosaid patents.  On October 23, 2006, the California
        Court dismissed the Company’s declaratory judgment suit based on lack of
        jurisdiction.  The Company has appealed that decision to the U.S.
        Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

Among
        other things, the above lawsuits
        pertain to certain of the Company’s SDRAM, DDR SDRAM, DDR2 SDRAM, RLDRAM, and
        image sensor products, which account for a significant portion of the Company’s
        net sales.

The
        Company is unable to predict the
        outcome of these suits.  A court determination that the Company’s
        products or manufacturing processes infringe the product or process intellectual
        property rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require
        the Company to make material changes to its products and/or manufacturing
        processes.  Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse
        effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial
        condition.

On
        June 17, 2002, the Company received
        a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
        of
        California seeking information regarding an investigation by the Antitrust
        Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) into possible antitrust
        violations in the “Dynamic Random Access Memory” or “DRAM”
industry.  The Company is cooperating fully and actively with the DOJ
        in its investigation.  The Company’s cooperation is pursuant to the
        terms of the DOJ’s Corporate Leniency Policy, which provides that in exchange
        for our full, continuing and complete cooperation in the pending investigation,
        the Company will not be subject to prosecution, fines or other penalties
        from
        the DOJ.

Subsequent
        to the commencement of the
        DOJ investigation, a number of purported class action lawsuits have been
        filed
        against the Company and other DRAM suppliers.  Four cases have been
        filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
        asserting claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities
        that
        indirectly purchased DRAM and/or products containing DRAM from various DRAM
        suppliers during the time period from April 1, 1999 through at least June
        30,
        2002.  The complaints allege price fixing in violation of federal
        antitrust laws and various state antitrust and unfair competition laws and
        seek
        treble monetary damages, restitution, costs, interest and attorneys’
fees.  In addition, at least sixty-four cases have been filed in
        various state courts asserting claims on behalf of a purported class of indirect
        purchasers of DRAM.  Cases have been filed in the following
        states:  Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas,
        Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina,
        North Dakota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New
        York,
        Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin,
        and West Virginia, and also in the District of Columbia and Puerto
        Rico.  The complaints purport to be on behalf of a class of
        individuals and entities that indirectly purchased DRAM and/or products
        containing DRAM in the respective jurisdictions during various time periods
        ranging from April 1999 through at least June 2002.  The complaints
        allege violations of the various jurisdictions’ antitrust, consumer protection
        and/or unfair competition laws relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM products
        and seek treble monetary damages, restitution, costs, interest and attorneys’
fees.  A number of these cases have been removed to federal court and
        transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
        (San Francisco) for consolidated proceedings.   On June 1, 2007,
        the Court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss the
        consolidated complaint.  Plaintiffs subsequently have filed an amended
        complaint.

Additionally,
        three cases have been
        filed in the following Canadian courts:  Superior Court, District of
        Montreal, Province of Quebec; Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Ontario;
        and
        Supreme Court of British Columbia, Vancouver Registry, British
        Columbia.  The substantive allegations in these cases are similar to
        those asserted in the cases filed in the United States.

In
        addition, various states, through
        their Attorneys General, have filed suit against the Company and other DRAM
        manufacturers.  On July 14, 2006, and on September 8, 2006 in an
        amended complaint, the following states filed suit in the U.S. District Court
        for the Northern District of California:  Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas,
        California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa,
        Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,
        Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina,
        North
        Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina,
        Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin
        and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.  The amended
        complaint alleges, among other things, violations of the Sherman Act, Cartwright
        Act, and certain other states’ consumer protection and antitrust laws and seeks
        damages, and injunctive and other relief.  Additionally, on July 13,
        2006, the State of New York filed a similar suit in the U.S. District Court
        for
        the Southern District of New York.  That case was subsequently
        transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
        for pre-trial purposes.  Three states, Ohio, New Hampshire, and Texas,
        subsequently have withdrawn from the complaint.


On
        February 28, 2007, February 28, 2007
        and March 8, 2007, cases were filed against the Company and other manufacturers
        of DRAM in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
        by
        All American Semiconductor, Inc., Jaco Electronics, Inc. and DRAM Claims
        Liquidation Trust, respectively, that opted-out of a direct purchaser class
        action suit that was settled.  The complaints allege, among other
        things, violations of federal and state antitrust and competition laws in
        the
        DRAM industry, and seek damages, injunctive relief, and other
        remedies.

On
        October 11, 2006, the Company
        received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Northern
        District of California seeking information regarding an investigation by
        the DOJ
        into possible antitrust violations in the “Static Random Access Memory” or
“SRAM” industry.  The Company believes that it is not a target of the
        investigation and is cooperating with the DOJ in its investigation of the
        SRAM
        industry.

Subsequent
        to the issuance of subpoenas
        to the SRAM industry, a number of purported class action lawsuits have been
        filed against the Company and other SRAM suppliers.  Six cases have
        been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
        asserting claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities
        that
        purchased SRAM directly from various SRAM suppliers during the period from
        January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2005.  Additionally, at least
        seventy-four cases have been filed in various U.S. District Courts asserting
        claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that
        indirectly purchased SRAM and/or products containing SRAM from various SRAM
        suppliers during the time period from January 1, 1998 through December 31,
        2005.  The complaints allege price fixing in violation of federal
        antitrust laws and state antitrust and unfair competition laws and seek treble
        monetary damages, restitution, costs, interest and attorneys’ fees.

In
        September 2007, a number of memory
        suppliers confirmed that they had received grand jury subpoenas from the
        U.S.
        District Court for the Northern District of California seeking information
        regarding an investigation by the DOJ into possible antitrust violations
        in the
        "Flash" industry.  The Company has not received a subpoena and
        believes that is not a target of the investigation.

At
        least thirty-four purported class
        action lawsuits have been filed against the Company and other suppliers of
        Flash
        memory products in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
        California and other federal district courts.  These cases assert
        claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that purchased
        Flash memory directly or indirectly from various Flash memory suppliers during
        the period from January 1, 1999 through the date the various cases were
        filed.  The complaints generally allege price fixing in violation of
        federal antitrust laws and various state antitrust and unfair competition
        laws
        and seek monetary damages, restitution, costs, interest, and attorneys’
fees.

On
        May 5, 2004, Rambus filed a
        complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California (San Francisco
        County) against the Company and other DRAM suppliers.  The complaint
        alleges various causes of action under California state law including a
        conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices on Rambus DRAM (“RDRAM”) and unfair
        competition.  The complaint seeks treble damages, punitive damages,
        attorneys’ fees, costs, and a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from
        the conduct alleged in the complaints.

The
        Company is unable to predict the
        outcome of these lawsuits and investigations.  The final resolution of
        these alleged violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability
        and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of
        operations or financial condition.

On
        February 24, 2006, a putative class
        action complaint was filed against the Company and certain of its officers
        in
        the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho alleging claims under Section
        10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule
        10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  Four substantially similar complaints
        subsequently were filed in the same Court.  The cases purport to be
        brought on behalf of a class of purchasers of the Company’s stock during the
        period February 24, 2001 to February 13, 2003.  The five lawsuits have
        been consolidated and a consolidated amended class action complaint was filed
        on
        July 24, 2006.  The complaint generally alleges violations of federal
        securities laws based on, among other things, claimed misstatements or omissions
        regarding alleged illegal price-fixing conduct or the Company’s operations and
        financial results.  The complaint seeks unspecified damages, interest,
        attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses.


In
        addition, on March 23, 2006 a
        shareholder derivative action was filed in the Fourth District Court for
        the
        State of Idaho (Ada County), allegedly on behalf of and for the benefit of
        the
        Company, against certain of the Company’s current and former officers and
        directors.  The Company also was named as a nominal
        defendant.  An amended complaint was filed on August 23,
        2006.  The complaint is based on the same allegations of fact as in
        the securities class actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the District
        of Idaho and alleges breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross
        mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, and insider
        trading.  The complaint seeks unspecified damages, restitution,
        disgorgement of profits, equitable and injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees,
        costs, and expenses.  The complaint is derivative in nature and does
        not seek monetary damages from the Company.  However, the Company may
        be required, throughout the pendency of the action, to advance payment of
        legal
        fees and costs incurred by the defendants.  On May 29, 2007, the Court
        granted the Company's motion to dismiss the complaint but provided plaintiffs
        leave to file an amended complaint.  On June 29, 2007, plaintiffs
        filed an amended complaint.

The
        Company is unable to predict the
        outcome of these cases.  A court determination in any of these actions
        against the Company could result in significant liability and could have
        a
        material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or
        financial condition.

In
        March 2006, following the Company’s
        announcement of a definitive agreement to acquire Lexar Media, Inc. (“Lexar”) in
        a stock-for-stock merger, four purported class action complaints were filed
        in
        the Superior Court for the State of California (Alameda County) on behalf
        of
        shareholders of Lexar against Lexar and its directors.  Two of the
        complaints also name the Company as a defendant.  The complaints
        allege that the defendants breached, or aided and abetted the breach of,
        fiduciary duties owed to Lexar shareholders by, among other things, engaging
        in
        self-dealing, failing to engage in efforts to obtain the highest price
        reasonably available, and failing to properly value Lexar in connection with
        a
        merger transaction between Lexar and the Company.  The plaintiffs
        seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing, or an order of
        rescission reversing, the merger, compensatory damages, interest, attorneys’
fees, and costs.  On May 19, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a motion for
        preliminary injunction seeking to block the merger.  On May 31, 2006,
        the Court denied the motion.  An amended consolidated complaint was
        filed on October 10, 2006.  On June 14, 2007, the Court granted
        Lexar's and the Company's motions to dismiss the amended complaint but allowed
        plaintiffs leave to file a further amended complaint.  The Company is
        unable to predict the outcome of these suits.  A court determination
        against the Company could result in significant liability and could have
        a
        material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or
        financial condition.  (See “Acquisitions – Item 8. Financial

Selected Financial Data

In
        the third quarter of 2006, the
        Company entered into an agreement with the Singapore Economic Development
        Board
        (“EDB”), a partner in its TECH Semiconductor joint venture, and on March 30,
        2007, the Company acquired all of the shares of TECH common stock held by

Overview

The
        Company is a global manufacturer of
        semiconductor devices, principally semiconductor memory products (including
        DRAM
        and NAND Flash) and CMOS image sensors.  The Company operates in two
        segments:  Memory and Imaging.  Its products are used in a
        broad range of electronic applications including personal computers,
        workstations, network servers, mobile phones and other consumer applications
        including Flash memory cards, USB storage devices, digital still cameras,
        MP3/4
        players and in automotive applications.  The Company markets its
        products through its internal sales force, independent sales representatives
        and
        distributors primarily to original equipment manufacturers and retailers
        located
        around the world.  The Company’s success is largely dependent on the
        market acceptance of a diversified portfolio of semiconductor memory products,
        efficient utilization of the Company’s manufacturing infrastructure, successful
        ongoing development of advanced process technologies and generation of
        sufficient return on research and development investments.

The
        Company is focused on improving its
        competitiveness by increasing manufacturing scale, improving its cost
        competitiveness and expanding its product portfolio within the semiconductor
        memory market.  The Company has increased its manufacturing scale in
        2007 by ramping NAND Flash production at two 300mm wafer fabrication facilities
        and beginning the conversion of another facility to 300mm DRAM wafer
        fabrication.  The Company continues to explore other options to
        increase its manufacturing scale.  To reduce costs, the Company is
        implementing restructure initiatives aimed at reducing manufacturing and
        overhead costs through outsourcing, relocation of operations and workforce
        reductions.  In recent years the Company has strategically entered
        into the NAND Flash memory and specialty DRAM markets and has experienced
        significant revenue growth from these products.  The Company is able
        to leverage its existing product and process technology and semiconductor
        memory
        manufacturing expertise in these markets.

To
        improve its focus on the
        semiconductor memory market, the Company is exploring business model
        alternatives for its Imaging business including partnering
        arrangements.  Under any of the alternatives being considered, the
        Company expects that it will continue to manufacture CMOS image
        sensors.

The
        Company has partnered with Intel to
        form two NAND Flash manufacturing joint ventures:  IM Flash
        Technologies, LLC and IM Flash Singapore LLP (collectively “IM
        Flash”).  IM Flash operations include two 300mm wafer fabrication
        facilities that are expected to greatly increase the Company’s production of
        NAND Flash in 2008.  IM Flash Singapore LLP began construction of a
        new 300mm wafer fabrication facility in Singapore in 2007.  The
        Company expects to contribute approximately $1.7 billion in cash to IM Flash
        over the next three years, with similar contributions to be made by
        Intel.  Completion of the facility in Singapore is subject to the
        mutual agreement of the joint venture partners.  As of August 30,
        2007, the Company owned 51% and Intel owned 49% of IM Flash.  The
        parties share output of IM Flash generally in proportion to their ownership
        in
        IM Flash.


The
        Company makes significant ongoing
        investments to implement its proprietary product and process technology in
        its
        facilities in the United States, Europe and Asia to manufacture semiconductor
        products with increasing functionality and performance at lower
        costs.  The Company continues to introduce new generations of products
        that offer improved performance characteristics, such as higher data transfer
        rates, reduced package size, lower power consumption and increased memory
        density and megapixel count.  The Company generally reduces the
        manufacturing cost of each generation of product through advancements in
        product
        and process technology such as its leading-edge line width process technology
        and innovative array architecture.

In
        order to maximize returns from
        investments in research and development (“R&D”), the Company develops
        process technology that effectively reduces production costs and leverages
        the
        Company’s capital expenditures.  To be successfully incorporated in
        customers’ end products, the Company must offer qualified semiconductor
        solutions at a time when customers are developing their design specifications
        for their end products.  In addition, DRAM and NAND Flash products
        necessarily incorporate highly advanced design and process
        technologies.  The Company must make significant investments in
        R&D to expand its product offering and develop its leading-edge product and
        process technologies.  To leverage its R&D investments, the
        Company has formed strategic joint ventures under which the costs of developing
        NAND Flash memory product and process technologies are shared with its joint
        venture partner.  In addition, from time to time, the Company has also
        sold and/or licensed technology to third parties.  The Company is
        pursuing further opportunities to recover its investment in intellectual
        property through partnering and other arrangements.

Restructure:

The
        Company is pursuing a number of initiatives to reduce costs and increase
        revenue
        across its operations.  These initiatives include workforce reductions
        in certain areas of the Company as the Company’s business is
        realigned.  Additional initiatives include establishing certain
        operations closer in location to the Company’s global customers, evaluating
        functions more efficiently performed through partnerships or other outside
        relationships and reducing the Company’s overhead costs to meet or exceed
        industry benchmarks.  The Company is also exploring opportunities to
        leverage the Company’s technology and diversified product portfolio to increase
        revenue and shareholder value.  It is anticipated that these
        initiatives will be implemented over several quarters.

In
        the fourth quarter of 2007, the
        Company incurred a restructure charge of $19 million in connection with the
        implementation of these cost reduction initiatives.  The fourth
        quarter charge was comprised primarily of employee severance and related
        costs
        resulting from a reduction in the Company’s workforce.  The Company
        anticipates that it will incur some level of restructure charges through
        the end
        of 2008 as it continues to implement these initiatives, but is currently
        unable
        to estimate the aggregate amount of such charges.

Results
        of Operations

The
        Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or
        53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31.


Net
        Sales

Total
        net sales for 2007 increased 8%
        as compared to 2006 primarily due to an 11% increase in Memory sales partially
        offset by an 8% decline in Imaging sales.  Memory sales for 2007
        reflect a 204% increase in megabits sold partially offset by a 64% decline
        in
        per megabit average selling prices from 2006.  Memory sales were 88%
        of total net sales in 2007 compared to 86% in 2006 and 94% in
        2005.  Imaging sales for 2007 decreased 8% from 2006 reflecting
        industry softness in mobile handset sales and pricing pressure.  Total
        net sales for 2006 increased 8% as compared to 2005 primarily reflecting
        a 147%
        increase in Imaging sales as Memory sales declined 1%.

Memory:

Memory
        sales for 2007 increased 11% from 2006 primarily due to a 287% increase in
        sales
        of NAND Flash products offset by an 11% decrease in sales of DRAM
        products.

Sales
        of NAND Flash products for 2007
        increased from 2006 primarily due to significant increases in megabits
        manufactured and the Company’s acquisition of Lexar Media, Inc. (which occurred
        in the fourth quarter of 2006), partially offset by a 56% decline in average
        selling prices per megabit.  Megabit production of NAND Flash products
        increased over 800% for 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily due to the ramp
        of
        NAND Flash products at the Company’s 300mm fabrication facilities and
        transitions to higher density, advanced geometry devices.  Sales of
        NAND Flash products represented 23% of the Company’s total net sales for 2007 as
        compared to 6% for 2006.  The Company expects that sales of NAND Flash
        products will continue to increase in 2008 as it continues to ramp production
        capacity at its 300mm wafer fabrication facilities.

Sales
        of DRAM products for 2007
        decreased from 2006 primarily due to a 23% decline in average selling prices
        (which includes the effects of a $50 million charge to revenue in the first
        quarter of 2007 as a result of a settlement agreement with a class of direct
        purchasers of certain DRAM products), which was partially mitigated by a
        16%
        increase in megabits sold.  Megabit production of DRAM products
        increased 23% for 2007, primarily due to transitions to higher density, advanced
        geometry devices.  Sales of DDR and DDR2 DRAM products were 47% of the
        Company’s total net sales in 2007 as compared to 51% for 2006 and 59% for
        2005.

Memory
        sales for 2006 declined 1% from
        2005 as a 287% increase in sales of NAND Flash products was offset by a 5%
        decrease in sales of DRAM products.  Sales of NAND Flash products for
        2006 increased from 2005 primarily due to a significant increase in megabits
        sold partially offset by an approximate 35% decline in average selling
        prices.  Sales of NAND Flash products increased significantly for 2006
        as compared to 2005, primarily due to significant increases in manufacturing
        resources allocated to their production.  The decrease in sales of
        DRAM products in 2006 from 2005 was the result of a 22% decline in average
        selling prices mitigated by a 22% increase in megabits sold.  Megabit
        production of DRAM products increased 14% for 2006 as compared to 2005,
        primarily due to production efficiencies including improvements in product
        and
        process technologies partially offset by a reduction in wafer
        starts.

Imaging:

Imaging
        sales for 2007 decreased 8% from 2006 primarily due to declines in average
        selling prices as a result of industry softness in mobile handset sales and
        pricing pressure.  Declines in average selling prices were partially
        mitigated by increased sales of higher resolution products.  Imaging
        sales were 12% of the Company’s total net sales in 2007 as compared to 14% for
        2006 and 6% for 2005.  Imaging sales for 2006 increased by 147% from
        2005 as unit sales tripled, partially offset by a 19% decrease in average
        selling price per unit.  The decrease in average selling price per
        unit was due primarily to a significant increase of lower priced VGA products
        sold in 2006 as compared to 2005.  The growth in Imaging unit sales
        for 2006 reflected strong demand for the Company’s products and increased
        production.

Gross
        Margin

The
        Company’s overall gross margin
        percentage for 2007 declined to 19% from 23% for 2006 due to a decrease in
        both
        the gross margin percentages for Memory and Imaging products.  The
        Company’s overall gross margin percentage of 23% for 2006 was unchanged from
        2005 as a decrease in the gross margin percentage for Memory in 2006 to 19%
        from
        22% for 2005 was offset by a slight increase in the gross margin percentage
        for
        Imaging products and a shift in product mix to higher margin Imaging
        products.

Memory:

The
        Company’s gross margin percentage for Memory products of 17% for 2007 declined
        from 19% for 2006 primarily due to the shift in product mix to NAND Flash
        products, which had a significantly lower gross margin than DRAM products
        in
        2007.  This decline in gross margin percentage was mitigated by
        improvements in the gross margin for 2007 on sales of both DRAM and NAND
        Flash
        products as compared to 2006.


The
        gross margin for DRAM products for
        2007 improved from 2006, primarily due to a 27% reduction in costs per megabit,
        partially offset by a decline in average selling prices of 23%.  The
        Company achieved cost reductions for DRAM products through transitions to
        production of devices utilizing the Company’s advanced 78nm process
        technologies.

The
        Company’s gross margin on NAND
        Flash products for 2007 improved slightly from 2006 primarily due to a 57%
        reduction in costs per megabit, partially offset by a 56% decline in average
        selling prices.  Cost reductions in 2007 reflect lower manufacturing
        costs, lower costs of NAND Flash products purchased for sale under the Company’s
        Lexar brand and shifts in product mix.  The Company achieved
        manufacturing cost reductions for NAND Flash products primarily through
        increased production of higher-density, advanced-geometry devices at the
        Company’s 300mm fabrication facilities.  Sales of NAND Flash products
        include sales from IM Flash to Intel at long-term negotiated prices
        approximating cost.  IM Flash sales to Intel were $255 million and
        $111 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The
        Company’s gross margin for memory
        in 2007 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $20 million
        in the
        fourth quarter as a result of the significant decreases in average selling
        prices for our semiconductor memory products.  The Company may record
        additional write-downs in future periods if estimated average selling prices
        of
        products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarter
        end
        date are below the manufacturing cost of these products.

The
        Company’s gross margin percentage
        for Memory products declined to 19% for 2006 from 22% for 2005 primarily
        due to
        declining margins for NAND Flash products as a result of the 33% decrease
        in the
        average selling price per megabit and costs associated with the ramp in
        production at two facilities.  The gross margin percentage for DRAM
        products in 2006 was approximately the same as for 2005 as a 22% decrease
        in the
        average selling price per megabit was offset by cost reductions.  The
        Company achieved cost reductions for DRAM products in 2006 through improved
        product yields and an increase in production utilizing the Company’s 110nm and
        95nm process technologies.  The cost per megabit for products
        manufactured on 300mm wafers decreased significantly in 2006 compared to
        2005 as
        the Company continued to increase 300mm wafer production.

In
        2007, the Company’s TECH
        Semiconductor Singapore Pte. Ltd. (“TECH”) joint venture supplied approximately
        15% of the total megabits of memory produced by the Company (reflecting
        approximately 40% of total DRAM megabits).  TECH primarily produced
        DDR and DDR2 products in 2007 and 2006.  Since the beginning of the
        third quarter of 2006, TECH’s results have been included in the Company’s
        consolidated results.  Through the second quarter of 2006, the
        Company’s results reflected memory products purchased from TECH at prices
        generally based on a discount from average selling prices realized by the
        Company for the preceding quarter.  In the first six months of 2006,
        the Company realized higher gross margin percentages on sales of TECH products
        than on sales of similar products manufactured by the Company’s wholly-owned
        operations.  Since TECH utilizes the Company’s product designs and
        process technology and has a similar manufacturing cost structure, the gross
        margin on sales of TECH products since the third quarter of 2006 approximated
        those on sales of similar products manufactured by the Company’s wholly-owned
        operations.  In 2005, the Company’s gross margin percentages on sales
        of TECH products were approximately the same as on sales of similar products
        manufactured by the Company’s wholly-owned operations.  (See “Item 8.
        Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial
        Statements – Joint Ventures – TECH Semiconductor Singapore Pte.
        Ltd.”)

Imaging:

The
        Company’s gross margin for Imaging declined to 34% for 2007 from 43% for of 2006
        primarily due to declines in average selling prices that were mitigated by
        cost
        reductions and shifts in product mix to higher resolution
        products.  The Company’s gross margin percentage for Imaging products
        for 2006 increased to 43% from 42% for 2005, primarily due to reductions
        in
        costs partially offset by decreases in average selling prices.


Selling,
        General and Administrative

Selling,
        general and administrative
        (“SG&A”) expenses for 2007 increased 33% from 2006 primarily due to higher
        personnel costs and higher legal costs including a $31 million charge to
        SG&A as a result of the settlement of certain antitrust class action (direct
        purchaser) lawsuits.  Personnel costs in 2007 increased from 2006
        primarily due to increased headcount resulting from the acquisition of Lexar
        in
        the fourth quarter of 2006, the formation of IM Flash in the second quarter
        of
        2006 and subsequent ramp of its operations, and the consolidation of TECH
        in the
        third quarter of 2006.  SG&A expenses for 2006 increased 32% from
        2005 primarily due to higher compensation costs and increased costs associated
        with outstanding legal matters.  Payroll costs in 2006 increased from
        2005 primarily due to increased headcount resulting in part from the acquisition
        of Lexar, the ramp of IM Flash and the consolidation of TECH.  The
        Company expects SG&A expenses to approximate $125 million to $135 million
        for the first quarter of 2008.  Future SG&A expense is expected to
        vary, potentially significantly, depending on the number of legal matters
        that
        are resolved relatively early in their life-cycle and the number of matters
        that
        progress to trial.  The Company is involved in a number of significant
        cases which are scheduled for trial in 2008.  Additionally, the timing
        and final resolution of legal matters may cause SG&A expense to vary
        significantly.  For the Company’s Memory segment, SG&A expenses as
        a percentage of sales were 11% in 2007, 8% in 2006 and 7% in
        2005.  For the Imaging segment, SG&A expenses as a percentage of
        sales were 11% in 2007, 12% in 2006 and 11% in 2005.

Research
        and Development

Research
        and development (“R&D”)
        expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed,
        the
        cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development,
        and
        personnel costs.  Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture
        its products, the Company typically begins to process wafers before completion
        of performance and reliability testing.  The Company deems development
        of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested
        for performance and reliability.  R&D expenses can vary
        significantly depending on the timing of product qualification as costs incurred
        in production prior to qualification are charged to R&D.

R&D
        expenses for 2007 increased 23%
        from 2006 principally due to NAND pre-production wafer processing mitigated
        by
        reimbursements received from Intel under a NAND Flash R&D cost-sharing
        arrangement.  R&D expenses were reduced by $240 million in 2007
        and $86 million in 2006 for amounts reimbursable from Intel under the NAND
        Flash
        R&D cost-sharing arrangement.  R&D expenses for 2006 increased
        9% from 2005, principally due to increases in development wafers processed,
        higher compensation costs and increases in R&D equipment depreciation
        partially mitigated by reimbursements under the NAND Flash R&D cost sharing
        arrangement.  The Company expects that its R&D expenses, net of
        amounts reimbursable from Intel, will approximate $165 million to $175 million
        for the first quarter of 2008.  For the Memory segment, R&D
        expenses as a percentage of sales were 13% for 2007, 13% for 2006 and 12%
        for
        2005.  For the Imaging segment, R&D expenses as a percentage of
        sales were 23% for 2007, 11% for 2006 and 23% for 2005.

The
        Company’s process technology
        R&D efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller
        line-width process technologies which are designed to facilitate the Company’s
        transition to next-generation memory products and CMOS image
        sensors.  Additional process technology R&D efforts focus on
        advanced computing and mobile memory architectures and new manufacturing
        materials.  Product design and development efforts are concentrated on
        the Company’s 1 Gb and 2 Gb DDR2 and DDR3 products as well as high density and
        mobile NAND Flash memory (including multi-level cell technology), CMOS image
        sensors and specialty memory products.

Restructure

The
        Company is pursuing a number of
        initiatives to reduce costs and increase revenue across its
        operations.  These initiatives include workforce reductions in certain
        areas of the Company as the Company’s business is
        realigned.  Additional initiatives include establishing certain
        operations closer in location to the Company’s global customers, evaluating
        functions more efficiently performed through partnerships or other outside
        relationships and reducing the Company’s overhead costs to meet or exceed
        industry benchmarks.  The Company is also exploring opportunities to
        leverage the Company’s technology and diversified product portfolio to increase
        revenue and shareholder value.  It is anticipated that these
        initiatives will be implemented over several quarters.

In
        the fourth quarter of 2007, the
        Company incurred a restructure charge of $19 million in connection with the
        implementation of these cost reduction initiatives.  The fourth
        quarter charge was comprised primarily of employee severance and related
        costs
        resulting from a reduction in the Company’s workforce.  The Company
        anticipates that it will incur some level of restructure charges through
        the end
        of 2008 as it continues to implement these initiatives, but is currently
        unable
        to estimate the aggregate amount of such charges.  As of August 30,
        2007, $5 million of the restructure costs remained unpaid and were included
        in
        accounts payable and accrued expenses.


Other
        Operating (Income) Expense, Net

Other
        operating income for 2007
        includes $43 million from gains on disposals of semiconductor equipment,
        a gain
        of $30 million from the sale of certain intellectual property rights and
        $7
        million in grants received in connection with the Company’s operations in
        China.  Other operating expense for 2007 includes losses of $14
        million from changes in currency exchange rates.  Other operating
        income for 2006 includes $230 million of net proceeds for the sale of the
        Company’s existing NAND Flash memory designs and certain related technology to
        Intel net of amounts paid by the Company for a perpetual, paid-up license
        to use
        and modify such designs.  Other operating income for 2006 also
        includes $23 million in additional amounts expected to be reimbursed resulting
        from the extension of an economic development agreement, which allows the
        Company to recover amounts relating to certain investments in the IM Flash’s
        Utah facility.  Other operating income for 2005 includes gains net of
        losses on disposals of semiconductor equipment of $13 million and $12 million
        in
        receipts from the U.S. Government in connection with anti-dumping
        tariffs.

Income
        Taxes

Income
        taxes for 2007 and 2006
        primarily reflect taxes on the Company’s non-U.S. operations and U.S.
        alternative minimum tax.  The Company has a valuation allowance for
        its net deferred tax asset associated with its U.S. operations.  The
        benefit in 2007 and provision in 2006 for taxes on U.S. operations was
        substantially offset by changes in the valuation allowance.  As of
        August 30, 2007, the Company had aggregate U.S. tax net operating loss
        carryforwards of $2.2 billion and unused U.S. tax credit carryforwards of
        $202
        million.  The Company also had unused state tax net operating loss
        carryforwards of $1.5 billion and unused state tax credits of $169 million
        as of
        August 30, 2007.  Substantially all of the net operating loss
        carryforwards expire in 2022 to 2027 and substantially all of the tax credit
        carryforwards expire in 2013 to 2027.

Noncontrolling
        Interests in Net (Income) Loss

Noncontrolling
        interests for 2007 and
        2006 primarily reflects the share of income or losses of the Company’s TECH
        joint venture attributable to the noncontrolling interests in
        TECH.  On March 30, 2007, the Company acquired all of the shares of
        TECH common stock held by the Singapore Economic Development Board, which
        had
        the effect of reducing the noncontrolling interests in TECH as of that date
        from
        57% to 27%.  (See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
– Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Joint Ventures – TECH
        Semiconductor Singapore Pte. Ltd.”)

Stock-Based
        Compensation

Through
        2005, the Company accounted for
        its stock plans using the intrinsic value method.  Effective the
        beginning of 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
        Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” which requires the Company
        to use a fair-value based method to account for stock-based
        compensation.  Total compensation cost for the Company’s equity plans
        in 2007 and 2006 was $44 million and $26 million, respectively, of which
        $3
        million and $1 million were capitalized and remained in inventory at the
        end of
        2007 and 2006, respectively.  As of August 30, 2007, there was $113
        million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to equity plans,
        which
        is expected to be recognized through the fourth quarter of 2011.  In
        2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of substantially all of its unvested
        stock options then outstanding under the Company’s stock plans to reduce
        compensation costs recognized subsequent to the adoption in 2006 of SFAS
        No.
        123(R), “Share-Based Payment.”  Because the Company’s stock-based
        compensation costs were reduced by the effect of the acceleration of vesting
        in
        2005, the Company expects that stock-based compensation costs will continue
        to
        grow in future periods.

Liquidity
        and Capital Resources

The
        Company’s liquidity is highly
        dependent on average selling prices for its products and the timing of capital
        expenditures, both of which can vary significantly from period to
        period.  As of August 30, 2007, the Company had cash and equivalents
        and short-term investments totaling $2.6 billion compared to $3.1 billion
        as of
        August 31, 2006.  The balance as of August 30, 2007, included an
        aggregate of $610 million held at, and anticipated to be used in the near
        term
        by, IM Flash and TECH.

Operating
        Activities:

The Company generated $937 million of cash
        from operating activities in 2007, which principally reflects the Company’s $320
        million of net loss adjusted by $1.7 billion for non-cash depreciation and
        amortization expense.  Net cash provided by operating activities was
        net of the effects of an increase of $591 million in inventories primarily
        due
        to increases in production, growth in output that exceeded growth in demand
        for
        the Company’s Memory products and, with respect to Imaging, industry softness in
        the mobile handset market.


Investing
        Activities:

Net cash used by investing activities was
        $2.4 billion in 2007, which included cash expenditures for property, plant
        and
        equipment of $3.6 billion partially offset by the net effect of purchases,
        sales
        and maturities of investment securities of $1.2 billion.  A
        significant portion of the capital expenditures relate to the ramp of IM
        Flash
        facilities and 300mm conversion of manufacturing operations at
        TECH.  The Company believes that to develop new product and process
        technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain
        product quality, it must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies,
        facilities and capital equipment and research and development.  The
        Company expects 2008 capital spending to approximate $2.5 billion, primarily
        for
        expenditures on 300mm fabrication facilities.  The Company expects
        that approximately $750 million of the capital expenditure requirement will
        come
        from joint venture partners through new investment and payment for product
        purchases.  As of August 30, 2007, the Company had commitments of
        approximately $1.2 billion for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment,
        nearly all of which are expected to be paid within one year.

On
        December 11, 2006, the Company
        acquired the CMOS image sensor business of Avago Technologies
        Limited.  The Company made payments of $55 million in 2007 in
        connection with this acquisition and is obligated to make additional contingent
        payments up to $15 million if certain milestones are met through
        2008.

On
        March 30, 2007, the Company acquired
        all of the shares of TECH common stock held by the Singapore Economic
        Development Board for approximately $290 million payable over nine months,
        increasing the Company’s ownership interest in TECH from 43% to
        73%.  As of August 30, 2007, $216 million of this amount remained in
        notes payable.

Financing
        Activities:

Net cash provided by financing activities
        was $2.2 billion in 2007.  In May 2007, the Company issued $1.3
        billion of 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due June 1, 2014 (the “Senior
        Notes”).  The issuance costs associated with the Senior Notes totaled
        $26 million.  In connection with the offering of the Senior Notes, the
        Company also entered into capped call transactions (“Capped Calls”) with the
        intent to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Senior
        Notes.  Micron paid approximately $151 million from the net proceeds
        from the issuance and sale of the Senior Notes to purchase the Capped
        Calls.  (See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data –
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Supplemental Balance Sheet
        Information – Debt” and “Supplemental Balance Sheet Information – Capped Call
        Transactions.”)

In
        2007, the Company received $1.2
        billion in capital contributions from joint venture partners and $454 million
        in
        proceeds from equipment financing arrangements, payable in periodic installments
        through July 2011.  The Company made an aggregate of $680 million in
        scheduled debt payments and payments on equipment purchase contracts in
        2007.

The
        Company’s TECH joint venture has a
        credit facility that enabled it to borrow up to $360 million as of August
        30,
        2007.  The amount available under the credit facility decreased to
        $320 million as of September 27, 2007, and will decline by approximately
        $40
        million every calendar quarter thereafter until the facility expires in
        September 2009.  As of August 30, 2007, TECH had not borrowed any
        amounts against the credit facility.

Access
        to capital markets has
        historically been important to the Company.  Depending on market
        conditions, the Company may issue registered or unregistered securities to
        raise
        capital to fund a portion of its operations.

Joint
        Ventures:

As of August 30, 2007, IM Flash had $407
        million of cash and marketable investment securities.  IM Flash’s cash
        and marketable investment securities are not anticipated to be made available
        to
        finance the Company’s other operations.  Subject to certain
        conditions, the Company expects to make additional contributions to IM Flash
        of
        approximately $1.7 billion over the next three years, with similar contributions
        to be made by Intel.  The Company anticipates additional investments
        as appropriate to support the growth of IM Flash’s operations.

As
        of August 30, 2007, TECH had $203
        million of cash and marketable investment securities.  TECH’s cash and
        marketable investment securities are not anticipated to be made available
        to
        finance the Company’s other operations.

(See
“Item
        8. Financial Statements and
        Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Joint
        Ventures.”)

Contractual
        Obligations:

The following table summarizes the
        Company’s significant contractual obligations at August 30, 2007, and the effect
        such obligations are expected to have on the Company’s liquidity and cash flows
        in future periods.


The
        obligations disclosed above do not
        include contractual obligations recorded on the Company’s balance sheet as
        current liabilities except for the current portion of long-term
        debt.  The expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations
        discussed above is estimated based on current information.  Timing and
        actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods
        or
        services, market prices or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some
        obligations.

Purchase
        obligations include all
        commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity
        that meet any of the following criteria: (1) they are noncancelable, (2)
        the
        Company would incur a penalty if the agreement was cancelled, or (3) the
        Company
        must make specified minimum payments even if it does not take delivery of
        the
        contracted products or services (“take-or-pay”).  If the obligation to
        purchase goods or services is noncancelable, the entire value of the contract
        was included in the above table.  If the obligation is cancelable, but
        the Company would incur a penalty if cancelled, the dollar amount of the
        penalty
        was included as a purchase obligation.  Contracted minimum amounts
        specified in take-or-pay contracts are also included in the above table as
        they
        represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment.

Off-Balance
        Sheet Arrangements

In
        May 2007, in connection with the
        offering of the Senior Notes, the Company paid approximately $151 million
        for
        the Capped Calls.  The Capped Calls cover an aggregate of
        approximately 91.3 million shares of common stock.  The Capped Calls
        are in three equal tranches with cap prices of $17.25, $20.13 and $23.00
        per
        share, respectively, each with an initial strike price of approximately $14.23
        per share, subject to certain adjustments.  The Capped Calls expire on
        various dates between November 2011 and December 2012.  (See “Item 8.
        Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial
        Statements – Supplemental Balance Sheet Information – Capped Call
        Transactions.”)

As
        of August 30, 2007, the Company had
        stock warrants outstanding that may be considered off-balance sheet
        arrangements.  In 2001, the Company received $480 million from the
        issuance of warrants to purchase 29.1 million shares of the Company’s common
        stock.  The warrants entitle the holders to exercise their warrants
        and purchase shares of the Company’s common stock for $56.00 per share (the
“Exercise Price”) at any time through May 15, 2008 (the “Expiration
        Date”).  Warrants exercised prior to the Expiration Date will be
        settled on a “net share” basis, wherein investors receive common stock equal to
        the difference between $56.00 and the average closing sale price for the
        common
        shares over the 30 trading days immediately preceding the Exercise
        Date.  At expiration, the Company may elect to settle the warrants on
        a net share basis or for cash, provided certain conditions are
        satisfied.  As of August 30, 2007, there had been no exercises of
        warrants and all warrants issued remained outstanding.

Recently
        Issued Accounting Standards

In
        February 2007, the Financial
        Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option
        for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Including an amendment of FASB
        Statement No. 115.”  Under SFAS No. 159, the Company may elect to
        measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value
        on an
        instrument by instrument basis, subject to certain restrictions.  The
        Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 159 effective at the beginning of
        2009.  The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will depend on the
        extent to which the Company elects to measure eligible items at fair
        value.


In
        September 2006, the SEC staff issued
        Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior
        Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
        Statements.”  In SAB No. 108, the SEC staff established an approach
        that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on
        the
        effects of the misstatements on each of a company’s financial statements and the
        related financial statement disclosures.  SAB No. 108 permits
        companies to initially apply its provisions either by (i) restating prior
        financial statements or (ii) recording the cumulative effect as adjustments
        to
        the carrying values of assets and liabilities with an offsetting adjustment
        recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings.  The Company
        adopted SAB No. 108 as of August 30, 2007.  The adoption of SAB No.
        108 did not impact the Company’s results of operations or financial
        condition.

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
        No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
        Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
        132(R).”  SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the
        overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan
        (other
        than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of
        financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the
        year in
        which the changes occur through comprehensive income.  SFAS No. 158
        also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the
        date
        of its year-end statement of financial position, with limited
        exceptions.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 as of August 30,
        2007.  The adoption of SFAS No. 158 did not have a material impact the
        Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
        No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.”  SFAS No. 157 defines fair value,
        establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
        accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value
        measurements.  SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting
        pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements.  The
        Company is required to adopt FAS No. 157 effective at the beginning of
        2009.  The Company is evaluating the impact this statement will have
        on its consolidated financial statements.

In
        June 2006, the FASB issued
        Interpretation Number 48 (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
– an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.”  The interpretation
        contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax
        positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109.  The first
        step is to evaluate each tax position for recognition by determining if the
        weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the
        position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals
        or
        litigation processes, if any.  The second step is to measure the tax
        benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized
        upon ultimate settlement. The Company is required to adopt FIN 48 effective
        at
        the beginning of 2008.  The Company does not expect any material
        adjustments upon adoption.

In
        February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
        No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments.”  SFAS
        No. 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument
        that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require
        bifurcation.  As of August 30, 2007, the Company did not have any
        hybrid financial instruments subject to the fair value election under SFAS
        No.
        155.  The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 155 effective at the
        beginning of 2008.

In
        May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No.
        154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.”  SFAS No. 154 changes
        the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting
        principle.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 154 at the beginning of 2007.
        The adoption of SFAS No. 154 did not impact the Company’s results of operations
        or financial condition.

Critical
        Accounting Estimates

The
        preparation of financial statements
        and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
        to make
        estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
        revenues, expenses and related disclosures.  Estimates and judgments
        are based on historical experience, forecasted future events and various
        other
        assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the
        circumstances.  Estimates and judgments may vary under different
        assumptions or conditions.  The Company evaluates its estimates and
        judgments on an ongoing basis.  Management believes the accounting
        policies below are critical in the portrayal of the Company’s financial
        condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult,
        subjective or complex judgments.


Acquisitions
        and
        consolidations:

Determination and the allocation
        thereof of the purchase price of acquired operations significantly influences
        the period in which costs are recognized.  Accounting for acquisitions
        and consolidations requires the Company to estimate the fair value of the
        individual assets and liabilities acquired as well as various forms of
        consideration given.  The Company typically obtains independent third
        party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values, including
        assistance in determining future cash flows, appropriate discount rates and
        comparable market values.  The estimation of the fair values of
        consideration given and assets and liabilities acquired involves a number
        of
        judgments, assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount
        and
        timing of costs recognized.

Contingencies:

The
        Company is subject to the possibility of losses from various
        contingencies.  Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the
        probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies.  An
        accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or
        an
        asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably
        estimated.  The Company accrues a liability and charges operations for
        the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted
        claims existing as of the balance sheet date.

Goodwill
        and intangible
        assets:

The Company tests goodwill for impairment
        annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not
        that
        an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in
        the
        business climate or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting
        unit.  Determining whether impairment has occurred requires valuation
        of the respective reporting unit.  If the analysis indicates goodwill
        is impaired, measuring the impairment requires a fair value estimate of each
        identified tangible and intangible asset.  The Company tests other
        identified intangible assets with definite useful lives and subject to
        amortization when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may
        not
        be recoverable by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted
        cash
        flows expected to be generated by the asset.  The Company tests
        intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair
        value method such as discounted cash flows.  Estimating fair values
        involves significant assumptions, especially regarding future sales prices,
        sales volumes, costs and discount rates.

Income
        taxes:

The Company is required to estimate its
        provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable
        in
        numerous tax jurisdictions around the world.  Estimates involve
        interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex.  Resolution
        of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for
        many
        years after completion of any fiscal year.  The Company is also
        required to evaluate the realizability of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing
        basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the assessment of the
        Company’s performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a
        valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax
        assets.  Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the
        Company’s ability to generate future taxable income.  The Company is
        required to adopt FIN 48 effective at the beginning of 2008.

Inventories:

Inventories
        are stated at the lower of average cost or market value.  Cost
        includes labor, material and overhead costs, including product and process
        technology costs.  Determining market value of inventories involves
        numerous judgments, including projecting average selling prices and sales
        volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process
        inventories.  To project average selling prices and sales volumes, the
        Company reviews recent sales volumes, existing customer orders, current contract
        prices, industry analysis of supply and demand, seasonal factors, general
        economic trends and other information.  When these analyses reflect
        estimated market values below the Company’s manufacturing costs, the Company
        records a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is
        actually sold.  Differences in forecasted average selling prices used
        in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant
        changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and
        accordingly the amount of write-down recorded.  For example, a 5%
        variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated
        fair
        value of the Company’s semiconductor memory inventory by approximately $85
        million at August 30, 2007.  Due to the volatile nature of the
        semiconductor memory industry, actual selling prices and volumes often vary
        significantly from projected prices and volumes and, as a result, the timing
        of
        when product costs are charged to operations can vary
        significantly.

U.S.
        GAAP provides for products to be
        grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market
        values.  The amount of any inventory write-down can vary significantly
        depending on the determination of inventory categories.  The Company’s
        inventories have been categorized as Memory products or Imaging
        products.  The major characteristics the Company considers in
        determining inventory categories are product type and markets.

Product
        and process
        technology:

Costs incurred to acquire product and
        process technology or to patent technology developed by the Company are
        capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over periods currently
        ranging up to 10 years.  The Company capitalizes a portion of costs
        incurred based on its analysis of historical and projected patents issued
        as a
        percent of patents filed.  Capitalized product and process technology
        costs are amortized over the shorter of (i) the estimated useful life of
        the
        technology, (ii) the patent term or (iii) the term of the technology
        agreement.


Research
        and
        development:

Costs related to the conceptual
        formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research
        and
        development when incurred.  Determining when product development is
        complete requires judgment by the Company.  The Company deems
        development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed
        and tested for performance and reliability.

Stock-based
        compensation:

Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),
        stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the
        fair-value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite
        service period of the award.  Determining the appropriate fair-value
        model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date
        requires considerable judgment, including estimating stock price volatility,
        expected option life and forfeiture rates.  The Company develops its
        estimates based on historical data and market information which can change
        significantly over time.  A small change in the estimates used can
        result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation.

The
        Company uses the Black-Scholes
        option valuation model to value employee stock awards.  The Company
        estimates stock price volatility based on an average of its historical
        volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on the
        Company’s stock.  Estimated option life and forfeiture rate
        assumptions are derived from historical data.  For stock based
        compensation awards with graded vesting that were granted after 2005, the
        Company recognizes compensation expense using the straight-line amortization
        method.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
        Risk

Interest
        Rate Risk

As
        of August 30, 2007, $2,335 million
        of the Company’s $2,410 million in total debt was at fixed interest
        rates.  As a result, the fair value of the debt fluctuates based on
        changes in market interest rates.  The estimated fair market value of
        the Company’s debt was $2,411 million as of August 30, 2007.  The
        Company estimates that as of August 30, 2007, a 1% change in market interest
        rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by approximately
        $100
        million.

Foreign
        Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The
        information in this section should
        be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the exchange
        rates of foreign currency in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”  Changes in
        foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect the Company’s
        results of operations or financial condition.

The
        functional currency for
        substantially all of the Company’s operations is the U.S. dollar.  The
        Company held aggregate cash and other assets in foreign currencies valued
        at
        U.S. $448 million as of August 30, 2007, and U.S. $425 million as of August
        31,
        2006 (including cash and equivalents denominated in yen valued at U.S. $180
        million as of August 30, 2007 and U.S. $222 million as of August 31, 2006;
        cash
        and equivalents denominated in Singapore dollars valued at U.S. $58 million
        as
        of August 30, 2007 and U.S. $42 million as of August 31, 2006; and deferred
        income tax assets denominated in yen valued at U.S. $76 million as of August
        30,
        2007, and U.S. $64 million as of August 31, 2006).  The Company also
        held aggregate foreign currency liabilities valued at U.S. $979 million as
        of
        August 30, 2007, and U.S. $615 million as of August 31, 2006 (including debt
        denominated in Singapore dollars valued at U.S. $258 million as of August
        30,
        2007, and U.S. $38 million as of August 31, 2006; debt denominated in yen
        valued
        at U.S. $165 million as of August 30, 2007, and U.S. $228 million as of August
        31, 2006; accounts payable and accrued expenses denominated in yen valued
        at
        U.S. $168 million as of August 30, 2007, and U.S. $124 million as of August
        31,
        2006; accounts payable and accrued expenses denominated in euros valued at
        U.S.
        $137 million as of August 30, 2007, and U.S. $68 million as of August 31,
        2006;
        and accounts payable and accrued expenses denominated in Singapore dollars
        valued at U.S. $116 million as of August 30, 2007, and U.S. $48 million as
        of
        August 31, 2006).  Foreign currency receivables and payables as of
        August 30, 2007, were comprised primarily of yen, euros and Singapore
        dollars.  The Company estimates that, based on its assets and
        liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar as of August
        30,
        2007, a 1% change in the exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar would result
        in
        foreign currency gains or losses of approximately U.S. $3 million for the
        Singapore dollar, U.S. $2 million for the euro and U.S. $1 million for the
        yen.

Significant
        Accounting Policies

Basis
        of
        presentation:

Micron Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries
        (hereinafter referred to collectively as the “Company”) manufacture and market
        DRAM, NAND Flash memory, CMOS image sensors and other semiconductor
        components.  The Company’s reportable segments are Memory and
        Imaging.  The Memory segment’s primary products are DRAM and NAND
        Flash and the Imaging segment’s primary product is CMOS image
        sensors.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
        prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
        United States of America and include the accounts of the Company and its
        consolidated subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany transactions
        and balances have been eliminated.

The
        Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or
        53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31.  The
        Company’s fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 each contained 52 weeks. All period
        references are to the Company’s fiscal periods unless otherwise
        indicated.

Use
        of
        estimates:

The preparation of financial statements and
        related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
        in the United States requires management to make estimates and judgments
        that
        affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and
        related disclosures.  Estimates and judgments are based on historical
        experience, forecasted future events and various other assumptions that the
        Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Estimates
        and judgments may differ under different assumptions or
        conditions.  The Company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an
        ongoing basis.  Actual results could differ from
        estimates.

Certain
        concentrations:

Approximately 50% of the Company’s net sales
        for 2007 were to the computing market, including desktop PCs, servers, notebooks
        and workstations.  Sales to Hewlett-Packard Company (“HP”) were 10% of
        the Company’s net sales in 2007 and were included in the Memory
        segment.  Sales of DRAM, NAND Flash and CMOS image sensor products
        constituted 65%, 23% and 12%, respectively, of the Company’s net sales for
        2007.  Certain components used by the Company in manufacturing
        semiconductor products are available from a limited number of
        suppliers.

Financial
        instruments that potentially
        subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally
        of
        cash, investment securities and trade receivables.  The Company
        invests through high-credit-quality financial institutions and, by policy,
        generally limits the concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments
        with any single obligor.  A concentration of credit risk may exist
        with respect to trade receivables as a substantial portion of the Company’s
        customers are affiliated with the computing industry.  The Company
        performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers worldwide and generally
        does
        not require collateral from its customers.  Historically, the Company
        has not experienced significant losses on receivables.

Product
        warranty:

The Company generally provides a limited warranty
        that its products are in compliance with Company specifications existing
        at the
        time of delivery.  Under the Company’s general terms and conditions of
        sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty
        period
        is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return
        of, or
        a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items.  Under certain
        circumstances, the Company may provide more extensive limited warranty coverage
        and general legal principles may impose upon the Company more extensive
        liability than that provided under the Company’s general terms and
        conditions.  The Company’s warranty obligations are not
        material.

Revenue
        recognition:

The Company recognizes product or license revenue when persuasive evidence
        of a
        sales arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or
        determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.  Because of
        frequent changes in market prices for the Company’s products, sales made under
        agreements allowing pricing protection or rights of return (other than for
        product warranty) are deferred until customers have sold the
        product.

Research
        and
        development:

Costs related to the conceptual formulation and
        design of products and processes are expensed as research and development
        as
        incurred.  Determining when product development is complete requires
        judgment by the Company.  The Company deems development of a product
        complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for
        performance and reliability.  Subsequent to product qualification,
        product costs are valued in inventory.  Product design and other
        research and development costs for NAND Flash are shared equally among the
        Company and Intel Corporation (“Intel”).  These charges to Intel are
        reflected as a reduction of research and development expense.  (See
“Joint Ventures – NAND Flash Joint Ventures with Intel.”)


Stock-based
        compensation:

Effective the beginning of 2006, the Company
        adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R),
“Share-Based Payment,” and elected to adopt the modified prospective application
        method.  Accordingly, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the
        grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense
        over the requisite service period.  For stock awards granted after the
        beginning of 2006, expenses are amortized under the straight-line attribution
        method.  (See “Equity Plans.”)

Functional
        currency:

The U.S. dollar is the Company’s functional
        currency for substantially all of its operations.

Earnings
        per
        share:

Basic earnings per share is computed based on the
        weighted-average number of common shares and stock rights
        outstanding.  Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the
        weighted-average number of common shares and stock rights outstanding plus
        the
        dilutive effects of stock options, warrants and convertible
        notes.  Potential common shares that would increase earnings per share
        amounts or decrease loss per share amounts are antidilutive and are, therefore,
        excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations.

Financial
        instruments:

Cash equivalents include highly liquid
        short-term investments with original maturities to the Company of three months
        or less, readily convertible to known amounts of cash.  Investments
        with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities
        less
        than one year are classified as short-term investments.  Investments
        with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as other
        noncurrent assets.  Securities classified as available-for-sale are
        stated at market value.  The carrying value of investment securities
        sold is determined using the specific identification method.

Amounts
        reported as cash and
        equivalents, short-term investments, receivables, other assets, accounts
        payable
        and accrued expenses and equipment purchase contracts approximate their fair
        values.  The estimated fair value of the Company’s debt was $2,411
        million and $627 million as of August 30, 2007, and August 31, 2006,
        respectively.  The estimated fair values presented herein were based
        on market interest rates and other market information available to management
        as
        of each balance sheet date presented.  The use of different market
        assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a material effect
        on the
        estimated fair values.  The estimated fair values do not take into
        consideration expenses that could be incurred in an actual
        settlement.

Inventories:

Inventories
        are stated at the lower of average cost or market value.  Cost
        includes labor, material and overhead costs, including product and process
        technology costs.  Determining fair market values of inventories
        involves numerous judgments, including projecting average selling prices
        and
        sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in
        process inventories.  As a result of these analyses, when fair market
        values are below the Company’s costs, the Company records a charge to cost of
        goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold.  The
        Company’s inventories have been categorized as Memory products or Imaging
        products for purposes of determining average cost and fair market
        value.  The major characteristics the Company considers in determining
        categories are product type and markets.

Product
        and process
        technology:

Costs incurred to acquire product and process
        technology or to patent technology developed by the Company are capitalized
        and
        amortized on a straight-line basis over periods currently ranging up to 10
        years.  The Company capitalizes a portion of costs incurred based on
        its analysis of historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents
        filed.  Capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized
        over the shorter of (i) the estimated useful life of the technology, (ii)
        the
        patent term or (iii) the term of the technology
        agreement.  Fully-amortized assets are removed from product and
        process technology and accumulated amortization.

Property,
        plant and
        equipment:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost
        and depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives
        of 5
        to 30 years for buildings, 2 to 20 years for equipment and 2 to 5 years for
        software.  Assets held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or
        estimated fair value and are included in other noncurrent
        assets.  When property or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed
        of, the net book value of the asset is removed from the Company’s accounts and
        any net gain or loss is included in the Company’s results of
        operations.

The
        Company capitalizes interest on
        borrowings during the active construction period of major capital
        projects.  Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying
        assets and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets.  The
        Company capitalized interest costs of $18 million, $10 million and $2 million
        in
        2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in connection with various capital
        projects.


Recently
        issued accounting
        standards:

In February 2007, the Financial Accounting
        Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for
        Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Including an amendment of FASB
        Statement No. 115.”  Under SFAS No. 159, the Company may elect to
        measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value
        on an
        instrument by instrument basis, subject to certain restrictions.  The
        Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 159 effective at the beginning of
        2009.  The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will depend on the
        extent to which the Company elects to measure eligible items at fair
        value.

In
        September 2006, the SEC staff issued
        Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior
        Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
        Statements.”  In SAB No. 108, the SEC staff established an approach
        that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on
        the
        effects of the misstatements on each of a company’s financial statements and the
        related financial statement disclosures.  SAB No. 108 permits
        companies to initially apply its provisions either by (i) restating prior
        financial statements or (ii) recording the cumulative effect as adjustments
        to
        the carrying values of assets and liabilities with an offsetting adjustment
        recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings.  The Company
        adopted SAB No. 108 as of August 30, 2007.  The adoption of SAB No.
        108 did not impact the Company’s results of operations or financial
        condition.

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
        No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
        Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
        132(R).”  SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the
        overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan
        (other
        than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of
        financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the
        year in
        which the changes occur through comprehensive income.  SFAS No. 158
        also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the
        date
        of its year-end statement of financial position, with limited
        exceptions.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 as of August 30,
        2007.  The adoption of SFAS No. 158 did not have a material impact the
        Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
        No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.”  SFAS No. 157 defines fair value,
        establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
        accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value
        measurements.  SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting
        pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements.  The
        Company is required to adopt FAS No. 157 effective at the beginning of
        2009.  The Company is evaluating the impact this statement will have
        on its consolidated financial statements.

In
        June 2006, the FASB issued
        Interpretation Number 48 (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
– an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.”  The interpretation
        contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax
        positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109.  The first
        step is to evaluate each tax position for recognition by determining if the
        weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the
        position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals
        or
        litigation processes, if any.  The second step is to measure the tax
        benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized
        upon ultimate settlement. The Company is required to adopt FIN 48 effective
        at
        the beginning of 2008.  The Company does not expect any material
        adjustments upon adoption.

In
        February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
        No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments.”  SFAS
        No. 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument
        that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require
        bifurcation.  As of August 30, 2007, the Company did not have any
        hybrid financial instruments subject to the fair value election under SFAS
        No.
        155.  The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 155 effective at the
        beginning of 2008.

In
        May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No.
        154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.”  SFAS No. 154 changes
        the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting
        principle.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 154 at the beginning of 2007.
        The adoption of SFAS No. 154 did not impact the Company’s results of operations
        or financial condition.

        settlement of litigation of $110 million and $181 million,
        respectively.

The
        Company’s results of operations for
        2007 include a charge of $20 million to write down the carrying value of
        work in
        process and finished goods inventories of memory products to their estimated
        fair market values.


During
        2007, the Company capitalized
        $86 million for product and process technology with a weighted-average useful
        life of 9 years and $2 million of other intangible assets with a
        weighted-average useful life of 4 years.  During 2006, the Company
        capitalized $76 million for product and process technology, $127 million
        for
        customer related intangible assets and $21 million for trademark and trade
        name
        intangible assets with weighted-average useful lives of 10 years, 8 years
        and 5

        million for its Memory segment and $12 million for its Imaging
        segment.  All changes in goodwill are due to acquisitions and changes
        in the preliminary purchase price allocation.  (See
“Acquisitions.”)  The Company performs its annual test of impairment
        for goodwill in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year.

Depreciation
        expense was $1,664
        million, $1,258 million and $1,211 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005,
        respectively.

As

        NAND Flash memory products to Apple Computer, Inc. (“Apple”) until December 31,
        2010, pursuant to a prepaid NAND Flash supply agreement.  As of August
        30, 2007, an additional $167 million was included in other noncurrent
        liabilities pursuant to this supply agreement.

As
        of August 30, 2007, notes payable
        and capital lease obligations above included an aggregate of $258 million,
        denominated in Singapore dollars, at a weighted average interest rate of
        6.6%
        and $165 million, denominated in Japanese yen, at a weighted-average interest
        rate of 1.5%.


In
        May 2007, the Company issued $1.3
        billion of 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due June 1, 2014 (the “Senior
        Notes”).  The issuance costs associated with the Senior Notes totaled
        $26 million and the net proceeds to the Company from the offering of the
        Senior
        Notes were $1,274 million.  The initial conversion rate for the Senior
        Notes is 70.2679 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Senior
        Notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $14.23
        per
        share of common stock.  Holders may convert the Senior Notes prior to
        the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity
        date for the Senior Notes only under the following circumstances: (1) during
        any
        calendar quarter beginning after August 30, 2007, (and only during such calendar
        quarter) if the closing price of the Company's common stock for at least
        trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
        day
        of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the then
        applicable conversion price per share of the Senior Notes; (2) if the Senior
        Notes have been called for redemption; (3) if specified distributions to
        holders
        of the Company's common stock are made, or specified corporate events occur,
        as
        specified in the indenture for the Senior Notes; (4) during the five business
        days after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price
        per $1,000 principal amount of Senior Notes for each day of that period was
        less
        than 98% of the product of the closing price of the Company’s common stock and
        the then applicable conversion rate of the Senior Notes; or (5) at any time
        on
        or after March 1, 2014.  Upon conversion, the Company will have the
        right to deliver, in lieu of shares of its common stock, cash or a combination
        of cash and shares of common stock.  If a holder elects to convert its
        Senior Notes in connection with a make-whole change in control, as defined
        in
        the indenture, the Company will, in certain circumstances, pay a make-whole
        premium by increasing the conversion rate for the Senior Notes converted
        in
        connection with such make-whole change in control.  On or after June
        6, 2011, the Company may redeem for cash all or part of the Senior Notes
        if the
        last reported sale price of its common stock has been at least 130% of the
        conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30
        consecutive trading day period ending within five trading days prior to the
        date
        on which the Company provides notice of redemption.  The redemption
        price is 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed,
        plus
        accrued and unpaid interest.  Upon a change in control or a
        termination of trading, as defined in the indenture, the holders may require
        the
        Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Senior Notes at
        a
        repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes,
        plus
        accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

In
        2007, the Company received $454
        million in proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions. In connection with
        these
        transactions, the Company recorded capital lease obligations aggregating
        $441
        million with a weighted-average imputed interest rate of 6.7%, payable in
        periodic installments through July 2011.

As
        of August 30, 2007, notes payable
        included $216 million payable to the Singapore Economic Development Board
        (“EDB”) recorded in connection with the Company’s acquisition of EDB’s interest
        in the TECH Semiconductor Singapore Pte. Ltd. joint venture in the third
        quarter
        of 2007.  These notes have a stated interest rate of 6.8%, are payable
        to EDB in three installments through December 2007 and are collateralized
        by the
        acquired shares in the TECH joint venture.  (See “Joint Ventures –
TECH Semiconductor Singapore Pte. Ltd.”)

The
        Company’s TECH subsidiary has a
        credit facility that, as of August 30, 2007, enables it to borrow up to $360
        million at Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (“SIBOR”) plus 2.5% subject to
        customary covenants.  The amount available under the credit facility
        decreased to $320 million as of September 27, 2007 and will decline by
        approximately $40 million every calendar quarter thereafter until the facility
        expires in September 2009.  Amounts borrowed under the facility would
        be due in quarterly installments through September 2009.  As of August
        30, 2007, TECH had not borrowed any amounts against the credit
        facility.

In
        connection with the Company’s
        acquisition of Lexar in the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company assumed Lexar’s
        $70 million 5.625% convertible notes due April 1, 2010 (the “Lexar
        Notes”).  The Lexar Notes are convertible into the Company’s common
        stock any time at the option of the holders of the Notes at a price equal
        to
        approximately $11.28 per share and are subject to customary covenants.  The
        Lexar Notes are redeemable for cash at the Company’s option beginning on
        April 1, 2008, at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued
        interest plus the net present value of the remaining scheduled interest payments
        through April 1, 2010.  The Company may only redeem the Lexar Notes if
        its common stock has exceeded 175% of the conversion price for at least 20
        trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days prior to delivery of a notice
        of
        redemption.

Certain
        notes payable are
        collateralized by property, plant and equipment with a carrying value of
        $72
        million as of August 30, 2007.

As
        of August 30, 2007, maturities of
        notes payable and future minimum lease payments under capital lease obligations
        were as follows:


Commitments

As
        of August 30, 2007, the Company had
        commitments of approximately $1.2 billion for the acquisition of property,
        plant
        and equipment.  The Company has an agreement to construct a facility
        to produce photomasks and sell such facility to its MP Mask partner for a
        negotiated amount.  The Company expects to complete the facility in
        November 2007 and does not expect to incur a material loss upon
        completion.  The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under
        operating leases.  Total rental expense was $62 million, $30 million
        and $23 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Minimum future
        rental commitments under operating leases aggregated $117 million as of August
        30, 2007, and are payable as follows:  $31 million in 2008; $16
        million in 2009; $13 million in 2010; $12 million in 2011, $10 million in
        and $35 million in 2013 and thereafter.

Contingencies

As
        is typical in the semiconductor and
        other high technology industries, from time to time, others have asserted,
        and
        may in the future assert, that the Company’s products or manufacturing processes
        infringe their intellectual property rights.  In this regard, the
        Company is engaged in litigation with Rambus, Inc. (“Rambus”) relating to
        certain of Rambus’ patents and certain of the Company’s claims and
        defenses.  Lawsuits between Rambus and the Company are pending in the
        U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, U.S. District Court for
        the
        Northern District of California, Germany, France, and Italy.  The
        Company also is engaged in patent litigation with Mosaid Technologies, Inc.
        (“Mosaid”) in both the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
        California and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
        Texas.  Among other things, the above lawsuits pertain to certain of
        the Company’s SDRAM, DDR SDRAM, DDR2 SDRAM, RLDRAM, and image sensor products,
        which account for a significant portion of net sales.  In the first
        quarter of 2008, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the
        Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”) that did not have a material
        impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial
        condition.

The
        Company is unable to predict the
        outcome of assertions of infringement made against the Company.  A
        court determination that the Company’s products or manufacturing processes
        infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant
        liability and/or require the Company to make material changes to its products
        and/or manufacturing processes.  Any of the foregoing could have a
        material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or
        financial condition.

On
        June 17, 2002, the Company received
        a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
        of
        California seeking information regarding an investigation by the Antitrust
        Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) into possible antitrust
        violations in the “Dynamic Random Access Memory” or “DRAM”
industry.  The Company is cooperating fully and actively with the DOJ
        in its investigation.  The Company’s cooperation is pursuant to the
        terms of the DOJ’s Corporate Leniency Policy, which provides that in exchange
        for the Company’s full, continuing and complete cooperation in the pending
        investigation, the Company will not be subject to prosecution, fines or other
        penalties from the DOJ.


Subsequent
        to the commencement of the
        DOJ DRAM investigation, at least sixty-eight purported class action lawsuits
        have been filed against the Company and other DRAM suppliers in various federal
        and state courts in the United States and in Puerto Rico on behalf of indirect
        purchasers alleging price-fixing in violation of federal and state antitrust
        laws, violations of state unfair competition law, and/or unjust enrichment
        relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM products during the period from
        April
        1999 through at least June 2002.  The complaints seek treble damages
        sustained by purported class members, in addition to restitution, costs,
        and
        attorneys’ fees.  On June 1, 2007, the Court granted in part and
        denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss the consolidated
        complaint.  Plaintiffs subsequently have filed an amended
        complaint.

In
        addition, various states, through
        their Attorneys General, have filed suit against the Company and other DRAM
        manufacturers.  On July 14, 2006, and on September 8, 2006 in an
        amended complaint, the following states filed suit in the U.S. District Court
        for the Northern District of California:  Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas,
        California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa,
        Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,
        Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina,
        North
        Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina,
        Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin
        and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.  The amended
        complaint alleges, among other things, violations of the Sherman Act, Cartwright
        Act, and certain other states’ consumer protection and antitrust laws and seeks
        damages, and injunctive and other relief.  Additionally, on July 13,
        2006, the State of New York filed a similar suit in the U.S. District Court
        for
        the Southern District of New York.  That case was subsequently
        transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
        for pre-trial purposes.

Three states, Ohio,
        New
        Hampshire, and Texas, subsequently have withdrawn from the
        complaint.

Three
        purported class action lawsuits
        also have been filed in Canada, on behalf of direct and indirect purchasers,
        alleging violations of the Canadian Competition Act.  The substantive
        allegations in these cases are similar to those asserted in the cases filed
        in
        the United States.

On
        January 9, 2007, the Company entered
        into a settlement agreement with a class of direct purchasers (“Direct Purchaser
        Settlement”) that had alleged price-fixing in violation of federal and state
        antitrust laws, violations of state unfair competition law, and/or unjust
        enrichment relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM products.  Under
        terms of the Direct Purchaser Settlement, the Company was dismissed with
        prejudice from the direct purchaser consolidated class-action
        suit.  As a result of the Direct Purchaser Settlement, the Company
        recorded a $50 million charge to revenue (for the amount attributable to
        then-current customers) and a $31 million net charge to selling, general
        and
        administrative expenses for 2007.

In
        February and March 2007, All
        American Semiconductor, Inc., Jaco Electronics, Inc., and the DRAM Claims
        Liquidation Trust each filed suit against the Company and other DRAM suppliers
        in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California after
        opting-out of the direct purchaser class action suit that was
        settled.  The complaints allege, among other things, violations of
        federal and state antitrust and competition laws in the DRAM industry, and
        seek
        damages, injunctive relief, and other remedies.

On
        October 11, 2006, the Company
        received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Northern
        District of California seeking information regarding an investigation by
        the DOJ
        into possible antitrust violations in the “Static Random Access Memory” or
“SRAM” industry.  The Company believes that it is not a target of the
        investigation and is cooperating with the DOJ in its investigation of the
        SRAM
        industry.

Subsequent
        to the commencement of the
        DOJ SRAM investigation, at least eighty purported class action lawsuits have
        been filed against the Company and other SRAM suppliers in various federal
        courts on behalf of direct and indirect purchasers alleging price-fixing
        in
        violation of federal and state antitrust laws, violations of state unfair
        competition law, and/or unjust enrichment relating to the sale and pricing
        of
        SRAM products during the period from January 1998 through December
        2005.  The complaints seek treble monetary damages sustained by
        purported class members, in addition to restitution, costs, and attorneys’
fees.

In
        September 2007, a number of memory
        suppliers confirmed that they had received grand jury subpoenas from the
        U.S.
        District Court for the Northern District of California seeking information
        regarding an investigation by the DOJ into possible antitrust violations
        in the
        "Flash" industry.  The Company has not received a subpoena and
        believes that is not a target of the investigation.


At
        least thirty-four purported class
        action lawsuits were filed against the Company and other suppliers of Flash
        memory products in various federal and state courts on behalf of direct and
        indirect purchasers alleging price-fixing in violation of federal and state
        antitrust laws, violations of state unfair competition law, and/or unjust
        enrichment relating to the sale and pricing of Flash memory products during
        the
        period from January 1, 1999 through the date the various cases were
        filed.  The complaints seek treble monetary damages sustained by
        purported class members, in addition to restitution, costs, and attorneys’
fees.

On
        May 5, 2004, Rambus filed a
        complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California (San Francisco
        County) against the Company and other DRAM suppliers.  The complaint
        alleges various causes of action under California state law including conspiracy
        to restrict output and fix prices on Rambus DRAM (“RDRAM”) and unfair
        competition.  The complaint seeks treble damages, punitive damages,
        attorneys’ fees, costs, and a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from
        the conduct alleged in the complaint.

The
        Company is unable to predict the
        outcome of these lawsuits and investigations.  The final resolution of
        these alleged violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability
        and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of
        operations or financial condition.

On
        February 24, 2006, a putative class
        action complaint was filed against the Company and certain of its officers
        in
        the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho alleging claims under Section
        10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule
        10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  Four substantially similar complaints
        subsequently were filed in the same Court.  The cases purport to be
        brought on behalf of a class of purchasers of the Company’s stock during the
        period February 24, 2001 to February 13, 2003.  The five lawsuits have
        been consolidated and a consolidated amended class action complaint was filed
        on
        July 24, 2006.  The complaint generally alleges violations of federal
        securities laws based on, among other things, claimed misstatements or omissions
        regarding alleged illegal price-fixing conduct.  The complaint seeks
        unspecified damages, interest, attorneys’ fees, costs, and
        expenses.

In
        addition, on March 23, 2006, a
        shareholder derivative action was filed in the Fourth District Court for
        the
        State of Idaho (Ada County), allegedly on behalf of and for the benefit of
        the
        Company, against certain of the Company’s current and former officers and
        directors.  The Company also was named as a nominal
        defendant.  An amended complaint was filed on August 23,
        2006.  The complaint is based on the same allegations of fact as in
        the securities class actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the District
        of Idaho and alleges breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross
        mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, and insider
        trading.  The complaint seeks unspecified damages, restitution,
        disgorgement of profits, equitable and injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees,
        costs, and expenses.  The complaint is derivative in nature and does
        not seek monetary damages from the Company.  However, the Company may
        be required, throughout the pendency of the action, to advance payment of
        legal
        fees and costs incurred by the defendants.  On May 29, 2007, the Court
        granted the Company's motion to dismiss the complaint but provided plaintiffs
        leave to file an amended complaint.  On September 6, 2007, plaintiffs
        filed an amended complaint.

The
        Company is unable to predict the
        outcome of these cases.  A court determination in any of these actions
        against the Company could result in significant liability and could have
        a
        material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or
        financial condition.

In
        March 2006, following the Company’s
        announcement of a definitive agreement to acquire Lexar Media, Inc. (“Lexar”) in
        a stock-for-stock merger, four purported class action complaints were filed
        in
        the Superior Court for the State of California (Alameda County) on behalf
        of
        shareholders of Lexar against Lexar and its directors.  Two of the
        complaints also name the Company as a defendant.  The complaints
        allege that the defendants breached, or aided and abetted the breach of,
        fiduciary duties owed to Lexar shareholders by, among other things, engaging
        in
        self-dealing, failing to engage in efforts to obtain the highest price
        reasonably available, and failing to properly value Lexar in connection with
        a
        merger transaction between Lexar and the Company.  The plaintiffs
        seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing, or an order of
        rescission reversing, the merger, compensatory damages, interest, attorneys’
fees, and costs.  On May 19, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a motion for
        preliminary injunction seeking to block the merger.  On May 31, 2006,
        the Court denied the motion.  An amended consolidated complaint was
        filed on October 10, 2006.  On June 14, 2007, the Court granted
        Lexar's and the Company's motions to dismiss the amended complaint but allowed
        plaintiffs leave to file a further amended complaint.  The Company is
        unable to predict the outcome of these suits.  A court determination
        against the Company could result in significant liability and could have
        a
        material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or
        financial condition.  (See “Acquisitions – Lexar Media,
        Inc.”)


The
        Company has accrued a liability and
        charged operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement
        of
        various asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet
        date.  The Company is currently a party to other legal actions arising
        out of the normal course of business, none of which is expected to have a
        material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or
        financial condition.

In
        the normal course of business, the
        Company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be
        obligated to indemnify the other party.  It is not possible to predict
        the maximum potential amount of future payments under these types of agreements
        due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts
        and circumstances involved in each particular
        agreement.  Historically, payments made by the Company under these
        types of agreements have not had a material effect on the Company’s business,
        results of operations or financial condition.

Capped
        Call Transactions

In
        connection with the offering of the
        Senior Notes in May 2007, the Company entered into three capped call
        transactions (the “Capped Calls”).  The Capped Calls each have an
        initial strike price of approximately $14.23 per share, subject to certain
        adjustments, which matches the initial conversion price of the Senior
        Notes.  The Capped Calls are in three equal tranches, have cap prices
        of $17.25, $20.13 and $23.00 per share, and cover, subject to anti-dilution
        adjustments similar to those contained in the Senior Notes, an approximate
        combined total of 91.3 million shares of common stock.  The Capped
        Calls may reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Senior
        Notes.  Settlement of the Capped Calls in cash on their respective
        expiration dates would result in the Company receiving an amount ranging
        from
        zero if the market price per share of the Company’s common stock is at or below
        $14.23 to a maximum of $538 million.  The Company paid approximately
        $151 million to purchase the Capped Calls.  The Capped Calls expire on
        various dates between November 2011 and December 2012.  The Capped
        Calls are considered capital transactions and the related cost was recorded
        as a
        charge to additional capital.

Shareholders’
        Equity

Stock
        Rights:

As of August 30, 2007, Intel held stock rights
        exchangeable into approximately 16.9 million shares of the Company’s common
        stock.  The shares issuable pursuant to the stock rights are included
        in weighted-average common shares outstanding in the computations of earnings
        per share.

Stock
        Warrants:

In 2001, the Company received $480 million
        from the issuance of warrants to purchase 29.1 million shares of the Company’s
        common stock.  The warrants entitle the holders to exercise their
        warrants and purchase shares of common stock for $56.00 per share at any
        time
        through May 15, 2008 (the “Expiration Date”).  Warrants exercised
        prior to the Expiration Date will be settled on a “net share” basis, wherein
        investors receive common stock equal to the difference between $56.00 and
        the
        average closing sale price for the common shares over the 30 trading days
        immediately preceding the exercise date.  At expiration, the Company
        may elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis or for cash, provided
        certain conditions are satisfied.  As of August 30, 2007, no warrants
        have been exercised.

Accumulated
        Other
        Comprehensive Loss:

Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of
        tax, consists of the following as of the end of the periods shown

Equity
        Plans

As
        of August 30, 2007, the Company had
        an aggregate of 181.8 million shares of its common stock reserved for issuance
        for stock options and restricted stock awards, of which 124.8 million shares
        were subject to outstanding awards and 57.0 million shares were available
        for
        future grants.  Awards are subject to terms and conditions as
        determined by the Company’s Board of Directors.


Stock
        Options:

Stock options granted by the Company are
        generally exercisable in increments of 25% during each year of employment
        beginning one year from the date of grant.  Stock options issued prior
        to January 19, 1998, and after September 22, 2004, generally expire six years
        from the date of grant.  All other options expire ten years from the
        grant date.

In
        connection with the Company’s
        acquisition of Lexar in 2006, the Company assumed Lexar options, which were
        converted into options to purchase 6.6 million shares of the Company’s common
        stock, which vest over four years and expire ten years from the grant
        date.  (See “Acquisitions – Lexar Media, Inc.”)

Option
        activity for 2007 is summarized
        as follows:

The
        following table summarizes
        information about options outstanding as of August 30, 2007:

The
        weighted-average grant-date fair
        value per share was $4.87, $5.92 and $5.10 for options granted during 2007,
        and 2005, respectively.  The total intrinsic value was $32 million and
        $46 million for options exercised during 2007 and 2006.  The total
        intrinsic value for options exercised during 2005 was de minimis.

Changes
        in the Company’s nonvested
        options for 2007 are summarized as follows:


As
        of August 30, 2007, there was $64
        million of total unrecognized compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures
        related to nonvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over
        a
        weighted-average period of 1.4 years.  The Company’s nonvested options
        as of August 30, 2007, have a weighted-average exercise price of $13.06,
        a
        weighted-average remaining contractual life of 4.95 years and a de minimis
        aggregate intrinsic value.

The
        fair value of each option award is
        estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
        model.  Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from
        traded options on the Company’s stock and historical volatility.  The
        expected life of options granted is based on historical experience and on
        the
        terms and conditions of the options.  The risk-free rates are based on
        the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant.  For
        purposes of this valuation model, no dividends have been assumed.  The
        Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
        the
        fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
        transferable and requires the input of subjective assumptions, including
        the
        expected stock price volatility and estimated option
        life.  Assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model are presented
        below:

Restricted
        Stock:

As of August 30, 2007, there were 5.3 million
        shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units outstanding, of which
        1.5
        million were performance-based restricted stock awards.  For
        service-based restricted stock awards, restrictions generally lapse either
        in
        one-fourth or one-third increments during each year of employment after the
        grant date.  For performance-based restricted stock awards, vesting is
        contingent upon meeting certain Company-wide performance
        goals.  Restricted stock activity for 2007 is summarized as
        follows:

The
        weighted-average grant-date fair
        value for restricted stock awards granted during 2007 and 2006 was $14.91
        and
        $13.04 per share, respectively.  The total value of awards for which
        restrictions lapsed during 2007 and 2006 was $11 million and $2
        million.  As of August 30, 2007, there was $49 million of total
        unrecognized compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures, related to
        nonvested restricted stock awards, which is expected to be recognized over
        a
        weighted-average period of 1.4 years.


Stock
        Purchase
        Plan:

The Company’s 1989 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
        (“ESPP”) allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company’s common
        stock through payroll deductions.  Prior to July 1, 2005, shares could
        be purchased at 85% of the lower of the beginning or ending closing stock
        prices
        of each quarterly offering period.  After July 1, 2005, shares can be
        purchased at 95% of the ending closing stock price of each offering quarterly
        period.  Shares can be resold when purchased.  Purchases are
        limited to 20% of an employee’s eligible compensation.  As of August
        30, 2007, 27.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock had been issued
        under the ESPP and 2.1 million shares were available for future issuance
        under
        the plan.

Non-Employee
        Director Stock
        Incentive Plan:

Shares are issued under the Director
        Stock Incentive Plan (“DSIP”) as compensation to non-employee directors of the
        Company.  As of August 30, 2007, 64,666 shares of the Company’s common
        stock had been issued under the DSIP and 435,334 shares were reserved for
        future
        issuance under the plan.

Stock-Based
        Compensation
        Expense:

Total compensation cost for the Company’s
        stock plans was as follows:

Stock-based
        compensation expense of $3
        million and $1 million was capitalized and remained in inventory at the end
        of
        2007 and 2006, respectively.  As of August 30, 2007, $113 million of
        total unrecognized compensation costs net of estimated forfeitures related
        to
        non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
        of
        1.4 years.

Through
        2005, the Company accounted for
        its stock plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion
        No.
        25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related
        interpretations.  Previously reported amounts have not been
        restated.  The following presents the pro forma income and per share
        data required under SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” as
        if a fair value based method had been used to account for stock-based
        compensation for 2005:

Stock-based
        compensation expense in the
        above presentation does not reflect any significant income taxes, which is
        consistent with the Company’s treatment of income or loss from its U.S.
        operations.  (See “Income Taxes.”)  In 2005, the Company
        accelerated the vesting of substantially all of its unvested stock options
        then
        outstanding under the Company’s stock plans to reduce compensation costs
        recognized subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123(R).


Assumptions
        used in the Black-Scholes
        option valuation model to estimate the value of the Company’s options included
        in pro forma amounts for 2005 are presented below:

Employee
        Benefit Plans

The
        Company has employee retirement
        plans at its U.S. and international sites.  Details of the more
        significant plans are discussed as follows:

Employee
        Savings Plan for
        U.S. Employees:

The Company has a 401(k) retirement
        plan (“RAM Plan”) under which U.S. employees may contribute up to 45% of their
        eligible pay (subject to IRS annual contribution limits) to various savings
        alternatives, none of which include direct investment in the Company’s common
        stock.  Under the RAM plan, the Company matches in cash eligible
        contributions from employees up to 4% of the employee’s annual eligible
        earnings, or $2,000, whichever is greater.  Contribution expense for
        the Company’s RAM Plan was $31 million, $26 million and $18 million in 2007,
        2006 and 2005, respectively.

Retirement
        Plans

:

The Company has pension plans
        in various countries worldwide.  The pension plans are only available
        to local employees and are generally government mandated.  Upon
        adoption of FAS 158 as of August 30, 2007, the Company recorded a liability
        of
        $8 million related to the unfunded pension liabilities of the
        plans.

Restructure

In
        an effort to increase the Company’s
        competitiveness and efficiency, in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company
        announced a number of initiatives to drive greater cost efficiencies and
        revenue
        growth across its operations.  The initiatives included workforce
        reductions in certain areas of the Company as the Company’s business is
        realigned. Additional initiatives include establishing certain operations
        closer
        in location to the Company’s global customers, evaluating functions more
        efficiently performed through partnerships or other outside relationships
        and
        reducing the Company’s overhead costs to meet or exceed industry benchmarks. The
        Company will continue to execute the initiatives through 2008. In connection
        with the restructure, the Company recorded a charge of $19 million consisting
        primarily of employee severance and related costs resulting from a reduction
        in
        the Company’s workforce of approximately 1,000 employees (primarily from the
        Company’s Memory segment).  As of August 30, 2007, $5 million of the
        restructure costs remained unpaid and were included in accounts payable and
        accrued expenses.

Other
        Operating (Income) Expense, Net

Other
        operating income for 2007
        includes $43 million from gains on disposals of semiconductor equipment,
        a gain
        of $30 million from the sale of certain intellectual property to Toshiba
        Corporation and $7 million in grants received in connection with the Company’s
        operations in China.  Other operating expense for 2007 includes losses
        of $14 million from changes in currency exchange rates.  Other
        operating income for 2006 includes $230 million of net proceeds for the sale
        of
        the Company’s existing NAND Flash memory designs and certain related technology
        to Intel net of amounts paid by the Company for a perpetual, paid-up license
        to
        use and modify such designs.  Other operating income for 2006 also
        includes $23 million in additional amounts expected to be reimbursed resulting
        from the extension of an economic development agreement, which allows the
        Company to recover amounts relating to certain investments in IM
        Flash.  (See “Joint Ventures – NAND Flash Joint Ventures with
        Intel.”)  Other operating income for 2005 includes gains net of losses
        on disposals of semiconductor equipment of $13 million and $12 million in
        receipts from the U.S. Government in connection with anti-dumping
        tariffs.


Income
        Taxes

Income
        (loss) before taxes and
        noncontrolling interests in net income and the income tax (provision) consisted
        of the following:

The
        Company’s income tax (provision)
        computed using the U.S. federal statutory rate reconciled to the Company’s
        income tax (provision) follows:

State
        taxes reflect investment tax
        credits of $10 million, $23 million and $14 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005,
        respectively.

Deferred
        income taxes reflect the net
        tax effects of temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities
        for financial reporting and income tax purposes.  The Company’s
        deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following as of the end
        of
        the periods shown below:


The
        Company has a valuation allowance
        against substantially all of its U.S. net deferred tax assets.  As of
        August 30, 2007, the Company had aggregate U.S. tax net operating loss
        carryforwards of $2.2 billion and unused U.S. tax credit carryforwards of
        $202
        million.  The Company also has unused state tax net operating loss
        carryforwards of $1.5 billion and unused state tax credits of $169 million
        as of
        August 30, 2007.  Substantially all of the net operating loss
        carryforwards expire in 2022 to 2027 and substantially all of the tax credit
        carryforwards expire in 2013 to 2027.  As a consequence of prior
        business acquisitions, utilization of the tax benefits for some of the tax
        carryforwards is subject to limitations imposed by Section 382 of the Internal
        Revenue Code and some portion or all of these carryforwards may not be available
        to offset any future taxable income.

The
        changes in valuation allowance of
        $227 million and $(114) million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, are primarily
        due to uncertainties of realizing certain U.S. net operating losses and certain
        tax credit carryforwards.  The change in the valuation allowance in
        2007 and 2006 includes $6 million and $12 million, respectively, for stock
        plan
        deductions, which will be credited to additional capital if
        realized.

Provision
        has been made for deferred
        taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that
        dividend payments from such companies are expected to result in additional
        tax
        liability.  Remaining undistributed earnings of $935 million as of
        August 30, 2007, have been indefinitely reinvested; therefore, no provision
        has
        been made for taxes due upon remittance of these
        earnings.  Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax
        liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable.


Earnings

        below are the potential common
        shares, as of the end of the periods shown below, that could dilute basic
        earnings per share in the future that were not included in the computation
        of
        diluted earnings per share because to do so would have been
        antidilutive:

Acquisitions

Lexar
        Media, Inc.
        (“Lexar”):

On June 21, 2006, the Company acquired Lexar, a
        designer, developer, manufacturer and marketer of Flash memory products,
        in a
        stock for stock merger to broaden the Company’s NAND Flash memory product
        offering, enhance its retail presence and strengthen its portfolio of
        intellectual property.  Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement,
        each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Lexar was converted
        into
        0.5925 shares of Micron’s common stock (the “Exchange Ratio”), and each issued,
        outstanding and unexercised Lexar employee stock option with an exercise
        price
        per share of $9.54 or less was converted into a Micron employee stock option
        using the Exchange Ratio.  In connection therewith, the Company issued
        50.7 million shares of common stock, issued 6.6 million stock options and
        incurred other acquisition costs resulting in an aggregate purchase price
        of
        $886 million.  The Company’s results of operations for 2006 include
        the results of Lexar, which are included in the Company’s Memory segment, for
        the period subsequent to the acquisition date.

The
        $886 million purchase price was
        allocated to the assets and liabilities of Lexar based on an estimate of
        fair
        values as follows:


As
        of June 21, 2006, the estimated fair
        value of Lexar’s convertible debt exceeded its face value by $43
        million.  The convertible debt was recorded at its $70 million face
        value and the $43 million was recorded as additional capital in the accompanying
        consolidated financial statements.

Effective
        September 15, 2006, the
        Company and Toshiba Corporation entered into agreements settling all outstanding
        NAND Flash memory-related litigation between the companies.  Toshiba
        purchased certain of the Company’s semiconductor technology patents and licensed
        certain patents previously owned by Lexar.  The Company will receive
        payments totaling $288 million over three years, a substantial portion of
        which
        was included in the allocation of the purchase price for Lexar as a receivable
        at an imputed interest rate of 5.9%.  As of August 30, 2007, $193
        million of the settlement proceeds remained in current and noncurrent
        receivables.

The
        following unaudited pro forma
        information presents the consolidated results of operations of the Company
        as if
        the acquisition of Lexar had taken place at the beginning of 2006 and at
        the
        beginning of 2005.  The pro forma information does not necessarily
        reflect the actual results that would have occurred nor is it necessarily
        indicative of future results of operations.

Avago
        Technologies Limited
        Image Sensor Business:

On December 11, 2006, the
        Company acquired the CMOS image sensor business of Avago Technologies Limited
        (“Avago”), for an initial cash payment of $53 million and additional contingent
        consideration at inception of up to $17 million if certain milestones were
        met
        through 2008.  Due to the achievement of certain milestones during
        2007, the Company increased the initial $53 million acquisition cost (and
        its
        preliminary allocation of this cost to goodwill) by $4 million.  Based
        on a preliminary allocation of acquisition costs as of August 30, 2007, the
        Company had recorded total assets of $58 million (including intangible assets
        of
        $17 million and goodwill of $40 million) and total liabilities of $1
        million.  The Company’s results of operations subsequent to the
        acquisition date include the CMOS image sensor business acquired from Avago
        as
        part of the Company’s Imaging segment.  Mercedes Johnson, a member of
        the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Senior Vice President, Finance and
        Chief Financial Officer of Avago.  Ms. Johnson recused herself from
        all deliberations of the Company’s Board of Directors concerning this
        transaction.


Joint
        Ventures

NAND
        Flash Joint Ventures
        with Intel (“IM Flash”):

The Company has formed two
        joint ventures with Intel to manufacture NAND Flash memory products for the
        exclusive benefit of the partners:  IM Flash Technologies, LLC and IM
        Flash Singapore LLP.  As of August 30, 2007, the Company owned 51% and
        Intel owned 49% of IM Flash.  The Company’s capital contributions of
        assets and cash to IM Flash were matched by pro rata cash contributions from
        Intel of $1,238 million and $936 million in 2007 and 2006,
        respectively.  The partners share the output of IM Flash generally in
        proportion to their ownership in IM Flash.  IM Flash sells products to
        the joint venture partners at long-term negotiated prices approximating
        cost.  IM Flash sales to Intel were $255 million and $111 million for
        2007 and 2006, respectively.

IM
        Flash manufactures NAND Flash memory
        products based on NAND Flash designs developed by the Company and Intel and
        licensed to the Company.  Product design and other research and
        development costs for NAND Flash are generally shared equally between the
        Company and Intel.  In 2007 and 2006, the Company received $240
        million and $86 million, respectively, from Intel under the NAND Flash research
        and development cost sharing arrangement.  In the second quarter of
        2006, the Company received net proceeds of $230 million from Intel for the
        sale
        of the Company’s then existing NAND Flash memory designs and certain related
        technology and the Company’s acquisition of a perpetual, paid-up license to use
        and modify such designs.

Under
        the terms of a lease agreement,
        IM Flash has the use of approximately 50% of the Company’s manufacturing
        facility in Manassas, Virginia through January 2016.  IM Flash
        purchases and installs manufacturing equipment into the leased facility,
        which
        is operated and maintained by the Company.  The cost of operating and
        maintaining the equipment is charged to IM Flash.  Under the terms of
        a wafer supply agreement, the Company manufactures wafers for IM Flash in
        its
        Boise, Idaho facility through January 2011.  The Company and Intel
        entered into various service contracts with IM Flash under which they provide
        operational and administrative support services.  The Company and
        Intel generally charge IM Flash for costs of providing such
        services.

The
        Company has determined that both of
        the IM Flash joint ventures are variable interest entities as defined in
        FIN
        46(R), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” and that the Company is
        the primary beneficiary of both.  Accordingly, IM Flash financial
        results are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
        of
        the Company.  All amounts pertaining to Intel’s interests in IM Flash
        are reported as noncontrolling interest.  IM Flash’s cash and
        marketable investment securities are not anticipated to be made available
        to
        finance the Company’s other operations.  The creditors of IM Flash
        have recourse only to the assets of IM Flash and do not have recourse to
        any
        other assets of the Company.

TECH
        Semiconductor
        Singapore Pte. Ltd. (“TECH”):

Since 1998, the Company
        has participated in TECH, a semiconductor memory manufacturing joint venture
        in
        Singapore among the Company, the Singapore Economic Development Board (“EDB”),
        Canon Inc. and HP.  As of August 30, 2007, the Company owned an
        approximate 73% interest in TECH.  The shareholders’ agreement for the
        TECH joint venture expires in 2011.  The Company began consolidating
        TECH’s financial results as of the beginning of the Company’s third quarter of
        2006.  TECH’s cash and marketable investment securities are not
        anticipated to be made available to finance the Company’s other
        operations.  The creditors of TECH have recourse only to the assets of
        TECH and do not have recourse to any other assets of the Company.

On
        March 30, 2007, the Company
        exercised its option and acquired all of the shares of TECH common stock
        held by
        EDB for approximately $290 million, of which $216 million was outstanding
        as of
        August 30, 2007, payable through December 2007.  As a result of the
        acquisition, the Company’s ownership interest in TECH increased from 43% to
        73%.  The Company applied purchase accounting to the acquisition of
        these shares, which resulted in a $322 million reduction in noncontrolling
        interest.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect
        the impact of acquiring these shares as of March 30, 2007.

TECH’s
        semiconductor manufacturing uses
        the Company’s product and process technology.  Subject to specific
        terms and conditions, the Company has agreed to purchase all of the products
        manufactured by TECH.  The Company generally purchases semiconductor
        memory products from TECH at prices determined quarterly, based on a discount
        from average selling prices realized by the Company for the preceding
        quarter.  The Company performs assembly and test services on product
        manufactured by TECH.  The Company also provides certain technology,
        engineering and training to support TECH.  Through the second quarter
        of 2006, prior to the consolidation of TECH, all of these transactions with
        TECH
        were recognized as part of the net cost of products purchased from
        TECH.  The net cost of products purchased from TECH amounted to $287
        million for the first six months of 2006 and $652 million for 2005.


MP
        Mask Technology Center,
        LLC (“MP Mask”):

In the third quarter of 2006, the
        Company formed a joint venture, MP Mask, with Photronics, Inc. (“Photronics”) to
        produce photomasks for leading-edge and advanced next generation
        semiconductors.  The Company contributed its then existing reticle
        manufacturing operation to the venture.  In exchange for a 49.99%
        interest in MP Mask, Photronics paid $48 million cash and $15 million in
        notes
        due over two years to the Company.  In connection with the joint
        venture, the Company received $72 million in exchange for entering into a
        license agreement with Photronics, which will be recognized over the term
        of the
        10-year agreement.  The Company and Photronics also entered into
        supply arrangements wherein the Company is expected to purchase a substantial
        majority of the reticles produced by MP Mask.  The financial results
        of MP Mask are included in the consolidated financial results of the
        Company.

REPORT
        OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
        the
        Board of Directors and Shareholders

of
        Micron
        Technology, Inc.

In
        our opinion, the consolidated
        financial statements listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item
        present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Micron
        Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries at August 30, 2007 and August 31, 2006,
        and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
        three
        years in the period ended August 30, 2007 in conformity with accounting
        principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  In
        addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
        accompanying index appearing under Item 8 presents fairly, in all material
        respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
        the
        related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company
        maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
        reporting as of August 30, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal
        Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
        Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company's
        management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement
        schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
        and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
        reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
        Reporting appearing under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express
        opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule,
        and
        on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our
        integrated audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the
        standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
        States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits
        to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
        free
        of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
        reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the
        financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
        the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
        accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
        and
        evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of
        internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding
        of
        internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
        weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
        effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our
        audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
        in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
        for
        our opinions.

As
        discussed in the Significant
        Accounting Policies note to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
        changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation in the
        year
        ended August 31, 2006.

A
        company’s internal control over
        financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
        regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
        financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
        accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial
        reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
        maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
        reflect
        the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
        reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
        preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
        accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
        are
        being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
        of
        the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
        or
        timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
        company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
        statements.

Because
        of its inherent limitations,
        internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
        misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
        to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
        because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
        policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Controls and Procedures

An
        evaluation was carried out under the
        supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including
        its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the
        effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls
        and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
        Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this
        report.  Based upon that evaluation, the principal executive officer
        and principal financial officer concluded that those disclosure controls
        and
        procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
        by
        the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
        is
        (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
        specified in the Commission’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and
        communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s principal
        executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow
        timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

During
        the fourth quarter of fiscal
        2007, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial
        reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
        affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s
        Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The
        Company’s management is responsible
        for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
        reporting for the Company.  Internal control over financial reporting
        is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
        of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
        purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
        United States of America.  The Company’s internal control over
        financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i) pertain
        to
        the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately reflect the
        transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; ii) provide
        reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
        preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
        accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company
        are
        being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
        of
        the Company; and iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
        timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
        Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s financial
        statements.

Internal
        control over financial
        reporting cannot provide absolute assurance regarding the prevention or
        detection of misstatements because of inherent limitations.  These
        inherent limitations are known by management and considered in the design
        of the
        Company’s internal control over financial reporting which reduce, though not
        eliminate, this risk.

Management
