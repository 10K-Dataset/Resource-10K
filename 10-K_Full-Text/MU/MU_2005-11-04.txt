Overview

The Company is an industry
leading, global manufacturer and marketer of semiconductor devices, principally
DRAM and NAND Flash memory, and CMOS image sensors.  Our products are key components used in a
broad array of electronic applications including personal computers,
workstations, network servers, mobile phones, flash memory cards, USB storage
devices, digital still cameras, MP3 players and other consumer electronics
products.  The Company’s customers are
original equipment manufacturers located around the world.

The Company’s products are
offered in a wide variety of package and configuration options, architectures,
and performance characteristics tailored to meet application and customer
needs.  Individual devices take advantage
of the Company’s advanced silicon processing technology and manufacturing
expertise.  The Company continually
introduces new generations of products that offer lower costs per unit and
improved performance characteristics.

Products

Dynamic Random Access Memory (“DRAM”):

DRAM
products are high-density, low-cost-per-bit, random access memory devices that
provide high-speed data storage and retrieval. 
DRAM products were 87%, 92% and 96% of the Company’s net sales in 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.  The Company
offers DRAM products with a variety of performance, pricing and other
characteristics.  Historically, most of
the Company’s DRAM sales have been from standardized, high-density, high-volume
products sold for use as main memory in computers.  With the development, introduction and
acceptance of new memory architectures, computer main memory has transitioned
in recent years from synchronous DRAM (“SDRAM”) to Double Data Rate Synchronous
DRAM (“DDR”) and DDR2.  In 2005, the
majority of the Company’s DRAM revenue came from sales of DDR and DDR2 products
for use in computer main memory.  In
2005, the Company experienced a significant increase in revenue from sales of
specialty memory products (such as pseudo-static RAM


(“PSRAM”) and Mobile SDRAM) that are generally targeted to applications
with specific performance characteristics such as low power, low latency, and
high mobility.  The Company expects sales
of these products to continue to increase in 2006.

DDR and DDR2:

DDR and DDR2 are standardized,
high-volume, DRAM products that are sold primarily for use as main system
memory in computers.  DDR and DDR2
products offer high speed and high bandwidth at a relatively low cost compared
to other semiconductor memory products. 
DDR products were 44%, 57% and 57% of the Company’s net sales in 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.  DDR2
products were 14% the Company’s net sales in 2005 and were 20% of net sales in
the fourth quarter of 2005.  DDR2 products
are expected to become the Company’s primary DRAM product in 2006.

In
response to changes in the DRAM market, the Company has broadened its DDR and
DDR2 product offerings in recent years. 
The Company offers DDR products in 128 Meg, 256 Meg, 512 Meg and 1 Gig
densities.  The Company also offers 256
Meg, 512 Meg and 1 Gig DDR2 products and has begun sampling 2 Gig DDR2.  The Company expects that these densities will
be necessary to meet customers’ demand in the future.  In the fourth quarter of 2005, 512 Meg
devices replaced 256 Meg density devices as the Company’s predominant density
for DDR and DDR2 products.  The Company
also offers its DDR and DDR2 products in multiple configurations, speeds and
package types.

SDRAM:

In 2005, SDRAM was primarily used in
networking devices, servers, consumer electronics, communications equipment and
computer peripherals as well as upgrades to legacy computers.  Sales of SDRAM products were 20%, 31% and 37%
of the Company’s net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  SDRAM sales have declined as personal
computer manufacturers have transitioned to DDR and DDR2 products, the decline
has been partially offset by increased usage of SDRAM products in other
applications.  The Company offers 64 Meg,
128 Meg, 256 Meg and 512 Meg SDRAM products.

PSRAM:

PSRAM products, marketed by the Company under
the proprietary brand name CellularRAM™, are DRAM products with
an SRAM-like interface.  PSRAM combines
the minimal power consumption of SRAM with a much lower cost-per-bit to provide
an economical alternative to SRAM.  PSRAM
products are used primarily in cellular phone applications.  The Company offers PSRAM products in 16 Meg,
32 Meg, 64 Meg and 128 Meg densities. 
Sales of PSRAM products increased significantly in 2005 and were 7% of
the Company’s net sales in 2005.

Mobile DRAM:

Mobile DRAM products are
specialty DRAM memory devices designed for applications that demand minimal
power consumption, such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), smart phones,
GPS devices, digital still cameras and other handheld electronic devices.  Sales of Mobile DRAM products grew
significantly to 2% of net sales in 2005 and are expected to continue to grow
in 2006.  The Company sells SDRAM and DDR
Mobile memory products in 64 Meg, 128 Meg, 256 Meg and 512 Meg densities.  The Company’s mobile DRAM products feature
its proprietary Endur-IC™ technology, which the Company believes provides
distinct advantages to its customers in terms of low power, high quality, high
reliability, and overall robustness.

Reduced Latency DRAM

(“

RLDRAM”):

RLDRAM
products are low-latency DRAM memory devices with high clock rates targeted at
network applications.  The Company began
shipping commercial volumes of RLDRAM products in 2005.

NAND Flash Memory:

Flash memory products are
electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor devices that retain
memory content when power is turned off. 
The Company’s Flash efforts are concentrated on NAND Flash (“NAND”)
devices which use semiconductor technology similar to DRAM.  NAND offers faster erase and write times, higher
density, and lower cost per bit than NOR Flash, which is the primary competing
Flash architecture.  In addition, NAND
has significantly longer cycle endurance making it ideal for mass-storage
devices.  The market for NAND products has grown rapidly and the Company expects
it to continue to grow due to demand for removable and embedded storage
devices.  Removable storage devices such
as USB and Flash memory cards are used with applications such as personal computers,
digital still cameras, MP3 players and mobile phones.  Embedded NAND-based storage devices are also
beginning to be utilized in mobile phones and other personal and consumer
applications.

NAND and DRAM share common manufacturing processes, enabling t

he Company to leverage its product and
process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across product
lines.  The Company’s NAND designs
feature a small cell structure that allows for higher densities for demanding
applications.  In the second quarter of
2005, the Company began shipping its first NAND product, a 2 Gig device
incorporating the Company’s 90nm process technology.  NAND sales grew to 6% of the Company’s
overall net sales in the fourth quarter of 2005.  In 2006, the Company plans to introduce 1 Gig
and 4 Gig


NAND products and begin manufacturing NAND products using 72nm process
technology.  The Company expects sales of
NAND to continue to increase in 2006 as the Company allocates additional
manufacturing resources to NAND production.

Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (“CMOS”) Image Sensors:

CMOS
image sensors are semiconductor devices that capture and process images into
pictures or video for a variety of consumer and industrial applications.  The Company’s CMOS image sensors are used in
products such as cellular phone cameras, digital still cameras, pill cameras
for medical use, automotive and other emerging applications.  The Company offers image sensors in a range
of pixel resolutions from its VGA (video graphics array) products to its higher
resolution 3.1 megapixel products.  In September 2005,
the Company introduced a 5 megapixel sensor designed for use in digital still
cameras and cameral phones and a 3.1 megapixel designed specifically for camera
phones.  These products feature a
leading-edge pixel size of 2.2 square microns, enabling a smaller form factor
for the sensor.  The Company expects to
begin shipping commercial volumes of these products in 2006.  Image sensors are sold either as individual
components or combined with integrated circuitry to create complete camera
system-on-a-chip (“SOC”) solutions.  In
2005, the Company’s image sensors were primarily used in mobile applications.

The Company’s CMOS image
sensors incorporating its DigitalClarity™ technology have many advantages over
other CMOS image sensors and charge-coupled device (“CCD”) sensors.  The Company’s DigitalClarity™ technology
features “active pixels” enabling better sensor performance that produces
higher-quality images at faster frame rates. 
Unlike CCD sensors, which rely on specialized fabrication requiring
dedicated, and costly manufacturing processes, CMOS image sensors can be
manufactured using standardized semiconductor processes resulting in substantially
lower costs.  The Company’s low-leakage
DRAM processes are particularly well-suited for the manufacture of CMOS image
sensors.  The Company’s CMOS image
sensors consume substantially less power than CCD devices, a critical advantage
in the battery-dependent portable device applications where most image sensors
are used.  By combining all camera
functions on a single chip, from the capture of photons to the output of
digital bits, CMOS image sensors reduce the part-count of a digital camera system,
which in turn increases reliability, eases miniaturization, and enables on-chip
programming of frame size, windowing, exposure, and other camera
parameters.  The Company’s CMOS image
sensors are also capable of producing high-quality images in low-light
conditions.  The Company’s CMOS image sensors’
active-pixel design architecture enables them to achieve performance comparable
to high-end CCD sensors and higher than competitor’s CMOS image sensors.

The Company’s sales of CMOS
image sensors for 2005 increased over 200% from 2004.  In the fourth quarter of 2005, sales of CMOS
image sensors were 9% of the Company’s net sales.  The Company expects its sales of CMOS image
sensors to continue to grow rapidly in 2006 due to strong demand and increases
in the allocation of manufacturing capacity. 
The overall market for image sensors is expected to increase
significantly over the next several years due to the growth forecasted for
applications such as phone cameras and digital still cameras.  Additionally, CMOS image sensors are expected
to capture an increasing percentage of the overall image sensor market.

Manufacturing

The Company’s manufacturing
facilities are located in the United States, Italy, Japan, Puerto Rico,
Scotland and Singapore.  The Company’s
manufacturing facilities generally operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per
week.  Semiconductor manufacturing is
extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated
facilities and equipment.  Most semiconductor
equipment must be replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced
equipment.

The Company’s process for
manufacturing semiconductor products is complex, involving a number of precise
steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly, burn-in and final test.  Efficient production of semiconductor
products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing
techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple
facilities.  The primary determinants of
manufacturing cost are die size, number of mask layers, number of fabrication
steps and number of good die produced on each wafer.  Other factors that contribute to
manufacturing costs are wafer size, cost and sophistication of manufacturing
equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials,
labor productivity, package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing
environment.  The Company is continuously
enhancing production processes, reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher
density products.  In 2005, the Company
manufactured most of its products using its 110 nanometer (“nm”) line-width
process technology and began transferring its manufacturing operations to 95nm
line-width process technology.  The
Company expects to continue to transfer more of its manufacturing operation to
95nm and lower line-width process technology in 2006.  In 2005 most of the Company’s DRAM products
incorporated its 6F² Hypershrink™ array architecture technology, a design rule that
incorporates a memory cell in 6 design features rather and the industry
standard 8 design features, which enables production of approximately 20% more
die per wafer.


Wafer fabrication occurs in
a highly controlled, clean environment to minimize dust and other yield- and
quality-limiting contaminants.  Despite
stringent manufacturing controls, dust particles, equipment errors, minute
impurities in materials, defects in photomasks and circuit design marginalities
or defects which can lead to wafers being scrapped and individual circuits
being nonfunctional.  Success of the
Company’s manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects and
thereby maximizing yield of high-quality circuits.  In this regard, the Company employs rigorous
quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening and testing processes.  The Company is able to recover many
nonstandard devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of
functionality.

After fabrication, silicon
wafers are separated into individual die. 
Functional die are sorted, connected to external leads and encapsulated
in plastic packages.  The Company
assembles products in a variety of packages, including TSOP (thin small outline
package), TQFP (thin quad flat package) and FBGA (fine pitch ball grid array).  Each completed package is then inspected and
tested.  The Company also sells
semiconductor products in an unpackaged or die form.  The Company tests its products at various
stages in the manufacturing process, performs high temperature burn-in on
finished products and conducts numerous quality control inspections throughout
the entire production flow.  In addition,
the Company uses its proprietary AMBYX™ line of intelligent test and burn-in
systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of DRAM die during the burn-in
process, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and
cost.

A significant portion of the
Company’s memory products are assembled into memory modules for sale to
customers.  Memory modules consist of an
array of memory components attached to printed circuit boards (“PCBs”) that
insert directly into computer systems or other electronic devices.  Memory components are attached to PCBs in a
soldering process performed by screen printing machines and high speed
automated pick-and-place machines. 
Completed modules are tested by custom equipment and visually inspected.

In 2005, the Company
significantly increased its 300mm wafer production.  The Company manufactured 256 Meg and 512 Meg
DDR devices on the Company’s 110nm process technology on 300mm wafers, and
manufactured the industry’s first memory devices in production to utilize
copper interconnects.  In 2006, the
Company plans to continue increasing its 300mm wafer manufacturing capacity.

In recent years the Company
has produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products, which enhances the
Company’s ability to allocate resources to its most profitable products but
increases the complexity of the manufacturing process.  Although new product lines such as NAND
Flash, CMOS image sensors and specialty memory can be manufactured using
processes that are very similar to the processes for the Company’s predominant
DRAM products, frequent conversions to new products and the allocation of
manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume parts can affect the
Company’s cost efficiency.  However, the
Company’s ability to competitively manufacture many of these products on
existing 200mm lines significantly extends the useful life of this equipment.

TECH Semiconductor Singapore Pte. Ltd. (“TECH”):

TECH is a memory manufacturing joint venture in Singapore among Micron
Technology, Inc., the Singapore Economic Development Board, Canon Inc. and
Hewlett-Packard Company.  TECH’s
semiconductor manufacturing facilities use the Company’s product and process
technology.  Subject to specific terms
and conditions, the Company has agreed to purchase all of the products
manufactured by TECH.  TECH supplied
approximately 25%, 30% and 30% of the total megabits of memory produced by the
Company in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 
The Company generally purchases semiconductor memory products from TECH
at prices determined quarterly, based on a discount from average selling prices
realized by the Company for the preceding fiscal quarter.  The Company performs assembly and test
services on product manufactured by TECH. 
The Company also provides certain technology, engineering and training
to support TECH.  All of these
transactions with TECH are recognized as part of the net cost of products
purchased from TECH.

Availability of Raw Materials

The Company’s production processes require raw
materials that meet exacting standards, including several that are customized
for, or unique to, the Company.  The
Company generally has multiple sources of supply; however, only a limited
number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet
the Company’s standards.  Various factors
could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers,
photomasks, chemicals, gases, lead frames, molding compound and other
materials.  In addition, any
transportation problems could delay the Company’s receipt of raw
materials.  Although raw materials
shortages or transportation problems have not interrupted the Company’s
operations in the past, shortages may occur from time to time in the future.  Also, lead times for the supply of raw
materials have been extended in the past. 
If the Company’s supply of raw materials is interrupted, or lead times
are extended, results of operations could be adversely affected.


Marketing and Customers

The Company’s products are
sold into computing and consumer, networking and telecommunications, and
imaging markets.  Approximately 70% of
the Company’s net sales for 2005 were to the computing market, including
desktop PCs, notebooks, servers and workstations.  Sales to both Dell Computer Corporation and
Hewlett-Packard Company exceeded 10% of the Company’s net sales in 2005, 2004
and 2003, and aggregated 23%, 27% and 28% of the Company’s net sales in 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

The Company markets its
semiconductor products primarily through its own direct sales force.  The Company maintains inventory at locations
in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of product
shipments.  The Company’s products are
also offered through independent sales representatives, distributors and
Crucial Technology, the Company’s web-based customer direct sales
division.  The Company’s products are
offered under the Micron, SpecTek and Crucial brand names, and under other
private labels.  The Company maintains
sales offices in all of its primary markets around the world.  Independent sales representatives obtain orders
subject to final acceptance by the Company and are compensated on a commission
basis.  The Company makes shipments
against these orders directly to the customer. 
Distributors carry the Company’s products in inventory and typically
sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors’
products.

Segmentation of the memory
market continues, with diverse memory needs being driven by the different
requirements of personal computers, servers, mobile devices, and
communications, consumer and other applications that demand specific memory
solutions.  Many of the Company’s
customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products,
which may take several months.  As the
Company further diversifies its product lines and reduces the die sizes of
existing memory products, more products become subject to qualification which
may delay volume introduction of specific devices by the Company.

Backlog

Volatile industry conditions
make customers reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts.  Accordingly, new order volumes for the
Company’s semiconductor products fluctuate significantly.  Orders are typically accepted with
acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at
the date of shipment.  Customers can
change delivery schedules or cancel orders without significant penalty.  For these reasons, the Company does not
believe that its order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable
indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period.

Product Warranty

Because the design and
manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is
possible that the Company may produce products that do not comply with customer
specifications, contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end
uses.  In accordance with industry practice, the Company generally provides
a limited warranty that its products are in compliance with Company
specifications existing at the time of delivery.  Under the Company’s
general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product
during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of
defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for
such items.  Under certain circumstances the Company may provide more
extensive limited warranty coverage and general legal principles may impose
more extensive liability than that provided under the Company’s general terms
and conditions.

Competition

The Company faces intense
competition in the semiconductor memory markets from a number of companies,
including Elpida Memory, Inc., Hynix Semiconductor Inc., Infineon
Technologies AG and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, SanDisk Corporation and
Toshiba Corporation.  Additionally, the
Company faces competition from emerging companies in Taiwan and China who have
announced plans to significantly expand the scale of their operations.  The Company faces competition in the image
sensor market from a number of suppliers of CMOS image sensors as well a large
number of suppliers of CCD image sensors. 
Some of the Company’s competitors are large corporations or
conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the
semiconductor markets in which the Company competes, invest in technology and
capitalize on growth opportunities.  The
Company’s competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce
die size and


minimize mask levels in their product designs.  These factors have significantly increased
worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices.

Research and Development

To compete in the
semiconductor memory industry, the Company must continue to develop
technologically advanced products and processes.  The Company believes that expansion of its
semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for
specific memory solutions.  The Company
has several product design centers around the world, the largest located at its
corporate headquarters in Boise, Idaho. 
In addition, the Company has a facility at its Boise site to develop
leading edge photolithography mask technology.

R&D expenses vary
primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced
equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel
costs.  Because of the lead times necessary
to manufacture the Company’s products, the Company typically begins to process
wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing.  The Company deems development of a product
complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance
and reliability and is internally qualified for sale to customers.  R&D expenses can vary significantly
depending on the timing of product qualification.  Product development costs are recorded as
R&D expense.  The Company’s R&D
expenses were $603.7 million, $754.9 million and $656.4 million in 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

The Company’s process
technology R&D efforts are focused primarily on development of 95nm, 78nm,
65nm and smaller DRAM and 90nm, 72nm and 50nm and smaller NAND Flash line-width
process technologies, which are designed to facilitate the Company’s transition
to next generation products.  Additional
R&D efforts include process development to support the Company’s 300mm
wafer manufacturing, NAND Flash memory, CMOS image sensors, specialty memory
products (including PSRAM, mobile SDRAM and RLDRAM) and new memory
manufacturing materials.  Efforts toward
the design and development of new products are concentrated on the Company’s 1
Gig and 2 Gig DDR, DDR2 and DDR3 DRAM products as well as high density and
mobile NAND Flash memory, CMOS image sensors and specialty memory products.

12,400 in the United States, 2,800 in Singapore, 1,800 in Italy, 1,200 in Japan
and 300 in the United Kingdom.  The
Company’s employees in Italy are represented by labor organizations that have
entered into national and local labor contracts with the Company.  The Company’s employment levels can vary
depending on market conditions and the level of the Company’s production,
research and product and process development. 
Many of the Company’s employees are highly skilled, and the Company’s
continued success depends in part upon its ability to attract and retain such
employees.  The loss of key Company
personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business,
results of operations or financial condition.


Environmental Compliance

Government regulations
impose various environmental controls on raw materials and discharges,
emissions and solid wastes from the Company’s manufacturing processes.  In 2005, the Company’s wafer fabrication
facilities continued to conform to the requirements of ISO 14001
certification.  To continue
certification, the Company met annual requirements in environmental policy,
compliance, planning, management, structure and responsibility, training,
communication, document control, operational control, emergency preparedness
and response, record keeping and management review.  While the Company has not experienced any
materially adverse effects on its operations from environmental regulations,
changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures,
modification of operations or other compliance actions.

Directors and Executive
Officers of the Registrant

Officers of the Company are
appointed annually by the Board of Directors. 
Directors of the Company are elected annually by the shareholders of the
Company.  Any directors appointed by the
Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the Board serve until the next election

Legal Proceedings

On August 28, 2000, the
Company filed a complaint against Rambus, Inc. (“Rambus”) in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Delaware seeking monetary damages and
declaratory and injunctive relief.  Among other things, the Company’s
complaint (as amended) alleges violation of federal antitrust laws, breach of
contract, fraud, deceptive trade practices, and negligent misrepresentation. 
The complaint also seeks a declaratory judgment (a) that certain Rambus
patents are not infringed by the Company, are invalid, and/or are
unenforceable, (b) that the Company has an implied license to those
patents, and (c) that Rambus is estopped from enforcing those patents
against the Company.  On February 15, 2001, Rambus filed an answer
and counterclaim in Delaware denying that the Company is entitled to relief,
alleging infringement of the eight Rambus patents named in the Company’s
declaratory judgment claim, and seeking monetary damages and injunctive
relief.  A number of other suits are currently pending in Europe alleging
that certain of the Company’s SDRAM and DDR SDRAM products infringe various of
Rambus’ country counterparts to its European patent 525 068, including: 
on September 1, 2000, Rambus filed suit against Micron Semiconductor
(Deutschland) GmbH in the District Court of Mannheim, Germany; on September 13,
2000, Rambus filed suit against Micron Europe Limited in the High Court of
Justice, Chancery Division in London, England;  on September 22,
2000, Rambus filed a complaint against the Company and Reptronic (a distributor
of the Company’s products) in Court of First Instance of Paris, France; on September 29,
2000, the Company filed suit against Rambus in the Civil Court of Milan, Italy,
alleging invalidity and non-infringement.  In addition, on December 29,
2000, the Company filed suit against Rambus in the Civil Court of Avezzano,
Italy, alleging invalidity and non-infringement of the Italian counterpart to
European patent 1 004 956.  Additionally, other suits are pending alleging
that certain of our DDR SDRAM products infringe Rambus’ country counterparts to
its European patent 1 022 642, including:  on August 10, 2001, Rambus
filed suit against the Company and Assitec (an electronics retailer) in the
Civil Court of Pavia, Italy; and on August 14, 2001, Rambus filed suit
against Micron Semiconductor (Deutschland) GmbH in the District Court of
Mannheim, Germany.  In the European suits against the


Company, Rambus is seeking monetary damages and injunctive
relief.  Subsequent to the filing of the various European suits, the
European Patent Office declared Rambus’ 525 068 and 1 004 956 European patents
invalid and revoked the patents.

On March 1, 2005,
Tessera, Inc. (“Tessera”) filed suit against the Company in the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging infringement of five
Tessera patents.  On June 22, 2005, the Company filed an answer and
counterclaim denying Tessera’s claims and alleging infringement of eight
Company patents.

On June 2, 2005,
Tadahiro Ohmi (“Ohmi”) filed suit against the Company in the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Texas (amended on August 31, 2005)
alleging infringement of a single Ohmi patent.

Among other things, the
above lawsuits pertain to certain of the Company’s SDRAM, DDR SDRAM, and DDR2
SDRAM products, which account for a significant portion of the Company’s net
sales.  The Company is unable to predict the outcome of these suits.

A court determination that
the Company’s products or manufacturing processes infringe the product or
process intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability
and/or require the Company to make material changes to its products and/or
manufacturing processes.  Any of the foregoing results could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or
financial condition.

On June 17, 2002, the
Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California seeking information regarding an investigation
by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) into
possible antitrust violations in the “Dynamic Random Access Memory” or “DRAM”
industry.  The Company is cooperating fully and actively with the DOJ in
its investigation.  The Company’s cooperation is pursuant to the terms of
the DOJ’s Corporate Leniency Policy, which provides that in exchange for our
full, continuing and complete cooperation in the pending investigation, the
Company will not be subject to prosecution, fines or other penalties from the
DOJ.

Subsequent to the
commencement of the DOJ investigation, a number of purported class action
lawsuits have been filed against the Company and other DRAM suppliers. 
Eighteen cases have been filed in various federal district courts (one of which
has been voluntarily dismissed) asserting claims on behalf of a purported class
of individuals and entities that purchased DRAM directly from the various DRAM
suppliers during the period from April 1, 1999 through at least June 30,
2002.  All of the cases have been transferred to the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of California for consolidated proceedings.  The
complaints allege price-fixing in violation of federal antitrust laws and seek
treble monetary damages, costs, attorneys’ fees, and an injunction against the
allegedly unlawful conduct.  Additionally, four cases have been filed in
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California asserting
claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that
indirectly purchased DRAM and/or products containing DRAM from various DRAM
suppliers during the time period from April 1, 1999 through at least June 30,
2002.  The complaints allege price fixing in violation of federal
antitrust laws and various state antitrust and unfair competition laws and seek
treble monetary damages, restitution, costs, interest and attorneys’
fees.  In addition, at least sixty-one cases have been filed in various
state courts (three of which have been voluntarily dismissed) asserting claims
on behalf of a purported class of indirect purchasers of DRAM.  Cases have
been filed in the following states:  Arkansas, Arizona, California,
Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin, and West Virginia, and also in
the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  The complaints purport to be on
behalf of a class of individuals and entities that indirectly purchased DRAM
and/or products containing DRAM in the respective jurisdictions during various
time periods ranging from 1999 through the filing date of the various
complaints.  The complaints allege violations of the various jurisdictions’
antitrust, consumer protection and/or unfair competition laws relating to the
sale and pricing of DRAM products and seek treble monetary damages,
restitution, costs, interest and attorneys’ fees.  A number of these cases
have been removed to federal court and transferred to the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of California (San Francisco) for consolidated
proceedings.  Additionally, three cases have been filed in the following
Canadian courts:  Superior Court, District of Montreal, Province of
Quebec; Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Ontario; and Supreme Court of
British Columbia, Vancouver Registry, British Columbia.  The substantive
allegations in these cases are similar to those asserted in the cases filed in
the United States.  Based upon the Company’s analysis of the claims made
and the nature of the DRAM industry, the Company believes that class treatment
of these cases is not appropriate and that any purported injury alleged by
plaintiffs in the direct purchaser cases would be more appropriately resolved
on a customer-by-customer basis.  In addition, the Attorneys General of
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois,
Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New
York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Vermont,
Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin have indicated that they are
investigating potential state and federal civil claims against the Company and
other DRAM suppliers on behalf of state and governmental entities that were
direct or indirect purchasers of DRAM and potentially on behalf of other
indirect purchasers of DRAM.  The Company
is unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits and investigations. 
The final resolution of these alleged violations of


antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or
financial condition.

On May 5, 2004, Rambus
filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California (San
Francisco County) against the Company and other DRAM suppliers.  The
complaint alleges various causes of action under California state law including
a conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices on Rambus DRAM (“RDRAM”) and
unfair competition.  Tessera also has asserted certain antitrust and
unfair competition claims relating to Tessera’s packaging technology. 
These complaints seek treble damages, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, costs,
and a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in
the complaints.  The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the
suit.  A court determination against the Company could result in
significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
business, results of operations or financial condition.

Overview

The Company is a global
manufacturer of semiconductor devices, principally DRAM, NAND Flash, and CMOS
image sensors.  Its products are used in
a broad range of electronic applications including personal computers,
workstations, network servers, mobile phones and other consumer applications
including flash memory cards, USB storage devices, digital still camera and MP3
players.  The Company’s customers are
principally original equipment manufacturers located around the world.  The Company’s success is largely dependent on
the market acceptance of a diversified semiconductor product portfolio,
efficient utilization of the Company’s manufacturing infrastructure, successful
ongoing development of advanced process technologies and generation of
sufficient return on research and development efforts.

The Company has
strategically diversified its business by expanding into semiconductor products
such as specialty memory products (including SDRAM, PSRAM, mobile SDRAM and
reduced latency DRAM), NAND Flash memory products and CMOS image sensors.  These products are used in a wider range of
applications than the computing applications that use the Company’s
standardized DRAM products.  The Company
leverages its expertise in semiconductor memory manufacturing and product and
process technology to provide these products that are differentiated from
competitors’ products based on performance characteristics.  In the fourth quarter of 2005, specialty
memory products, NAND Flash products and CMOS image sensors were over 45% of
the Company’s net sales.  The Company
expects that the markets for these products will grow more rapidly than the
overall semiconductor market in the near term. 
The Company’s products have been well received in these growing customer
applications.  The Company plans to
allocate an increasing portion of its manufacturing capacity to support these
products and expand its market position in 2006.  The Company believes that the strategic
diversification of its product portfolio will strengthen its ability to
allocate manufacturing resources to obtain the highest rate of return.

The Company makes
significant ongoing investments to implement its proprietary product and
process technology in its manufacturing facilities in the United States, Europe
and Asia to provide semiconductor products with increasing functionality and
performance at lower costs.  The Company
introduces new generations of products that offer improved performance
characteristics, such as higher data transfer rates, reduced package size,
lower power consumption and increased megapixel count.  The Company generally reduces the
manufacturing cost of each generation of product through its advanced product
and process technology such as its leading-edge line width process technology
and innovative array architecture.

In order to maximize returns
from investments in research and development (“R&D”), the Company develops
process technology that effectively reduces production costs and leverages the
Company’s capital expenditures.  To be
successfully incorporated in customers’ end products, the Company must offer
qualified semiconductor solutions at a time when customers are developing their
design specifications for their end products. 
This is especially true for specialty memory products and CMOS image
sensors which are required to demonstrate advanced functionality and
performance well ahead of a planned ramp of production to commercial
volumes.  In addition, DRAM and NAND
Flash products often incorporate highly advanced design and process
technologies that are difficult to manufacture. 
The Company must make significant investments in R&D to expand its
product offering and develop its leading-edge product and process technologies.


Results of Operations

The Company’s fiscal year is
the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31.  The Company’s fiscal 2005 and 2003 contained
52 weeks.  The Company’s fiscal 2004
contained 53 weeks.

Net Sales

Net sales for 2005 increased
by 11% as compared to 2004 primarily due to a 40% increase in megabits of
memory sold, partially offset by a 24% decrease in the overall average selling
price per megabit for the Company’s memory products.  Net sales for 2005 also benefited from an
increase of approximately $200 million in sales of CMOS image sensors.  The Company’s overall megabit production in
2005 increased by 48% as compared to 2004, principally due to a steep ramp in
300mm wafer production and gains in manufacturing efficiencies realized from improvements
in product and process technologies.  The
Company realized a significant increase in 300mm wafer production in 2005,
achieving its initial target of 5,000 wafer outs per week in the fourth
quarter.  The Company expects that its
300mm wafer production will continue to increase in 2006.  The Company’s megabit production exceeded
megabit sales in 2005, which resulted in an approximate 170% increase in
megabit finished goods inventories, primarily consisting of DDR and DDR2
products.  The increase in inventories
was largely the result of a slower than previously expected industry-wide
transition to DDR2 memory products.

Most of the increase in
sales in 2005 as compared to 2004 resulted from sales of the Company’s emerging
specialty memory products, such as pseudo-static RAM (“PSRAM”) and mobile DRAM
products, CMOS image sensors and NAND Flash memory.  The Company’s combined revenue from these
products was $811.9 million in 2005 and quadrupled from 2004 due to large
increases in production and strong demand for the Company’s offerings in these
product groups.  The Company expects that
its revenue from these products will continue to grow rapidly in 2006 as it
allocates increasing manufacturing resources to these product groups.  DDR and DDR2 product sales in 2005 increased
12% from 2004 and were 59% of the Company’s net sales in 2005.  Sales of DDR2 products increased to 14% of
the Company’s net sales in 2005 from 1% of net sales in 2004.  The Company expects that sales of DDR2
products will continue to increase in 2006 as market demand continues to shift
from DDR products to more advanced DDR2 products.

Net sales for 2004 increased
by 42% as compared to 2003 primarily due to a 20% increase in megabits sold and
a 16% increase in average per megabit selling prices for the Company’s memory
products as a result of generally improved market conditions.  During 2004, the Company increased its
allocation of manufacturing capacity to specialty memory products and CMOS
image sensors.  The shift in product mix
contributed to the increase in average per megabit selling prices for 2004 as
specialty memory products on average had higher selling prices per megabit than
the Company’s DDR and DDR2 products.  The
Company’s overall megabit production for 2004 increased approximately 23% from
2003 primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies.  The growth rate in megabit production for
2004 was partially mitigated by the allocation of wafers to CMOS image sensors
and specialty memory products.

Gross Margin

The Company’s gross margin
percentage for 2005 declined to 24% as compared to 30% for 2004.  This decline in gross margin was primarily
due to the 24% decrease in the Company’s overall average selling price per
megabit of memory and, to a lesser extent, a shift in product mix from DDR to
DDR2 products which had lower margins in 2005. 
Partially offsetting this decline in gross margin from 2005 to 2004 was
a reduction in cost of goods sold per megabit and the increase in sales of CMOS
image sensors, specialty memory and NAND Flash products, which had
significantly higher margins than DDR and DDR2 products.

The Company’s overall cost
of goods sold per megabit in 2005 declined from 2004 primarily due to
manufacturing improvements.  The Company
reduced product costs through manufacturing efficiencies achieved from improved
product yield and increase in production utilizing the Company’s 110nm process
technology and 6F² technology.  The cost per
megabit for


products
manufactured on 300mm wafers decreased significantly in 2005 compared to 2004
as the Company continued to increase 300mm wafer production, reaching its
initial target of 5,000 wafer outs per week. 
Manufacturing costs per megabit for DDR2 products were higher than the
Company’s DDR products in 2005 because of DDR2’s relatively larger die
size.  The Company expects that per
megabit cost reductions in 2006 will continue to be mitigated by shifts in
product mix from DDR to DDR2.

The Company’s gross margin
percentage for 2004 improved to 30% from a negative 1% for 2003 primarily due
to the 16% increase in average per megabit selling prices and reduced costs per
megabit.  In addition, compared to 2003,
gross margin for 2004 benefited from relatively higher margins on sales of
products purchased from the Company’s TECH joint venture.  The Company reduced its overall average cost
per megabit for 2004 as compared to 2003 through manufacturing efficiencies
achieved by improving product yields and continuing its transition to products
utilizing 110nm process technology and 6F² technology.

Inventory
write-downs:

In accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, the Company recorded $307.0 million of charges to cost
of goods sold in 2003 to write down the carrying values of work in process and
finished goods inventories to their estimated market values.  As these charges were recorded in advance of
when inventory subject to the write-down was sold, gross margins in the period
of sale were higher than they would be absent the effect of the previous
write-downs.  The Company did not record
any charges for inventory write-downs in 2005 and 2004.  Costs of goods sold in 2004 were $61.0
million lower than they otherwise would have been as a result of write-downs in
prior periods.  Costs of goods sold in
2003 were $174.9 million lower than they otherwise would have been as a result
of write-downs in prior periods net of the write-downs in 2003.

TECH
Semiconductor Singapore Pte. Ltd. (“TECH”):

The Company’s
TECH joint venture supplied approximately 25%, 30% and 30% of the total
megabits of memory produced by the Company in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.  The Company generally
purchases memory products from TECH at prices determined quarterly, based on a
discount from average selling prices realized by the Company for the
immediately preceding quarter.  Depending
on market conditions, the gross margin from the sale of products manufactured
by TECH may be higher or lower than the gross margin from the sale of products
manufactured by the Company’s wholly-owned operations.  In 2005, the Company realized gross margin
percentages on sales of TECH products that were approximately the same as for
the DDR and DDR2 products manufactured by its wholly-owned operations.  In 2004 and 2003, the Company realized higher
gross margin percentages on sales of TECH products than for products
manufactured by its wholly-owned operations.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and
administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for 2005 increased 5% from 2004 primarily
due to higher compensation costs, partially offset by a decrease in costs
associated with legal matters.  SG&A
expenses for 2004 were 7% lower than for 2003 primarily due to lower costs associated
with outstanding legal matters and reduced depreciation costs, partially offset
by higher levels of performance-based compensation expense and other personnel
costs.

Research and Development

R&D expenses vary
primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced
equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel
costs.  Because of the lead times
necessary to manufacture its products, the Company typically begins to process
wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing.  The Company deems development of a product
complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for
performance and reliability.  R&D
expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification.

R&D expenses for 2005
decreased 20% from 2004 principally because products were qualified on the
300mm wafer fabrication process in the first quarter of 2005.  When products are qualified, the Company
includes costs from the production of these products in inventory and costs of
goods sold rather than research and development expense.  Higher compensation costs partially offset
the decreases in R&D expenses for 2005 as compared to 2004.  R&D expenses for 2004 increased 15% from
2003 principally due to an increase in development wafers processed during 2004
as the Company increased its product diversification and ramped production at
its 300mm wafer fabrication facility, which primarily ran development wafers in
2004.  Higher R&D costs in 2004 as
compared to 2003 also reflected a higher level of expenses related to CMOS
image sensors, Flash memory and specialty memory products.

The Company’s process
technology R&D efforts are focused primarily on development of 95nm, 78nm,
65nm and smaller DRAM and 90nm, 72nm, 50nm and smaller NAND Flash line-width
process technologies, which are designed to facilitate the Company’s transition
to next generation products.  Additional
R&D efforts include process development to support the Company’s 300mm


wafer
manufacturing, NAND Flash memory, CMOS image sensors, specialty memory products
(including PSRAM, mobile SDRAM and reduced latency DRAM) and new manufacturing
materials.  Efforts toward the design and
development of new products are concentrated on the Company’s 1 Gig and 2 Gig
DDR, DDR2 and DDR3 products as well as high density and mobile NAND Flash
memory, CMOS image sensors and specialty memory products.

Restructure and Other Charges

In 2003, the Company
announced a series of cost-reduction initiatives.  The restructure plan included the shutdown of
the Company’s 200mm production line in Virginia; the discontinuance of certain
memory products, including SRAM and TCAM; and an approximate 10% reduction in
the Company’s worldwide workforce.  In
2003, the Company recorded restructure charges of $109.2 million and other
restructure-related charges of $7.1 million, including $50.7 million of
equipment write-downs, $26.3 million of severance and other termination
benefits and $18.6 million of intangible asset write downs.  The Company recorded net credits to
restructure of $1.4 million and $22.5 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively,
primarily from sales of equipment associated with the Company’s 200mm
production line in Virginia.  The Company
substantially completed the restructure plan and paid essentially all costs
associated with the restructure plan in 2004 and 2003.

Stock-Based Compensation

In December 2004, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.”  SFAS No. 123(R) will require the Company
to use a fair-value based method of accounting for share-based compensation
beginning in 2006.  Through 2005 the
Company used the intrinsic-value method to account for stock-based compensation
and generally no compensation costs were recorded.  Accordingly, the Company’s implementation of
SFAS No. 123(R) will increase compensation costs reflected in cost of
goods sold, SG&A and R&D in the consolidated statement of operations
for future periods.

In April of 2005, the
Company accelerated the vesting of approximately 44.6 million unvested stock
options outstanding under the Company’s stock plans to reduce compensation
costs that would have been recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements after 2005 with the adoption of SFAS 123(R) by approximately $100
million.  As of September 1, 2005,
3% of the Company’s then outstanding stock options were unvested and the
expense for these unvested stock options to be recorded in 2006 through 2009 is
$10.4 million.  Because the Company’s
near-term, stock-based compensation costs were reduced by the acceleration of
vesting, share-based compensation costs could grow significantly in future
periods if the Company continues to grant amounts of new share-based
compensation awards similar to recent periods.

Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net

Other operating income for
2005 includes net gains on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment
of $12.7 million and $12.0 million in receipts from the U.S. government in
connection with anti-dumping tariffs. 
Other operating expense for 2004 includes losses of $17.2 million from
changes in currency exchange rates. 
Other operating income for 2004 includes $7.2 million from the
Commonwealth of Virginia for meeting investment commitments at the Virginia
wafer fabrication facility and net gains of $3.9 million on write-downs and
disposals of semiconductor equipment. 
Other operating expense for 2003 includes net losses on write-downs and
disposals of semiconductor equipment of $41.5 million and losses of $10.7
million from changes in currency exchange rates.  Other operating expense for 2003 is net of
$14.4 million in receipts from the U.S. government in connection with anti-dumping
tariffs.  The Company estimates that,
based on its assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S.
dollar as of September 1, 2005, a 1% change in the exchange rate versus
the U.S. dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of
approximately $1 million for the yen and $1 million for the euro.

Income Taxes

Income taxes for 2005, 2004
and 2003 primarily reflect taxes on the Company’s non-U.S. operations.  The Company has a valuation allowance for its
net deferred tax asset associated with its U.S. operations.  The provision for taxes on U.S. operations in
2005 and 2004 was substantially offset by a reduction in the valuation
allowance.  Until such time as the
Company utilizes its U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and unused tax
credits, the provision for taxes on the Company’s U.S. operations is expected
to be substantially offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance.  As of September 1, 2005, the Company had
aggregate U.S. tax net operating loss carryforwards of $2.5 billion and unused
U.S. tax credit carryforwards of $140.7 million.  The Company also has unused state tax net
operating loss carryforwards of $1.7 billion and unused state tax credits of
$137.5 million.  Substantially all of the
net operating loss carryforwards expire in 2022 to 2025 and substantially all
of the tax credit carryforwards expire in 2013 to 2025.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s liquidity is
highly dependent on average selling prices for its semiconductor memory
products and the timing of capital expenditures, both of which can vary
significantly from period to period.  As
of September 1, 2005, the Company had cash and marketable investment
securities totaling $1,290.4 million compared to $1,231.0 million as of September 2,
2004.

Operating
Activities:

For 2005, net cash provided by operating
activities was $1,237.8 million, which principally reflects the Company’s
$188.0 million of net income adjusted by $1,264.5 million for non-cash
depreciation and amortization expense. 
Cash provided by operations was reduced by a $193.3 million increase in
inventories.  The increase in inventories
was largely the result of a slower than previously expected industry-wide
transition to DDR2 memory products.

Investing
Activities:

For 2005, net cash used by investing
activities was $1,083.9 million, which included cash expenditures for property,
plant and equipment of $1,064.8 million. 
The Company believes that to develop new product and process
technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and
maintain product quality, it must continue to invest in manufacturing
technologies, facilities and capital equipment, research and development, and
product and process technologies.  The
Company projects 2006 capital spending of $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion.  As of September 1, 2005, the Company had
commitments extending into 2007 of approximately $250 million for the
acquisition of property, plant and equipment.

Financing
Activities:

For 2005, net cash used by financing
activities was $115.5 million.  Payments
on debt were $300.0 million for 2005, and included prepayment of the $210.0
million outstanding on the Company’s subordinated notes that were due September 2005.  Payments on equipment purchase contracts were
$236.0 million for 2005.  In the third
quarter of 2005, the Company obtained an aggregate of 23.5 billion yen ($221.4
million) from two yen-denominated loan financing arrangements that are payable
in semi-annual installments through 2010. 
In 2005, the Company received $161.3 million in proceeds from
sales-leaseback transactions which are payable in periodic installments through
January 2009.

In 2004, the Company
received $450.0 million from Intel in exchange for stock rights exchangeable
into approximately 33.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock.  Additionally, the Company agreed to achieve
operational objectives or be subject to monetary penalties.  The Company has achieved operational
objectives and does not expect to make any payments to Intel under this
agreement.

Access to capital markets
has historically been important to the Company. 
Depending on market conditions, the Company may, from time to time,
issue registered or unregistered securities to raise capital to fund a portion
of its operations.

As of September 1,
2005, the Company had $632.5 million of 2.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes
(the “Notes”) outstanding.  Holders of
the Notes may convert all or some of their Notes at any time prior to maturity,
unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into the Company’s common stock at a
conversion rate of 84.8320 shares for each $1,000 principal amount of the
Notes.  This conversion rate is
equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $11.79 per share.  The Company may redeem the Notes at any time
after February 6, 2006, at declining premiums to par.

Contractual
Obligations:

The following table summarizes the Company’s
significant contractual obligations at September 1, 2005, and the effect
such obligations are expected to have on the Company’s liquidity and cash flows
in future periods.

The obligations disclosed above do not include
contractual obligations recorded on the Company’s balance sheet as current
liabilities except for the current portion of long-term debt.  The expected timing of payment amounts of the
obligations


discussed
above is estimated based on current information.  Timing and actual amounts paid may differ
depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, market prices or
changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.

Purchase obligations include all commitments to
purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any
of the following criteria: (1) they are noncancelable, (2) the
Company would incur a penalty if the agreement was cancelled, or (3) the
Company must make specified minimum payments even if it does not take delivery
of the contracted products or services (“take-or-pay”).  If the obligation to purchase goods or
services is noncancelable, the entire value of the contract was included in the
above table.  If the obligation is
cancelable, but the Company would incur a penalty if cancelled, the dollar
amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation.  Contracted minimum amounts specified in
take-or-pay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent
the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment.

The Company has an agreement with its TECH joint
venture to purchase all of TECH’s output of semiconductor memory components
subject to specific terms and conditions. 
As the purchase quantities are based on qualified production output, the
agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity and therefore
the Company did not include the agreement in its purchase obligations.  In addition to purchase quantities, the TECH
purchase obligation fluctuates based on average selling prices for
semiconductor memory components which can change significantly from period to
period.  In 2005, the net cost of
semiconductor components purchased from TECH was $651.9 million.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

As of September 1,
2005, the Company had the following off-balance sheet arrangements:  convertible debt, call spread options, stock
warrants and its variable interest in the TECH joint venture.

See “Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources”
for a description of the Company’s convertible debt.

Concurrent with the issuance
of the Notes, the Company purchased call spread options (the “Call Spread
Options”) covering 53.7 million shares of the Company’s common stock, which is
the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes in full.  The Call Spread Options have a lower strike
price of $11.79, a higher strike price of $18.19, may be settled at the Company’s
option either in cash or net shares and expire on January 29, 2008.  Settlement of the Call Spread Options in cash
on January 29, 2008, would result in the Company receiving an amount
ranging from zero if the market price per share of the Company’s common stock
is at or below $11.79 to a maximum of $343.4 million if the market price per
share of the Company’s common stock is at or above $18.19.

In 2001, the Company
received $480.2 million from the issuance of warrants to purchase 29.1 million
shares of the Company’s common stock. 
The warrants entitle the holders to exercise their warrants and purchase
shares of Common Stock for $56.00 per share (the “Exercise Price”) at any time
through May 15, 2008 (the “Expiration Date”).  Warrants exercised prior to the Expiration
Date will be settled on a “net share” basis, wherein investors receive common
stock equal to the difference between $56.00 and the average closing sale price
for the common shares over the 30 trading days immediately preceding the Exercise
Date.  At expiration, the Company may
elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis or for cash, provided certain
conditions are satisfied.  As of September 1,
2005, there had been no exercises of warrants and all warrants issued remained
outstanding.

See “Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
– Joint Venture” for a description of the Company’s arrangement with its TECH
joint venture.

Recently Issued
Accounting Standards

In May 2005, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.”  SFAS No. 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20,
“Accounting Changes,” and SFAS No. 3, “Reporting Accounting Changes in
Interim Financial Statements,” and changes the requirements for the accounting
for and reporting of a change in accounting principle.  The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 154
for accounting changes and error corrections that occur after the beginning of
2007.  The Company’s results of
operations and financial condition will only be impacted following the adoption
of SFAS No. 154 if it implements changes in accounting principle that are
addressed by the standard or corrects accounting errors in future periods.


In March 2005, the FASB
issued Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations,” which clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a
liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if
the fair value can be reasonably estimated even though uncertainty exists about
the timing and (or) method of settlement. 
The Company is required to adopt Interpretation No. 47 prior to the
end of 2006.  The Company is currently
assessing the impact of Interpretation No. 47 on its results of operations
and financial condition.

In December 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.”  SFAS No. 123(R) establishes standards
for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity
instruments for goods or services or incurs liabilities in exchange for goods
or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity
instruments, focusing primarily on accounting for transactions in which an
entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions.  SFAS No. 123(R) requires public entities
to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of
equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with
limited exceptions) and recognize the cost over the period during which an
employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.  In March 2005, the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued SAB 107 which expresses views of the SEC
staff regarding the application of SFAS No. 123(R).  Among other things, SAB 107 provides
interpretive guidance related to the interaction between SFAS No. 123(R)
and certain SEC rules and regulations as well as provides the SEC staff’s
views regarding the valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public
companies.  The Company is required to
adopt SFAS No. 123(R) in the beginning of 2006.  Upon adoption, the Company will record
non-cash stock compensation expense primarily associated with future grants of
stock options, which will have an adverse effect on its results of operations.

In December 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets – An Amendment
of APB Opinion No. 29,” which eliminates the exception for nonmonetary
exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception
for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance.  The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 153
for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in the first quarter of 2006 and its
adoption is not expected to have a significant effect on the Company’s results
of operations or financial condition.

In November 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs – An Amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4,” which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage).  The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 151
in the beginning of 2006 and its adoption is not expected to have a significant
effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial
statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures.  Estimates and judgments are based on
historical experience, forecasted future events and various other assumptions
that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Estimates and judgments may vary under
different assumptions or conditions.  The
Company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.  Management believes the accounting policies
below are critical in the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and
results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective or
complex judgments.

Contingencies:

The
Company is subject to the possibility of losses from various
contingencies.  Considerable judgment is
necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such
contingencies.  An accrual is made when
it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired
and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  The Company accrues a liability and charges
operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted
and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date.

Income
taxes:

The Company is required to estimate its
provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in
numerous tax jurisdictions around the world. 
Estimates involve interpretations of regulations and are inherently
complex.  Resolution of income tax
treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after
completion of any fiscal year.  The
Company is also required to evaluate the realizability of its deferred tax
assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the
assessment of the Company’s performance and other relevant factors when
determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred
tax assets.  Realization of deferred tax
assets is dependent on the Company’s ability to generate future taxable income.

Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market
value.  Cost includes labor, material and
overhead costs, including product and process technology costs.  Determining market value of inventories
involves numerous judgments, including projecting average selling prices and
sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in


work in process inventories.  To
project average selling prices and sales volumes, the Company reviews recent
sales volumes, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry
analysis of supply and demand, seasonal factors, general economic trends and
other information.  When these analyses
reflect estimated market values below the Company’s manufacturing costs, the
Company records a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory
is actually sold.  Differences in
forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market
adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable
value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of write-down
recorded.  Due to the volatile nature of
the semiconductor memory industry, actual selling prices and volumes often vary
significantly from projected prices and volumes and, as a result, the timing of
when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly.

U.S. GAAP provides for
products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market
values.  The amount of any inventory
write-down can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory
categories.  The Company’s inventory has
been categorized as semiconductor memory products or CMOS image sensors.  The major characteristics the Company
considers in determining inventory categories are product type and markets.

Product and
process technology:

Costs incurred to acquire product and process
technology or to patent technology developed by the Company are capitalized and
amortized on a straight-line basis over periods currently ranging up to 10
years.  The Company capitalizes a portion
of costs incurred based on its analysis of historical and projected patents
issued as a percent of patents filed. 
Capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the
shorter of (i) the estimated useful life of the technology, (ii) the
patent term or (iii) the term of the technology agreement.

Property,
plant and equipment:

The Company reviews the carrying value of
property, plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be
recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its
use and/or disposition.  In cases where
undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an
impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value
exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. 
The estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which
require judgment by the Company, including, but not limited to, future use of
the assets for Company operations versus sale or disposal of the assets, future
selling prices for the Company’s products and future production and sales
volumes.  In addition, judgment is
required by the Company in determining the groups of assets for which impairment
tests are separately performed.

Research
and development:

Costs related to the conceptual formulation
and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development
when incurred.  Determining when product
development is complete requires judgment by the Company.  The Company deems development of a product
complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for
performance and reliability.

Certain Factors

In
addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the
following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to
differ materially from those contained in any forward- looking statements made
by or on behalf of the Company.

We have
experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our memory products
which have adversely affected our business.

Per megabit average selling
prices decreased 24% in 2005 as compared to 2004.  In recent years, we have also experienced
annual decreases in per megabit average selling prices for our semiconductor
memory products including:  17% in 2003,
53% in 2002, 60% in 2001, 37% in 1999, 60% in 1998 and 75% in 1997.  At times, average selling prices for our
semiconductor products have been below our costs.  If average selling prices for our memory
products decrease faster than we can decrease per megabit costs, our business,
results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely
affected.

Increased
worldwide DRAM production or lack of demand for DRAM could lead to further
declines in average selling prices for DRAM.

The transition to smaller
line-width process technologies and 300mm wafers in the industry could,
depending upon the rate of transition, lead to a significant increase in the
worldwide supply of DRAM.  Increases in
worldwide supply of DRAM also result from DRAM fab capacity expansions, either
by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization or reallocation of
other semiconductor production to DRAM production.  Several of our competitors have announced plans
to increase production through construction of new facilities or expansion of
existing facilities.  Increases in
worldwide supply of DRAM,


if not accompanied with increases in demand, could lead to further
declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially
adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

As the
computer industry matures and the growth rate of computers sold or growth rate
of the amount of semiconductor memory included in each computer decreases,
sales of our semiconductor products could decrease.

We are primarily dependent
on the computing market as most of the semiconductor products we sell are used
in computers, servers or peripheral products. 
Approximately 70% of our sales of semiconductor products for 2005 were
to the computing market.  DRAMs are the
primary semiconductor memory components in computers.  Throughout most of the 1980s and 1990s,
industry revenue for the DRAM market grew at a much faster rate than the
overall economy, driven by both growth in sales of computers and the amount of
memory included in each computer sold. 
However, as with any maturing market, it is unlikely that historic
growth rates for this market will be sustained. 
In recent years, the DRAM market has grown at a significantly slower
rate as the computer industry has continued to mature.  The reduction in the growth rate of computers
sold or growth rate of the amount of semiconductor memory included in each
computer could reduce sales of our semiconductor products and our business,
results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely
affected.

We may be
unable to reduce our per megabit manufacturing costs at the same rate as we have
in the past.

Historically, our gross
margin has benefited from decreases in per megabit manufacturing costs achieved
through improvements in our manufacturing processes, including reducing the die
size of our existing products.  In future
periods, we may be unable to reduce our per megabit manufacturing costs or
reduce costs at historical rates due to the ever increasing complexity of
manufacturing processes, to changes in process technologies or products which
inherently may require relatively larger die sizes, or to strategic product
diversification decisions affecting product mix.

We may not
be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and make
adequate capital investments.

Our cash flows from
operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold, average
selling prices and per megabit manufacturing costs.  To develop new product and process
technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and
maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in
manufacturing technology, facilities and capital equipment, research and
development, and product and process technology.  In addition to cash provided by operations,
we have from time to time utilized external sources of financing.  Depending on general market and economic
conditions or other factors, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash
flows to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments.

The
semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive.

We face intense competition
in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including Elpida
Memory, Inc., Hynix Semiconductor Inc., Infineon Technologies AG, Samsung
Electronics Co., Ltd., SanDisk Corporation and Toshiba Corporation.  Additionally, we face competition from
emerging companies in Taiwan and China who have announced plans to
significantly expand the scale of their operations.  We face competition in the image sensor
market from a number of suppliers of CMOS image sensors as well a large number
of suppliers of CCD image sensors.  Some
of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have
greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which
we compete, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities.  Our competitors seek to increase silicon
capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their
product designs.  These factors have
significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices.

Changes in
foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business,
results of operations or financial condition.

Our financial statements are
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are reported in U.S. dollars.  Across our multi-national operations there
are transactions and balances denominated in other currencies, primarily the
yen and euro.  In the event that the U.S.
dollar weakens significantly compared to the yen or euro, our results of operations
or financial condition will be adversely affected.  The Company estimates that, based on its
assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar as of September 1,
2005, a 1% change in the exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar would result in
foreign currency gains or losses of approximately $1 million for the yen and $1
million for the euro.

If our TECH
joint venture experiences financial difficulty, or if our supply of
semiconductor products from TECH is disrupted, our business, results of
operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.


TECH supplied approximately
25% of our total megabits of memory produced in 2005.  We have agreements to purchase all of the
products manufactured by TECH subject to specific terms and conditions.  In some periods, we have realized higher
margins on products purchased from TECH than products manufactured by our
wholly-owned facilities.  Any reduction
in supply could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations
or financial condition.  As of September 1,
2005, we had intangible assets with a net book value of $50.3 million relating
to the supply arrangement to purchase product from TECH.  In the event that our supply of semiconductor
products from TECH is reduced or eliminated, we may be required to write off
part or all of these assets and our revenues and results of operations would be
adversely affected.

New product
development may be unsuccessful.

We are developing new
products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their
underlying design or process technology. 
We anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor
product development over the next several years.  In particular, we have made significant investments
in NAND Flash and CMOS image sensor product and process technologies.  There can be no assurance that our product
development efforts will be successful, that we will be able to
cost-effectively manufacture these new products, that we will be able to
successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of
these products will recover costs of development efforts.

An adverse determination that our
products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights
of others could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations
or financial condition.

As is
typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to
time, others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or
manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights.  In
this regard, we are engaged in litigation with Rambus, Inc. (“Rambus”)
relating to certain of Rambus’ patents and certain of our claims and
defenses.  On August 28, 2000, we filed a complaint (subsequently
amended) against Rambus in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware
seeking monetary damages and declaratory and injunctive relief.  Among
other things, our amended complaint alleges violation of federal antitrust
laws, breach of contract, fraud, deceptive trade practices, and negligent
misrepresentation.  The complaint also seeks a declaratory judgment (a) that
certain Rambus patents are not infringed by us, are invalid, and/or are
unenforceable, (b) that we have an implied license to those patents, and (c) that
Rambus is estopped from enforcing those patents against us.  On February 15,
2001, Rambus filed an answer and counterclaim in Delaware denying that we are
entitled to relief, alleging infringement of the eight Rambus patents named in
our declaratory judgment claim, and seeking monetary damages and injunctive
relief.  A number of other suits are pending in Europe alleging that
certain of our SDRAM and DDR SDRAM products infringe various of Rambus’ country
counterparts to its European patent 525 068, including:  on September 1,
2000, Rambus filed suit against Micron Semiconductor (Deutschland) GmbH in the
District Court of Mannheim, Germany; on September 13, 2000, Rambus filed
suit against Micron Europe Limited in the High Court of Justice, Chancery
Division in London, England;  on September 22, 2000, Rambus filed a
complaint against us and Reptronic (a distributor of our products) in Court of
First Instance of Paris, France; and on September 29, 2000, we filed suit
against Rambus in the Civil Court of Milan, Italy, alleging invalidity and
non-infringement.  In addition, on December 29, 2000, we filed suit
against Rambus in the Civil Court of Avezzano, Italy, alleging invalidity and
non-infringement of the Italian counterpart to European patent 1 004 956. 
Additionally, other suits are pending alleging that certain of our DDR SDRAM
products infringe Rambus’ country counterparts to its European patent 1 022
642, including:  on August 10, 2001, Rambus filed suit against us and
Assitec (an electronics retailer) in the Civil Court of Pavia, Italy; and on August 14,
2001, Rambus filed suit against Micron Semiconductor (Deutschland) GmbH in the
District Court of Mannheim, Germany.  In the European suits against us, Rambus
is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief.  Subsequent to the
filing of the various European suits, the European Patent Office declared
Rambus’ 525 068 and 1 004 956 European patents invalid and revoked the
patents.  We also are engaged in litigation with Tessera, Inc. (“Tessera”)
relating to certain of Tessera’s patents and certain of our patents.  On March 1,
2005, Tessera filed suit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas alleging infringement of five Tessera patents.  On June 22,
2005, we filed an answer and counterclaim denying Tessera’s claims and alleging
infringement of eight of our patents.  We also are engaged in litigation
with Tadahiro Ohmi (“Ohmi”).  On June 2,
2005, Ohmi filed suit against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Texas (amended on August 31, 2005) alleging
infringement of a single Ohmi patent.

Among
other things, the above lawsuits pertain to certain of our SDRAM, DDRSDRAM, and
DDR2 SDRAM products, which account for a significant portion of our net
sales.  A court determination that our products or manufacturing processes
infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant
liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or
manufacturing processes.  We are unable to predict the outcome of
assertions of infringement made against the Company.  Any of the foregoing
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.


We have a
number of patent and intellectual property license agreements.  Some of
these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic
payments.  We may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew
existing license agreements in the future.  We are unable to predict
whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable
terms.

Allegations of anticompetitive conduct.

On
June 17, 2002, we received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California seeking information regarding an
investigation by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”)
into possible antitrust violations in the “Dynamic Random Access Memory” or “DRAM”
industry.  We are cooperating fully and actively with the DOJ in its
investigation of the DRAM industry.  Our cooperation is pursuant to the
terms of the DOJ’s Corporate Leniency Policy, which provides that in exchange
for our full, continuing and complete cooperation in the pending investigation,
we will not be subject to prosecution, fines or other penalties from the DOJ.

Subsequent
to the commencement of the DOJ investigation, a number of purported class
action lawsuits have been filed against us and other DRAM suppliers. 
Eighteen cases have been filed in various federal district courts (one of which
has been voluntarily dismissed) asserting claims on behalf of a purported class
of individuals and entities that purchased DRAM directly from various DRAM
suppliers during the period from April 1, 1999 through at least June 30,
2002.  All of the cases have been transferred to the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of California for consolidated proceedings.  The
complaints allege price-fixing in violation of federal antitrust laws and seek
treble monetary damages, costs, attorneys’ fees, and an injunction against the
allegedly unlawful conduct.  Additionally, four cases have been filed in
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California asserting
claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that
indirectly purchased DRAM and/or products containing DRAM from various DRAM
suppliers during the time period from April 1, 1999 through at least June 30,
2002.  The complaints allege price fixing in violation of federal
antitrust laws and various state antitrust and unfair competition laws and seek
treble monetary damages, restitution, costs, interest and attorneys’
fees.  In addition, at least sixty-one cases have been filed in various
state and federal courts (three of which have been voluntarily dismissed)
asserting claims on behalf of a purported class of indirect purchasers of
DRAM.  Cases have been filed in the following states:  Arkansas, Arizona,
California, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin, and West Virginia, and
also in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  The complaints purport
to be on behalf of individuals and entities that indirectly purchased DRAM
and/or products containing DRAM in the respective jurisdictions during various
time periods ranging from 1999 through the filing date of the various
complaints.  The complaints allege violations of various jurisdictions’
antitrust, consumer protection and/or unfair competition laws relating to the
sale and pricing of DRAM products and seek treble monetary damages,
restitution, costs, interest and attorneys’ fees.  A number of these cases
have been removed to federal court and transferred to the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of California (San Francisco) for consolidated
proceedings.  Additionally, three cases have been filed in the following
Canadian courts:  Superior Court, District of Montreal, Province of
Quebec; Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Ontario; and Supreme Court of
British Columbia, Vancouver Registry, British Columbia.  The substantive
allegations in these cases are similar to those asserted in the cases filed in
the United States.  Based upon our analysis of the claims made and the
nature of the DRAM industry, we believe that class treatment of these cases is
not appropriate and that any purported injury alleged by plaintiffs in the
direct purchaser cases would be more appropriately resolved on a
customer-by-customer basis.  In addition,
the Attorneys General of Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii,
Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey,
New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,
Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin have
indicated that they are investigating potential state and federal civil claims
against us and other DRAM suppliers on behalf of state and governmental
entities that were direct or indirect purchasers of DRAM and potentially on
behalf of other indirect purchasers of DRAM. 
We are unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits and
investigations.  The final resolution of these alleged violations of
antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

On
May 5, 2004, Rambus filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State
of California (San Francisco County) against us and other DRAM suppliers. 
The complaint alleges various causes of action under California state law
including conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices on Rambus DRAM (“RDRAM”),
and unfair competition.  Tessera also has asserted certain antitrust and
unfair competition claims relating to Tessera’s packaging technology. 
These complaints seek treble damages, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, costs,
and a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in
the complaints.  We are unable to predict the outcome of the suit.  A
court determination against us could result in significant liability and could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

Current economic and political conditions may harm our
business.

Global
economic conditions and the effects of military or terrorist actions may cause
significant disruptions to worldwide commerce. 
If these disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer
orders, a decrease in corporate spending on


information
technology or our inability to effectively market, manufacture or ship our
products, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be
materially adversely affected.

We face risks associated with our international sales and
operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

Sales
to customers outside the United States approximated 66% of our consolidated net
sales for 2005.  In addition, we have
manufacturing operations in Italy, Japan, Puerto Rico, Scotland and
Singapore.  Our international sales and
operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:

•

currency
exchange rate fluctuations,

•

export
and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, and restrictions
on the transfer of funds,

•

political
and economic instability,

•

problems
with the transportation or delivery of our products,

•

issues
arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest,

•

longer
payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, and

•

compliance
with trade and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions.

These factors may materially
adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

If our manufacturing process is disrupted, our business,
results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely
affected.

We manufacture products using
highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and
continuous modification to improve yields and performance.  Difficulties in the manufacturing process or
the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production
and may increase our per megabit manufacturing costs.  From time to time, we have experienced minor
disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages or
equipment failures.  If production at a
fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be
adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers’ requirements and
they may purchase products from other suppliers.  This could result in a significant increase
in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships,
which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

Disruptions in our supply of raw materials could materially
adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Our operations require raw
materials that meet exacting standards. 
We generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials.  However, only a limited number of suppliers
are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards.  Various factors could reduce the availability
of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, lead
frames and molding compound.  Shortages
may occur from time to time in the future. 
In addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt
of raw materials.  Lead times for the
supply of raw materials have been extended in the past.  If our supply of raw materials is disrupted
or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations or financial
condition could be materially adversely affected.

Products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or
are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise
incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise
materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

Because the design and production
process for semiconductor memory is highly complex, it is possible that we may
produce products that do not comply with customer specifications, contain
defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses.  If, despite design review, quality control
and product qualification procedures, problems with nonconforming, defective or


incompatible
products occur after we have shipped such products, we could be adversely
affected in several ways, including the following:

•

we
may replace product or otherwise compensate customers for costs incurred or
damages caused by defective or incompatible product, and

•

we
may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our
products.

We expect to make future acquisitions where advisable, which
involve numerous risks.

We expect to make future
acquisitions where we believe it is advisable to enhance shareholder
value.  Acquisitions involve numerous
risks, including:

•

increasing
our exposure to changes in average selling prices for semiconductor products,

•

difficulties
in integrating the operations, technologies and products of the acquired
companies,

•

increasing
capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities,

•

increasing
debt to finance any acquisition,

•

diverting
management’s attention from normal daily operations,

•

managing
larger operations and facilities and employees in separate geographic areas,
and

•

hiring
and retaining key employees.

Mergers
and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky, and future
acquisitions may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations or financial condition.

Item
7A.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

As
of September 1, 2005, over $1.0 billion

of
the Company’s $1.2 billion in total debt was at fixed interest rates.  As a result, the fair value of the debt
fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates.  The estimated fair market value of the
Company’s debt approximated $1.2 billion as of September 1, 2005 and September 2,
2004.  The Company entered into an
interest rate swap agreement (the “Swap”) that effectively converted, beginning
August 29, 2003, the 2.5% fixed interest rate on the Company’s $632.5
million Convertible Subordinated Notes (the “Notes”) to a variable interest
rate based on the 3-month London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) less 65
basis points.  The Swap qualifies as a
fair-value hedge under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities” as amended. 
The gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the Swap is expected
to be highly effective at offsetting the gain or loss from changes in the fair
value of the Notes attributable to changes in interest rates.  The Company does not use derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The
information in this section should be read in conjunction with the
information related to changes in the exchange rates of foreign currency in “Item
7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – Certain Factors.”  Changes
in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect the
Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

The
functional currency for substantially all of the Company’s operations is the
U.S. dollar.  The Company held aggregate
cash and other assets in foreign currency valued at U.S. $344.4 million as of September 1,
2005, and U.S. $118.9 million as of September 2, 2004 (including cash and
equivalents denominated in yen valued at U.S. $214.9 million as of September 1,
2005, and U.S. $10.9 million as of September 2, 2004 and deferred income
tax assets denominated in yen valued at U.S. $50.5 million as of September 1,
2005, and U.S. $52.4 million as of September 2, 2004).  The Company also held aggregate foreign
currency liabilities valued at U.S. $575.3 million as of September 1,
2005, and U.S. $403.6 million as of September 2, 2004


(including debt
denominated in yen valued at U.S. $298.9 million as of September 1, 2005,
and U.S. $113.1 million as of September 2, 2004).  Foreign currency receivables and payables as
of September 1, 2005, were comprised primarily of yen, euros, Singapore
dollars and British pounds.

The Company estimates that,
based on its assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S.
dollar as of September 1, 2005, a 1% change in the exchange rate versus
the U.S. dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of
approximately $1 million for the yen and $1 million for the euro.

In
the third quarter of 2005, the Company entered into two yen-denominated loans
aggregating 23.5 billion yen ($221.4 million) payable in semi-annual
installments through 2010.  The first, a
syndicated loan for 13.5 billion yen, bears interest at the 6-month Tokyo
Interbank Offered Rate (“TIBOR”) plus 1.25% (1.35% as of closing).  The second, a 10.0 billion yen loan has a
fixed rate of 0.95%.  The Company
invested the proceeds of the loans in yen-denominated instruments.

Significant
Accounting Policies

Basis of presentation:

Micron Technology, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to collectively as the “Company”)
manufacture and market DRAM, NAND Flash memory, CMOS image sensors and other
semiconductor components.  The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated.

The
Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday
closest to August 31.  The Company’s
fiscal 2005 and 2003 contained 52 weeks. 
The Company’s fiscal 2004 contained 53 weeks.  All period references are to the Company’s
fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated.

Reclassifications:

Certain
reclassifications have been made, none of which affected results of operations,
to present the financial statements on a consistent basis.

Use of estimates:

The preparation of financial statements and
related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related
disclosures.  Estimates and judgments are
based on historical experience, forecasted future events and various other
assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances.  Estimates and judgments
may differ under different assumptions or conditions.  The Company evaluates its estimates and
judgments on an ongoing basis.  Actual
results could differ from estimates.

Certain concentrations:

Approximately 70% of the Company’s net sales for 2005 were
to the computing market, including desktop PCs, notebooks, servers and
workstations.  Sales to one customer were
12.2%, 14.1 % and 14.9% of the Company’s net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.  Sales to another customer
were 11.3%, 13.2% and 13.2% of the Company’s net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.  Sales of DRAM products
constituted 87% of the Company's net sales for 2005 and no other product group
individually constituted greater than 10% of the Company's net sales.  Certain components used by the Company in
manufacturing semiconductor products are available from a limited number of
suppliers.

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of cash, investment securities and trade
receivables.  The Company invests through
high-credit-quality financial institutions and, by policy, limits the
concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single
obligor.  A concentration of credit risk
may exist with respect to trade receivables as a substantial portion of the
Company’s customers are affiliated with the computing industry.  The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of customers worldwide and generally does not require collateral
from its customers.  Historically, the
Company has not experienced significant losses on receivables.

Product warranty:

The Company generally provides a limited
warranty that its products are in compliance with Company specifications
existing at the time of delivery.  Under the Company’s general terms and
conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated
warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items
or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. 
Under certain circumstances, the Company may provide more extensive limited
warranty coverage and general legal principles may impose upon the Company more
extensive liability than that provided under the Company’s general terms and conditions.  The Company’s warranty obligations are not
material.

Revenue recognition:

The
Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is reasonably assured. 
Because of frequent changes in market prices for the Company’s products,
sales made under agreements allowing pricing protection or rights of return
(other than for product warranty) are deferred until customers have sold the
product.

Research and development:

Costs related to the conceptual formulation
and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development
as incurred.  Determining when product
development is complete requires judgment by the Company.  The Company deems development of a product
complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for
performance and reliability.  Subsequent
to product qualification, product costs are valued in inventory.


Segment information:

The Company has determined, based on the
nature of its operations and products offered to customers, that its only
reportable segment is Semiconductor Operations. 
The Semiconductor Operations segment’s primary product is semiconductor
memory.

Stock-based compensation:

Through 2005, the Company’s employee stock
plans were accounted for using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” 
The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option valuation model to value
stock options for pro forma presentation of income and per share data as if the
fair value based method in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)

No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” had been used to account for stock-based compensation.  The following presents pro forma income
(loss) and per share data as if a fair value based method had been used to
account for stock-based compensation:

Stock-based
compensation expense in the above presentation does not reflect any significant
income taxes, which is consistent with the Company’s treatment of income or
loss from its U.S. operations.  (See “Income
Taxes” note.)

On
April 4, 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of approximately 44.6
million unvested stock options outstanding under the Company’s stock plans with
exercise prices per share of $12.00 or higher. 
The options had a range of exercise prices of $12.00 to $44.90 and a
weighted average exercise price of $14.08. 
The closing price of the Company’s common stock on April 1, 2005,
the last trading day before the acceleration, was $10.26.  The acceleration was effective as of April 4,
2005.  The purpose of the accelerated
vesting was to enable the Company to avoid recognizing compensation expense
associated with these options upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).  The aggregate pre-tax expense associated with
the accelerated options that would have been reflected in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements in future fiscal years was approximately $100
million, which is included in pro forma stock-based employee compensation
expense for 2005.

Functional currency:

The U.S. dollar is the Company’s functional
currency for substantially all of its operations.

Earnings per share:

Basic
earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common
shares and stock rights outstanding. 
Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effects of stock options,
warrants and convertible notes. 
Potential common shares that would increase earnings per share amounts
or decrease loss per share amounts are antidilutive and are, therefore,
excluded from earnings per share calculations. 
Basic and diluted earnings per share computations reflect the effect of
accretion of, and fair value adjustment to, redeemable common stock.

Financial instruments:

Cash equivalents include highly liquid
short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less,
readily convertible to known amounts of cash. 
Investments with original maturities greater than three months and
remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short-term
investments.  Investments with remaining
maturities greater than one year are classified as other noncurrent
assets.  Securities classified as
available-for-sale are


stated at market
value.  The carrying value of investment
securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.

The
amounts reported as cash and equivalents, short-term investments, receivables,
other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and equipment purchase
contracts approximate their fair values. 
The estimated fair value of the Company’s debt was $1.2 billion as of September 1,
2005 and September 2, 2004.  The
fair value estimates presented herein were based on market interest rates and
other market information available to management as of each balance sheet date
presented.  The use of different market
assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the
estimated fair value amounts.  The
approximate fair values do not take into consideration expenses that could be
incurred in an actual settlement.

Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of
average cost or market value.  Cost
includes labor, material and overhead costs, including product and process
technology costs.  Determining market
value of inventories involves numerous judgments, including projecting average
selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete
products in work in process inventories. 
As a result of these analyses, when market values are below the Company’s
costs, the Company records a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when
the inventory is actually sold.

Product and process technology:

Costs incurred to acquire product and process
technology or to patent technology developed by the Company are capitalized and
amortized on a straight-line basis over periods currently ranging up to 10
years.  The Company capitalizes a portion
of costs incurred based on its analysis of historical and projected patents
issued as a percent of patents filed. 
Capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the
shorter of (i) the estimated useful life of the technology, (ii) the
patent term or (iii) the term of the technology agreement.  Fully-amortized costs are removed from
product and process technology and accumulated amortization.

Property, plant and equipment:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at
cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of 5 to 30 years for buildings, 2 to 20 years for equipment and 2 to 5
years for software.  Assets held for sale
are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value and are included in
other noncurrent assets.  When property
or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the net book value of the
asset is removed from the Company’s accounts and any net gain or loss is
included in the Company’s results of operations.

The
Company capitalizes interest on borrowings during the active construction
period of major capital projects. 
Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and
is amortized over the useful lives of the assets.  The Company capitalized interest costs of
$1.8 million, $1.1 million and $3.4 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, in connection with various capital projects.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards:

In May 2005, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and
Error Corrections.”  SFAS No. 154
replaces APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes”, and SFAS No. 3, “Reporting
Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements,” and changes the
requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting
principle.  The Company is required to
adopt SFAS No. 154 for accounting changes and error corrections that occur
after the beginning of 2007.  The Company’s
results of operations and financial condition will only be impacted following
the adoption of SFAS No. 154 if it implements changes in accounting
principle that are addressed by the standard or corrects accounting errors in
future periods.

In
March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations,” which clarifies that an entity is
required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset
retirement obligation if the fair value can be reasonably estimated even though
uncertainty exists about the timing and (or) method of settlement.  The Company is required to adopt
Interpretation No. 47 prior to the end of 2006.  The Company is currently assessing the impact
of Interpretation No. 47 on its results of operations and financial
condition.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.”  SFAS No. 123(R) establishes standards
for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity
instruments for goods or services or incurs liabilities in exchange for goods
or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity
instruments, focusing primarily on accounting for transactions in which an
entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions.  SFAS No. 123(R) requires public entities
to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of
equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with
limited exceptions) and recognize the cost over the period during which an
employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.  In March 2005, the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued SAB 107 which expresses views of the SEC
staff regarding the application of SFAS No. 123(R).  Among other things, SAB 107 provides interpretive
guidance related to the


interaction between
SFAS No. 123(R) and certain SEC rules and regulations as well as
provides the SEC staff’s views regarding the valuation of share-based payment
arrangements for public companies.  The
Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 123(R) in the beginning of
2006.  Upon adoption, the Company will
record non-cash stock compensation expense primarily associated with future
grants of stock options, which will have an adverse effect on its results of
operations.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of
Nonmonetary Assets – An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29,” which eliminates
the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and
replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that
do not have commercial substance.  The
Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 153 for nonmonetary asset exchanges
occurring in the first quarter of 2006 and its adoption is not expected to have
a significant effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial
condition.

In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs – An
Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,” which clarifies the accounting for
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material
(spoilage).  The Company is required to
adopt SFAS No. 151 in the beginning of 2006 and its adoption is not
expected to have a significant effect on the Company’s results of operations or
financial condition.

Supplemental Balance Sheet Information

Gross
unrealized gains and losses as of the end of the periods shown above were de minimis
as were gross realized gains and losses in 2005, 2004 and 2003.  Debt securities of $995.2 million held by the
Company as of September 1, 2005, have contractual maturities within one
year.

The
Company recognized write-downs aggregating $307.0 million in 2003 to record
work in process and finished goods inventories at their estimated market
values.


During
2005, the Company capitalized $34.7 million for product and process technology
with a weighted average useful life of ten years.  During 2004, the Company capitalized $37.0
million for product and process technology with a weighted average useful life
of ten years.  As part of a restructure
plan announced in the second quarter of 2003, the Company wrote off net carrying
values of $16.1 million of product and process technology and $2.5 million of
other intangible assets associated with discontinued products, including SRAM
and TCAM products.  (See “Restructure and
Other Charges” note.)

Amortization
expense for intangible assets was $50.8 million, $50.3 million and $51.1
million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 
Annual amortization expense for intangible assets held as of September 1,
2005, is estimated to be $51.1 million for 2006, $49.2 million for 2007, $48.5
million for 2008, $37.5 million for 2009 and $29.0 million for 2010.

Depreciation
expense was $1,211.4 million, $1,166.3 million and $1,157.8 million for 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

The
Company has a manufacturing facility in Utah that is only partially
utilized.  The Utah facility had a net
book value of $683.7 million as of September 1, 2005.  A portion of the Utah facility is being used
for component test operations.  The
Company is depreciating substantially all assets at the Utah facility other
than $192.1 million included in construction in progress as of September 1,
2005.  Increased utilization of the
facility is dependent upon market conditions, including, but not limited to,
worldwide market supply of, and demand for, semiconductor products and the
Company’s operations, cash flows and alternative capacity utilization
opportunities.

As
part of a restructure plan announced in the second quarter of 2003, the Company
recorded impairment charges of $42.6 million in 2003 to writedown the carrying
value of certain assets used in the Company’s 200mm production line in
Virginia, which was shut down as part of the restructure plan.  (See “Restructure and Other Charges” note.)


In
the third quarter of 2005, the Company entered into two yen-dominated loans
aggregating 23.5 billion yen ($221.4 million), payable in semi-annual
installments through 2010.  The first, a
syndicated term loan for 13.5 billion yen bears interest at the 6-month Tokyo
Interbank Offered Rate (“TIBOR”) plus 1.25% (1.35% as of September 1,
2005) and requires the Company to maintain a deposit with the lead bank ($14.5
million as of September 1, 2005), which is included in restricted cash in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 
The second loan for 10.0 billion yen bears interest at a fixed rate of
0.95% and is collateralized by certain equipment owned by the Company.

As
of September 1, 2005, notes payable of $298.9 million denominated in
Japanese yen were at a weighted average interest rate of 1.2%.

In
2005, the Company received $161.3 million in proceeds from sales-leaseback
transactions and as a result recorded capital lease obligations aggregating
$157.3 million with a weighted average imputed interest rate of 6.3%, payable
in periodic installments through January 2009.

In
February 2003, the Company issued $632.5 million of 2.5% Convertible
Subordinated Notes due February 1, 2010 (the “Notes”).  Holders of the Notes may convert all or some
of their Notes at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or
repurchased, into the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 84.8320
shares for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes.  This conversion rate is equivalent to a
conversion price of approximately $11.79 per share.  The Company may redeem the notes at any time
after February 6, 2006, at declining premiums to par.

Certain
notes payable are collateralized by property, plant and equipment with a
carrying value of $302.3 million as of September 1, 2005.  Equipment under capital leases and
accumulated amortization thereon were $253.8 million and $73.8 million,
respectively, as of September 1, 2005, and $108.1 million and $38.0
million, respectively, as of September 2, 2004.


As
of September 1, 2005, maturities of notes payable and future minimum lease
payments under capital lease obligations were as follows:

Interest Rate Swap:

The Company entered into an interest rate swap
agreement (the “Swap”) that effectively converted, beginning August 29,
2003, the fixed interest rate on the Company’s 2.5% Convertible Subordinated
Notes (the “Notes”) to a variable interest rate based on the 3-month London
Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) less 65 basis points (average rate of 1.99%
for 2005).  The Swap qualifies as a
fair-value hedge under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended.  The gain or loss from changes in the fair
value of the Swap is expected to be highly effective at offsetting the gain or
loss from changes in the fair value of the Notes attributable to changes in
interest rates.  The Company measures the
effectiveness of the Swap using regression analysis.  The Company recognizes changes in the fair
value of the Swap and changes in the fair value of the Notes since inception of
the Swap in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Through September 1, 2005, the
cumulative difference between the change in the fair value of the Swap and the
change in the fair value of the Notes was de minimis.  As of September 1, 2005, the Company had
pledged $34.5 million as collateral for the Swap which is included in
restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  The amount of collateral fluctuates based on
the fair value of the Swap.  The Swap
will terminate if the closing price of the Company’s common stock is at or
exceeds $14.15 after February 6, 2006.

Commitments

As
of September 1, 2005, the Company had commitments of approximately $250
million for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment.  The Company leases certain facilities,
equipment and software under operating leases. 
Total rental expense on all operating leases was $23.4 million, $21.1
million and $24.6 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Minimum future rental commitments under
operating leases aggregated $60.8 million as of September 1, 2005, and are
payable as follows:  $18.1 million in
2006; $8.3 million in 2007; $5.7 million in 2008; $3.0 million in 2009; $2.5
million in 2010, $23.2 million in 2011 and thereafter.

Contingencies

As
is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time
to time, others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that the Company’s
products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property
rights.  In this regard, the Company is engaged in litigation with Rambus, Inc.
(“Rambus”) relating to certain of Rambus’ patents and certain of the Company’s
claims and defenses.  Lawsuits between Rambus and the Company are pending
in the United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy.  The
Company also is engaged in litigation with Tessera, Inc. (“Tessera”)
relating to certain of Tessera’s patents and certain of the Company’s patents
in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.  Among other
things, the above lawsuits pertain to certain of the Company’s SDRAM, DDR SDRAM,
and DDR2 SDRAM products, which account for a significant portion of net
sales.  The Company is unable to predict the outcome of assertions of
infringement made against the Company.  A court determination that the
Company’s products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual
property rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require
the Company to make material changes to its products and/or manufacturing
processes.  Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.


On
June 17, 2002, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California seeking information
regarding an investigation by the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (the “DOJ”) into possible antitrust violations in the “Dynamic Random
Access Memory” or “DRAM” industry.  The Company is cooperating fully and
actively with the DOJ in its investigation.  The Company’s cooperation is
pursuant to the terms of the DOJ’s Corporate Leniency Policy, which provides
that in exchange for the Company’s full, continuing and complete cooperation in
the pending investigation, the Company will not be subject to prosecution,
fines or other penalties from the DOJ.  Subsequent to the commencement of
the DOJ investigation, at least eighty-three (four of which have been
voluntarily dismissed) purported class action lawsuits have been filed against
the Company and other DRAM suppliers in various federal and state courts in the
United States and in Puerto Rico by direct and indirect purchasers alleging
price-fixing in violation of federal antitrust laws, violations of state unfair
competition law, and/or unjust enrichment relating to the sale and pricing of
DRAM products.  The complaints seek treble damages for the alleged damages
sustained by purported class members, in addition to restitution, costs and
attorneys’ fees, as well as an injunction against the allegedly unlawful
conduct.  Three purported class action lawsuits also have been filed in
Canada, alleging violations of the Canadian Competition Act.  The
substantive allegations in these cases are similar to those asserted in the cases
filed in the United States and Puerto Rico.  The Company is unable to
predict the outcome of these suits.  Based upon the Company’s analysis of
the claims made and the nature of the DRAM industry, the Company believes that
class treatment of these cases is not appropriate and that any purported injury
alleged by plaintiffs in the direct purchaser cases would be more appropriately
resolved on a customer-by-customer basis. 
In addition, the Attorneys General of Arkansas, California, Colorado,
Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland,
Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West
Virginia and Wisconsin have indicated that they are investigating potential
state and federal civil claims against the Company and other DRAM suppliers on
behalf of state and governmental entities that were direct or indirect
purchasers of DRAM and potentially on behalf of other indirect purchasers of DRAM.  The Company is unable to predict the outcome
of these lawsuits and investigations.  The final resolution of these
alleged violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability and
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of
operations or financial condition.

On
May 5, 2004, Rambus filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State
of California (San Francisco County) against the Company and other DRAM
suppliers.  The complaint alleges various causes of action under
California state law including conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices on
Rambus DRAM (“RDRAM”) and unfair competition.  Tessera also has asserted
certain antitrust and unfair competition claims relating to Tessera’s packaging
technology.  These complaints seek treble damages, punitive damages,
attorneys’ fees, costs, and a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants
from the conduct alleged in the complaints.  The Company is unable to
predict the outcome of these suits.  A court determination against the
Company could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.

The
Company has accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs
of adjudication or settlement of various asserted and unasserted claims
existing as of the balance sheet date.  The Company is currently a party
to other legal actions arising out of the normal course of business, none of
which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business,
results of operations or financial condition.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is a party to a variety of
agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other
party.  It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of
future payments under these types of agreements due to the conditional nature
of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in
each particular agreement.  Historically, payments made by the Company
under these types of agreements have not had a material effect on the Company’s
business, results of operations or financial condition.

Redeemable Common Stock

In
connection with the Company’s acquisition on April 22, 2002, of
substantially all of the assets of Toshiba Corporation’s (“Toshiba”) DRAM
business as conducted by Dominion Semiconductor L.L.C., the Company issued
Toshiba 1.5 million shares of common stock and granted Toshiba an option to
require the Company to repurchase the shares for $67.5 million in cash.  During the first quarter of 2004, Toshiba
exercised its option and the Company redeemed the 1.5 million shares.


Shareholders’ Equity

Stock Rights:

On September 24, 2003, the Company
received $450.0 million, which is included in additional capital in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet, from Intel Corporation (“Intel”) in
exchange for the issuance of stock rights exchangeable into approximately 33.9
million shares of the Company’s common stock. 
In conjunction with the issuance of the stock rights, the Company agreed
to achieve operational objectives through May 2005, including certain
levels of DDR2 production and 300mm wafer processing capacity, or be subject to
monetary penalties.  The Company has
achieved the DDR2 production and 300mm wafer processing milestones and,
consequently, does not expect to make any payments to Intel under this
agreement.  The shares issuable pursuant
to the stock rights are included in weighted average common shares outstanding
in the computations of earnings per share.

Common Stock Warrants:

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the
Company received $480.2 million from the issuance of warrants to purchase 29.1
million shares of the Company’s common stock. 
The warrants entitle the holders to exercise their warrants and purchase
shares of Common Stock for $56.00 per share (the “Exercise Price”) at any time
through May 15, 2008 (the “Expiration Date”).  Warrants exercised prior to the Expiration
Date will be settled on a “net share” basis, wherein investors receive common
stock equal to the difference between $56.00 and the average closing sale price
for the common shares over the 30 trading days immediately preceding the
Exercise Date.  At expiration, the
Company may elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis or for cash,
provided certain conditions are satisfied. 
As of September 1, 2005, there have been no exercises of warrants
and all warrants issued remain outstanding.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
(Loss):

Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, consists of the following as of the
end of the periods shown below:

Employee and Director Stock Plans

Stock Options:

As of September 1, 2005, the Company had
an aggregate of 159.8 million shares of its common stock reserved for issuance
under its various stock plans, of which 119.1 million shares are subject to
outstanding options and 40.7 million shares are available for future
grants.  Options are subject to terms and
conditions as determined by the Company’s Board of Directors.

Stock
options granted after June 16, 1999, are generally exercisable in
increments of 25% during each year of employment beginning one year from the
date of grant.  Stock options granted
prior to June 16, 1999, are generally exercisable in increments of 20%
during each year of employment beginning one year from the date of grant.  Stock options issued prior to January 19,
1998, expire six years from the date of grant; stock options issued from January 19,
1998 to September 22, 2004, expire ten years from the date of grant; stock
options granted after September 22, 2004, expire six years from the date
of grant.

Option
activity under the Company’s stock option plans is summarized as follows:


The
following table summarizes information about options outstanding as of September 1,
2005:

Restricted Stock Awards:

As of September 1, 2005, there were
305,000 shares of restricted stock awards outstanding.  The fair value for the restricted shares, all
of which were granted during 2005, was $12.17 at grant date.  The restrictions lapse in one-third
increments during each year of employment after the grant date.

Stock Purchase Plan:

The Company’s 1989 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (“ESPP”) allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company’s
common stock through payroll deductions. 
Prior to July 1, 2005, shares could be purchased at 85% of the
lower of the beginning or ending closing stock prices of each quarterly
offering period.  After July 1,
2005, shares can be purchased at 95% of the ending closing stock price of each
offering quarterly period.  Shares can be
resold when purchased.  Purchases are
limited to 20% of an employee’s eligible compensation.  As of September 1, 2005, 26.3 million
shares of the Company’s common stock had been issued under the ESPP and 3.2
million shares were available for future issuance under the plan.

Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan:

As of September 1, 2005, 39,957 shares
of the Company’s common stock had been issued under the 1998 Non-Employee
Director Stock Incentive Plan (“DSIP Plan”) and 460,043 shares were reserved
for future issuance under the plan. 
Shares are issued under the DSIP plan as compensation to non-employee
directors of the Company.

Stock-Based Compensation:

Assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option
valuation model to estimate the value of the Company’s options included in pro
forma amounts are presented below:

The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable and requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the
expected stock price volatility and estimated option life.  For purposes of this valuation model, no
dividends have been assumed.


Employee Savings Plan

The
Company has a 401(k) retirement plan (“RAM Plan”) under which U.S. employees
may contribute up to 45% of their eligible pay (subject to IRS annual
contribution limits) to various savings alternatives, none of which include
direct investment in the Company’s common stock.  Under the plan, the Company matches in cash
eligible contributions from employees up to 3% of the employee’s annual
eligible earnings, or $1,500, whichever is greater.  The Company may provide additional
contributions based on its financial performance.  Contribution expense for the Company’s RAM
Plan was $17.6 million, $13.7 million and $12.5 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Restructure and Other Charges

In
2003, the Company announced a series of cost-reduction initiatives.  The restructure plan included the shutdown of
the Company’s 200mm production line in Virginia; the discontinuance of certain
memory products, including SRAM and TCAM; and an approximate 10% reduction in
the Company’s worldwide workforce.  In
2003, the Company recorded restructure charges of $109.2 million and other
restructure-related charges of $7.1 million, including $50.7 million of
equipment write-downs, $26.3 million of severance and other termination
benefits and $18.6 million of intangible asset write downs.  The Company recorded net credits to
restructure of $1.4 million and $22.5 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively,
primarily from sales of equipment associated with the Company’s 200mm production
line in Virginia.  The Company
substantially completed the restructure plan and paid essentially all costs
associated with the restructure plan in 2004 and 2003.

Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net

Other
operating income for 2005 includes net gains on write-downs and disposals of
semiconductor equipment of $12.7 million and $12.0 million in receipts from the
U.S. government in connection with anti-dumping tariffs.  Other operating expense for 2004 includes
losses of $17.2 million from changes in currency exchange rates.  Other operating income for 2004 includes $7.2
million from the Commonwealth of Virginia for meeting investment commitments at
the Virginia wafer fabrication facility and net gains of $3.9 million on
write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment.  Other operating expense for 2003 includes net
losses on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment of $41.5 million
and losses of $10.7 million from changes in currency exchange rates.  Other operating expense for 2003 is net of
$14.4 million in receipts from the U.S. government in connection with
anti-dumping tariffs.


Income Taxes

Income
(loss) before taxes and the income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following:

A
reconciliation between income tax (provision) computed using the U.S. federal
statutory rate and the Company’s income tax (provision) is as follows:

State
taxes reflect investment tax credits of $13.7 million, $9.1 million and $16.8
million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.


Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax
purposes.  The Company’s deferred tax
assets and liabilities consist of the following as of the end of the periods
shown below:

The
Company currently records a valuation allowance against substantially all of
its U.S. net deferred tax assets.  As of September 1,
2005, the Company had aggregate U.S. tax net operating loss carryforwards of
$2.5 billion and unused U.S. tax credit carryforwards of $140.7 million.  The Company also has unused state tax net
operating loss carryforwards of $1.7 billion and unused state tax credits of
$137.5 million.  Substantially all of the
net operating loss carryforwards expire in 2022 to 2025 and substantially all
of the tax credit carryforwards expire in 2013 to 2025.

The
changes in valuation allowance of $24.6 million and $11.2 million in 2005 and
2004, respectively, are primarily due to uncertainties of realizing certain
U.S. net operating losses and certain tax credit carryforwards.  The change in the valuation allowance in 2005
and 2004 includes $1.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively, for stock plan
deductions, which will be credited to additional capital if realized.

Provision
has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S.
subsidiaries to the extent that dividend payments from such companies are
expected to result in additional tax liability. 
Remaining undistributed earnings of $657.2 million have been
indefinitely reinvested; therefore, no provision has been made for taxes due
upon remittance of these earnings.  Determination
of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted
earnings is not practicable.


Earnings (Loss) Per Share

On
September 24, 2003, the Company issued stock rights to Intel which are
exchangeable into approximately 33.9 million shares of the Company’s common
stock.  The shares issuable pursuant to
the stock rights are considered outstanding common shares in the computations
of basic and diluted earnings per share. 
(See “Shareholders’ Equity – Stock Rights” note.)

Listed
below are the potential common shares, as of the end of the periods shown
below, that could dilute basic earnings per share in the future that were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because to do so
would have been antidilutive:

Joint Venture

Since
1998, the Company has participated in TECH Semiconductor Singapore Pte. Ltd. (“TECH”),
a semiconductor memory manufacturing joint venture in Singapore among the
Company, the Singapore Economic Development Board, Canon Inc. and
Hewlett-Packard Company.  As of September 1,
2005, the Company had a 39.12% ownership interest in TECH.  Significant financing, investment and
operating decisions for TECH typically require approval from TECH’s Board of
Directors.  The shareholders’ agreement
for the TECH joint venture expires in 2011. 
Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities,” TECH does not qualify for consolidation.

TECH’s
semiconductor manufacturing facilities use the Company’s product and process
technology.  Subject to specific terms
and conditions, the Company has agreed to purchase all of the products
manufactured by TECH.  The Company
generally purchases semiconductor memory products from TECH at prices
determined quarterly, based on a discount from average selling prices realized
by the Company for the preceding quarter. 
The Company performs assembly and test services on product manufactured
by TECH.  The Company also provides
certain technology, engineering and training to support TECH.  All of these transactions with TECH are
recognized as part of the net cost of products purchased from TECH.  The net cost of products purchased from TECH
amounted to $651.9 million, $453.8 million and $318.2 million for 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.  Amortization
expense resulting from the TECH supply arrangement, included in the cost of
products purchased from TECH, was $11.7 million, $11.8 million and $9.6 million
for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 
Receivables from TECH were $24.0 million and payables to TECH were $51.4
million as of September 1, 2005. 
Receivables from TECH were $23.8 million and payables to TECH were $56.8
million as of


September 2,
2004.  TECH supplied approximately 25% of
the total megabits of memory produced by the Company in 2005.  As of September 1, 2005, the Company had
intangible assets with a net book value of $50.3 million relating to the supply
arrangement to purchase product from TECH.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of
Micron Technology, Inc.

We
have completed an integrated audit of Micron Technology, Inc.’s 2005
consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial
reporting as of September 1, 2005 and audits of its 2004 and 2003
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index on page 27
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Micron
Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries at September 1, 2005 and 2004,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended September 1, 2005 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the index appearing on page 27 presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read
in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.  These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based
on our audits.  We conducted our audits
of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit of
financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also,
in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 1,
2005 based on criteria established in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. 
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 1,
2005, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.  The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting.  Our responsibility is to express
opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit of internal control
over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects.  An audit of internal control over financial
reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

An
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of
the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the
period covered by this report.  Based
upon that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures were effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and
forms.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The
Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting for the Company.  Internal control over financial reporting is
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.  The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the Company; ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the Company; and iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s
financial statements.

Internal
control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance regarding
the prevention or detection of misstatements because of inherent
limitations.  These inherent limitations
are known by management and considered in the design of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting which reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.

Management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this evaluation, management
concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of September 1, 2005. 
Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of September 1, 2005, has been audited
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report, which is included in part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
