Overview

Micron Technology, Inc., including its consolidated subsidiaries, is a global leader in advanced semiconductor systems.  Our broad portfolio of high-performance memory technologies, including DRAM, NAND Flash, and NOR Flash, is the basis for solid-state drives, modules, multi-chip packages, and other system solutions.  Our memory solutions enable the world's most innovative computing, consumer, enterprise storage, networking, mobile, embedded, and automotive applications.  We market our products through our internal sales force, independent sales representatives, and distributors primarily to OEMs and retailers located around the world.  Our success is largely dependent on the market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor products, efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, successful ongoing development of advanced product and process technologies, and generating a return on R&D investments.

We obtain products for sale to our customers from our wholly-owned manufacturing facilities and our joint ventures.  In recent years, we have increased our manufacturing scale and product diversity through strategic acquisitions and various partnering arrangements.

We make significant investments to develop the proprietary product and process technologies that are implemented in our worldwide manufacturing facilities and through our joint ventures.  These investments enable our production of semiconductor products with increasing functionality and performance at lower costs.  We generally reduce the manufacturing cost of each generation of product through advancements in product and process technologies, such as our leading-edge line-width process technology.  We continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, including higher data transfer rates, reduced package size, lower power consumption, improved read/write reliability, and increased memory density.  To leverage our significant investments in R&D, we have formed, and may continue to form, strategic joint ventures that allow us to share the costs of developing memory product and process technologies with joint venture partners.  In addition, from time to time, we also sell and/or license technology to other parties.  We continue to pursue additional opportunities to monetize our investment in intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements.


On July 31, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Elpida, now known as MMJ, and a controlling interest in Rexchip, now known as MMT (together, the "MMJ Acquisition").  The MMJ Acquisition included a 300mm DRAM wafer fabrication facility located in Hiroshima, Japan, a 300mm DRAM wafer fabrication facility in Taichung City, Taiwan, and an assembly and test facility located in Akita, Japan.  These wafer fabrication facilities together represented approximately 30% of our total wafer capacity for 2015.  The operations from the MMJ Acquisition, which are included primarily in our MBU and CNBU segments, include the manufacture of mobile DRAM targeted to mobile phones and tablets and computing DRAM targeted to desktop PCs, servers, notebooks, and workstations.  (See "Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Micron Memory Japan, Inc.")

Products

DRAM

DRAM products are high-density, low-cost-per-bit, random access memory devices that provide high-speed data storage and retrieval with a variety of performance, pricing, and other characteristics.  Sales of DRAM products were 64%, 68%, and 48% of our total net sales in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  DRAM products are sold by CNBU, MBU, and EBU.

DDR3 DRAM is a standardized, high-density, high-volume, DRAM product, which offers high speed and high bandwidth at a relatively low cost.  DDR3 products are primarily targeted at computers, servers, networking devices, communications equipment, consumer electronics, automotive, and industrial applications.  In 2015, we offered DDR3 products in 1Gb, 2Gb, 4Gb, and 8Gb densities.  We also offered next generation DDR4 DRAM products in 4Gb and 8Gb densities in 2015 and we expect sales of these products to increase significantly in 2016 as they replace DDR3 DRAM products in many applications.  Sales of DDR3 and DDR4 DRAM products were 38%, 40%, and 31% of our total net sales in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

LPDRAM products offer lower power consumption relative to other DRAM products and are used primarily in mobile phones, tablets, embedded applications, ultra-thin laptop computers, and other mobile consumer devices that require low power consumption.  We offer DDR4, DDR3, DDR2, and DDR versions of LPDRAM.  Sales of LPDRAM products were 18%, 20%, and 6% of our total net sales in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

We also offer other DRAM products targeted to specialty markets including DDR2 DRAM, DDR DRAM, GDDR5 DRAM, SDRAM, RLDRAM, and PSRAM.  These products are used primarily in networking devices, servers, consumer electronics, communications equipment, computer peripherals, automotive and industrial applications, and computer memory upgrades.  We offer HMC products, which are semiconductor memory devices where vertical stacks of DRAM die that are connected using through-silicon-via interconnects are placed above a small, high-speed logic layer.  HMC enables ultra-high system performance and is targeted primarily at networking and high performance computing applications.


Non-Volatile Memory

Non-Volatile Memory includes NAND Flash and 3D XPoint™ memory.  Through 2015, substantially all of our Non-Volatile Memory sales were from NAND Flash products.  NAND Flash products are electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content when power is turned off.  NAND Flash sales were 33%, 27%, and 40% of our total net sales in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  NAND Flash is ideal for mass-storage devices due to its fast erase and write times, high density, and low cost per bit relative to other solid-state memories.  Embedded NAND Flash-based storage devices are utilized in mobile phones, SSDs, tablets, computers, industrial and automotive applications, networking, and other personal and consumer applications.  Removable storage devices, such as USB and Flash memory cards, are used with applications such as PCs, digital still cameras, and mobile phones.  The market for NAND Flash products has grown rapidly and we expect it to continue to grow due to increased demand for these and other embedded and removable storage devices.  NAND Flash products are sold by SBU, EBU, MBU, and CNBU.

Our NAND Flash products feature a small cell structure that enables higher densities for demanding applications.  We offer high-speed SLC, MLC, and TLC NAND Flash products that are compatible with advanced interfaces.  MLC and TLC products have two and three times, respectively, the bit density of SLC products.  In 2015, we offered SLC NAND Flash products in 1Gb to 64Gb densities; 2-bit-per-cell MLC NAND Flash products in 8Gb to 128Gb densities; and 3-bit-per-cell TLC NAND Flash in 128Gb density.  In 2015, we began sampling products featuring our new 3D NAND Flash technology, which stacks layers of data storage cells vertically to create storage devices with three times higher capacity than competing NAND Flash  technologies.  This enables more storage in a smaller space, bringing significant cost savings, low power usage and high performance to a range of mobile consumer devices as well as the most demanding enterprise deployments.  We expect to be in production of a 256Gb MLC version and 384Gb TLC version of 3D NAND Flash products by the end of calendar year 2015.

We offer client and enterprise SSDs which feature higher performance, reduced-power consumption, and enhanced reliability as compared to typical hard disk drives.  Our client SSDs are targeted at notebooks, desktops, workstations, and other consumer applications.  Using our NAND Flash process technology and a leading-edge SATA 6 Gb per second interface, our SSDs deliver read and write speeds that help improve boot and application load times and deliver higher performance than hard disk drives.  Our client SSDs feature industry-leading encryption for corporate users and are offered in a 2.5-inch, M.2., and mSATA modules, with densities up to 1 terabyte.  Our enterprise SSDs are targeted at server and storage applications and incorporate our Extended Performance and Enhanced Reliability Technology ("XPERT") architecture, which closely incorporates the storage and controller through highly optimized firmware algorithms and hardware enhancements.  The end result is a set of market-focused enterprise features that deliver ultra-low latencies, improved data transfer time, power-loss protection, and cost-effectiveness, along with higher capacities and power efficiency.  We offer enterprise SSDs with both PCIe and SATA interfaces and capacities up to 1.4 terabytes.  We expect that demand for both client and enterprise SSDs will continue to increase significantly over the next several years.

We also offer managed MCP products, which incorporate our NAND Flash.  These managed NAND Flash products include e-MMC, e-MCP, and embedded USB.  Our e-MMC products combine NAND Flash with a logic controller that performs media management and Error Code Correction ("ECC"), which provides reduced ECC complexity, better system performance, improved reliability, easy integration, and lower overall system costs.  Our e-MCP products combine e-MMC with LPDRAM on the same substrate, which improves overall functionality and performance while simplifying system design.

Through our Lexar

®

brand, we sell high-performance digital media products and other flash-based storage products through retail and OEM channels.  Our digital media products include a variety of flash memory cards and JumpDrive

®

products with a range of speeds, capacities, and value-added features.  We offer flash memory cards in a variety of speeds and capacities and in all major media formats, including CompactFlash

®

, Memory Stick

®

, and Secure Digital ("SD") formats.  CompactFlash and Memory Stick products sold by us incorporate our patented controller technology.  Other products, including SD memory cards and some JumpDrive products, incorporate third party controllers.  We also manufacture products that are sold under other brand names and resell flash memory products that are purchased from other NAND Flash suppliers.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we introduced 3D XPoint technology, a new category of non-volatile memory.  3D XPoint memory's innovative, transistor-less, cross point architecture creates a three-dimensional checkerboard where memory cells sit at the intersection of word lines and bit lines, allowing the cells to be addressed individually.  As a result, data can be written and read in small sizes, leading to fast and efficient read/write processes.   We plan to produce commercial volumes of 3D XPoint memory products in 2016.


Other

Other products included primarily NOR Flash, which are electrically re-writeable, semiconductor memory devices that offer fast read times which are used in wireless and embedded applications.

Partnering Arrangements

The following is a summary of our partnering arrangements as of

September 3, 2015

:

(1)

IMFT:

We partner with Intel for the design, development, and manufacture of NAND Flash and 3D XPoint memory products.  In connection therewith, we formed the IMFT joint venture with Intel to manufacture NAND Flash and 3D XPoint memory products for the exclusive use of the members.  The members share the output of IMFT generally in proportion to their investment.  We sell a portion of our products to Intel through IMFT at long-term negotiated prices approximating cost.  We generally share with Intel the costs of product design and process development activities for NAND Flash memory and 3D XPoint memory.  The IMFT joint venture agreement extends through 2024 and includes certain buy-sell rights.  Commencing in January 2015, Intel can put to us, and commencing in January 2018, we can call from Intel, Intel's interest in IMFT, in either case, for an amount equal to the noncontrolling interest balance attributable to Intel at that time.  If Intel elects to sell to us, we can elect to set the closing date of the transaction to be any time within two years following such election by Intel and can elect to receive financing of the purchase price from Intel for one to two years from the closing date.  (See "Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Equity – Noncontrolling Interests in Subsidiaries – IMFT.")

(2)

MP Mask:

We produce photomasks for leading-edge and advanced next-generation semiconductors through MP Mask, a joint venture with Photronics.  On March 24, 2015, we notified Photronics of our election to terminate MP Mask effective in May 2016.  Upon termination, we have the right to acquire Photronics' interest in MP Mask for an amount equal to the noncontrolling interest balance.  Since its inception, we and Photronics have each owned approximately 50% of MP Mask.  We purchase a substantial majority of the photomasks produced by MP Mask pursuant to a supply arrangement.  (See "Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Equity – Noncontrolling Interests in Subsidiaries – MP Mask.")

(3)

Inotera:

We partner with Nanya for the manufacture of DRAM products by Inotera, a Taiwan DRAM memory company.  Since January 2013, we have purchased all of Inotera's DRAM output at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement.  In the second quarter of 2015, we executed a supply agreement, to be effective beginning on January 1, 2016 (the "2016 Supply Agreement"), which will replace the current agreement.  Under the 2016 Supply Agreement, the price for DRAM products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between Inotera and us.  The 2016 Supply Agreement has an initial two-year term, followed by a three-year wind-down period, and contemplates negotiations in late 2016 with respect to a two-year extension, and annual negotiations thereafter with respect to successive one-year extensions.  Upon termination of the initial two-year term of the 2016 Supply Agreement, or any extensions, we would purchase DRAM from Inotera during the wind-down period.  Our share of Inotera's capacity would decline over the wind-down period.  (See "Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Equity Method Investments – Inotera.")

(4)

Tera Probe:

We have an approximate 40% ownership interest in Tera Probe, an entity that provides semiconductor wafer testing and probe services to us and others.


Manufacturing

Our manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan.  Our Inotera joint venture has a wafer fabrication facility in Taiwan.  Nearly all of our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment.  A significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment.  DRAM, NAND Flash, and NOR Flash products share a number of common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines.  In 2015, we began construction of a significant expansion of our wafer fabrication facilities in Singapore for production of NAND Flash memory.

Our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex, involving a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly, and test.  Efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities.  The primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps, and number of good die produced on each wafer.  Other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size, cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type, and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment.  We continuously enhance our production processes, reducing die sizes, and transitioning to higher density products.  In 2015, the majority of our DRAM production was manufactured on our 25nm line-width process technologies.  We expect that by the second half of 2016 the majority of our DRAM production will be manufactured on our 20nm line-width process technology.  In 2015, a majority of our NAND Flash production was manufactured on our 20nm and 16nm line-width process technology.  We began production of 3D NAND Flash products in 2015 and expect that in 2016 the majority of our NAND Flash production will be manufactured using 16nm line-width process technology or 3D NAND technology.

Wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled, clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and quality-limiting contaminants.  Despite stringent manufacturing controls, individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may need to be scrapped due to equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects, and dust particles.  Success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of high-quality circuits.  In this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening, and testing processes.  We are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality.

We test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, perform high temperature burn-in on finished products, and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow.  In addition, we use our proprietary AMBYX™ line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burn-in process, capturing quality and reliability data, and reducing testing time and cost.

We sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged (i.e. "bare die") forms.  Our packaged products include memory modules, SSDs, MCPs, managed NAND, memory cards, USB devices, and HMCs.  We assemble many products in-house and, in some cases, outsource assembly services where we can reduce costs and minimize our capital investment.  We contract with independent foundries and assembly and testing companies to manufacture NAND Flash media products such as memory cards and USB devices.

In recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products, which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing operations.  Although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products, the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume parts, and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines.


Availability of Raw Materials

Our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards.  We generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials; however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards.  In some cases, materials are provided by a single supplier.  Various factors could reduce the availability and increase the cost of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, photoresist, lead frames, and molding compound.  Shortages may occur from time to time in the future.  We and/or our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials.  In addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials.  Lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past.  If our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

brand names and private labels.  We market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world.  We sell Lexar-branded NAND Flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our Crucial-branded products through a web-based customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners.  Our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors.  Independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis.  We make shipments against these orders directly to the customer.  Distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors' products.  We maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products.  Many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products, which may take several months.

Backlog

Because of volatile industry conditions, customers are reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts.  Accordingly, new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly.  We typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment.  For these reasons, we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period.

Product Warranty

Because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications, contain defects, or are otherwise incompatible with end uses.  In accordance with industry practice, we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery.  Under our general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items.  Under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditions.


Competition

We face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including Intel; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SanDisk Corporation; SK Hynix Inc.; and Toshiba Corporation.  Some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete, invest in technology, and capitalize on growth opportunities.  Our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size, and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significantly increased worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices.  Many of our high-volume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors.  For these high-volume memory products, the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including:  operating speed, power consumption, reliability, compatibility, size, and form factors.  For our other memory products, the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence over pricing.

Research and Development

Our process technology R&D efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller line-width process technologies, as well as new, fundamentally different memory structures, materials, and packages, which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products.  Additional process technology R&D efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures, the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise, and the development of new manufacturing materials.  Product design and development efforts include our high density DDR3 and DDR4 DRAM and LPDRAM products as well as high density and mobile NAND Flash memory (including 3D NAND and MLC and TLC technologies), 3D XPoint memory, NOR Flash memory, specialty memory, SSDs

,

HMCs, and other memory technologies and systems.

Our R&D expenses were

$1.54 billion

, $1.37 billion, and $931 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  We generally share with Intel the costs of product design and process development activities for NAND Flash memory and 3D XPoint memory.  Our R&D expenses reflect net reductions of $231 million, $162 million, and $176 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, as a result of reimbursements under our Intel and other cost-sharing arrangements.

To compete in the semiconductor memory industry, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes.  We believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions.  Our process, design, and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world, with our largest R&D center located in Boise, Idaho, and other significant R&D centers in Japan, China, and other sites in the U.S.  In addition, we develop photolithography mask technology at our MP Mask joint venture facility in Boise.

R&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs.  Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing.  We deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability.  R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification.

In recent years, we have been recognized as a leader in per capita and quality of patents issued.  As of

September 3, 2015

, we owned approximately 16,800 U.S. patents and 4,200 foreign patents.  In addition, we have thousands of U.S. and foreign patent applications pending.  Our patents have various terms expiring through 2034.

We have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have from time to time licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties.  Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments.  We may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and partnering arrangements.  We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms.

Employees

As of

September 3, 2015

, we had approximately 31,800 employees.

Environmental Compliance

Government regulations impose various environmental controls on raw materials and discharges, emissions, and solid wastes from our manufacturing processes.  In 2015, our wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of ISO 14001 certification.  To continue certification, we must meet annual requirements in environmental policy, compliance, planning, management, structure and responsibility, training, communication, document control, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, record keeping, and management review.  While we have not experienced any material adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations, changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures, modification of our operations, or other compliance actions.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us.

We have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business.

If average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  We have experienced significant decreases in our average selling prices per gigabit in previous years as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such decreases in the future.  In some prior periods, average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future.

We may be unable to maintain or improve gross margins.

Our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs, including, but not limited to, process line-width, architecture, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps, and yield.  In future periods, we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins.  Factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include, but are not limited to, strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix, the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, difficulty in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies, technological barriers, and changes in process technologies or products that may require relatively larger die sizes.  Per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products.

The semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive.

We face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including Intel; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SanDisk Corporation; SK Hynix Inc.; and Toshiba Corporation.  Some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete.  Consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage.  In addition, some governments, such as China, have provided, and may continue to provide, significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants.  Our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size, and minimize mask levels in their product designs.  Transitions to smaller line-width process technologies and product and process improvements have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory.  Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production.  Our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply.  In recent periods, we and some of our competitors have begun construction on or announced plans to build new fabrication facilities.  Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.


Debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition.

In recent periods, our debt levels have increased due to the capital intensive nature of our business, business acquisitions, and restructuring of our capital structure.  As of

September 3, 2015

, we had debt with a carrying value of

$7.34 billion

.  In addition, the conversion value in excess of principal amount for our convertible notes outstanding as of

September 3, 2015

was

$553 million

.  In 2015, we paid $1.43 billion to repurchase and settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with a principal amount of $489 million.  In 2014, we paid $2.30 billion to repurchase and settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with a principal amount of $1.09 billion.  As of

September 3, 2015

, we had (1) revolving credit facilities available that provide for up to

$842 million

of additional financing and (2) a term loan agreement available to obtain financing collateralized by certain property, plant, and equipment in the amount of 6.90 billion New Taiwan dollars or an equivalent amount in U.S. dollars (approximately $213 million as of

September 3, 2015

), of which we drew $40 million in 2015.  The availability of these revolving and other facilities is subject to certain conditions, including outstanding balances of trade receivables; inventories; collateralization of certain property, plant, and equipment; and other conditions.  Events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy these applicable drawdown conditions and utilize these facilities.  We have in the past and expect in the future to continue to incur additional debt to finance our capital investments, business acquisitions, and restructuring of our capital structure.

Our debt obligations could adversely impact us.  For example, these obligations could:

•

require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, R&D expenditures, and other business activities;

•

continue to dilute our earnings per share as a result of the conversion provisions in our convertible notes;

•

require us to continue to pay cash amounts substantially in excess of the principal amounts upon settlement of our convertible notes to minimize dilution of our earnings per share;

•

limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, R&D, and other general corporate requirements;

•

adversely impact our credit rating, which could increase future borrowing costs; and

•

increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory industry conditions.

Our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows in the future.  This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control.  There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs.  If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.  If we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make scheduled debt payments, and make adequate capital investments.

Our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold, average selling prices, and manufacturing costs.  To develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, R&D, and product and process technology.  We estimate that cash expenditures in 2016 for property, plant, and equipment will be approximately $5.3 billion to $5.8 billion.  Investments in capital expenditures for 2015 were $4.12 billion.  In addition, as a result of the MMJ acquisition and our capacity expansion in Singapore, we expect our future capital spending will be higher than our historical levels.  As of

September 3, 2015

, we had cash and marketable investments of

$5.63 billion

, which included

$748 million

held by the MMJ Group and

$134 million

held by IMFT, none of which is generally available to finance our other operations.


As a result of the Japan Proceedings, for so long as such proceedings are continuing, the MMJ Companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends, loans, and advances.  The plans of reorganization of the MMJ Companies prohibit the MMJ Companies from paying dividends, including any cash dividends, to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the MMJ Companies' installment payments.  These prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the MMJ Companies from paying cash dividends to us in respect of the shares of such subsidiaries owned by the MMJ Companies, as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the MMJ Companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization.  In addition, pursuant to an order of the Japan Court, the MMJ Companies cannot make loans or advances, other than certain ordinary course advances, to us without the consent of the Japan Court.  Moreover, loans or advances by subsidiaries of the MMJ Companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and Japan Court.  As a result, the assets of the MMJ Companies and their subsidiaries, while available to satisfy the MMJ Companies' installment payments and the other obligations, capital expenditures, and other operating needs of the MMJ Companies and their subsidiaries, are not available for use by us in our other operations.  Furthermore, certain uses of the assets of the MMJ Group, including investments in certain capital expenditures and in MMT, may require consent of MMJ's trustees and/or the Japan Court.

In the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed.  As a result of our debt levels, expected debt amortization and general economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, use cash held by MMJ to fund its capital expenditures, access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt payments, and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency.  Our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions.

The acquisition of our ownership interest in Inotera from Qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for Qimonda.

On January 20, 2011, Dr. Michael Jaffé, administrator for Qimonda insolvency proceedings, filed suit against Micron and Micron Semiconductor B.V., our Netherlands subsidiary ("Micron B.V."), in the District Court of Munich, Civil Chamber.  The complaint seeks to void under Section 133 of the German Insolvency Act a share purchase agreement between Micron B.V. and Qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which Micron B.V. purchased substantially all of Qimonda's shares of Inotera Memories, Inc. (the "Inotera Shares"), representing approximately 55% of our total shares in Inotera as of

September 3, 2015

, and seeks an order requiring us to re-transfer those shares to the Qimonda estate.  The complaint also seeks, among other things, to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with Inotera and to terminate under Sections 103 or 133 of the German Insolvency Code a patent cross-license between us and Qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement.

Following a series of hearings with pleadings, arguments, and witnesses on behalf of the Qimonda estate, on March 13, 2014, the Court issued judgments:  (1) ordering Micron B.V. to pay approximately $1 million in respect of certain Inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase; (2) ordering Micron B.V. to disclose certain information with respect to any Inotera Shares sold by it to third parties; (3) ordering Micron B.V. to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the Inotera Shares, including in particular, any profits distributed on such shares and all other benefits; (4) denying Qimonda’s claims against Micron for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with Inotera; and (5) determining that Qimonda's obligations under the patent cross-license agreement are canceled.  In addition, the Court issued interlocutory judgments ordering, among other things:  (1) that Micron B.V. transfer to the Qimonda estate the Inotera Shares still owned by it and pay to the Qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any Inotera Shares sold to third parties; and (2) that Micron B.V. pay the Qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by it from ownership of the Inotera Shares.  The interlocutory judgments have no immediate, enforceable effect on us, and, accordingly, we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the Inotera Shares subject to further developments in the case.  We have filed a notice of appeal, and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals court.  The next hearing on the matter has not yet been scheduled.

We are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss.  The final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the Inotera shares or monetary damages, unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by Micron B.V. from the ownership of the Inotera Shares, and/or the termination of the patent cross-license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, or financial condition.  As of

September 3, 2015

, the Inotera Shares had a carrying value for purposes of our financial reporting of $683 million and a market value of $846 million.


Our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologies.

Our key semiconductor memory technologies of DRAM, NAND Flash, and NOR Flash face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs.  These barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs, meet higher density requirements, and improve power consumption and reliability.  To meet these requirements, we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry.  Our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance and/or cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete.  Accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies

.

There can be no assurance of the following:

•

that we will be successful in developing competitive

new semiconductor memory technologies;

•

that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products;

•

that we will be able to successfully market these technologies; and

•

that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced the development of new 3D XPoint technology, which is an entirely new class of non-volatile memory.  There is no assurance that our efforts to develop and market this new product technology will be successful.  If our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

New product development may be unsuccessful.

We are developing new products, including system-level memory products, that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology.  We have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years.  The process to develop DRAM, NAND Flash, NOR Flash, and certain specialty memory products, requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance, many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers.  There can be no assurance of the following:

•

that our product development efforts will be successful;

•

that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products;

•

that we will be able to successfully market these products; or

•

that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts.

If our efforts to develop new products are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

Products that fail to meet specifications, are defective, or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us.

Products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.  From time to time we experience problems with nonconforming, defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products.  In recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application.  As a result of these problems we could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following:

•

we may be required to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product or replace products;

•

we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages; and

•

we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products.


A determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

As is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights.  We are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us.  A determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others, or entering a license agreement covering such intellectual property, could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes.  Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.  (See "Part II. Financial Information – Item 8. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Contingencies.")

We have a number of intellectual property license agreements.  Some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments.  We may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future.  We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms.

Our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous risks.

We have entered into strategic relationships to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products.  These relationships include our IMFT joint venture with Intel, our Inotera joint venture with Nanya, and our MP Mask joint venture with Photronics.  These joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations.  These risks include the following:

•

our interests could diverge from our partners or we may not be able to agree with partners on ongoing manufacturing and operational activities, or on the amount, timing, or nature of further investments in our joint venture;

•

our joint venture partners' products may compete with our products;

•

we may experience difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventures;

•

we may experience difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint ventures;

•

our control over the operations of our joint ventures is limited;

•

we may recognize losses from our equity method investments;

•

due to financial constraints, our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures and may pose credit risks for our transactions with them;

•

due to differing business models or long-term business goals, our partners may decide not to join us in funding capital investment in our joint ventures, which may result in higher levels of cash expenditures by us;

•

cash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirements;

•

we may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our joint ventures and partners;

•

the terms of our partnering arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable; and

•

changes in tax, legal, or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in the agreements with our partners.

If our joint ventures and strategic relationships are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

If our manufacturing process is disrupted, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

We manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance.  Difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs.  We maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the U.S., Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, and China.  Additionally, our control over operations at IMFT, Inotera, MP Mask, and Tera Probe is limited by our agreements with our partners.  From time to time, we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, equipment failures, earthquakes, or other environmental events.  If production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers' requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers.  This could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs, loss of revenues, or damage to customer relationships, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.


The operations of the MMJ Companies are subject to continued oversight by the Japan Court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings.

Because the plans of reorganization of the MMJ Companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of MMJ, the Japan Proceedings are continuing, and the MMJ Companies remain subject to the oversight of the Japan Court and of the trustees (including a trustee designated by us, who we refer to as the business trustee, and a trustee designated by the Japan Court, who we refer to as the legal trustee), pending completion of the Japan Proceedings.  The Japan Proceedings and oversight of the Japan Court are expected to continue until the final creditor payment is made under the MMJ Companies' plans of reorganization, which is scheduled to occur in December 2019, but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date.  Although we may be able to petition the court to terminate the Japan Proceedings once two-thirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made, there can be no assurance that the Japan Court will grant any such petition.

During the pendency of the Japan Proceedings, the MMJ Companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the Japan Court and may be required to obtain the consent of the Japan Court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses, including transferring or disposing of, or acquiring, certain material assets, incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness, settling disputes, or entering into certain material agreements.  The consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the MMJ Companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets, to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the MMJ Companies.  Accordingly, during the pendency of the Japan Proceedings, our ability to effectively integrate the MMJ Companies as part of our global operations or to cause the MMJ Companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the Japan Court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the MMJ Companies.

Our Inotera supply agreements involves numerous risks.

Since January 2013, we have purchased all of Inotera's DRAM output at a price reflecting a discount from market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement.  In the second quarter of 2015, we executed a supply agreement, to be effective beginning on January 1, 2016 (the "2016 Supply Agreement"), which will replace the current agreement.  Under the 2016 Supply Agreement, the price for DRAM products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between Inotera and us.  The 2016 Supply Agreement has an initial two-year term, followed by a three-year wind-down period, and contemplates negotiations in late 2016 with respect to a two-year extension, and annual negotiations thereafter with respect to successive one-year extensions.  Upon termination of the initial two-year term of the 2016 Supply Agreement, or any extensions, we would purchase DRAM from Inotera during the wind-down period.  Our share of Inotera's capacity would decline over the wind-down period.  Our Inotera supply agreements involve numerous risks including the following:

•

higher costs for supply obtained under the Inotera supply agreements as compared to our wholly-owned facilities;

•

difficulties and delays in ramping production at Inotera;

•

difficulties in transferring technology to Inotera; and

•

difficulties in coming to an agreement with Nanya regarding major corporate decisions, such as capital expenditures or capital structure.

In 2015 and in 2014, our cost of products purchased from Inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities, due to the pricing formula of the current agreement and strong market conditions.  For 2015, we purchased

$2.37 billion

of DRAM products from Inotera and our supply from Inotera accounted for 35% of our aggregate DRAM gigabit production.  If our supply of DRAM from Inotera is impacted, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.


Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

Across our global operations, there are transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the British pound, euro, shekel, Singapore dollar, New Taiwan dollar, yen, and yuan.  We recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of $27 million for 2015, $28 million for 2014, and $229 million for 2013.  Based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities, offset by balance sheet hedges, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would result in losses of approximately

$3 million

as of

September 3, 2015

.  In addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies.  Exchange rates for some of these currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly the yen, have been volatile in recent periods.  If these currencies strengthen against the U.S. dollar, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase.  In the event that exchange rates for the U.S. dollar adversely change against our foreign currency exposures, our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected.

We may make future acquisitions and/or alliances, which involve numerous risks.

Acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks including the following:

•

integrating the operations, technologies, and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations;

•

increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities;

•

increased debt levels;

•

the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities;

•

the use of cash to finance a transaction, which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, R&D expenditures, and other business activities;

•

diverting management's attention from daily operations;

•

managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas;

•

hiring and retaining key employees;

•

requirements imposed by governmental authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business;

•

inability to realize synergies or other expected benefits;

•

failure to maintain customer, vendor, and other relationships;

•

inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company's internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and

•

impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements, or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired business.

In previous years, supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for DRAM, NAND Flash, and NOR Flash products.  Resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants, including the liquidation of Qimonda and the 2012 bankruptcy filing by Elpida (now known as MMJ).  These types of proceedings often lead to court-directed processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets.  We believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors, and we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions.  To the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions, we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above, including the risks pertaining to funding, assumption of liabilities, integration challenges, and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions.  Acquisitions of, or alliances with, high-technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

Breaches of our network security could expose us to losses.

We manage and store on our network systems various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations.  We also process, store, and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees, including sensitive personal information.  Unauthorized users may be able to gain access to our network system and steal proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns.  These parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities.  Attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers, and could expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers, suppliers, or employees is compromised.


Compliance with regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.

Increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") and its implementing Securities and Exchange Commission regulations.  The Dodd-Frank Act imposes supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the "DRC") and finance or benefit local armed groups.  These "conflict minerals" are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors.  The implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials.  This in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing.  Some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our products are DRC conflict free.

We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.

We operate in a number of locations outside the U.S., including in Singapore, and, to a lesser extent, Taiwan, where we have tax incentive agreements that are, in part, conditional upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds.  Our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the distribution of our earnings among these different jurisdictions.  Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including challenges by tax authorities to our tax structure, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements, and changes in tax laws and regulations.  We file income tax returns with the U.S. federal government, various U.S. states, and various other jurisdictions throughout the world.  Our U.S. federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2011 through 2015.  In addition, tax returns open to examination in multiple other taxing jurisdictions range from the years 2007 to 2015.  The results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.

We may not utilize all of our net deferred tax assets.

We have substantial deferred tax assets, which include, among others, net operating loss and credit carryforwards.  As of

September 3, 2015

, our U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, including uncertain tax benefits, were

$4.02 billion

and

$2.05 billion

, respectively, which, if not utilized, will expire at various dates from 2016 through 2035.  As of

September 3, 2015

, our foreign net operating loss carryforwards were $5.15 billion, including

$3.81 billion

pertaining to Japan, which, if not utilized, substantially all will expire at various dates from 2017 through 2025.  As of

September 3, 2015

, we had valuation allowances of

$1.16 billion

and

$710 million

against our net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Japan, respectively.

The limited availability of raw materials, supplies, or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

Our operations require raw materials, and in certain cases, third party services, that meet exacting standards.  We generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services.  However, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards.  In some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single supplier.  Various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as silicon wafers, controllers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, photoresist, lead frames, and molding compound.  Shortages may occur from time to time in the future.  We and/or our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials.  In addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials.  Lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past.  If our supply of raw materials or services is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.


Our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes.  For certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier.  From time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the supplier's limited capacity.  Our inability to obtain this equipment timely could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs.  Delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp.  If we are unable to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

A downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business.

Downturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business.  Adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers, mobile devices, solid-state drives, and servers.  Reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales.  A deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures.  In addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties.  Difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of loss on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults.  As a result, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate.

We have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations.  In addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations.  A natural disaster, fire, explosion, or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

We face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

Sales to customers outside the United States approximated 84% of our consolidated net sales for 2015.  In addition, a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the United States.  In particular, a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in Singapore, Taiwan, and Japan.  Our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:

•

export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, customs regulations and processes, and restrictions on the transfer of funds;

•

compliance with U.S. and international laws involving international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export and import laws, and similar rules and regulations;

•

protection of intellectual property;

•

political and economic instability;

•

problems with the transportation or delivery of our products;

•

issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest;

•

longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;

•

compliance with trade, technical standards, and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions;

•

contractual and regulatory limitations on our ability to maintain flexibility with our staffing levels;

•

disruptions to our manufacturing operations as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments;

•

changes in economic policies of foreign governments; and

•

difficulties in staffing and managing international operations.

These factors may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.


We are subject to counterparty default risks.

We have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits, investments, capped-call contracts on our stock, and derivative instruments.  As a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations.  A counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure.  Additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action.  If one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceeding.  In the event of such default, we could incur significant losses, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

ITEM 1B.  UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

Our corporate headquarters are located in Boise, Idaho.  The following is a summary of our principal facilities as of

September 3, 2015

:

Substantially all of the capacity of the facilities listed above is fully utilized.  Our Inotera joint venture has a 300mm wafer fabrication facility in Kueishan, Taiwan.  Under our supply agreement with Inotera, we purchase all of the output of Inotera.  We also own and lease a number of other facilities in locations throughout the world that are used for design, R&D, and sales and marketing activities.

Our facility in Lehi is owned and operated by our IMFT joint venture with Intel.  (See "Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Equity – Noncontrolling Interests in Subsidiaries – IMFT.")

In December 2014, we announced plans to add approximately 255,000 square feet of clean room space to our fabrication facility in Singapore to implement 3D NAND Flash production.  Construction of the additional space began in 2015 with initial manufacturing output likely in 2017.

We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes.  We do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment.  (See "Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Geographic Information.")


ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Reorganization Proceedings of the MMJ Companies

On July 31, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Elpida, now known as MMJ, a Japanese corporation, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement on Support for Reorganization Companies (as amended, the "Sponsor Agreement") that we entered into on July 2, 2012 with the trustees of the MMJ Companies' pending corporate reorganization proceedings under the Corporate Reorganization Act of Japan.

The MMJ Companies filed petitions for commencement of corporate reorganization proceedings with the Japan Court under the Corporate Reorganization Act of Japan on February 27, 2012, and the Japan Court issued an order to commence the reorganization proceedings (the "Japan Proceedings") on March 23, 2012.  On July 2, 2012, we entered into the Sponsor Agreement with the legal trustees of the MMJ Companies and the Japan Court approved the Sponsor Agreement.  Under the Sponsor Agreement, we agreed to provide certain support for the reorganization of the MMJ Companies and the trustees agreed to prepare and seek approval from the Japan Court and the MMJ Companies' creditors of plans of reorganization consistent with such support.

The trustees initially submitted the proposed plans of reorganization for the MMJ Companies to the Japan Court on August 21, 2012 and submitted final proposed plans on October 29, 2012.  On October 31, 2012, the Japan Court approved submission of the trustees' proposed plans of reorganization to creditors for approval.  On February 26, 2013, the MMJ Companies' creditors approved the reorganization plans and on February 28, 2013, the Japan Court issued an order approving the plans of reorganization.  Appeals filed by certain creditors of MMJ in Japan challenging the plan approval order issued by the Japan Court were denied.

In a related action, MMJ filed a Verified Petition for Recognition and Chapter 15 Relief in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "U.S. Court") on March 19, 2012 and, on April 24, 2012, the U.S. Court entered an order that, among other things, recognized MMJ's corporate reorganization proceeding as a foreign main proceeding pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 1517(b).  On June 25, 2013, the U.S. Court issued a recognition order, which recognized the order of the Japan Court approving MMJ's plan of reorganization.  On November 19, 2013, the U.S. Court closed the U.S. Chapter 15 proceeding.

The plans of reorganization provide for payments by the MMJ Companies to their secured and unsecured creditors in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen, less certain expenses of the reorganization proceedings and certain other items.  The plans of reorganization also provided for the investment by us pursuant to the Sponsor Agreement of 60 billion yen ($615 million) paid at closing in cash into MMJ in exchange for 100% ownership of MMJ's equity and the use of such investment to fund the initial installment payment by the MMJ Companies to their creditors of 60 billion yen, subject to reduction for certain items specified in the Sponsor Agreement and plans of reorganization.

Under MMJ's plan of reorganization, secured creditors will recover 100% of the amount of their fixed claims and unsecured creditors will recover at least 17.4% of the amount of their fixed claims.  The actual recovery of unsecured creditors will be higher, however, based, in part, on events and circumstances occurring following the plan approval.  The remaining portion of the unsecured claims will be discharged, without payment, over the period that payments are made pursuant to the plans of reorganization.  The secured creditors will be paid in full on or before the sixth installment payment date, while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installments.  MAI's plan of reorganization provides that secured creditors will recover 100% of the amount of their claims, whereas unsecured creditors will recover 19% of the amount of their claims.  The secured creditors of MAI were paid in full on the first installment payment date, while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installments.


Because the plans of reorganization of the MMJ Companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of the MMJ acquisition, the Japan Proceedings are continuing and the MMJ Companies remain subject to the oversight of the Japan Court and of the trustees (including a trustee designated by us, who we refer to as the business trustee, and a trustee designated by the Japan Court, who we refer to as the legal trustee), pending completion of the reorganization proceedings.  The business trustee makes decisions in relation to the operation of the businesses of the MMJ Companies, other than decisions in relation to acts that need to be carried out in connection with the Japan Proceedings, which are the responsibility of the legal trustee.  The Japan Proceedings and oversight of the Japan Court will continue until the final creditor payment is made under the MMJ Companies' plans of reorganization, which is scheduled to occur in December 2019, but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date.  The MMJ Companies may petition the Japan Court for an early termination of the Japan Proceedings once two-thirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made.  Although such early terminations are customarily granted, there can be no assurance that the Japan Court will grant any such petition in these particular cases.

During the pendency of the Japan Proceedings, the MMJ Companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the Japan Court and may be required to obtain the consent of the Japan Court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses, including transferring or disposing of, or acquiring, certain material assets, incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness, settling material disputes, or entering into certain material agreements.  The consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the MMJ Companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets, to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the MMJ Companies.  Accordingly, during the pendency of the Japan Proceedings, our ability to effectively integrate the MMJ Companies as part of our global operations or to cause the MMJ Companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the Japan Court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the MMJ Companies.

For a discussion of other legal proceedings, see "Part II Financial Information – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Contingencies" and "Item 1A. Risk Factors."

ITEM 6.  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

On July 31, 2013, we completed the MMJ Acquisition, in which we acquired Elpida, now known as MMJ, and a controlling interest in Rexchip, now known as MMT.  The MMJ Group's products include mobile DRAM targeted to mobile phones and tablets and computing DRAM targeted to desktop PCs, servers, notebooks, and workstations.  The MMJ Acquisition included a 300mm DRAM wafer fabrication facility located in Hiroshima, Japan, a 300mm DRAM wafer fabrication facility in Taichung City, Taiwan, and an assembly and test facility located in Akita, Japan.  In connection with the MMJ Acquisition, we recorded net assets of

$2.60 billion

, noncontrolling interests of

$168 million

, and a gain on the transaction of

$1.48 billion

in 2013.  (See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Micron Memory Japan, Inc.")

We entered into a joint venture relationship with Intel to form IMFT in 2006 and IM Flash Singapore, LLP ("IMFS") in 2007 to manufacture NAND Flash memory products for the exclusive use of the members.  We have owned

51%

of IMFT from inception through

September 3, 2015

.  Our ownership percentage of IMFS had increased from

51%

at inception to

82%

as of April 6, 2012 due to a series of contributions by us that were not fully matched by Intel.  On

April 6, 2012

, we entered into a series of agreements with Intel to restructure IMFT and IMFS, in which we acquired Intel's remaining

18%

interest in IMFS for

$466 million

.  In addition, we acquired IMFT's assets located at our Virginia wafer fabrication facility, for which Intel received a distribution from IMFT of

$139 million

.  For both transactions, the amounts Intel received approximated the book values of Intel's interests in the assets acquired.  We consolidate IMFT (and IMFS through April 6, 2012) and report Intel's ownership interests as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries.  (See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Equity – Noncontrolling Interests in Subsidiaries – IMFT.")

Acquisition of Micron Memory Japan, Inc.

On July 31, 2013, we completed the MMJ Acquisition, in which we acquired Elpida, now known as MMJ, and a controlling interest in Rexchip, now known as MMT.  In 2014, we purchased additional interests in MMT, increasing our ownership interest to 99.5%.  In connection with the MMJ Acquisition, we recorded net assets of $2.60 billion, noncontrolling interests of $168 million and a gain on the transaction of $1.48 billion in 2013.  In the second quarter of 2014, the provisional amounts recorded in connection with the MMJ Acquisition were adjusted, primarily for pre-petition liabilities.  As a result, other non-operating expense for 2014 included these measurement period adjustments of $33 million.  (See "Item 8. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Micron Memory Japan, Inc.")

The MMJ Acquisition included a 300mm DRAM wafer fabrication facility located in Hiroshima, Japan, a 300mm DRAM wafer fabrication facility in Taichung City, Taiwan, and an assembly and test facility located in Akita, Japan.  These wafer fabrication facilities together represented approximately 30% of our total wafer capacity for 2015.  The MMJ Group's products include mobile DRAM targeted to mobile phones and tablets, and computing DRAM targeted to desktop PCs, servers, notebooks, and workstations.  The operations from the MMJ Acquisition are included primarily in the MBU and CNBU segments.


Net Sales

Percentages reflect rounding and may not total 100%.

Total net sales for 2015 decreased 1% as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower CNBU sales as a result of decreases in DRAM sales as declines in average selling prices outpaced increases in gigabit sales volumes.  SBU and MBU sales for 2015 increased as compared to 2014 as a result of higher NAND Flash sales due to increases in gigabit sales volumes partially offset by declines in average selling prices.  EBU sales for 2015 increased as compared to 2014 due to higher sales volumes as a result of increases in market demand.  The increases in gigabit sales volumes for 2015 were primarily attributable to higher manufacturing output due to improvements in product and process technologies.

Total net sales for 2014 increased 80% as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher CNBU and MBU sales resulting from the MMJ Acquisition.  Net sales for all segments in 2014 also benefitted, as compared to 2013, from increases in DRAM and NAND Flash sales volumes driven primarily by higher manufacturing output as a result of improvements in product and process technology and an increased share of output from Inotera.

Gross Margin

Our overall gross margin percentage declined to 32% for 2015 from 33% for 2014 primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by manufacturing cost reductions.  CNBU and SBU experienced declines in gross margin percentage for 2015 as compared to 2014 as declines in average selling price outpaced manufacturing cost reductions.  MBU's gross margin percentage for 2015 improved as compared to 2014 as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices.

Since January 2013, we have purchased all of Inotera's DRAM output at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement.  In the second quarter of 2015, we executed a supply agreement, to be effective beginning on January 1, 2016 (the "2016 Supply Agreement"), which will replace the current agreement.  Under the 2016 Supply Agreement, the price for DRAM products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between Inotera and us.  The 2016 Supply Agreement has an initial two-year term, followed by a three-year wind-down period, and contemplates negotiations in late 2016 with respect to a two-year extension, and annual negotiations thereafter with respect to successive one-year extensions.  Upon termination of the initial two-year term of the 2016 Supply Agreement, or any extensions, we would purchase DRAM from Inotera during the wind-down period.  Our share of Inotera's capacity would decline over the wind-down period.  In 2015 and 2014, our cost of products purchased from Inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities, due to the pricing formula of the current agreement and strong market conditions.  Under the market conditions prevailing in the fourth quarter of 2015, costs of products purchased under the current agreement were higher than they would have been under the pricing formula of the 2016 Supply Agreement.  We purchased

$2.37 billion

,

$2.68 billion

, and

$1.26 billion

of DRAM products from Inotera in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

Our overall gross margin percentage improved to 33% for 2014 from 20% for 2013 primarily due to improvements in the gross margin percentage for CNBU and MBU as a result of higher margins for DRAM products.  The gross margin improvements for CNBU and MBU for 2014 as compared to 2013 resulted primarily from the MMJ Acquisition, manufacturing cost reductions, and higher average selling prices for CNBU.  Our gross margin percentage on sales of DRAM products for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to reductions in costs and increases in average selling prices.  Cost reductions for 2014 primarily reflected improvements in product and process technologies and the comparatively lower manufacturing costs of the MMJ Group, partially offset by higher costs for product obtained under the Inotera supply agreement.  For 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013, our costs of goods sold for DRAM products included the sale of the MMJ Group's inventories recorded at fair value in the MMJ Acquisition, which was higher than the manufacturing cost of such inventories.  This increased our costs of goods sold by approximately $153 million for 2014 and $41 million for 2013.


Operating Results by Business Segments

CNBU

CNBU sales and operating results are significantly impacted by average selling prices, gigabit sales volumes, and cost per gigabit of our DRAM products.  (See "Operating Results by Product – DRAM" for further detail.)  CNBU sales for 2015 decreased 8% as compared to 2014 primarily due to declines in average selling prices as a result of continued weakness in the PC sector, partially offset by increases in gigabits sold.  CNBU operating income for 2015 declined from 2014 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions.

CNBU sales for 2014 increased 112% as compared to 2013 primarily due to (1) the MMJ Acquisition, (2) higher average selling prices, (3) increased DRAM supply from Inotera as a result of the restructuring of our supply agreement, and (4) higher output due to improvements in product and process technologies.  CNBU sales for 2014 as compared to 2013 were adversely impacted by the transition of production at one of our Singapore wafer fabrication facilities from DRAM to NAND Flash.  CNBU operating income for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to the MMJ Acquisition, higher average selling prices, and manufacturing cost reductions.

MBU

In 2015 and 2014, MBU sales were comprised primarily of DRAM, NAND Flash, and NOR Flash, in decreasing order of revenue, with mobile DRAM products accounting for a significant majority of the sales.  MBU sales for 2015 increased 2% as compared to 2014 primarily due to significant increases in gigabit sales volumes for managed NAND Flash and MCP products partially offset by lower sales of mobile DRAM products as a result of declines in average selling prices and sales volumes.  MBU operating income for 2015 improved from 2014 as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices.

MBU sales for 2014 increased 199% as compared to 2013 primarily due to significant increases in mobile DRAM sales as a result of the MMJ Acquisition.  MBU operating margin for 2014 also improved from 2013 primarily due to the MMJ Acquisition and manufacturing cost reductions, which significantly outpaced declines in average selling prices.

SBU

SBU sales and operating results are significantly impacted by average selling prices, gigabit sales volumes, and cost per gigabit of our NAND Flash products.  (See "Operating Results by Product – Non-Volatile Memory" for further details.)  SBU sales for 2015 increased 6% from 2014 primarily due to increases in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices.  SBU sells a portion of its products to Intel through our IMFT joint venture at long-term negotiated prices approximating cost.  SBU sales of products to Intel under this arrangement were

$420 million

,

$423 million

, and

$387 million

for


,


, and


, respectively.  All other SBU products are sold to OEMs, resellers, retailers, and other customers (including Intel), which we collectively refer to as "trade customers."


SBU sales of NAND Flash products to trade customers for 2015 increased 7% as compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices.  Increases in gigabits sold for 2015 as compared to 2014 were primarily due to higher manufacturing output.  SBU operating margin for 2015 declined from 2014 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions and R&D costs increased in connection with increased spending on controllers, firmware, and engineering for SSDs and managed NAND Flash products.

SBU sales for 2014 increased 23% from 2013 primarily due to increases in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices.  Increases in gigabits sold for 2014 were primarily due to the transition in 2014 of production at one of our wafer fabrication facilities in Singapore from DRAM to NAND Flash and improvements in product and process technologies.  SBU sales of NAND Flash products to trade customers for 2014 increased 26% as compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices.  SBU operating income for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to higher gigabit sales volumes as manufacturing cost reductions were essentially offset by declines in average selling prices.

EBU

In 2015 and 2014, EBU sales were comprised of DRAM, NAND Flash, and NOR Flash in decreasing order of revenue.  EBU sales for 2015 increased 13% as compared to 2014 primarily due to higher sales volumes of DRAM and NAND Flash products as a result of increases in demand.  EBU operating income for 2015 improved as compared to 2014 primarily due to the higher sales volumes.

EBU sales for 2014 increased 39% as compared to 2013 primarily due to increased sales volumes of DRAM and NAND Flash products partially offset by declines in average selling prices.  EBU operating income for 2014 improved as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher margins on sales of DRAM and NAND Flash products as a result of the increase in sales and cost reductions.

Operating Results by Product

Net Sales by Product

Percentages reflect rounding and may not total 100%.

Non-Volatile Memory includes NAND Flash and 3D XPoint memory.  Through 2015, substantially all of our Non-Volatile Memory sales were from NAND Flash products.  Sales of NOR Flash products are included in Other.  Information regarding our MCP products, which combine both NAND Flash and DRAM components, is reported within Non-Volatile Memory.

DRAM


The increase in gigabit sales volumes of DRAM products for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to increases in gigabit production despite our continued preparation of fabrication facilities for production of the next technology node, which constrained output.  DRAM gigabit production growth in 2015 was also impacted by a shift to a higher mix of mobile and DDR4 products, which have larger die sizes and therefore produce fewer bits per wafer.  The increase in gigabit sales of DRAM products for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher production volumes resulting from the MMJ Acquisition, increased supply under the Inotera supply agreement, and improved product and process technologies, partially offset by the transition of one of our wafer fabrication facilities in Singapore from DRAM to NAND Flash.  In 2014, DRAM products produced by facilities acquired in the MMJ Acquisition constituted 54% of our aggregate DRAM gigabit production as compared to 9% in 2013.

In 2015 and 2014, our cost of products purchased from Inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities, due to the pricing formula of the current agreement and strong market conditions.  Under the market conditions prevailing in the fourth quarter of 2015, costs of products purchased under the current agreement were higher than they would have been under the pricing formula of the 2016 Supply Agreement.  DRAM products acquired from Inotera accounted for 35% of our aggregate DRAM gigabit production for 2015 as compared to 38% for 2014 and 54% for 2013.

Our gross margin percentage on sales of DRAM products for 2015 improved from 2014 as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices.  Our gross margin percentage on sales of DRAM products for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to reductions in costs and increases in average selling prices.  Cost reductions for 2014 primarily reflected improvements in product and process technologies and the comparatively lower manufacturing costs of the MMJ Group partially offset by higher costs for product obtained under the Inotera supply agreement and the sale of the MMJ Group's inventories recorded in the MMJ Acquisition.

Non-Volatile Memory

The following discussion focuses on sales of NAND Flash products which constituted substantially all of Non-Volatile Memory sales through 2015.  This discussion of NAND Flash excludes NAND Flash products manufactured and sold to Intel through IMFT at long-term negotiated prices approximating cost.

The increase in NAND Flash gigabits sold to trade customers for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to higher production from improved product and process technologies and the transition of our wafer fabrication facility in Singapore from DRAM to NAND Flash production.  Increases in gigabit production of NAND Flash products for 2015 as compared to 2014 were limited by a shift in product mix to higher levels of managed NAND Flash and MCP products, which have both higher average selling prices and costs per gigabit.  Increases in NAND Flash gigabits sold to trade customers for 2014 as compared to 2013 were primarily due to the transition of our wafer fabrication facility in Singapore from DRAM to NAND Flash production and improvements in product and process technologies.

Our gross margin percentage on sales of trade NAND Flash products for 2015 declined from 2014 as the declines in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions resulting from improvements in product and process technologies.  Our gross margin percentage on sales of trade NAND Flash products for 2014 was relatively unchanged from 2013 as manufacturing cost reductions offset declines in average selling prices.  Manufacturing cost reductions for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily resulted from improvements in product and process technologies.


Operating Expenses and Other

Selling, General and Administrative

SG&A expenses for 2015 increased 2% as compared to 2014 primarily due to an additional week in 2015 and higher legal costs.

SG&A expenses for 2014 increased 26% as compared to 2013 primarily due to the incremental costs resulting from the MMJ Acquisition and higher payroll costs resulting primarily from the reinstatement of variable pay plans.

Research and Development

R&D expenses for 2015 increased 12% from 2014 primarily due to a higher volume of development wafers processed, an increase in depreciation expense due to R&D capital expenditures, higher payroll costs, higher subcontracted engineering and other professional service costs, and an additional week in 2015.  Increases in R&D expenses for 2015 as compared to 2014 were partly attributable to increased spending on controllers, firmware, and engineering to support system level products, including SSD, managed NAND Flash, and HMC products.

R&D expenses for 2014 increased 47% from 2013 primarily due to the incremental costs resulting from the MMJ Acquisition, higher payroll costs resulting primarily from the reinstatement of variable pay plans, and increased resources dedicated to development efforts.

We generally share with Intel the costs of product design and process development activities for NAND Flash memory and 3D XPoint memory.  Our R&D expenses reflect net reductions of $231 million, $162 million, and $176 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, as a result of reimbursements under our Intel and other cost-sharing arrangements.

Our process technology R&D efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller line-width process technologies which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products.  Additional process technology R&D efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures, the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise, and the development of new manufacturing materials.  Product design and development efforts include our high density DDR3 and DDR4 DRAM, Mobile LPDRAM products, high density NAND Flash memory (including 3D NAND and MLC and TLC technologies), 3D XPoint memory, SSDs, Hybrid Memory Cubes, specialty memory, NOR Flash memory, and other memory technologies and systems.

Restructure and Asset Impairments

In order to optimize operations, improve efficiency, and increase our focus on our core memory operations, we have entered into various restructure activities.  For 2014 and 2013, other restructure included charges associated with our efforts to wind down our 200mm operations primarily in Agrate, Italy and Kiryat Gat, Israel and charges associated with workforce optimization activities, primarily related to our MBU and EBU operating segments.  As of

September 3, 2015

, we do not anticipate incurring any significant additional costs for these restructure activities.  (See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Restructure and Asset Impairments.")

Interest Income (Expense)

Net interest expense for


,


, and 2013, included aggregate amounts of amortization of debt discount and other costs of

$138 million

,

$167 million

, and

$122 million

, respectively.


Income Taxes

Our effective tax rates were 6.0%, 4.7%, and 0.6% for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  Our effective tax rates reflect the following:

•

operations in tax jurisdictions, including Singapore and Taiwan, where our earnings are indefinitely reinvested and the effective tax rates in these jurisdictions are significantly lower than the U.S. statutory rate;

•

operations outside the U.S., including Singapore

and, to a lesser extent Taiwan, where we have tax incentive arrangements that decrease our effective tax rates; and

•

a valuation allowance against substantially all of our U.S. net deferred tax assets.

Income taxes for 2015 and 2014 included $80 million and $59 million, respectively, related to changes in amounts of net deferred tax assets associated with the MMJ Group.  Income taxes for 2013 included benefits of $19 million from the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters and a change in tax laws applicable to prior years.  The remaining tax provision for 2015, 2014, and 2013 primarily reflects taxes on our other non-U.S. operations.  Income taxes on U.S. operations for 2015, 2014, and 2013 were substantially offset by changes in the valuation allowance.

We have a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset associated with our U.S. operations.  Management continues to evaluate future projected financial performance to determine whether such performance is sufficient evidence to support a reduction in or reversal of the valuation allowances.  The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if significant positive evidence increases.

We operate in a number of locations outside the U.S., including Singapore and, to a lesser extent, Taiwan, where we have tax incentive agreements that are conditional upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds.  The effect of tax incentive arrangements, which expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2030, reduced our tax provision for


,


, and


by

$338 million

(benefitting our diluted earnings per share by

$0.29

),

$286 million

(

$0.24

per diluted share), and

$141 million

(

$0.13

per diluted share), respectively.

(See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Income Taxes.")

Equity in Net Income (Loss) of Equity Method Investees

We recognize our share of earnings or losses from equity method investments, generally on a two-month lag.  Equity in net income (loss) of equity method investees, net of tax, included the following:

Our share of earnings for 2015 included $49 million for the net effect of Inotera's full release of its valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets related to its net operating loss carryforward and the resulting tax provision in subsequent periods.  As a result of the release, Inotera's future net income is subject to tax provisions.  Our equity in net income of Inotera declined for 2015 as compared to 2014 due to a decrease in Inotera's operating results as a result of declines in average selling prices.

Since January 2013, we have purchased all of Inotera's DRAM output at prices reflecting a discount from market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement.  In the second quarter of 2015, we executed the 2016 Supply Agreement, to be effective beginning on January 1, 2016, which will replace the current agreement.  Under the 2016 Supply Agreement, the price for DRAM products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between Inotera and us.  In 2015 and in 2014, our cost of products purchased from Inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities, due to the pricing formula of the current agreement and strong market conditions.  Under the market conditions prevailing in the fourth quarter of 2015, costs of products purchased under the current agreement were higher than they would have been under the pricing formula of the 2016 Supply Agreement.


Other Operating and Non-Operating

In 2014, we settled all pending litigation between us and Rambus, including all antitrust and patent matters, and entered into a patent cross-license agreement.  As a result, other operating expense for 2014 included a $233 million charge to accrue a liability, which reflects the discounted value of amounts due under this arrangement.

Other non-operating expense for 2015, 2014, and 2013 included losses from the restructure of our debt of

$49 million

,

$184 million

, and

$31 million

, respectively.  (See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Debt.")

Other non-operating expense included losses from changes in currency exchange rates of

$27 million

,

$28 million

, and

$229 million

for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  The loss for 2013 included a $228 million loss for currency contracts to hedge our yen-denominated obligations in connection with the MMJ Acquisition.

On August 15, 2014, ON Semiconductor Corporation acquired Aptina for approximately

$433 million

and we recognized a non-operating gain of

$119 million

on the sale of our shares based on our diluted ownership interest of approximately

27%

.

On May 15, 2014, Inotera issued

400 million

common shares in a public offering at a price equal to

31.50

New Taiwan dollars per share, which was in excess of our carrying value per share.  As a result of the issuance, our ownership interest decreased from 35% to

33%

and we recognized a non-operating gain of

$93 million

in 2014.  On May 28, 2013, Inotera issued 634 million common shares to Nanya and certain of its affiliates in a private placement at a price equal to 9.47 New Taiwan dollars per share, which was in excess of our carrying value per share.  As a result of the issuance, our ownership interest decreased from 40% to 35% and we recognized a non-operating gain of $48 million in 2013.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets.  We generated cash from operations of

$5.21 billion

in 2015 and $

5.70 billion

in 2014.  Cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products, which can vary significantly from period to period.  We obtained $2.50 billion from debt and lease financing in 2015 and $2.23 billion in 2014.  As of

September 3, 2015

, we had (1) revolving credit facilities available that provide for up to

$842 million

of additional financing based on eligible receivables and inventories and (2) a term loan agreement available to obtain financing collateralized by certain property, plant, and equipment in the amount of

6.90 billion

New Taiwan dollars or an equivalent amount in U.S. dollars (approximately

$213 million

as of

September 3, 2015

), of which we drew

$40 million

on June 18, 2015.  We are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding capital expenditures, dilution-management activities (including repurchases of convertible notes and our common stock), and ongoing operations.  We expect, from time to time in the future, to engage in a variety of transactions for such purposes, including the issuance or incurrence of secured and unsecured debt and the refinancing and restructuring of existing debt.

To develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and R&D.  As a result of the MMJ acquisition and our expansion in Singapore, we expect our future capital spending will be higher than our historical levels.  We estimate that cash expenditures in 2016 for property, plant, and equipment will be approximately $5.3 billion to $5.8 billion, which includes amounts we expect to be funded by our partners.  The actual amounts for 2016 will vary depending on market conditions.  Investments in capital expenditures for 2015 were $4.12 billion.  Total additions to property, plant, and equipment were

$4.46 billion

, which, in comparison to cash expenditures, reflects differences in timing of receipts and payments for equipment as well as non-cash additions such as equipment leases.  As of

September 3, 2015

, we had commitments of approximately

$1.62 billion

for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, substantially all of which is expected to be paid within one year.


In December 2014, we announced plans to add approximately 255,000 square feet of clean room space to our fabrication facility in Singapore.  This expansion facilitates efficient implementation of 3D NAND Flash production at the Singapore facility and gives us the flexibility to gradually add incremental capacity in response to market requirements.  Construction of the additional space began in 2015 with initial manufacturing output likely in 2017.  Subject to market conditions, we estimate capital expenditures of approximately $1.93 billion in 2016 related to this facility.

Since the first quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $1.25 billion of our outstanding common stock, $250 million of which was authorized in the first quarter of 2016.  Any repurchases under the authorization may be made in open market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, and/or derivative transactions.  Repurchases are subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash.  During 2015, we repurchased

42 million

shares for

$831 million

(including commissions) in the open market.

We expect that our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months.

As of

September 3, 2015

, $2.17 billion of our cash and equivalents and short-term investments was held by foreign subsidiaries, of which $149 million was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  To mitigate credit risk, we invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and, by policy, generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor.

Limitations on the Use of Cash and Investments

MMJ Group:

Cash and equivalents and short-term investments in the table above included an aggregate of $748 million held by the MMJ Group as of

September 3, 2015

.  As a result of the corporate reorganization proceedings of the MMJ Companies entered into in March 2012 and for so long as such proceedings are continuing, the MMJ Companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends, loans, and advances.  The plans of reorganization of the MMJ Companies prohibit the MMJ Companies from paying dividends, including any cash dividends, to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the MMJ Companies' installment payments.  These prohibitions also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the MMJ Companies from paying cash dividends.  In addition, pursuant to an order of the Japan Court, the MMJ Companies cannot make loans or advances, other than certain ordinary course advances, to us without the consent of the Japan Court.  Moreover, loans or advances by subsidiaries of the MMJ Companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustee and Japan Court.  As a result, the assets of the MMJ Group are not available for use by us in our other operations.  Moreover, certain uses of the assets of the MMJ Group, including investments in certain capital expenditures and in MMT, may require consent of MMJ's trustees and/or the Japan Court.

IMFT:

Cash and equivalents and short-term investments in the table above included

$134 million

held by IMFT as of

September 3, 2015

.  Our ability to access funds held by IMFT to finance our other operations is subject to agreement by Intel and contractual limitations.  Amounts held by IMFT are not anticipated to be available to finance our other operations.


Indefinitely Reinvested:

As of

September 3, 2015

, we had $1.48 billion of cash and equivalents and short-term investments, including substantially all of the amounts held by the MMJ Group, that were held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested and repatriation of these funds to the U.S. would subject these funds to U.S. federal income taxes.  Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries is not practicable.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was

$5.21 billion

for 2015.  Cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to net income generated by our operations, adjusted for certain non-cash items.

Investing Activities

Net cash used for investing activities was

$6.23 billion

for 2015, which consisted primarily of cash expenditures of

$4.02 billion

for property, plant, and equipment and $2.14 billion of net outflows for investments in available-for-sale securities.

Financing Activities

Net cash used by financing activities was

$718 million

for 2015, which included outflows of

$2.33 billion

for repayments of debt (including $932 million for the amount in excess of principal of our convertible notes),

$831 million

for the open-market repurchases of

42 million

shares of our common stock, and $95 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts.  Cash outflows for financing activities in 2015 were partially offset by inflows of $2.00 billion in aggregate from the issuance of the 2023 Notes, 2024 Notes, and 2026 Notes, $291 million from the proceeds of sale-leaseback transactions, $125 million from draws on our revolving credit facilities, and $87 million from term loans.

2015 Debt Activity

Throughout 2015, we reduced the dilutive effects of our convertible notes through conversions and repurchases.  As a result, we eliminated convertible notes that were convertible into approximately 37 million shares of our common stock.  The following table summarized our debt restructure activities in 2015.

Potential Settlement Obligations of Convertible Notes

Since the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 trading day period ended September 30, 2015 exceeded 130% of the conversion price per share of our 2032 Notes and 2033 Notes, holders of those notes have the right to convert their notes at any time through December 31, 2015.  For all of our convertible notes, we have either: (1) the requirement to pay cash for the principal amount and the option to pay either cash, shares of our common stock, or any combination thereof for any remaining conversion obligation, or (2) the option to pay cash, issue shares of common stock, or any combination thereof for the aggregate amount due upon conversion.


The following table summarizes the potential settlements, as of

September 3, 2015

, that we could be required to make if all holders converted their 2032 Notes and 2033 Notes:

(1)

We are required to settle the principal amount of the 2033 Notes in cash.  The remaining conversion obligation paid in shares is based on our closing share price of

$16.59

as of

September 3, 2015

.

(2)

Based on our closing share price of

$16.59

as of

September 3, 2015

.  Assumes we elect cash settlement for the entire obligation.

Contractual Obligations

(1)

Amounts include MMJ Creditor Installment Payments, convertible notes, and other notes.  Any future redemptions, repurchases, or conversions of convertible debt could impact the amount and timing of our cash payments.

(2)

Amounts include principal and interest.

(3)

Amounts include contractually obligated minimum lease payments for operating leases having an initial noncancelable term in excess of one year.

(4)

Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, including $222 million for the current portion of these long-term liabilities.  We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities; therefore, $91 million in aggregate of long-term income taxes payable and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities has been excluded from the preceding table.  However, other noncurrent liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet included these uncertain tax positions and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities.

The expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information.  Timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, market prices, changes to agreed-upon amounts, or timing of certain events for some obligations.  The contractual obligations in the table above include the current portions of the related long-term obligations.  All other current liabilities are excluded.

Purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria: (1) they are noncancelable, (2) we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled, or (3) we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services ("take-or-pay").  If the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable, the entire value of the contract was included in the above table.  If the obligation is cancelable, but we would incur a penalty if canceled, the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation.  Contracted minimum amounts specified in take-or-pay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment.


Inotera Supply Agreements

:

Since January 2013, we have purchased all of Inotera's DRAM output at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement.  In the second quarter of 2015, we executed the 2016 Supply Agreement, to be effective beginning on January 1, 2016, which will replace the current agreement.  Under the 2016 Supply Agreement, the price for DRAM products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between Inotera and us.  The 2016 Supply Agreement has an initial two-year term, followed by a three-year wind-down period, and contemplates negotiations in late 2016 with respect to a two-year extension, and annual negotiations thereafter with respect to successive one-year extensions.  Upon termination of the initial two-year term of the 2016 Supply Agreement, or any extensions, we would purchase DRAM from Inotera during the wind-down period.  Our share of Inotera's capacity would decline over the wind-down period.  We purchased

$2.37 billion

of DRAM products from Inotera in 2015 under the current agreement.  The current agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity as quantities are based on qualified production output and pricing fluctuates as it is based on market prices.  Therefore, we did not include any amounts under the current agreement in the contractual obligations table above.  Under the 2016 Supply Agreement, payments are primarily based on fluctuating quantities and prices, but a portion of the expected costs under the agreement meet the criteria of a minimum lease payment under an operating lease and are included in the table above.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have entered into capped calls, which are intended to reduce the effect of potential dilution from our convertible notes.  The capped calls provide for our receipt of cash or shares, at our election, from our counterparties if the trading price of our stock is above a specified initial strike price at the expiration dates.  The amounts receivable varies based on the trading price of our stock, up to specified cap prices.  The dollar value of the cash or shares that we would receive from the capped calls on their expiration dates ranges from $0 if the trading price of our stock is below the initial strike price for all of the capped calls to

$814 million

if the trading price of our stock is at or above the cap price for all of the capped calls.  We paid

$57 million

in 2011,

$103 million

in 2012, and

$48 million

in 2013 to purchase capped calls.  The amounts paid were recorded as charges to additional capital.  For further details of our capped call arrangements, see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Equity – Micron Shareholders' Equity – Capped Calls."

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures.  Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions.  We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.  Our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.

Business Acquisitions

:

Accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired, which involves a number of judgments, assumptions, and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized.  Accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred.  We typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values, including assistance in determining future cash flows, appropriate discount rates, and comparable market values.  The items involving the most significant assumptions, estimates, and judgments included determining the fair value of the following:

•

Property, plant, and equipment, including determination of values in a continued-use model;

•

Deferred tax assets, including projections of future taxable income and tax rates;

•

Inventory, including estimated future selling prices, timing of product sales, and completion costs for work in process;

•

Debt, including discount rate and timing of payments; and

•

Intangible assets, including valuation methodology, estimations of future revenue and costs, profit allocation rates attributable to the acquired technology, and discount rates.


Consolidations

:

We have interests in joint venture entities that are VIEs.  Determining whether to consolidate a VIE requires judgment in assessing whether an entity is a VIE and if we are the entity's primary beneficiary.  To determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  Our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology, product supply, operations services, equity funding, financing, and other applicable agreements and circumstances.  Our assessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our VIEs requires significant assumptions and judgment.

Contingencies

:

We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies.  Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies.  An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  We accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date.  In accounting for the resolution of contingencies, considerable judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution, and amounts related to future periods.

Income Taxes

:

We are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world.  These estimates involve judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex.  Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year.  We are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors.  Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income.  In recent periods, our results of operations have benefitted from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize, primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in Japan and Taiwan.  Our income tax provision or benefit is dependent, in part, on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions.  Such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve numerous judgments including, among others, projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes, manufacturing and overhead costs, levels of capital spending, and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.

Inventories

:

Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.  Cost includes depreciation, labor, material and overhead costs, including product and process technology costs.  Determining net realizable value of inventories involves numerous judgments, including projecting future average selling prices, sales volumes, and costs to complete products in work in process inventories.  To project average selling prices and sales volumes, we review recent sales volumes, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry analyses of supply and demand, seasonal factors, general economic trends, and other information.  When these analyses reflect estimated net realizable value below our manufacturing costs, we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold.  Differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of write-down recorded.  For example, a 5% variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our memory inventory by approximately $195 million as of September 3, 2015.  Due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry, actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes; as a result, the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly.

U.S. GAAP provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values.  The amount of any inventory write-down can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories.  Inventories are primarily categorized as memory (including DRAM, non-volatile, and other memory) for purposes of determining lower of average cost or net realizable value.  The major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and markets.

Property, Plant and Equipment

:

We review the carrying value of property, plant, and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and/or disposition.  In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets.  The estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us, including, but not limited to, future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets, future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes.  In addition, judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed.


Research and Development

:

Costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as R&D as incurred.  Determining when product development is complete requires judgment by us.  We deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability.  Subsequent to product qualification, product costs are valued in inventory.

Stock-based Compensation

:

Stock-based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straight-line amortization method over the requisite service period.  For performance-based stock awards, the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved.  We utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgment.

Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, expected option life, and forfeiture rates.  We develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time.  A small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation.  We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards.  We estimate stock price volatility based on an average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –  Recently Issued Accounting Standards."

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio.  Substantially all of our indebtedness is at fixed interest rates.  As a result, the fair value of our debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates.  We estimate that, as of

September 3, 2015

and August 28, 2014, a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates of 1% would increase the fair value of our notes payable by approximately $366 million and $250 million, respectively.  The increase in interest expense caused by a 1% increase in the interest rates of our variable-rate debt would not be significant.

As of

September 3, 2015

and August 24, 2014, we held debt securities of $3.83 billion and $1.65 billion, respectively, that were subject to interest rate risk.  We estimate that a 0.5% increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of these instruments by approximately $13 million as of

September 3, 2015

and $6 million as of August 28, 2014.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the currency exchange rates in "Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors."  Changes in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.


The functional currency for all of our consolidated subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.  The substantial majority of our revenues are transacted in the U.S. dollar; however, significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the British pound, the euro, the shekel, the Singapore dollar, the New Taiwan dollar, the yen, and the yuan.  We have established currency risk management programs for our operating expenditures and capital purchases to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates.  We utilize currency forward and option contracts in these hedging programs, which reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements.  We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

To hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities, we utilize a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days.  Based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities, offset by balance sheet hedges, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would result in losses of approximately

$3 million

as of

September 3, 2015

and

$7 million

as of

August 28, 2014

.  To hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures, we utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12 months.

Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation:

We are a global leader in advanced semiconductor systems.  Our broad portfolio of high-performance memory technologies, including DRAM, NAND Flash, and NOR Flash, is the basis for solid-state drives, modules, multi-chip packages, and other system solutions.  Our memory solutions enable the world's most innovative computing, consumer, enterprise storage, networking, mobile, embedded, and automotive applications.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Micron Technology, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation.  In addition, amounts for certain equipment purchases were reclassified from financing to investing within the statement of cash flows to better reflect the current nature of these transactions and to improve comparability with our industry peers.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, we adopted, on a retrospective basis, Accounting Standards Update 2015-03

– Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.

(See "Debt – Retrospective Application of a New Accounting Standard" note.)

Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31.  Fiscal year 2015 contained 53 weeks and fiscal years 2014 and 2013 each contained 52 weeks.  All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated.

Derivative and Hedging Instruments:

We use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities or future cash flows and to reduce volatility in our earnings caused by changes in interest rates that affect our variable-rate debt.  Our derivatives have consisted of forward and option contracts and we have also entered into interest rate swap contracts.  We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  Derivative instruments are measured at their fair values and recognized as either assets or liabilities.  The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments is based on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges for accounting purpose, gains or losses from changes in fair values are recognized in other non-operating income (expense).  For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss is included as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), and the ineffective or excluded portion of the gain or loss is included in other non-operating income (expense).  The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from these cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same line items of the consolidated statements of operation and in the same periods in which the underlying transactions affect earnings.  Effectiveness is measured by comparing the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item.  For the effectiveness assessment of our cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded for forward contracts.

We enter into master netting arrangements with our counterparties to mitigate credit risk in derivative hedge transactions.  These master netting arrangements allow us and our counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other.  Derivative assets and liabilities that can be net settled with each counterparty have been presented in our consolidated balance sheet on a net basis.

(See "Derivative Instruments" note.)

Financial Instruments:

Cash equivalents include highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities to us of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.  Investments with maturities greater than three months and less than one year are included in short-term investments.  Investments with remaining maturities greater than one year are included in long-term marketable investments.  The carrying value of investment securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.

Functional Currency:

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all of our consolidated subsidiaries.


Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.  Cost includes depreciation, labor, material, and overhead costs, including product and process technology costs.  Determining net realizable value of inventories involves numerous judgments, including projecting future average selling prices, sales volumes, and costs to complete products in work in process inventories.  When net realizable value is below cost, we record a charge to cost of goods sold to write down inventories to their estimated net realizable value in advance of when the inventories are actually sold.  Inventories are primarily categorized as memory (including DRAM, non-volatile, and other memory) for purposes of determining the lower of average cost or net realizable value.  The major characteristics considered in determining inventory categories for purposes of determining the lower of cost or net realizable value are product type and markets.  We remove amounts from inventory and charge such amounts to cost of goods sold on an average cost basis.

Product and Process Technology:

Costs incurred to (1) acquire product and process technology, (2) patent technology, and (3) maintain patent technology are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging up to

12.5

years.  We capitalize a portion of the costs incurred to patent technology based on historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents we file.  Capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of (1) the estimated useful life of the technology, (2) the patent term, or (3) the term of the technology agreement.  Fully-amortized assets are removed from product and process technology and accumulated amortization.

Product Warranty:

We generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery.  Under our general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items.  Under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditions.  Our warranty obligations are not significant.

Property, Plant and Equipment:

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of generally


to


years for buildings,


to


years for equipment, and


to


years for software.  Assets held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value and are included in other noncurrent assets.  When property, plant, or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed, the net book value is removed and we recognize any gain or loss in our results of operations.

We capitalize interest on borrowings during the period of time over which we carry out the activities necessary to bring the asset to the condition of its intended use and location.  Capitalized interest becomes part of the cost of the underlying assets and amortized over the useful lives of the assets.

Research and Development:

Costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development as incurred.  Determining when product development is complete requires judgment.  Development of a product is deemed complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and has passed tests for performance and reliability.  Subsequent to product qualification, product costs are valued in inventory.  Product design and other research and development costs for certain technologies are shared with our joint venture partners.  Amounts receivable from cost-sharing arrangements are reflected as a reduction of research and development expense.  (See "Equity – Noncontrolling Interests in Subsidiaries – IMFT" note.)

Revenue Recognition:

We recognize product or license revenue when persuasive evidence that a sales arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.  If we are unable to reasonably estimate returns or the price is not fixed or determinable, sales made under agreements allowing rights of return or price protection are deferred until customers have resold the product.

Stock-based Compensation:

Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and recognized as expense under the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period.  We issue new shares upon the exercise of stock options or conversion of share units.  (See "Equity Plans" note.)

Treasury Stock:

When we retire our treasury stock, any excess of the repurchase price paid over par value is allocated between additional capital and retained earnings.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures.  Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Estimates and judgments may differ under different assumptions or conditions.  We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.  Actual results could differ from estimates.


Variable Interest Entities

We have interests in entities that are VIEs.  If we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we are required to consolidate it.  To determine if we are the primary beneficiary, we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  Our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology, product supply, operations services, equity funding, financing, and other applicable agreements and circumstances.  Our assessments of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our VIEs require significant assumptions and judgments.

Unconsolidated VIEs

Inotera:

Inotera is a VIE because of the terms of its supply agreement with us.  We have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities of Inotera that most significantly impact its economic performance, primarily due to limitations on our governance rights that require the consent of other parties for key operating decisions and due to Inotera's dependence on Nanya for financing and the ability of Inotera to operate in Taiwan.  Therefore, we do not consolidate Inotera and we account for our interest under the equity method.  (See "Equity Method Investments – Inotera" note.)

EQUVO:

EQUVO HK Limited ("EQUVO") is a special purpose entity created to facilitate an equipment sale-leaseback financing transaction between us and a consortium of financial institutions.  Neither we nor the financing entities have an equity interest in EQUVO.  EQUVO is a VIE because its equity is not sufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional support from the financing entities and because the third-party equity holder lacks characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  By design, the arrangement with EQUVO is merely a financing vehicle and we do not bear any significant risks from variable interests with EQUVO.  Therefore, we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities of EQUVO that most significantly impact its economic performance and we do not consolidate EQUVO.

SC Hiroshima Energy Corporation:

SC Hiroshima Energy Corporation ("SCHE") is an entity created to construct and operate a cogeneration, electrical power plant to support our wafer manufacturing facility in Hiroshima, Japan.  SCHE is a VIE due to the nature of its tolling agreements with us and our purchase and call options for SCHE's assets.  We do not have an equity ownership interest in SCHE.  We do not control the operation and maintenance of the plant, which we have determined are the activities of SCHE that most significantly impact its economic performance.  Therefore, we do not consolidate SCHE.

Consolidated VIEs

IMFT:

IMFT is a VIE because all of its costs are passed to us and its other member, Intel, through product purchase agreements and because IMFT is dependent upon us or Intel for additional cash requirements.  The primary activities of IMFT are driven by the constant introduction of product and process technology.  Because we perform a significant majority of the technology development, we have the power to direct its key activities.  In addition, IMFT manufactures certain products exclusively for us using our technology.  We consolidate IMFT because we have the power to direct the activities of IMFT that most significantly impact its economic performance and because we have the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from IMFT that could potentially be significant to it.

MP Mask:

MP Mask is a VIE because substantially all of its costs are passed to us and its other member, Photronics, through product purchase agreements and MP Mask is dependent upon us or Photronics for any additional cash requirements.  We have tie-breaking voting rights over key operating decisions and nearly all key MP Mask activities are driven by our supply needs.  We consolidate MP Mask because we have the power to direct the activities of MP Mask that most significantly impact its economic performance and because we have the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from MP Mask that could potentially be significant to it.

(See "Equity – Noncontrolling Interests in Subsidiaries" note.)


Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-11

– Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,

which changed the subsequent measurement guidance from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost or net realizable value, with net realizable value defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.  No other changes were made to the current guidance on inventory measurement.  We adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2015.  The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03

– Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs

, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, as appropriate, consistent with debt discounts, as opposed to an asset.  We adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2015 on a retrospective basis.  As a result of adopting this standard, we presented our debt issuance costs for recognized debt liabilities as a direct reduction of the related debt liability in the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented.  (See "Debt – Retrospective Application of a New Accounting Standard" note.)

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05

– Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement

, which provides additional guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.  Under ASU 2015-05, if a software cloud computing arrangement contains a software license, customers should account for the license element of the arrangement in a manner consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.  If the arrangement does not contain a software license, customers should account for the arrangement as a service contract.  ASU 2015-05 also removes the requirement to analogize to ASC 840-10

–

Leases

to determine the asset acquired in a software licensing arrangement.  This ASU will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of 2017 and early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the effects of the adoption of this ASU on our financial statements.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02 –

Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis

, which amends the consolidation requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 810

–

Consolidation

.  ASU 2015-02 makes targeted amendments to the current consolidation guidance for VIEs, which could change consolidation conclusions.  This ASU will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of 2017 and early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the effects of the adoption of this ASU on our financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 –

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S.  The core principal of this ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  This ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.  Including the one-year extension of this ASU provided by ASU 2015-14, we are required to adopt this ASU beginning in our first quarter of 2019; however, we are permitted to adopt this ASU as early as our first quarter of 2018.  This ASU allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption.  We are evaluating the timing of our adoption, the transition method we will elect, and the effects of the adoption of this ASU on our financial statements.


Micron Memory Japan, Inc.

On July 31, 2013, we acquired Elpida, now known as MMJ, and a controlling interest in Rexchip, now known as MMT, for an aggregate of

$949 million

in cash (collectively, "the MMJ Acquisition").  The MMJ Acquisition included (1) the acquisition of MMJ, including its

65%

interest in MMT and (2) the acquisition of an additional

24%

interest in MMT from Powerchip Technology Corporation (the "MMT Share Purchase").  The MMJ Acquisition was treated as a single business combination because: (1) the two transactions were entered into and closed contemporaneously, and (2) the MMT Share Purchase was negotiated in contemplation of the acquisition of MMJ and its completion was contingent on the closing of the acquisition of MMJ.

In 2014, we purchased additional interests in MMT, increasing our ownership interest to

99.5%

.  (See "Equity – Noncontrolling Interest in Subsidiaries – MMT" note.)

The MMJ Acquisition included a


mm DRAM wafer fabrication facility located in Hiroshima, Japan, a


mm DRAM wafer fabrication facility located in Taichung City, Taiwan, and an assembly and test facility located in Akita, Japan.  The operations from the MMJ Acquisition, which are included primarily in our MBU and CNBU segments, include the manufacture of mobile DRAM targeted to mobile phones and tablets and computing DRAM targeted to desktop PCs, servers, notebooks, and workstations.

We estimated the provisional fair values of the assets and liabilities of the MMJ Group as of the July 31, 2013 acquisition date using an in-use model, which reflects its value through its use in combination with other assets as a group and we recognized a gain in 2013 of

$1.48 billion

.  In the second quarter of 2014, the provisional amounts recorded in connection with the MMJ Acquisition were adjusted, primarily for pre-petition liabilities, and we recognized a charge in 2014 for these measurement period adjustments.  The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were as follows:

Our results of operations for 2013 included

$355 million

of net sales and

$46 million

of operating income from the MMJ Group's operations after the July 31, 2013 acquisition date.  Selling, general, and administrative expenses in our results of operations for 2013 included transaction costs of

$50 million

incurred in connection with the MMJ Acquisition.


The acquisition of MMJ was pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement on Support for Reorganization Companies (as amended, the "Sponsor Agreement") that we entered into in July 2012 with the trustees of the MMJ Companies pursuant to and in connection with the MMJ Companies' corporate reorganization proceedings under the Corporate Reorganization Act of Japan.  As a result of the Japan Proceedings, for so long as such proceedings are continuing, the MMJ Companies are subject to certain restrictions on dividends, loans, and advances.  The plans of reorganization of the MMJ Companies prohibit the MMJ Companies from paying dividends, including any cash dividends, to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the MMJ Companies' installment payments.  These prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the MMJ Companies from paying cash dividends to us as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the MMJ Companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization.  In addition, pursuant to an order of the Japan Court, the MMJ Companies cannot make loans or advances, other than certain ordinary-course advances, to us without the consent of the Japan Court.  Moreover, loans or advances by subsidiaries of the MMJ Companies may be considered outside the ordinary course of business and may require consent of MMJ's trustees or, in certain cases, approval by the Japan Court.  As a result, the assets of the MMJ Companies, while available to satisfy the MMJ Companies' installment payments and other obligations, capital expenditures, and other operating needs of the MMJ Companies, are not available for use by us in our other operations.  Certain uses of the assets of the MMJ Companies, including investments in certain capital expenditures and in MMT, may require consent of MMJ's trustees or, in certain cases, approval by the Japan Court.  Disposition of certain assets of the MMJ Companies may also require consent of one or more of the secured creditors.

Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information

The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of operations as if the MMJ Acquisition had occurred on September 2, 2011.  The pro forma financial information includes the accounting effects of the business combination, including adjustments to the amortization of intangible assets; depreciation of property, plant, and equipment; interest expense; and elimination of intercompany activities.  The historical results of operations of the MMJ Group for the eleven months ended May 31, 2013 included a gain of

$1.69 billion

for the forgiveness of debt related to liabilities subject to compromise upon approval of the plans of reorganization by the creditors and the Japan Court.  No adjustments were made to the unaudited pro forma financial information for this item, consistent with the requirements for preparation of the pro forma financial information.  The unaudited pro forma financial information below is not necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or results that might have been achieved had the MMJ Acquisition occurred on September 2, 2011.

The unaudited pro forma financial information for 2013 includes our results for the year ended August 29, 2013, which includes one month of results from the MMJ Group following the closing of the MMJ Acquisition, and the results of the MMJ Group, including the adjustments described above, for the eleven months ended May 31, 2013.


Cash and Investments

Cash and the fair values of our available-for-sale investments, which approximated amortized costs, were as follows:

(1)

The fair value of Level 1 securities is measured based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.

(2)

The fair value of Level 2 securities is measured using information obtained from pricing services, which obtain quoted market prices for similar instruments, non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data, or various other methodologies, to determine the appropriate value at the measurement date.  We perform supplemental analysis to validate information obtained from these pricing services.  As of

September 3, 2015

, no adjustments were made to such pricing information.

(3)

The maturities of our long-term marketable securities generally range from

one

to

four

years.

Proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities for


,


, and


were

$1.49 billion

,

$355 million

, and

$526 million

, respectively.  Gross realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities were not significant for any period presented.  As of

September 3, 2015

,

none

of our available-for-sale securities had been in a loss position for longer than 12 months.

Receivables

As of

September 3, 2015

and

August 28, 2014

, other receivables included

$120 million

and

$70 million

, respectively, due from Intel for amounts related to product design and process development activities under cost-sharing agreements for NAND Flash memory and 3D XPoint memory.  (See "Equity – Noncontrolling Interests in Subsidiaries – IMFT" note.)


Inventories

Property, Plant and Equipment

(1)

Included costs related to equipment not placed into service of

$928 million

and

$826 million

, as of

September 3, 2015

and

August 28, 2014

, respectively.

(2)

Included building-related construction and tool installation costs on assets not placed into service.

Depreciation expense was

$2.55 billion

,

$1.99 billion

, and

$1.72 billion

for

, and


, respectively.  Other noncurrent assets included land held for development of

$58 million

as of

September 3, 2015

and

$57 million

as of

August 28, 2014

.

As of

September 3, 2015

, production equipment and buildings with an aggregate carrying value of

$248 million

and land with a carrying value of

$42 million

were pledged as collateral under various notes payable.  (See "Debt – Other Facilities" note.)


Equity Method Investments

(1)

Entity is a variable interest entity.

As of

September 3, 2015

, substantially all of our maximum exposure to loss from our VIEs that were not consolidated was the

$1.33 billion

carrying value of our investment in Inotera.  We may also incur losses in connection with our rights and obligations to purchase all of Inotera's wafer production capacity under our supply agreements with Inotera.

We recognize our share of earnings or losses from our equity method investees generally on a two-month lag.  Our share of earnings for 2015 included

$49 million

for the net effect of Inotera's full release of its valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets related to its net operating loss carryforward and the resulting tax provision in subsequent periods.  Equity in net income (loss) of equity method investees, net of tax, included the following:

The summarized financial information in the tables below reflects aggregate amounts for our equity method investees.  Financial information is presented for equity method investments as of the respective dates and for the periods through which we recorded our proportionate share of each investee's results of operations.  Summarized results of operations are presented only for the periods subsequent to the acquisition or through the disposition of our ownership interests.

Inotera

We have partnered with Nanya in Inotera, a Taiwan DRAM memory company, since 2009.  In 2013, Inotera issued

634 million

common shares to Nanya and certain of its affiliates in a private placement at a price equal to

9.47

New Taiwan dollars per share, which was in excess of our carrying value per share.  As a result of the issuance, our ownership interest decreased from

40%

to

35%

and we recognized a non-operating gain of

$48 million

in 2013.  In 2014, Inotera issued

400 million

common shares in a public offering at a price equal to

31.50

New Taiwan dollars per share, which was in excess of our carrying value per share.  As a result of the issuance, our ownership interest decreased from

35%

to

33%

and we recognized a non-operating gain of

$93 million

in 2014.  As of

September 3, 2015

, we held a

33%

ownership interest in Inotera, Nanya and certain of its affiliates held a

33%

ownership interest, and the remaining ownership interest in Inotera was publicly held.


As of

September 3, 2015

, the market value of our equity interest in Inotera was

$1.53 billion

based on the closing trading price of

23.20

New Taiwan dollars per share in an active market.  As of

September 3, 2015

and

August 28, 2014

, there were gains of

$13 million

and

$44 million

, respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cumulative translation adjustments from our equity investment in Inotera.

Since January 2013, we have purchased all of Inotera's DRAM output at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement.  In the second quarter of 2015, we executed a supply agreement, to be effective beginning on January 1, 2016 (the "2016 Supply Agreement"), which will replace the current agreement.  Under the 2016 Supply Agreement, the price for DRAM products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between Inotera and us.  The 2016 Supply Agreement has an initial two-year term, followed by a three-year wind-down period, and contemplates negotiations in late 2016 with respect to a two-year extension, and annual negotiations thereafter with respect to successive one-year extensions.  Upon termination of the initial two-year term of the 2016 Supply Agreement, or any extensions, we would purchase DRAM from Inotera during the wind-down period.  Our share of Inotera's capacity would decline over the wind-down period.  In 2015 and 2014, our cost of products purchased from Inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities.  We purchased

$2.37 billion

,

$2.68 billion

and

$1.26 billion

of DRAM products in 2015, 2014, and 2013 respectively.

Tera Probe

In 2013, as part of the MMJ Acquisition, we acquired a

40%

interest in Tera Probe, which provides semiconductor wafer testing and probe services to us and others.  The initial net carrying value of our investment was less than our proportionate share of Tera Probe's equity and the difference is being amortized as a credit to our earnings through equity in net income (loss) of equity method investees (the "Tera Probe Amortization").  As of

September 3, 2015

, the remaining balance of the Tera Probe Amortization was

$27 million

and is expected to be amortized over a weighted-average period of

seven

years.  Based on closing trading prices, the market value of our equity interest in Tera Probe was

$32 million

as of September 3, 2015 and

$41 million

as of June 30, 2015 (the other-than-temporary impairment measurement date for our fourth quarter, commensurate with our lag period).  We evaluated our investment in Tera Probe and concluded that the decline in the market value did not indicate an other-than-temporary impairment primarily because of the limited amount of time of the decline and historical volatility of Tera Probe's stock price.  In the first quarter of 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of

$10 million

within equity in net income of equity method investees to write down the carrying value of our investment in Tera Probe to its fair value, based on its trading price (Level 1 fair value measurement).  We incurred manufacturing costs for 2015, 2014, and 2013 of

$90 million

,

$117 million

, and

$13 million

respectively, for services performed by Tera Probe.

Other

Aptina:

We held an equity interest in Aptina until August 15, 2014.  On August 15, 2014, ON Semiconductor Corporation acquired Aptina for approximately

$433 million

and we recognized a non-operating gain of

$119 million

based on our diluted ownership interest of approximately

27%

.  The gain approximated our share of the consideration because the carrying value of our investment had been reduced to

zero

in 2012, at which time we ceased recognizing our proportionate share of Aptina's losses.

Through May 3, 2013, we manufactured components for Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor ("CMOS") image sensors for Aptina under a wafer supply agreement.  Subsequent to May 3, 2013, we provided various services for Aptina under a service agreement.  For 2014 and 2013, we recognized net sales of

$43 million

and

$182 million

, respectively, from products sold to and services performed for Aptina, and cost of goods sold of

$37 million

and

$219 million

, respectively.  In 2013, we assigned to LFoundry Marsica L.r.l. ("LFoundry") our supply agreement with Aptina to manufacture components for image sensors.  (See "Restructure and Asset Impairments" note.)


Intangible Assets

$98 million

and

Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses

As of

September 3, 2015

and

August 28, 2014

, related party payables included

$327 million

and

$660 million

, respectively, due to Inotera primarily for the purchase of DRAM products.  As of

September 3, 2015

and

August 28, 2014

, related party payables also included

$11 million

and

$13 million

, respectively, due to Tera Probe for probe services performed.  (See "Equity Method Investments" note.)

As of

August 28, 2014

, customer advances included

$90 million

, and other noncurrent liabilities also included

$90 million

, for amounts received from a customer in 2014 under a DRAM supply agreement, all of which was applied to purchases during 2015.


Debt

(1)

We have either the obligation or the option to pay cash for the principal amount due upon conversion for all of our convertible notes.  Since it is our current intent to settle in cash the principal amount of all of our convertible notes upon conversion, the dilutive effect of such notes on earnings per share is computed under the treasury stock method.

(2)

Weighted-average imputed rate of

3.7%

and

4.3%

as of

September 3, 2015

and

August 28, 2014

, respectively.

(3)

Amount recorded for 2014 included the debt and equity components.  The equity component was reclassified to a debt liability as a result of our obligation to settle the conversions of the 2031B Notes in cash.

(4)

Since the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 trading day period ending on June 30, 2015 exceeded 130% of the conversion price per share, holders had the right to convert their notes at any time during the calendar quarter ended September 30, 2015.  The closing price of our common stock also exceeded the thresholds for the calendar quarter ended September 30, 2015; therefore, these notes are convertible by the holders through December 31, 2015.  The 2033 Notes are classified as current because the terms of these notes require us to pay cash for the principal amount of any converted notes.


(1)

Expected remaining term for amortization of the remaining unamortized discount and debt issuance costs as of

September 3, 2015

.  The expected remaining term of the 2031B Notes was not applicable because the notes were not outstanding as of

September 3, 2015

.  Expected remaining term for capital lease obligations is the weighted-average remaining term.

(2)

As holders had elected to convert these notes and we elected to settle the conversions in cash, the net carrying amount for 2014 included the debt component and equity component, which were reclassified to a debt liability as a result of our obligation to settle the conversions of the 2031B Notes in cash, resulting in an aggregate liability of

$389 million

.  The outstanding principal reflects the original principal of the 2031B Notes.

(3)

The 2043G Notes have an original principal amount of

$820 million

that accretes up to

$917 million

through the expected term on November 15, 2028 and

$1.03 billion

at maturity in 2043.  The discount is based on the principal at maturity.  See "2043G Notes" below.

Our convertible and senior notes are unsecured obligations that rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future unsecured indebtedness, and are effectively subordinated to all of our other existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.  Our parent company, Micron, has

$5.18 billion

of debt (net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs), including all of our convertible notes and the 2022 Notes, 2023 Notes, 2024 Notes, 2025 Notes, and 2026 Notes, that is structurally subordinated to all liabilities of its subsidiaries, including trade payables.  Micron guarantees certain debt obligations of its subsidiaries.  Micron does not guarantee the MMJ creditor installment payments.  Micron's guarantees of its subsidiary debt obligations are unsecured obligations ranking equally in right of payment with all of Micron's other existing and future unsecured indebtedness.


2015 Debt Restructure

In 2015, we consummated a number of transactions to restructure our debt, including conversions and settlements, repurchases of convertible notes, issuances of non-convertible notes, and the early repayment of a note.  The following table presents the effect of each of the actions in 2015:

(1)

Included in other non-operating expense.

Conversions and Settlements

:

During 2015, we had the following debt conversions and settlements:

2031B Notes

: On July 23, 2014, we called for the redemption of our remaining 2031B Notes effective on August 22, 2014.  Prior to such effective date, substantially all of the holders of our 2031B Notes exercised their option to convert their notes and, in each case, we elected to settle the amount due upon conversion entirely in cash.  These notes were cash settled in 2015.

2033E Notes

: During 2015, holders converted a portion of our 2033E Notes, and we elected to settle the amounts due upon conversion entirely in cash.

As a result of our elections to settle the amounts due upon conversion in cash, each of the settlement obligations became derivative debt liabilities subject to mark-to-market accounting treatment.  Under the terms of the indentures for the above notes, cash settlement amounts for these derivative debt liabilities were determined based on the shares underlying the converted notes multiplied by the volume-weighted-average price of our common stock over a period of


consecutive trading days.  Therefore, at the dates of our election to settle the conversion in cash, we reclassified the fair values of the equity components of each of the converted notes from additional capital to derivative debt liabilities within current debt in our consolidated balance sheet.


Repurchases

:

During 2015, we repurchased portions of our convertible 2032C Notes, 2032D Notes, 2033E Notes, and 2033F Notes.  The liability and equity components of the repurchased notes had previously been stated separately within debt and additional capital in our consolidated balance sheet.  As a result, our accounting for the repurchased notes affected debt and equity.

Issuances:

On April 30, 2015, we issued

$550 million

in principal amount of 2024 Notes due January 2024 and

$450 million

in principal amount of 2026 Notes due January 2026.  On February 3, 2015, we issued

$1.00 billion

in principal amount of 2023 Notes due August 2023.  Issuance costs for these notes totaled

$21 million

. (See further discussion in "Senior Notes" below.)

Early Repayment

:

On October 17, 2014, we repaid a note prior to its scheduled maturity.

2014 Debt Restructure

In 2014, we consummated a number of transactions to restructure our debt, including exchanges, conversions and settlements, repurchases of convertible notes, issuances of non-convertible notes, and early repayments of notes.  The following table presents the net effect of each of the actions:

(1)

$184 million

included in other non-operating expense and

$21 million

included in interest expense

•

Exchanges

:

Exchanged

$440 million

in aggregate principal amount of our 2027 Notes, 2031A Notes, and 2031B Notes into

$1.03 billion

principal amount at maturity of 2043G Notes.

•

Conversions and Settlements

:

Holders of substantially all of our remaining 2014 Notes, 2027 Notes, and 2031A Notes (with an aggregate principal amount of

$770 million

) converted their notes and we settled the conversions in cash for

$1.45 billion

.  Holders of substantially all of our remaining 2031B Notes converted their notes in August 2014.  As a result of our election to settle the conversion amounts entirely in cash, the settlement obligations became derivative debt liabilities, increasing the carrying value of the 2031B Notes by

$275 million

in 2014 before being cash settled in 2015.

•

Repurchases

:

Repurchased

$320 million

in aggregate principal amount of our convertible 2031B Notes, 2032C Notes, and 2032D Notes for an aggregate of

$857 million

in cash.

•

Issuances

:

Issued

$600 million

in principal amount of the 2022 Notes and

$1.15 billion

in principal amount of the 2025 Notes, and issued

$462 million

in principal amount of the

1.258%

senior notes due 2019.

•

Early Repayments

:

Repaid

$332 million

of notes and capital leases prior to their scheduled maturities.

2013 Debt Restructure

During 2013, we repurchased

$464 million

in aggregate principal amount of our 2014 Notes for

$477 million

in cash.  The liability and equity components of the 2014 Notes had previously been stated separately within debt and additional capital in our consolidated balance sheet.  As a result, the repurchase resulted in the derecognition of

$430 million

in debt for the principal amount (net of

$34 million

of debt discount) and

$15 million

in additional capital for the equity component.  We recognized a loss of

$31 million

in 2013, which was included in other non-operating expense.


MMJ Creditor Installment Payments

Under the MMJ Companies' plans of reorganization, which set forth the treatment of the MMJ Companies' pre-petition creditors and their claims, the MMJ Companies were required to pay

200 billion

yen, less certain expenses of the reorganization proceedings and other items, to their secured and unsecured creditors in


annual installment payments (the "MMJ Creditor Installment Payments").  The MMJ Creditor Installment Payments do not provide for interest and were recorded at fair value in the MMJ Acquisition.  The fair-value discount is accreted to interest expense over the term of the installment payments.

Under the MMJ Companies' corporate reorganization proceedings, the secured creditors of MMJ will recover

100%

of their amount of their fixed claims in


annual installment payments through December 2018 and the unsecured creditors will recover at least

17.4%

of the amount of their fixed claims in


annual installment payments through December 2019.  In December 2014, we paid the second installment payment of

21 billion

yen to the reorganization creditors of the MMJ Companies.  The secured creditors of MAI were paid in full with a portion of the first installment payment made in October 2013, while the unsecured creditors of MAI will recover at least

19%

of the amount of their claims in


installment payments through December 2019.  The remaining portion of the unsecured claims of the creditors of the MMJ Companies not recovered pursuant to the Reorganization Proceedings will be discharged, without payment, through December 2019.

The following table presents the remaining amounts of MMJ Creditor Installment Payments (stated in Japanese yen and U.S. dollars) and the amount of unamortized discount as of

September 3, 2015

:

Pursuant to the terms of the Sponsor Agreement, we entered into a series of agreements with the MMJ Companies, including supply agreements, research and development services agreements, and general services agreements, which are intended to generate operating cash flows to meet the requirements of the MMJ Companies' businesses, including the funding of the MMJ Creditor Installment Payments.

Capital Lease Obligations

In 2015, we recorded capital lease obligations aggregating

$324 million

, including

$291 million

related to equipment sale-leaseback transactions, at a weighted-average effective interest rate of

3.2%

, payable in periodic installments through May 2019.  In 2014, we recorded capital lease obligations aggregating

$121 million

at a weighted-average effective interest rate of

4.6%

, payable in periodic installments through December 2023.

1.258% Notes

On December 20, 2013, we issued

$462 million

in principal amount of the 1.258% Notes.  The 1.258% Notes mature on January 15, 2019 and are collateralized by certain equipment, which had a carrying value of

$95 million

as of

September 3, 2015

.  The principal amount of the 1.258% Notes is payable in


semiannual installments in January and July of each year, commencing in July 2014.  The Export-Import Bank of the United States (the "Ex-Im Bank") guaranteed payment of all regularly scheduled installment payments of principal and interest on the 1.258% Notes.  We paid

$23 million

to Ex-Im Bank for its guarantee upon issuance of the 1.258% Notes.

The 1.258% Notes contain covenants which are customary for financings of this type, including negative covenants that limit or restrict our ability to create liens or dispose of the equipment securing the 1.258% Notes.  Events of default also include, among others, the occurrence of any event or circumstance that, in the reasonable judgment of Ex-Im Bank, is likely materially and adversely to affect our ability to perform any payment obligation, or any of our other material obligations under the indenture, the 1.258% Notes, or under any other related transaction documents to which Ex-Im Bank is a party.


Cash Redemption at Our Option:

At any time prior to the maturity date of the 1.258% Notes, we may redeem the 1.258% Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to the principal amount of the 1.258% Notes to be redeemed plus a make-whole premium as described in the indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest.

Senior Notes

The senior notes above contain covenants that, among other things, limit, in certain circumstances, our ability and/or the ability of our domestic restricted subsidiaries (which are generally subsidiaries in the U.S. in which we own at least

80%

of the voting stock) to (1) create or incur certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions, (2) create, assume, incur, or guarantee certain additional secured indebtedness and unsecured indebtedness of our domestic restricted subsidiaries, and (3) consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets, to another entity.  These covenants are subject to a number of limitations, exceptions, and qualifications.

Cash Redemption at Our Option:

We have the option to redeem these notes.  The applicable redemption price will be determined as follows:

(1)

If we redeem prior to the applicable date, the price is principal plus a make-whole premium equal to the present value of the remaining scheduled interest payments as described in the applicable indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest.

(2)

If we redeem on or after the applicable date, the price is principal plus a premium which declines over time as specified in the applicable indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest.

(3)

If we redeem prior to the applicable date with net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings, the price is equal to the amount specified above, together with accrued and unpaid interest, subject to a maximum redemption of

35%

of the aggregate principal amount of the respective notes being redeemed.

Convertible Senior Notes

Accounting standards for convertible debt instruments that may be fully or partially settled in cash upon conversion require the debt and equity components to be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects a nonconvertible borrowing rate when interest expense is recognized in subsequent periods.  The amount initially recorded as debt is based on the fair value of the debt component as a standalone instrument, determined using an interest rate for similar nonconvertible debt issued by entities with credit ratings similar to ours at the time of issuance.  The difference between the debt recorded at inception and its principal amount is accreted to principal through interest expense over the estimated life of the note.


As of

September 3, 2015

, the trading price of our common stock was higher than the initial conversion prices of our 2032 Notes and our 2033 Notes.  As a result, the conversion values were in excess of principal amounts for such notes.  The following table summarizes our convertible notes outstanding as of

September 3, 2015

:

(1)

The terms of our convertible notes give holders the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a date prior to the contractual maturities of the notes at a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest.

(2)

Holders have the right to convert all or a portion of their notes at a date prior to the contractual maturity if, during any calendar quarter, the closing price of our common stock for at least


trading days in the


consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than

130%

of the conversion price.  The closing price of our common stock exceeded the thresholds for the calendar quarter ended September 30, 2015 for our 2032 Notes and 2033 Notes; therefore, those notes are convertible by the holders through December 31, 2015.

Based on our closing share price of

$16.59

as of

September 3, 2015

Conversion Rights

:  Holders may convert their 2032 Notes under the following circumstances: (1) if the 2032 Notes are called for redemption; (2) during any calendar quarter if the closing price of our common stock for at least


trading days in the


consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than

130%

of the conversion price of the 2032 Notes (approximately

$12.52

per share for the 2032C Notes and

$12.97

per share for the 2032D Notes); (3) if the trading price of the 2032 Notes is less than

98%

of the product of the closing price of our common stock and the conversion rate of the 2032 Notes during the periods specified in the indenture; (4) if specified distributions or corporate events occur, as set forth in the indenture for the 2032 Notes; or (5) at any time after February 1, 2032.

We have the option to pay cash, issue shares of common stock or any combination thereof for the aggregate amount due upon conversion.  It is our intent to settle the principal amount of the 2032 Notes in cash upon any conversion.  As a result,  only the amounts payable in excess of the principal amounts upon conversion of the 2032 Notes are considered in diluted earnings per share under the treasury stock method.

Cash Redemption at Our Option

:  We may redeem for cash the 2032C Notes on or after May 1, 2016 and the 2032D Notes on or after May 1, 2017 if the volume weighted average price of our common stock has been at least

130%

of the conversion price for at least


trading days during any


consecutive trading day period.  The redemption price will equal the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.  If we redeem the 2032C Notes prior to May 4, 2019, or the 2032D Notes prior to May 4, 2021, we will also pay a make-whole premium in cash equal to the present value of all remaining scheduled payments of interest from the redemption date to May 4, 2019 for the 2032C Notes, or to May 4, 2021 for the 2032D Notes, using a discount rate equal to

1.5%

.

Cash Repurchase at the Option of the Holder

Upon a change in control or a termination of trading, as defined in the indenture, holders of the 2032 Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their 2032 Notes at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

2033E and 2033F Notes:

On February 12, 2013, we issued

$300 million

of the 2033E Notes and

$300 million

of the 2033F Notes.  The initial conversion rate for the 2033 Notes is

91.4808

shares of common stock per

$1,000

principal amount, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately

$10.93

per share of common stock.  Interest is payable in February and August of each year.  During 2015, holders converted

$7 million

of aggregate principal amounts of the 2033E Notes, and we elected to settle the amounts due upon conversion entirely in cash.  During 2015, we repurchased

$60 million

of aggregate principal amounts of the 2033E Notes and

$3 million

of aggregate principal amounts of the 2033F Notes, for cash.

Conversion Rights

:  Holders may convert their 2033 Notes under the following circumstances: (1) if the 2033 Notes are called for redemption; (2) during any calendar quarter if the closing price of our common stock for at least


trading days in the


consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than

130%

of the conversion price of the 2033 Notes (approximately

$14.21

per share); (3) if the trading price of the 2033 Notes is less than

98%

of the product of the closing price of our common stock and the conversion rate of the 2033 Notes during the periods specified in the indenture; (4) if specified distributions or corporate events occur, as set forth in the indenture for the 2033 Notes; or (5) at any time after November 15, 2032.


Upon conversion, we will pay cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount and the conversion value of the notes being converted and cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our option, for any remaining conversion obligation.  As a result, only the amounts payable in excess of the principal amounts upon conversion of the 2033 Notes are considered in diluted earnings per share under the treasury stock method.

Cash Redemption at Our Option

:

We may redeem for cash the 2033E Notes on or after February 20, 2018 and the 2033F Notes on or after February 20, 2020 at a price equal the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

2043G Notes:

On November 12, 2013, we issued

$1.03 billion

principal amount of the 2043G Notes in exchange for

$440 million

in aggregate principal amount of our 2027 Notes, 2031A Notes, and 2031B Notes.  Each

$1,000

of principal amount at maturity had an original issue price of

$800

.  An amount equal to the difference between the original issue price and the principal amount at maturity will accrete in accordance with a schedule set forth in the indenture.  The original principal amount of

$820 million

accretes up to

$1.03 billion

at maturity in 2043.  The initial conversion rate for the 2043G Notes is

34.2936

shares of common stock per

$1,000

principal amount at maturity, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately

$29.16

per share of common stock.  Interest is payable in May and November of each year.

Conversion Rights

:

Holders may convert their 2043G Notes under the following circumstances: (1) if the 2043G Notes are called for redemption; (2) during any calendar quarter if the closing price of our common stock for at least

We have the option to pay cash, issue shares of common stock or any combination thereof, for the aggregate amount due upon conversion.  It is our current intent to settle in cash the principal amount of the 2043G Notes upon conversion.  As a result, the dilutive effect of the 2043G Notes in earnings per share is computed under the treasury stock method.

Cash Redemption at Our Option

:

Prior to November 20, 2018, we may redeem for cash the 2043G Notes if the volume weighted average price of our common stock has been at least

130%

of the conversion price for at least


trading days during any


consecutive trading day period.  The redemption price will equal the principal amount at maturity plus accrued and unpaid interest.  On or after November 20, 2018, we may redeem for cash the 2043G Notes without regard to the closing price of our common stock at a price equal the accreted principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.  If we redeem the 2043G Notes prior to November 20, 2018, we are required to pay in cash a make-whole premium as specified in the indenture.

Cash Repurchase at the Option of the Holder

$917 million

plus accrued and unpaid interest.  Holders of the 2043G Notes may also require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their 2043G Notes at a price equal to the accreted principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon a change in control or a termination of trading, as defined in the indenture.


Other Facilities

Revolving Credit Facilities:

On February 12, 2015, we terminated our unused

$255 million

senior

three

-year revolving credit facility and entered into a senior

five

-year revolving credit facility.  Under this credit facility, we can draw up to the lesser of

$750 million

or

80%

of the net outstanding balance of certain trade receivables, as defined in the facility agreement.  Any amounts drawn are collateralized by a security interest in such trade receivables.  The credit facility contains customary covenants and conditions, including as a funding condition the absence of any event or circumstance that has a material adverse effect on certain of our operations, assets, prospects, business, or condition, and including negative covenants that limit or restrict our ability to create liens on, or dispose of, the collateral underlying the obligations under this facility.  Interest is payable on any outstanding principal balance at a variable rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus an applicable margin ranging between

1.75%

to

2.25%

, depending upon the utilized portion of the facility.  On April 16, 2015, we drew

$75 million

under this facility at an interest rate equal to

2.15%

per annum.  As of

September 3, 2015

,

$75 million

of principal was outstanding under this facility and

$572 million

was available for us to draw.

On December 2, 2014, we terminated our unused

$153 million

senior

three

-year revolving credit facility and entered into a senior

five

-year revolving credit facility, collateralized by a security interest in certain trade receivables and inventory.  The new credit facility has an aggregate revolving commitment which is subject to certain adjustments, including an availability block that effectively limits the maximum amount we could draw to

$540 million

.  Additionally, the maximum amount we could draw may decrease further if the value, as defined, of our trade receivables and inventory collateralizing the credit facility decreases below a specified threshold.  The credit facility contains customary covenants and conditions, including as a funding condition the absence of any event or circumstance that has a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.  Generally, interest is payable on any outstanding principal balance at a variable rate not to exceed LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging between

1.25%

to

1.75%

, depending upon the utilized portion of the facility.  On April 16, 2015, we drew

$50 million

under this facility at an interest rate equal to

1.65%

per annum.  As of

September 3, 2015

,

$50 million

of principal was outstanding under this facility and

$270 million

was available for us to draw.

Other Facilities

:

On April 14, 2015, our IMFT joint venture entered into a commitment letter and progress payment agreement to obtain up to

$275 million

of financing collateralized by semiconductor production equipment.  The facility was terminated in September 2015 and not utilized.

On May 28, 2015, we entered into a term loan agreement to obtain financing collateralized by certain property, plant, and equipment.  Subject to customary conditions, we can draw up to

6.90 billion

New Taiwan dollars or an equivalent amount in U.S. dollars (approximately

$213 million

as of

September 3, 2015

).  On June 18, 2015, we drew

$40 million

under this arrangement.  Subsequent draws must occur by December 18, 2015.  Amounts drawn will be made subject to a

three

-year loan, with equal quarterly principal payments beginning

six

months after the initial draw.  Amounts drawn in New Taiwan dollars will accrue interest at a variable rate equal to the

three

-month Taipei Interbank Offered Rate ("TAIBOR") plus a margin not to exceed

2.0%

.  Amounts drawn in U.S. dollars will accrue interest at a variable rate equal to the

three

-month LIBOR plus a margin not to exceed

2.2%

.  As of

September 3, 2015

, the outstanding balance was

$40 million

.

On March 13, 2015, we borrowed

$47 million

under a

two

-year note, collateralized by certain property, plant, and equipment.  The note is payable in equal quarterly installments, plus interest at a variable rate equal to the


-day TAIBOR plus

1.65%

per annum.  As of

September 3, 2015

, the outstanding balance was

$40 million

During 2015, we repaid, prior to their scheduled maturities, an aggregate of

$159 million

to close certain other notes payable with a weighted-average annual interest rate of

2.44%

and repaid, according to the scheduled payment terms, another note payable of

$127 million

, which amount represented the present value of monthly installment payments for the acquisition of an additional

9.9%

interest in MMT.


Maturities of Notes Payable and Future Minimum Lease Payments

As of

September 3, 2015

, maturities of notes payable (including the MMJ Creditor Installment Payments) and future minimum lease payments under capital lease obligations were as follows:

Retrospective Application of a New Accounting Standard

Effective in the fourth quarter of 2015, we adopted ASU 2015-03

– Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.

ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, as appropriate, consistent with debt discounts, as opposed to an asset.  The new accounting standard required retrospective application; therefore, our financial statements and notes to these statements contained herein have been adjusted to reflect the impact of adopting this new accounting standard.  The following table sets forth the financial statement line items affected by retrospective application of this new accounting standard:

Commitments

As of

September 3, 2015

, we had commitments of approximately

$1.62 billion

for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment.  We lease certain facilities and equipment under operating leases.  Total rental expense was

$48 million

,

$57 million

, and

$41 million

for


,


, and


, respectively.  Minimum future operating lease commitments as of

September 3, 2015

were as follows:


Contingencies

We have accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of various asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the applicable balance sheet dates, including those described below.  We are currently a party to other legal actions arising from the normal course of business, none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

Patent Matters

As is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights.

On November 21, 2014, Elm 3DS Innovations, LLC ("Elm") filed a patent infringement action against Micron, Micron Semiconductor Products, Inc., and Micron Consumer Products Group, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware.  On March 27, 2015, Elm filed an amended complaint against the same entities.  The amended complaint alleges that unspecified semiconductor products of ours that incorporate multiple stacked die infringe thirteen U.S. patents and seeks damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs.

On December 15, 2014, Innovative Memory Solutions, Inc. filed a patent infringement action against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware.  The complaint alleges that a variety of our NAND Flash products infringe eight U.S. patents and seeks damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.

Among other things, the above lawsuits pertain to certain of our DDR DRAM, DDR2 DRAM, DDR3 DRAM, DDR4 DRAM, SDR SDRAM, PSRAM, RLDRAM, LPDRAM, NAND Flash, and certain other memory products we manufacture, which account for a significant portion of our net sales.

We are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss.  A determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes.  Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

Qimonda

On January 20, 2011, Dr. Michael Jaffé, administrator for Qimonda insolvency proceedings, filed suit against Micron and Micron Semiconductor B.V., our Netherlands subsidiary ("Micron B.V."), in the District Court of Munich, Civil Chamber.  The complaint seeks to void under Section 133 of the German Insolvency Act a share purchase agreement between Micron B.V. and Qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which Micron B.V. purchased substantially all of Qimonda's shares of Inotera Memories, Inc. (the "Inotera Shares"), representing approximately 55% of our total shares in Inotera as of September 3, 2015, and seeks an order requiring us to re-transfer those shares to the Qimonda estate.  The complaint also seeks, among other things, to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with Inotera and to terminate under Sections 103 or 133 of the German Insolvency Code a patent cross-license between us and Qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement.

Following a series of hearings with pleadings, arguments and witnesses on behalf of the Qimonda estate, on March 13, 2014, the Court issued judgments:  (1) ordering Micron B.V. to pay approximately $1 million in respect of certain Inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase; (2) ordering Micron B.V. to disclose certain information with respect to any Inotera Shares sold by it to third parties; (3) ordering Micron B.V. to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the Inotera Shares, including in particular, any profits distributed on such shares and all other benefits; (4) denying Qimonda’s claims against Micron for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with Inotera; and (5) determining that Qimonda's obligations under the patent cross-license agreement are canceled.  In addition, the Court issued interlocutory judgments ordering, among other things:  (1) that Micron B.V. transfer to the Qimonda estate the Inotera Shares still owned by it and pay to the Qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any Inotera Shares sold to third parties; and (2) that Micron B.V. pay the Qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by it from ownership of the Inotera Shares.  The interlocutory judgments have no immediate, enforceable effect on us, and, accordingly, we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the Inotera Shares subject to further developments in the case.  We have filed a notice of appeal, and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals court.  The next hearing on the matter has not yet been scheduled.


We are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss.  The final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the Inotera Shares or monetary damages, unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by Micron B.V. from the ownership of the Inotera Shares, and/or the termination of the patent cross-license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, or financial condition.  As of September 3, 2015, the Inotera Shares had a carrying value in equity method investments for purposes of our financial reporting of $683 million and a market value of $846 million.

Other

In the normal course of business, we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party.  It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these types of agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.  Historically, our payments under these types of agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

Redeemable Convertible Notes

Under the terms of the indentures governing the 2033 Notes, upon conversion, we would be required to pay cash equal to the lesser amount of (1) the aggregate principal amount or (2) the conversion value of the notes being converted.  To the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, we could pay cash, shares of common stock, or a combination thereof, at our option, for the amount of such excess.  The 2033 Notes were convertible at the option of the holders as of

September 3, 2015

and

August 28, 2014

.  Therefore, the 2033 Notes were classified as current debt and the aggregate difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of

$49 million

as of

September 3, 2015

and

$68 million

as of

August 28, 2014

was classified as redeemable convertible notes in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  (See "Debt" note.)

Equity

Micron Shareholders' Equity

Common Stock Repurchases:

Since the first quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to

$1.25 billion

of our outstanding common stock,

$250 million

of which was authorized in the first quarter of 2016.  Any repurchases under the authorization may be made in open market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, and/or derivative transactions.  Repurchases are subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash.  During 2015, we repurchased

42 million

shares for

$831 million

(including commissions) through open market transactions, which were recorded as treasury stock.

Capped Calls

Issued and Outstanding Capped Calls

:  We have entered into capped calls, which are intended to reduce the effect of potential dilution from our convertible notes.  The capped calls provide for our receipt of cash or shares, at our election, from our counterparties if the trading price of our stock is above a specified initial strike price at the expiration dates.  The amounts receivable varies based on the trading price of our stock, up to specified cap prices.  The dollar value of the cash or shares that we would receive from the capped calls upon their expiration date ranges from

$0

if the trading price of our stock is below the initial strike price for all of the capped calls to

$814 million

if the trading price of our stock is at or above the cap price for all of the capped calls.  We paid

$57 million

in 2011 to purchase the 2031 Capped Calls,

$103 million

in 2012 to purchase the 2032 Capped Calls and

$48 million

in 2013 to purchase the 2033 Capped Calls.  The amounts paid were recorded as charges to additional capital.


The following table presents information related to the issued and outstanding capped calls as of

September 3, 2015

:

(1)

Settlement in cash on the respective expiration dates would result in us receiving an amount ranging from zero, if the market price per share of our common stock is at or below the low strike price, to the maximum amount if the market price per share of our common stock is at or above the high cap price.  If share settlement were elected, the number of shares received would be determined by the value of the capped calls at the time of settlement divided by the share price on the settlement date.  Settlement of the capped calls prior to the expiration dates may be for an amount less than the maximum value at expiration.

Expiration and Unwind of Capped Calls

:  A portion of our 2031 Capped Calls expired in the fourth quarter of 2015.  We elected share settlement and received

3 million

shares of our stock, equivalent to approximately

$50 million

based on the trading stock price at the time of expiration, which were recorded as treasury stock.  In May 2014, we and the counterparties agreed to terminate and unwind a portion of our 2031 Capped Calls.  We elected share settlement and received

3 million

shares of our stock, equivalent to approximately

$86 million

based on the trading stock price at the time of the unwind.  The shares received in May 2014 were retired from treasury stock in 2014.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss):

Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component for the year ended

September 3, 2015

, were as follows:

IMFT:

Since inception in 2006, we have owned

51%

of IMFT, a joint venture between us and Intel to manufacture NAND Flash and 3D XPoint memory products for the exclusive use of the members.  IMFT is governed by a Board of Managers, for which the number of managers appointed by each member varies based on the members' respective ownership interests.  The IMFT joint venture agreement extends through 2024 and includes certain buy-sell rights.  Commencing in January 2015, Intel can put to us, and commencing in January 2018, we can call from Intel, Intel's interest in IMFT, in either case, for an amount equal to the noncontrolling interest balance attributable to Intel at that time.  If Intel elects to sell to us, we can elect to set the closing date of the transaction to be any time within two years following such election by Intel and can elect to receive financing of the purchase price from Intel for one to two years from the closing date.

IMFT manufactures memory products using designs and technology we develop with Intel.  We generally share with Intel the costs of product design and process development activities for NAND Flash memory and 3D XPoint memory.  Our R&D expenses were reduced by reimbursements from Intel of

$224 million

,

$137 million

, and

$127 million

for


,


, and


, respectively.

We sell a portion of our products to Intel through our IMFT joint venture at long-term negotiated prices approximating cost.  Sales of products to Intel under this arrangement were

$420 million

,

$423 million

, and

$387 million

for


,


, and


, respectively.  Receivables from Intel as of

September 3, 2015

and

August 28, 2014

, were

$67 million

and

$66 million

, respectively, for these sales.

The following table presents the assets and liabilities of IMFT included in our consolidated balance sheets:

Amounts exclude intercompany balances that were eliminated in our consolidated balance sheets.

Creditors of IMFT have recourse only to IMFT's assets and do not have recourse to any other of our assets.

The following table presents IMFT's distributions to and contributions from its shareholders:


MP Mask:

In 2006, we formed a joint venture with Photronics to produce photomasks for leading-edge and advanced next generation semiconductors.  On March 24, 2015, we notified Photronics of our election to terminate MP Mask effective in May 2016.  Upon termination, we have the right to acquire Photronics' interest in MP Mask for an amount equal to the noncontrolling interest balance.  Since its inception, we and Photronics have each owned approximately

50%

of MP Mask.  We purchase a substantial majority of the photomasks produced by MP Mask pursuant to a supply arrangement.

The assets and liabilities of MP Mask included in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows:

Amounts exclude intercompany balances that were eliminated in our consolidated balance sheets.

Creditors of MP Mask have recourse only to MP Mask's assets and do not have recourse to any other of our assets.

MMT:

As of August 29, 2013, noncontrolling interests in MMT were

11%

.  In 2014, we purchased additional interests in MMT for an aggregate of

$146 million

, and as of August 28, 2014, noncontrolling interests in MMT were less than 1%.  Substantially all of the MMT shares purchased in 2014 were financed with a short-term loan from a seller.  As a result of the purchases of MMT shares in 2014, in aggregate, noncontrolling interests decreased by

$180 million

and additional capital increased by

$34 million

.

Restrictions on Net Assets

As a result of the reorganization proceedings of the MMJ Companies initiated on March 23, 2012, and for so long as such proceedings continue, the MMJ Group is subject to certain restrictions on dividends, loans, and advances.  In addition, our ability to access IMFT's cash and other assets through dividends, loans, or advances, including to finance our other operations, is subject to agreement by Intel.  As a result, our total restricted net assets (net assets less intercompany balances and noncontrolling interests) as of

September 3, 2015

were

$3.35 billion

for the MMJ Group and

$911 million

for IMFT, which included cash and equivalents of

$748 million

for the MMJ Group and

$134 million

for IMFT.  (See "Micron Memory Japan, Inc." note and "IMFT" above.)

As of

September 3, 2015

, our retained earnings included undistributed earnings from our equity method investees of

$232 million

.

Fair Value Measurements

Accounting standards establish three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (referred to as Level 1), inputs other than Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly (referred to as Level 2), and unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities (referred to as Level 3).

All of our marketable debt and equity investments (excluding equity method investments) were classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value.  In addition to the fair value measurements disclosed in the "Cash and Investments" note, as of

September 3, 2015

and

August 28, 2014

, we had certificates of deposit classified as restricted cash (included in other noncurrent assets) of

$45 million

and

$27 million

, respectively, valued using Level 2 fair value measurements.

In connection with our repurchases of debt in 2015, 2014, and 2013, we determined the fair value of the debt components of our convertible notes as if they were stand-alone instruments, using interest rates for similar nonconvertible debt issued by entities with credit ratings comparable to ours (Level 2).


Amounts reported as cash and equivalents, receivables, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value.  The estimated fair value and carrying value of debt instruments (carrying value excludes the equity and mezzanine equity components of our convertible notes) were as follows:

The fair values of our convertible notes were determined based on inputs that were observable in the market or that could be derived from, or corroborated with, observable market data, including the trading price of our convertible notes when available, our stock price, and interest rates based on similar debt issued by parties with credit ratings similar to ours (Level 2).  The fair value of our other debt instruments was estimated based on discounted cash flows using inputs that were observable in the market or that could be derived from, or corroborated with, observable market data, including the trading price of our notes, when available, and interest rates based on similar debt issued by parties with credit ratings similar to ours (Level 2).

In connection with our restructure and asset impairment charges in 2014 and 2013, the fair value of our


mm wafer fabrication equipment in Kiryat Gat, Israel was determined primarily based on the expected proceeds from the sale and the fair value of a supply agreement to manufacture NOR flash memory at the facility (Level 3).  The fair values of our MIT assets and our Light-emitting Diode ("LED") production assets were based on quotations obtained from equipment dealers, which consider the remaining useful life and configuration of the equipment (Level 3).  (See "Restructure and Asset Impairments" note.)

Derivative Instruments

We use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  We have also had convertible note settlement obligations which were accounted for as derivative instruments as a result of our elections to settle conversions in cash.  We do not use derivative instruments for speculative purpose.

Derivative Instruments without Hedge Accounting Designation

Currency Derivatives:

We use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities.  Our primary objective for entering into currency derivatives is to reduce the volatility that changes in currency exchange rates have on our earnings.

To hedge our exposures to monetary assets and liabilities, we generally utilize a rolling hedge strategy with currency forward contracts that mature within


days.  At the end of each reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured in U.S. dollars and the associated outstanding forward contracts are marked-to-market.  Currency forward contracts are valued at fair values based on the middle of bid and ask prices of dealers or exchange quotations (Level 2 fair value measurements).  In connection with the currency exchange rate risk associated with the MMJ Acquisition in July 2013, we entered into currency exchange transactions (the "MMJ Acquisition Hedges"). The MMJ Acquisition Hedges were not designated for hedge accounting and were remeasured at fair value each period.  We recorded losses from the MMJ Acquisition Hedges of

$228 million

in 2013.  To mitigate the risk of the yen strengthening against the U.S. dollar on the MMJ creditor installment payments due in December 2014 and December 2015, we entered into forward contracts to purchase

20 billion

yen on November 28, 2014 and

10 billion

yen on November 27, 2015.  In the first quarter of 2015, we paid

$33 million

to settle the

20 billion

yen forward contracts.

Realized and unrealized gains and losses on currency derivatives without hedge accounting designation as well as the change in the underlying monetary assets and liabilities due to changes in currency exchange rates are included in other non-operating income (expense), net.


Convertible Notes Settlement Obligations:

During 2015, holders elected to convert a portion of our 2033E Notes.  In 2014, holders elected to convert substantially all of our remaining 2014 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2031A Notes, and 2031B Notes.  As a result of our elections to settle the amounts due upon conversion in cash, each of the settlement obligations became derivative debt liabilities subject to mark-to-market accounting treatment for a period of approximately


days, beginning on the dates we notified the holder of our intention to settle the obligation in cash through the settlement dates.  The fair values of the underlying derivative settlement obligations were initially determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation model (Level 2 fair value measurements).  The Black-Scholes model requires the input of assumptions, including the stock price, expected stock-price volatility, estimated option life, risk-free interest rate, and dividend rate.  The subsequent measurements and final settlement amounts of our convertible note settlement obligations were based on the volume-weighted average stock price (Level 2 fair value measurements).  Changes in fair values of the derivative settlement obligations were included in other non-operating income (expense), net.

Total notional amounts and gross fair values for derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation were as follows:

(1)

Notional amounts of forward contracts in U.S. dollars and convertible notes settlement obligations in shares.

(2)

Included in receivables – other.

(3)

Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses – other for forward contracts and in current debt for convertible notes settlement obligations.

(4)

Included in other noncurrent liabilities.

Net gains (losses) for derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation were included in other non-operating income (expense), net as follows:


Derivative Instruments with Cash Flow Hedge Accounting Designation

Currency Derivatives:

We utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within


months to hedge our exposure to changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures.  Currency forward contracts are measured at fair value based on market-based observable inputs including currency exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate, and credit risk spread (Level 2 fair value measurements).

For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the realized and unrealized gain or loss on the derivatives is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified into earnings in the same line items of the consolidated statements of operations and in the same periods in which the underlying transactions affect earnings.  The ineffective or excluded portion of the realized and unrealized gain or loss is included in other non-operating income (expense), net.  Total notional amounts and gross fair values for derivative instruments with cash flow hedge accounting designation were as follows:

(1)

Included in receivables – other.

(2)

Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses – other.

For


,


, and 2013, we recognized losses of

$10 million

,

$4 million

, and

$8 million

, respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from the effective portion of cash flow hedges.  The ineffective and excluded portions of cash flow hedges recognized in other non-operating income (expense) were not significant in 2015, 2014, or 2013.  For


,


, and 2013, we reclassified gains of

$6 million

,

$4 million

, and

$1 million

, respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings.  As of

September 3, 2015

,

$3 million

of net gains from cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months.

Derivative Counterparty Credit Risk and Master Netting Arrangements

Our derivative instruments expose us to credit risk to the extent counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the contracts.  Our maximum exposure to loss due to credit risk if counterparties fail completely to perform according to the terms of the contracts would generally equal the fair value of assets for these contracts as listed in the tables above.  We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading risk across multiple financial institutions.

We enter into master netting arrangements with our counterparties to mitigate credit risk in derivative hedge transactions.  These master netting arrangements allow us and our counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other.  Derivative assets and liabilities that can be net settled with each counterparty under these arrangements have been presented in our consolidated balance sheets on a net basis.  As of

September 3, 2015

and

August 28, 2014

, amounts netted were not significant.


Equity Plans

As of

September 3, 2015

, our equity plans permit us to issue an aggregate of up to

170 million

shares of common stock, of which

112 million

shares were available for future awards.  Awards are subject to terms and conditions as determined by our Board of Directors.

Stock Options

Our stock options are generally exercisable in increments of either one-fourth or one-third per year beginning one year from the date of grant.  Stock options issued after February 2014 generally expire

eight

years from the date of grant.  Options issued prior to February 2014 generally expire

six

years from the date of grant.

Option activity for


is summarized as follows:

The total intrinsic value was

$229 million

,

$421 million

, and

$103 million

for options exercised during


,


, and


, respectively.

Stock options granted and assumptions used in the

Black-Scholes

option valuation model were as follows:

The expected volatilities utilized were based on implied volatilities from traded options on our stock and on our historical volatility.  The expected lives of options granted were based, in part, on historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the options.  The risk-free interest rates utilized were based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at each grant date.

No

dividends were assumed in estimated option values.


Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units ("Restricted Stock Awards")

As of

September 3, 2015

, there were

14 million

shares of Restricted Stock Awards outstanding, of which

1 million

were performance-based or market-based Restricted Stock Awards.  For service-based Restricted Stock Awards, restrictions generally lapse in one-fourth increments during each year of employment after the grant date.  Vesting for performance-based awards is contingent upon meeting a specified return on assets ("ROA"), as defined, over a

three

-year performance period and vesting for market-based Restricted Stock Awards is contingent upon achieving total shareholder return ("TSR") relative to the companies included in the S&P 500 over a

three

-year performance period.  At the end of the performance period, the number of actual shares to be awarded varies between

0%

and

200%

of target amounts, depending upon the achievement level of the specified ROA or TSR.  Restricted Stock Awards activity for


is summarized as follows:

Stock-based Compensation Expense

Stock-based compensation expense of

$9 million

and

$9 million

was capitalized and remained in inventory as of

September 3, 2015

and

August 28, 2014

, respectively.  As of

September 3, 2015

,

$384 million

of total unrecognized compensation costs for unvested awards, net of estimated forfeitures, was expected to be recognized through the

fourth quarter of 2019

, resulting in a weighted-average period of

1.3

years.  Stock-based compensation expense in the above presentation does not reflect any significant income tax benefits, which is consistent with our treatment of income or loss from our U.S. operations.


Employee Benefit Plans

We have employee retirement plans at our U.S. and international sites.  Details of the more significant plans are discussed as follows:

Employee Savings Plan for U.S. Employees

We have 401(k) retirement plans under which U.S. employees may contribute up to

75%

of their eligible pay (subject to IRS annual contribution limits) to various savings alternatives, none of which include direct investment in our stock.  We match in cash eligible contributions from employees up to

5%

of the employee's annual eligible earnings.  Contribution expense for the 401(k) plans was

$55 million

,

$44 million

, and

$41 million

in


,


, and


, respectively.

Retirement Plans

We have pension plans in various countries.  The pension plans are only available to local employees and are generally government mandated.  As of

September 3, 2015

, the projected benefit obligations of our plans was

$132 million

and plan assets were

$105 million

.  As of

August 28, 2014

, the projected benefit obligations of our plans was

$164 million

and plan assets were

$90 million

.  Pension expense was not significant for


,


, or


.

Restructure and Asset Impairments

In order to optimize operations, improve efficiency, and increase our focus on our core memory operations, we have entered into various restructure activities.  For 2014, our MBU and EBU operating segments recorded restructure and asset impairment charges of

$21 million

and

$20 million

, respectively.  For 2013, restructure and asset impairment charges of

$20 million

,

$14 million

,

$12 million

, and

$12 million

were recognized by our SBU, EBU, MBU, and CNBU operating segments, respectively.  The remaining restructure and asset impairment charges were recognized by our other segments that do not meet the thresholds of a reportable segment.  As of

September 3, 2015

, we do not anticipate incurring any significant additional costs for these restructure activities.

For 2014 and 2013, other restructure included charges associated with workforce optimization activities and with our efforts to wind down our


mm operations primarily in Agrate, Italy and Kiryat Gat, Israel.

For 2013, we also recognized charges of

$33 million

primarily to impair certain production assets used in the development of LED technology,

$62 million

to impair the assets of MIT, a wholly-owned subsidiary, to their estimated fair values in connection with the sale of MIT to LFoundry, and

$26 million

in connection with the restructure of a consortium agreement with ST, whereby certain assets and approximately


employees from our Agrate, Italy fabrication facility were transferred to ST.  For 2013, we also recognized a gain of

$25 million

related to the termination of a lease with Transform Solar Pty Ltd. ("Transform"), an equity method investee, to a portion of our manufacturing facilities in Boise, Idaho.


Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net

In December 2013, we settled all pending litigation between us and Rambus, Inc., including all antitrust and patent matters.  We also entered into a

seven

-year term patent cross-license agreement with Rambus, Inc. that allows us to avoid costs of patent-related litigation during the term.  The primary benefits we received from these arrangements were (1) the settlement and termination of all existing litigation, (2) the avoidance of future litigation expenses and (3) the avoidance of future management and customer disruptions.  As a result, other operating expense for 2014 included a

$233 million

charge to accrue a liability, which reflects the discounted value of amounts due under this arrangement.

Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net


Income Taxes

Income tax (provision) benefit computed using the U.S. federal statutory rate reconciled to income tax (provision) benefit was as follows:

We operate in tax jurisdictions, including Singapore and Taiwan, where our earnings are indefinitely reinvested and are taxed at lower effective tax rates than the U.S. statutory rate.  We operate in a number of locations outside the U.S., including Singapore and, to a lesser extent, Taiwan, where we have tax incentive agreements that are, in part, conditional upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds.  The effect of tax incentive arrangements, which expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2030, reduced our tax provision for


,


, and


by

$338 million

(benefitting our diluted earnings per share by

$0.29

),

$286 million

(

$0.24

per diluted share), and

$141 million

(

$0.13

per diluted share), respectively.


Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes as well as carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following:

As of

September 3, 2015

, we had a valuation allowance of

$1.16 billion

against substantially all U.S. net deferred tax assets, primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards.  The valuation allowance is based on our assessment of the deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.  As of

September 3, 2015

, we had partial valuation allowances of

$710 million

for Japan and

$177 million

for our other foreign subsidiaries against net deferred tax assets, primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards.  As of

September 3, 2015

, we had $3.81 billion of net operating loss carryforwards in Japan of which

$2.19 billion

is subject to a valuation allowance.  Our valuation allowance decreased

$392 million

in


primarily due to the utilization of U.S. and foreign net operating losses as well as adjustments based on management's assessment of the amount of foreign net operating losses that are more likely than not to be realized.

We have a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset associated with our U.S. operations.  Management continues to evaluate future projected financial performance to determine whether such performance is sufficient evidence to support a reduction in or reversal of the valuation allowances.  The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if significant positive evidence increases.  Income taxes on U.S. operations for 2015 and 2014 were substantially offset by changes in the valuation allowance.


As of

September 3, 2015

, our federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforward amounts and expiration periods as reported to tax authorities, were as follows:

As of

September 3, 2015

, our federal and state tax credit carryforward amounts and expiration periods as reported to tax authorities, were as follows:

We have not recognized deferred tax assets of

$307 million

for excess tax benefits that arose directly from tax deductions related to equity compensation greater than amounts recognized for financial reporting.  These excess stock compensation benefits will be credited to additional capital if realized.  We use the "with and without" method, as described in ASC 740, for purposes of determining when excess tax benefits have been realized.

Provision has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that dividend payments from such companies are expected to result in additional tax liabilities.  Remaining undistributed earnings of

$6.96 billion

as of

September 3, 2015

have been indefinitely reinvested; therefore, no provision has been made for taxes due on approximately

$8.52 billion

of the excess of the financial reporting amount over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested.  Generally, this amount becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from the subsidiary or a sale or liquidation of the subsidiary.  Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries is not practicable.

Below is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits:


Included in the unrecognized tax benefits balance as of

September 3, 2015

,

August 28, 2014

, and

August 29, 2013

were

$53 million

,

$66 million

, and

$63 million

, respectively, of unrecognized income tax benefits, which if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.  The increase in unrecognized tax benefits in


primarily related to transfer pricing and other matters which were substantially offset by changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance.  We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters within income tax expense.  As of

September 3, 2015

,

August 28, 2014

, and

August 29, 2013

, the amount accrued for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions was

$16 million

,

$19 million

, and

$16 million

, respectively.  The resolution of tax audits or lapses of statute of limitations could also reduce our unrecognized tax benefits.  Although the timing of final resolution is uncertain, the estimated potential reduction in our unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months ranges from

$0

to

$67 million

, including interest and penalties.

We and our subsidiaries file income tax returns with the U.S. federal government, various U.S. states and various foreign jurisdictions throughout the world.  Our U.S. federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2011 through 2015.  In addition, tax returns open to examination in multiple foreign taxing jurisdictions range from the years 2007 to 2015.  We believe that adequate amounts of taxes and related interest and penalties have been provided for, and any adjustments as a result of examinations are not expected to materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Earnings Per Share

Listed below are the potential common shares, as of the end of the periods shown, that could dilute basic earnings per share in the future that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because to do so would have been antidilutive:

O

ur 2033 Notes and, to the extent our 2027 Notes and 2031 Notes were outstanding during the periods presented, contain terms that upon conversion require us to settle the aggregate principal amount in cash and the remainder of our conversion obligation amount in either shares of our common stock or cash, at our election.  Our 2032 Notes and 2043 Notes, and, to the extent our 2014 Notes were outstanding during the periods presented, contain terms that upon conversion provide us the option to pay cash, issue shares of common stock, or any combination thereof for the aggregate amount due.  It is our current intent to settle the principal amount of our 2032 Notes and 2043 Notes in cash upon conversion.  As a result of these conversion terms and stated intent, the shares underlying the 2014 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2031 Notes, 2032 Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2043 Notes were considered in diluted earnings per share for the periods they were outstanding under the treasury stock method.  (See "Debt" note.)


Segment Information

Segment information reported herein is consistent with how it is reviewed and evaluated by our chief operating decision maker.  We have the following

four

business units, which are our reportable segments:

Compute and Networking Business Unit ("CNBU"):

Includes memory products sold into compute, networking, graphics, and cloud server markets.

Mobile Business Unit ("MBU"):

Includes memory products sold into smartphone, tablet, and other mobile-device markets.

Storage Business Unit ("SBU"):

Includes memory products sold into enterprise, client, cloud, and removable storage markets.  SBU also includes products sold to Intel through our IMFT joint venture.

Embedded Business Unit ("EBU"):

Includes memory products sold into automotive, industrial, connected home, and consumer electronics markets.

Certain operating expenses directly associated with the activities of a specific segment are charged to that segment.  Other indirect operating expenses (income) are generally allocated to segments based on their respective percentage of cost of goods sold or forecasted wafer production.  The unallocated amount of operating expense for 2014 related to the Rambus settlement.

We do not identify or report internally our assets or capital expenditures by segment, nor do we allocate gains and losses from equity method investments, interest, other non-operating income or expense items, or taxes to segments.  There are no differences in the accounting policies for segment reporting and our consolidated results of operations.

Depreciation and amortization expense was as follows:


Product Sales

Non-Volatile Memory includes NAND Flash and 3D XPoint memory.  Through 2015, substantially all of our Non-Volatile Memory sales were from NAND Flash products.  Sales of NOR Flash products are included in Other.  Information regarding our MCP products, which combine both NAND Flash and DRAM components, is reported within Non-Volatile Memory.

Certain Concentrations

Markets with concentrations of net sales were approximately as follows:

Customer concentrations included net sales to Kingston of

11%

for 2015 and

10%

for 2014, net sales to Intel of

10%

for 2013, and net sales to HP of

10%

for 2013.  Substantially all of our sales to Kingston were included in our CNBU and SBU segments, substantially all of our sales to Intel were included in our SBU segment, and substantially all of our sales to HP were included in our CNBU and SBU segments.

Certain of the raw materials and production equipment we use in manufacturing semiconductor products are available from multiple sources and in sufficient supply; however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and production equipment that meet our standards.  In some cases, materials are provided by a single supplier.

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, fixed-rate debt securities, trade receivables, and derivative contracts.  We invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and, by policy, generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single obligor.  A concentration of credit risk may exist with respect to receivables as a substantial portion of our customers are affiliated with the computing industry.  We perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers worldwide and generally do not require collateral from our customers.  Historically, we have not experienced significant losses on receivables.  A concentration of risk may also exist with respect to derivatives as the number of counterparties to our currency hedges is limited and the notional amounts are relatively large.  We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and through entering into master netting arrangements.  Capped calls expose us to credit risk to the extent the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements.  We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading the risk across several major financial institutions.  In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Micron Technology, Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 8 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Micron Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries at September 3, 2015 and August 28, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 3, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 8 present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 3, 2015, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

None.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decision regarding disclosure.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in "Internal Control – Integrated Framework" (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

September 3, 2015

.  The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

September 3, 2015

has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.

Basis of Presentation

Micron, a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in 1978.  Micron is the parent company of its consolidated subsidiaries and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is a global leader in advanced semiconductor systems.

These condensed financial statements have been prepared on a parent-only basis.  Under this parent-only presentation, Micron's investments in its consolidated subsidiaries are presented under the equity method of accounting.  In accordance with Rule 12-04 of Regulation S-X, these parent-only financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the United States for annual financial statements.  Because these parent-only financial statements and notes do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP in the U.S. for annual financial statements, these parent-only financial statements and other information included should be read in conjunction with Micron's audited Consolidated Financial Statements contained within Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for the year ended

September 3, 2015

.

Effective in the fourth quarter of 2015, Micron adopted ASU 2015-03

– Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.

ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, as appropriate, consistent with debt discounts, as opposed to an asset.  The new accounting standard required retrospective application; therefore, Micron's financial statements and notes to those statements contained herein have been adjusted to reflect the impact of adopting this new accounting standard.

Debt

(1)

Micron has either the obligation or the option to pay cash for the principal amount due upon conversion for all of its convertible notes.  Micron's current intent is to settle in cash the principal amount of all of its convertible notes upon conversion.

(2)

Weighted-average imputed rate of

4.5%

and

4.7%

as of

September 3, 2015

and

August 28, 2014

, respectively.


(3)

Amount recorded for 2014 included the debt and equity components.  The equity component was reclassified to a debt liability as a result of Micron's obligation to settle the conversions of the 2031B Notes in cash.

(4)

Since the closing price of Micron's common stock for at least


trading days in the


trading day period ending on June 30, 2015 exceeded

130%

of the initial conversion price per share, holders have the right to convert their notes at any time during the calendar quarter ended September 30, 2015.  The closing price of Micron's common stock also exceeded the thresholds for the calendar quarter ended September 30, 2015; therefore, these notes are convertible by the holders through December 31, 2015.  The 2033 Notes are classified as current because the terms of these notes require us to pay cash for the principal amount of any converted notes.

Micron's convertible and senior notes are unsecured obligations that rank equally in right of payment with all of Micron's other existing and future unsecured indebtedness, and are effectively subordinated to all of Micron's other existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.  The convertible notes and the 2022 Notes, 2023 Notes, 2024 Notes, 2025 Notes, and 2026 Notes of Micron are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of its subsidiaries, including trade payables.  Micron guarantees certain debt obligations of its subsidiaries.  Micron does not guarantee the MMJ creditor installment payments.  As of

September 3, 2015

, Micron had guaranteed

$655 million

of debt obligations of its subsidiaries.  Micron's guarantees of its subsidiary debt obligations are unsecured obligations ranking equally in right of payment with all of its other existing and future unsecured indebtedness.

Capital Lease Obligations

Micron has various capital lease obligations due in periodic installments with a weighted-average remaining term of


year.  As of

September 3, 2015

and

August 28, 2014

, Micron had production equipment with carrying values of

$140 million

and

$305 million

, respectively, under capital leases.

Convertible Senior Notes and Other Senior Notes

For further information, see "Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Debt" of Micron's consolidated financial statements.

Other Facilities

Micron has a credit facility with an aggregate revolving commitment which is subject to certain adjustments, including an availability block that effectively limits the maximum amount Micron could draw to

$540 million

.  As of

September 3, 2015

,

$50 million

of principal was outstanding under this facility and

$270 million

was available for Micron to draw.  For further information, see "Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Debt – Other Facilities – Revolving Credit Facilities" of Micron's consolidated financial statements.

Maturities of Notes Payable and Future Minimum Lease Payments

As of

September 3, 2015

, maturities of notes payable and future minimum lease payments under capital lease obligations were as follows:


Commitments

Micron has provided various financial guarantees issued in the normal course of business on behalf of its subsidiaries.  These contracts include debt guarantees and guarantees on certain banking facilities.  Micron enters into these arrangements to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties by enhancing the value of the transaction to the third party.  Micron has entered into agreements covering certain activities of its subsidiaries, and occasionally Micron may be required to perform under such agreements on behalf of its subsidiaries.

As of

September 3, 2015

, the maximum potential amount of future payments Micron could have been required to make under its debt guarantees was approximately

$655 million

.  Substantially all of this amount relates to guarantees for debt of wholly-owned entities whereby Micron would be obligated to perform under the guarantee if a subsidiary were to default on the terms of their debt arrangements.  In the event of performance under the guarantee, Micron would be permitted to seek reimbursement from the subsidiary company(s) through liquidation of the assets which were collateral under various debt instruments.  At the time these contracts were entered into, the collateralized assets approximated the value of the outstanding guarantees.  The majority of these guarantees expire at various times between

March 2016

and

February 2020

.  Micron guarantees a credit facility of a subsidiary that provides for up to

$750 million

of financing.  As of

September 3, 2015

,

$75 million

of principal amount was outstanding under this facility.

Micron guarantees certain banking facilities for its wholly-owned consolidated entities.  Substantially all of these guarantees relate to bank overdraft protections.  The maximum potential amount of future payments Micron could be required to make under these guarantees varies based on the extent of potential overdrafts.  Micron's business processes substantially mitigate the risk of wholly-owned subsidiaries overdrafting their bank accounts.  The majority of these guarantees have no contractual expiration.

Contingencies

As is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that Micron and its subsidiaries' products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights.  Micron has accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of various asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date.  Micron is currently a party to various litigation regarding patent, commercial, and other matters.  Micron is a party to the matters listed in the "Contingencies" note in the consolidated financial statements.  For further information, see "Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Contingencies" of Micron's consolidated financial statements.

Redeemable Convertible Notes

For further information, see "Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Redeemable Convertible Notes" of Micron's consolidated financial statements.

Related Party Transactions

Substantially all of Micron's activities relate to manufacturing services performed for a subsidiary and to royalties received from its subsidiaries for use of product and process technology.  Micron's net sales to consolidated subsidiaries were

$5.42 billion

,

$5.64 billion

, and

$4.19 billion

for


,


, and


, respectively.  Gross margins on manufacturing activities are commensurate with market rates for such services.  Transactions between Micron and its consolidated subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation.

Micron engages in various transactions with its equity method investees and eliminates the profits or losses on those transactions to the extent of its ownership interest until such time as the profits or losses are realized.  Micron held an equity interest in Aptina through August 15, 2014.  Net sales for


and


included

$43 million

and

$182 million

, respectively, from products sold to and services performed for Aptina.


On August 15, 2014, ON Semiconductor Corporation acquired Aptina for approximately

$433 million

and Micron recognized a non-operating gain of

$119 million

on the sale of its shares based on its diluted ownership interest of approximately

27%

.  The gain approximated Micron's share of the consideration because the carrying value of its investment had been reduced to

zero

since the second quarter of 2012, at which time Micron ceased recognizing its proportionate share of Aptina's losses.  For further information regarding transactions between Micron and its equity method investees, see "Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Equity Method Investments – Other" of Micron's consolidated financial statements.
