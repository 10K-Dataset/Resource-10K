General

Micron Technology, Inc., and its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Company") principally design, develop, manufacture and
market semiconductor memory products. Micron Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in 1978. The Company's executive offices are located at 8000 South Federal Way, Boise,
Idaho 83716-9632 and its telephone number is (208) 368-4000. Information about the Company is available on the internet at www.micron.com.

On
May 31, 2001, Micron Electronics, Inc., formerly a 61% owned subsidiary of the Company, ("MEI"), completed the disposition of its PC operations to Gores Technology
Group. On August 6, 2001, MEI completed a merger with Interland, Inc. in a stock-for-stock acquisition (the "Interland Merger"). Upon completion of the Interland
Merger, MEI changed its name to Interland, Inc. ("Interland"), and the
Company's ownership interest was reduced from 61% to 43% of Interland's outstanding common stock. On August 30, 2001, the Company contributed all of its shares of Interland common stock to the
Micron Technology Foundation (the "Foundation"), a charitable organization established by the Company.

On
April 30, 2001, the Company acquired Kobe Steel, Ltd.'s ("KSL") 75% interest in KMT Semiconductor Limited ("KMT") (the "KMT Acquisition") in a
transaction that resulted in KMT becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

Semiconductor Operations

Products and Services

The Company designs, develops and manufactures leading edge semiconductor memory products. The Company offers products with a wide variety of packaging and
configuration options, architectures and performance characteristics to meet particular customer needs.

Dynamic Random Access Memory ("DRAM").

DRAM is the Company's primary semiconductor memory
product. DRAMs are high density, low-cost-per-bit, random access memory components that store digital information and provide high-speed storage
and retrieval of data. DRAMs are the most widely used semiconductor memory component in computer systems. DRAM sales represented approximately 87%, 94% and 95% of the Company's net sales in
2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively.


Synchronous DRAMs ("SDRAMs") are memory components that operate faster than legacy DRAMs, due in part to the addition of a clock input that synchronizes inputs and allows PC
systems to transfer data at faster rates, enabling subsystems to maintain pace with high speed CPUs and graphics engines. SDRAMs are currently the most popular and highest volume type of
semiconductor memory used in computing, networking, communications, and consumer applications. The Company's primary product for 2001 was the 128 Meg SDRAM, available in multiple configurations,
speeds and package types. The Company offers PC100 and PC133 64 Meg, 128 Meg and 256 Meg SDRAMs. The Company began shipping 256 Meg SDRAMs in 2001 and is developing 512 Meg SDRAMs.

The
Company started shipping Double Data Rate ("DDR") SDRAMs in 2001 and expects them to account for a larger portion of DRAM sales in the future. DDR SDRAM is a higher
bandwidth memory solution that leverages existing SDRAM technology by supporting data transfers on both edges of each clock cycle, effectively doubling the memory chip's data throughput. DDR
SDRAMs are currently being used in high-end graphics and networking cards, and servers, workstation and desktop PC applications.

The
Company continues to produce legacy DRAM products such as extended data out ("EDO") and fast page mode ("FPM") and lower density products such as the 64 Meg and 16 Meg DRAM. The
Company also continues to design and develop other DRAM products, including Rambus® DRAM ("RDRAM®").

Static Random Access Memory ("SRAM").

SRAMs are semiconductor devices that perform
memory functions similar to DRAMs. SRAMs utilize a more complex memory cell and do not require the memory array to be periodically refreshed. This simplifies system design for memory
applications utilizing SRAM and allows SRAM to operate faster than DRAM, although SRAM has a higher cost-per-bit than DRAM. The Company produces SRAMs for the
high-performance or high-bandwidth applications that require a "buffer" or "cache" of high-speed memory to provide data access and data routing quickly.
SRAMs are a key component in leading-edge telecommunications and networking applications where bandwidth is a critical system parameter. Sales of SRAM products represented
approximately 4%, 2%, and 2% of the Company's total net sales in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Flash Memory ("Flash).

Flash products are non-volatile semiconductor devices that
retain memory content when the power is turned off, and are electrically re-writeable. Flash is used in networking applications, workstations, servers, PCs, and handheld electronic devices
such as digital cellular phones, digital cameras, and digital music players. Sales of Flash devices represented approximately 3%, 1% and 1% of the Company's total net sales in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

Manufacturing

The Company is a leading global manufacturer of semiconductor memory products with manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Italy, Japan,
Singapore, and Scotland. The Company's manufacturing facilities operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. The Company develops leading edge manufacturing process technology at its
research and development wafer fabrication facility in Boise, Idaho, which is then deployed to its fabrication facilities in Boise, Italy and Japan and its joint venture, TECH Semiconductor Singapore
Pte. Ltd. ("TECH").

The
Company's process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex, involving a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly, burn-in and final
test. Efficient production of semiconductor memory products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing
techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities. The primary determinants of manufacturing cost are die size (since the potential number of good die per wafer
increases with reduced die size), number of mask layers and yield of acceptable die produced on each wafer. Other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size, number of fabrication
steps, cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of


raw materials, labor productivity, package type and cleanliness of manufacturing environment. The Company is continuously enhancing production processes, reducing the die size of existing products and
transitioning to higher density products. The Company has transitioned a majority of its manufacturing operations to .15µ line-width process technology and
anticipates that it will move a significant portion of its manufacturing operations to .13µ line-width process technology in 2002.

Wafer
fabrication occurs in a highly controlled, clean environment to minimize dust and other yield-and quality-limiting contaminants. Despite stringent manufacturing controls, dust
particles, equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks or other problems may cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be scrapped or individual circuits to be
nonfunctional. Success of the Company's manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects and thereby maximizing yield of high-quality circuits. In this regard, the Company
employs rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening and testing processes. The Company is able to recover many nonstandard devices by testing and grading them to their highest
level of functionality.

After
fabrication, silicon wafers are separated into individual die. Functional die are connected to external leads by extremely fine wire and assembled into plastic packages. Each
completed package is then inspected, sealed and tested. The Company also sells semiconductor products in die and wafer form. The Company tests its products at various stages in the manufacturing
process, performs high temperature burn-in on finished products and conducts numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow. In addition, the Company uses its
proprietary AMBYX™ line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of all die during the burn-in process, capturing quality and
reliability data and reducing testing time and cost.

The
Company assembles a significant portion of its memory products into memory modules before sale to customers. Memory modules consist of an array of memory components attached to
printed circuit boards ("PCBs") that connect to computer systems or other electronic devices. Memory components are attached to PCBs in a soldering process performed by screen printing machines and
high speed automated pick and place machines. Completed modules are tested by custom equipment and visual inspection.

TECH Semiconductor Singapore Pte. Ltd.

TECH, which operates in Singapore, is a memory
manufacturing joint venture among Micron Technology, Inc., the Singapore Economic Development Board, Canon Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Company. TECH's semiconductor manufacturing facilities
use the Company's product and process technology.

Subject
to specific terms and conditions, the Company has agreed to purchase all of the products manufactured by TECH. TECH supplied approximately 25%, 20% and 10% of the total
megabits of memory produced by the Company in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. TECH is expected to require external financing to fund its ongoing operations. The Company's source of supply from TECH
could be interrupted if TECH is unable to obtain required financing. The Company purchases semiconductor memory products from TECH at prices determined quarterly, generally based on a discount from
average selling prices realized by the Company for the immediately preceding quarter. The Company performs assembly and test services on products manufactured by TECH. The Company also provides
certain technology, engineering, and training support to TECH. All transactions with TECH are recognized as part of the net cost of products purchased from TECH.

Availability of Raw Materials

The Company requires raw materials that meet exacting standards. The Company generally has multiple sources of supply; however, only a limited number of
suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet the Company's standards. Various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks,
chemicals, gases, lead frames and molding compound. In addition, any transportation problems could delay the Company's receipt of raw


materials. Although raw materials shortages or transportation problems have not interrupted the Company's operations in the past, shortages may occur from time to time in the future. Also, lead times
for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. If the Company's supply of raw materials is interrupted, or lead times are extended, results of operations could be adversely affected.

Marketing and Customers

The Company's memory products are sold primarily to the PC, telecommunications and networking hardware markets. The Company supplies several major PC original
equipment manufacturers with more than 30% of their memory requirements. Sales to Dell Computer Corporation exceeded 10% of the Company's net sales in 2001, 2000 and 1999. In addition, sales to Compaq
Computer Corporation exceeded 10% of the Company's net sales in 2000.

The
Company markets its semiconductor memory products primarily through its own direct sales force. The Company's products are also offered through independent sales representatives,
distributors and its retail sales division, Crucial Technology. The Company's products are offered under the Micron,
SpecTek and Crucial brand names, and under other private labels. The Company maintains semiconductor sales offices in North America, Europe and Asia. Sales representatives obtain orders subject to
final acceptance by the Company and are compensated on a commission basis. The Company makes shipments against these orders directly to the customer. Distributors carry the Company's products in
inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors' products. Semiconductor memory products sold through distributors approximated 17%, 13% and 11% of net
sales in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

The
semiconductor memory industry is characterized by volatile market conditions, declining average selling prices, rapid technological change, frequent product introductions and
enhancements, difficult product transitions and relatively short product life cycles. In recent periods the DRAM market has become relatively segmented, with diverse memory needs being driven by the
different requirements of desktop and notebook PC's, servers, workstations, hand-helds, and communications, industrial and other applications that demand specific memory solutions. Many of
the Company's customers require a thorough review or "qualification" of semiconductor memory products, which may take several months. As the Company further diversifies its product lines and reduces
the die sizes of existing memory products, more products become subject to qualification. There can be no assurance that new products will be qualified for purchase by existing or potential customers.

Backlog

Volatile industry conditions make it difficult for many customers to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts. Accordingly, new order volumes
for the Company's semiconductor memory products fluctuate significantly. Orders are typically accepted with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the shipping
date. Customers can change delivery schedules or cancel orders without significant penalty. For these reasons, the Company does not believe that its backlog of semiconductor memory products as of any
particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period.

Product Warranty

Because the design and production process for semiconductor memory is highly complex, it is possible that the Company may produce products that do not comply
with customer specifications, contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. In accordance with industry practice, the Company generally provides a limited warranty that its
semiconductor memory products are in compliance with Company specifications existing at the time of delivery. Under the Company's general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures
of product during a stated warranty period is


usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of amounts paid. Under certain circumstances the Company may provide more extensive limited warranty coverage.

Competition

The semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive. We face intense competition from a number of companies, including Elpida Memory, Inc., Hynix
Semiconductor, Inc., Infineon Technologies AG and Samsung Semiconductor, Inc. Some of these competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources or
government support to withstand downturns in the semiconductor memory market, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities. Like us, these competitors aggressively seek to improve
yields, reduce die size and decrease mask levels in their product designs. These factors have significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressures on prices.

Research and Development

To compete in the semiconductor memory industry, the Company must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. The Company believes
that expansion of semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions. The Company's total research and development expenses were
$490 million, $427 million and $321 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Research
and development expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and
personnel costs. The increase in research and development expenses in 2001 as compared to 2000 is primarily due to an increased number of development wafers processed and higher compensation expenses
reflective of an increased number of personnel. Process technology research and development efforts are focused on .13µ and .11µ
line-width process technologies which are designed to facilitate the Company's transition to next generation products.

In
addition to process technology, the Company continues to emphasize product designs which utilize advanced process technology. Currently these designs include further shrink
versions of the Company's 128 Meg and 256 Meg SDRAMs. Efforts towards the design and development of new products are concentrated on the Company's 512 Meg SDRAMs, DDR SDRAM, Flash and SRAM
memory products. Other research and development efforts are devoted to the design and development of embedded memory and advanced DRAM technology ("ADT") products. The Company is also developing
technologies designed to enable customers to more rapidly adopt the Company's advanced memory architectures.

International Sales

International sales totaled $1.8 billion for 2001 and included approximately $780 million in sales to Europe and $640 million in sales to
the Asia Pacific region. International sales totaled $2.8 billion for 2000 and $1.0 billion for 1999.

Patents and Licenses

As of August 30, 2001, the Company owned 5,965 United States patents and 452 foreign patents. In addition, the Company has numerous United States and
international patent applications pending.

From
time to time, others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that the Company's products or processes infringe their product or process technology rights. In this regard,
the Company is currently engaged in litigation with Rambus, Inc. ("Rambus") relating to certain of Rambus' patents and certain of the Company's claims and defenses. Lawsuits between Rambus and
the Company are


pending in the United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy. On August 28, 2000, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action against Rambus in the U.S. District Court for
the District of Delaware. On February 1, 2001, the Company amended its complaint. Pursuant to its complaint, the Company is seeking (1) relief under the federal antitrust laws for
violations by Rambus of Section 2 of the Sherman Act; (2) a declaratory judgment that (a) certain Rambus patents are not infringed, are invalid and/or are unenforceable,
(b) the Company has an implied license to Rambus' patents, and (c) Rambus is estopped from enforcing its patents against the Company because of its conduct in the Joint Electron Device
Engineering Council standards setting body; and (3) damages and declaratory relief for Rambus' breach of contract, fraud, deceptive trade practices, negligent misrepresentation, and conduct
requiring the application of equitable estoppel. On February 15, 2001, Rambus filed an Answer and Counterclaim. Rambus denies that the Company is entitled to relief and has alleged willful
infringement by the Company of eight Rambus patents. The Company cannot predict the outcome of these suits. A determination that the Company's manufacturing processes or products infringe the product
or process rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require the Company to make material changes to its products and/or manufacturing processes. Any of the foregoing results could
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.

The
Company has a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements. Some of these license agreements require the Company to make one time or periodic payments. The
Company may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. The
Company is unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms.

Employees

As of August 30, 2001, the Company had approximately 18,100 employees, including approximately 4,000 and 2,000 employees in Asia and Europe,
respectively. The Company's employees in Italy are represented by labor organizations that have entered into national and local labor contracts with the Company. The Company's employment levels can
vary depending on market conditions and the level of the Company's production, research and product and process development. Many of the Company's employees are highly skilled, and the Company's
continued success depends in part upon its ability to attract and retain such employees. The loss of key Company personnel could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.

Environmental Compliance

Government regulations impose various environmental controls on discharges, emissions and solid wastes from the Company's manufacturing processes. In 2001, the
Company's wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of ISO 14001 certification. To continue certification, the Company met requirements in environmental policy, compliance,
planning, management, structure and responsibility, training, communication, document control, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, record keeping and management review. While the
Company has not experienced any materially adverse effects on its operations from environmental or other government regulations, changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital
expenditures, modification of operations or other compliance actions.


Officers and Directors of the Registrant

Officers of the Company are appointed annually by the Board of Directors. Directors of the Company are elected annually by the shareholders of the Company. Any
directors appointed by the Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the Board serve until the next election by the shareholders. All officers and directors serve until their successors are duly chosen
or elected and qualified, except in the case of earlier death, resignation or removal.

As
of August 30, 2001, the following executive officers and directors of the Company were subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Securities

enforcing those patents against the Company because of its conduct in the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council, and (3) damages and declaratory relief for Rambus' breach of contract,
fraud, deceptive trade practices, negligent misrepresentation, and conduct requiring the application of equitable estoppel. On February 15, 2001, Rambus filed an answer and counterclaim against
the Company in Delaware denying the Company is entitled to relief and alleging infringement of eight (8) Rambus patents subject to the Company's declaratory judgment action. On
September 1, 2000, Rambus filed suit against Micron Semiconductor GmbH in the District Court of Mannheim, Germany, alleging that certain SDRAM and DDR SDRAM products infringe German patent and
utility model counterparts to European patent 525 068. On September 13, 2000, Rambus filed suit against Micron Europe Limited in the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division in London, England,
alleging that certain SDRAM and DDR SDRAM products infringe the U.K. counterpart to European patent 525 068. On September 22, 2000, Rambus filed a complaint against the Company and Reptronic


(a distributor of the Company's products) in Court of First Instance of Paris, France, alleging that certain SDRAM and DDR SDRAM products infringe the French counterpart to European patent 525 068. In
its suits against the Company, Rambus is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. On September 29, 2000, the Company filed suit against Rambus in the Civil Court of Milan, Italy,
alleging invalidity and non-infringement of the Italian counterpart to European patent 525 068. On September 29, 2000, Rambus filed a preliminary proceeding against the Company and
EBV (a distributor of the Company's products) in the Civil Court of Monza, Italy, alleging that certain SDRAM products infringe the Italian counterpart to European patent 525 068, and seeking the
seizure of certain materials and the entry of a preliminary injunction as to products manufactured at the Company's Avezzano, Italy, site. On December 21, 2000, an appeals panel of the Court of
Monza held that the Monza trial court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the seizure matter. The Monza trial court ordered that technical review proceedings continue with respect to the issue of
preliminary injunction. On May 24, 2001, the trial court rejected Rambus' assertions of infringement and denied its request for a preliminary injunction. Rambus' appeal from the trial judge's
ruling was rejected by the Monza appeals panel on July 18, 2001. On December 29, 2000, the Company filed suit against Rambus in the Civil Court of Avezzano, Italy, alleging invalidity
and non-infringement of the Italian counterpart to European patent 1 004 956. On August 10, 2001, Rambus filed suit against the Company and Assitec (an electronics retailer) in the
Civil Court of Pavia, Italy, alleging that certain DDR SDRAM products infringe the Italian counterpart to European patent 1 022 642. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of these suits.

Item 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Micron Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Company") principally design, develop, manufacture and market
semiconductor memory products.

The following discussion contains trend information and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking
statements include, but are not limited to, statements such as those made in "Net Sales" regarding the possibility that the Company's megabit inventories could


continue to increase. The Company's actual results could differ materially from the Company's historical results and those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, those identified in "Certain Factors." This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and
accompanying notes. All period references are to the Company's fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. Shares and per share amounts for all periods presented reflect a
two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on May 1, 2000. All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis.

Financial data for 2000 and 1999 has been restated to reflect the disposition of the PC Operations in May 2001. The net assets, results of operations
and cash flows of the PC business have been reported separately as discontinued PC Operations in the Company's consolidated financial statements. (See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Discontinued PC Operations.")

On
May 31, 2001, Micron Electronics, Inc., formerly a 61% owned subsidiary of the Company ("MEI"), completed the disposition of its PC Operations to Gores Technology
Group. The Company's consolidated net loss for 2001 of $625 million (or $1.05 per share) includes the loss, net of taxes and minority interest, on discontinued PC Operations of
$104 million ($0.18 per share). (See "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Discontinued PC Operations.") On August 6, 2001, MEI completed a merger with
Interland, Inc. in a stock-for-stock acquisition (the "Interland Merger"). Upon completion of the Interland Merger, MEI changed its name to Interland, Inc.
("Interland"), and the Company's ownership interest was reduced from 61% to 43% of Interland's outstanding common stock. On August 30, 2001, the Company contributed all of its shares of
Interland common stock to the Micron Technology Foundation (the "Foundation"), a charitable organization established by the Company. The Company incurred aggregate charges of $191 million in
the fourth quarter of 2001 to write down the carrying value of its equity interest in Interland to its market value and to reflect the contribution of Interland shares to the Foundation. MEI's 2001
financial results are included in the Company's financial statements for 11 months through the date of the Interland Merger. The Company's consolidated financial statements for 2000 and 1999
include the financial results of MEI for the full year.

On
April 30, 2001, the Company acquired Kobe Steel, Ltd.'s ("KSL") 75% interest in KMT Semiconductor Limited ("KMT") (the "KMT Acquisition") in a
transaction that resulted in KMT becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The KMT Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the purchase method of accounting. The results
of operations of KMT have been included in the accompanying financial statements from the date of acquisition. (See "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Acquisitions—KMT
Semiconductor Limited.")

Net Sales

Substantially all of the Company's net sales for all periods presented were derived from Semiconductor Operations. The Company's results of operations for 2001
were significantly affected by a precipitous decline in average selling prices for its semiconductor memory products. Average selling prices for the Company's semiconductor memory products declined by
approximately 60% for 2001 as compared to 2000, and decreased by approximately 85% for the fourth quarter of 2001 compared to the fourth quarter of 2000. The decrease in average selling prices led to
significantly lower net sales. The decrease also led to charges to cost of goods sold for the write-downs of the Company's work in process and finished goods semiconductor memory inventories of
$466 million and $261 million in the fourth and third quarters of 2001, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of such inventories to their lower of cost or market value.

Net
sales decreased by 38% for 2001 as compared to 2000, primarily due to the significant decline in average selling prices for the Company's semiconductor memory products. Megabit
shipments increased by approximately 50% for the same period. The Company achieved higher megabit sales for these
comparative periods through ongoing transitions to smaller die size versions of existing memory products ("shrink versions"), shifts to higher density products and increases in total wafer outs. The
Company's primary memory product in 2001 was the 128 Meg Synchronous DRAM ("SDRAM"),


which constituted 47% of net sales. The Company's primary memory product in 2000 and 1999 was the 64 Meg SDRAM, which constituted 47% and 66%, respectively, of net sales.

The
Company's aggregate work in process and finished goods inventories of semiconductor memory products, as measured in megabits, increased approximately 110% as of the end of 2001
compared to the prior year end. This increase in inventory was primarily due to weak industry demand for memory products and increases in megabit production. The increases in production resulted from
increases in total wafer outs and ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiency and product and process transitions to next generation devices. In addition, the consolidation of KMT's financial
statements with those of the Company contributed to the increase in inventory. If industry demand for semiconductor memory products does not improve, the Company's megabit inventories could continue
to increase.

Net
sales increased by 147% for 2000 as compared to 1999, primarily due to a 142% increase in total megabits of semiconductor memory sold and, to a lesser extent, a 3% increase in
average selling prices.

Substantially
all of the Company's gross margin for all periods presented was attributable to Semiconductor Operations. The decrease in gross margin percentage for 2001 as compared to
2000 was principally due to the decrease in average selling prices per megabit of memory. Average selling prices for the Company's memory products are currently below their manufacturing costs. As a
result, the Company recorded a $466 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2001 to write down the carrying value of semiconductor memory inventories to their estimated market values. The
Company incurred a similar write-down of $261 million in the third quarter of 2001.

The
Company's gross margin percentage increased for 2000 as compared to 1999, primarily due to decreases in per megabit manufacturing costs resulting from continued improvements in
manufacturing efficiency and, to a lesser extent, a 3% increase in average selling prices. Manufacturing cost improvements were achieved principally through transitions to shrink versions of existing
products and shifts to higher density products.

Subject
to specific terms and conditions, the Company has agreed to purchase all of the products manufactured by its joint venture wafer fabrication facility, TECH Semiconductor
Singapore Pte. Ltd. ("TECH"). TECH supplied approximately 25%, 20% and 10% of the total megabits of memory produced by the Company in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company purchases
semiconductor memory products from TECH at prices determined quarterly, generally based on a discount from average selling price realized by the Company for the immediately preceding quarter. The
Company performs assembly and test services on products manufactured by TECH. The Company also provides certain technology, engineering, and training support to TECH. All transactions with TECH are
recognized as part of the net cost of products purchased from TECH. The Company realized lower gross margins on sales of TECH products than for products manufactured by its wholly-owned facilities in
2001, 2000 and 1999.

The
increase in selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") for 2001 as compared to 2000 resulted primarily from the contribution charge of $94 million for the market
value of the Company's remaining equity interest in Interland contributed to the Foundation in the fourth quarter of 2001. The increase in SG&A for 2001 as compared to 2000 was also due to increased
legal costs associated with product and process technology rights litigation and patent prosecution and depreciation expense associated with the Company's business software systems, partially offset
by decreased performance-based compensation expense. (See "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies.")

The
increase in SG&A expenses for 2000 as compared to 1999 resulted primarily from increased employee compensation costs, attributable to higher levels of performance-based pay and
increased administrative personnel. Additionally, selling, general and administrative costs in 2000 included a $25 million charge for the market value of Interland common stock contributed by
the Company to the Foundation, increased selling costs resulting from higher semiconductor production volumes and
increased legal costs associated with product and process technology rights litigation and patent prosecution.

SG&A
for the Company's Web-hosting Operations, which were operated through MEI, was 12%, 11% and 1% of total SG&A for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Research
and development expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and
personnel costs. The increase in research and development expenses in 2001 as compared to 2000 is primarily due to an increased number of development wafers processed and higher compensation expenses
reflective of an increased number of personnel. Process technology research and development efforts are focused on .13µ and .11µ
line-width process technologies which are designed to facilitate the Company's transition to next generation products.

In
addition to process technology, the Company continues to emphasize product designs which utilize advanced process technology. Currently these designs include further shrink
versions of the Company's 128 Meg and 256 Meg SDRAMs. Efforts towards the design and development of new products are concentrated on the Company's 512 Meg SDRAMs, DDR SDRAM, Flash and SRAM
memory products. Other research and development efforts are devoted to the design and development of
embedded memory and advanced DRAM technology ("ADT") products. The Company is also developing technologies designed to enable customers to more rapidly adopt the Company's advanced memory
architectures.

Other Operating Expense (Income)

Other operating expense for 2001 includes losses of $44 million from the write-off of certain costs related to the Company's Lehi facility
and losses of $20 million, net of gains, on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment. Other operating income for 2000 includes a gain of $42 million on the sale of the
Company's facility located in Richardson, Texas and losses of $23 million, net of gains, on write-downs and disposals of other semiconductor equipment. Other operating expense for 1999 includes
charges of $24 million relating to the Company's former flat panel and radio frequency identification devices operations and losses of $12 million, net of gains, from the
write-down and disposal of semiconductor equipment.

Other Non-Operating (Expense) Income

Other non-operating expense for 2001 includes a $4 million loss on MEI stock issued to effect the Interland Merger and a charge of
$92 million to write down the carrying value of the Company's equity interest in Interland contributed to the Foundation to market value. In addition, the Company recognized charges totaling
$12 million resulting from market value adjustments for derivative financial instruments to purchase electricity and natural gas. Other non-operating income for 2000 includes a gain
of $14 million from the contribution to the Foundation of Interland common stock owned by the Company.

Interest Income and Expense

Interest income was higher for 2001 as compared to 2000 due to the Company's higher levels of cash and liquid investments in 2001. Interest expense was lower
for 2001 as compared to 2000, primarily as a result of the conversions of debt to equity in the third quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001. $500 million of the Company's 7.0%
convertible subordinated notes were converted into equity in the third quarter of 2000 and the Company's $740 million face amount, 6.5% convertible subordinated notes were converted into equity
in the first quarter of 2001.


Income Tax Provision (Benefit)

The effective tax rates for 2001, 2000 and 1999 were 46%, 34% and 39%, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate primarily reflects the statutory
corporate income tax rate, the net effect of state taxes, the tax effect of earnings or losses by domestic subsidiaries not consolidated with the Company for federal income tax purposes and the effect
of foreign income at non-U.S. tax rates. In addition, 2001 includes the benefit of a $34 million change in the prior year's accrual for income taxes upon filing of the tax returns.
The Company's future effective income tax rate will vary based on fluctuations in the mix of income and losses among tax jurisdictions with differing rates.

Minority Interests

Minority interests for 2001, 2000 and 1999 includes minority shareholders' interest in the SpecTek component recovery business and the Web-hosting
Operation. The component recovery business was purchased by the Company from MEI on April 5, 2001, at which time it became a wholly-owned operation of the Company and, as a result, the Company
no longer recorded minority interest in the earnings of the component recovery business after April 5, 2001. Approximately $18 million, $54 million and $18 million of
minority interest is attributable to the earnings of the component recovery business for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141 "Business
Combinations," and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and requires recognition of
certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination separate and apart from goodwill only when certain criteria are met. SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but rather are periodically tested
for impairment. FAS No. 141 is effective for any business combination initiated after June 30, 2001. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 142 in fiscal 2003, but expects to
adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2002. The Company does not expect the adoption of either SFAS 141 or 142 to have a significant impact on the Company's future results of operations or
financial position.

In
August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated retirement costs. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 is effective for the Company in 2003. The
Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 143 to have a significant impact on the Company's future results of operations or financial position.

In
October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144 supersedes previous
guidance for financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and for segments of a business to be disposed of. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 is
effective for the Company in 2003. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 144 on its results of operations and financial position.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's liquidity is highly dependent on average selling prices for its semiconductor memory products. Average selling prices have declined significantly
in recent periods. The Company's principal source of liquidity during 2001 was net cash flow from operations of $789 million which reflects a decrease in trade receivables, partially offset by
an increase in the level of semiconductor memory inventories. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company received $480 million from the


issuance of warrants to purchase its common stock. During 2001, the Company expended $1,489 million for property, plant and equipment. As of August 30, 2001, the Company had cash and
liquid investments totaling $1,678 million, representing a decrease of $788 million from August 31, 2000. The deconsolidation of MEI had the effect of decreasing cash and liquid
investments by $199 million, as MEI's financial results are no longer consolidated into the Company's financial results. On April 30, 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of KMT
and, in connection therewith, the Company assumed $296 million in debt and capital lease obligations.

As
of October 10, 2001, the Company had received $532 million of income taxes receivable reflected on the balance sheet date of August 30, 2001.

In
the first quarter of 2001, the Company's 6.5% convertible subordinated notes due October 2005, with a face amount of $740 million, were converted into
24.7 million shares of common stock, resulting in a reclassification of $685 million from debt to equity.

The
Company believes that to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality, it must continue to
invest in manufacturing technology, facilities and capital equipment, research and development, and product and process technology. The Company has historically utilized external sources of financing
to fund operations and capital improvement projects and has a shelf registration statement in place pursuant to which the Company may from time to time issue debt or equity securities for up to
$1 billion. The Company may also seek to raise funds through issuing securities not covered by the existing shelf registration statement. The Company expects capital spending to approximate
$1 billion in 2002. If market
conditions do not improve and the Company is unable to secure external financing, the Company may be required to adopt various cash conservation measures, which may have an adverse impact on the
Company's future results of operations or financial position. As of August 30, 2001, the Company had commitments extending into 2003 of approximately $290 million for equipment purchases
and software infrastructure, and approximately $95 million for the construction of facilities.

The
Company has pledged $50 million as cash collateral to secure TECH's fully-drawn revolving line of credit.

Certain Factors

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following are important factors which could
cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.

If average selling prices for our memory products do not increase significantly, we expect to continue to record significant losses

Average selling prices for our memory products in the fourth quarter of 2001 decreased approximately 55% compared to the third quarter. In four of the last
five fiscal years we experienced decreases in average selling prices, as follows: 60% decline in 2001, 37% decline in 1999, 60% decline in 1998 and 75% decline in 1997. We are unable to predict
pricing conditions for any future period.

Average
selling prices for our memory products are currently below our manufacturing costs, and accordingly our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition are being
adversely affected. If average selling prices do not improve to a level that exceeds cost, we would expect to continue to record significant losses on product sales. In addition, to the extent the
estimated market price of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarterly reporting date is below the cost of these products, we must recognize a charge against
operations to write down the carrying value to market value.


If average selling prices of memory products do not improve to a level that exceeds our costs, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our operations or
make adequate capital investments

Our cash flow from operations depends primarily on average selling prices and per megabit manufacturing costs of our semiconductor memory products. Average
selling prices for our memory products are currently below our manufacturing costs. To develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain
product quality, we must invest significant capital in manufacturing technology, facilities and capital equipment, research and development, and product and process technology. If average selling
prices do not improve to a level that exceeds our costs, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to sustain our operations.

Current economic and political conditions may harm our business

Deteriorating global economic conditions and the effects of ongoing military actions against terrorists may cause significant disruptions to commerce
throughout the world. To the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology, or our inability to
effectively market, manufacture or ship our products, our business, results of operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected. In addition, our ability to raise capital for purposes
of research and development, capital expenditures and ongoing operations is dependent upon ready access to capital markets. During times of adverse global economic and political conditions, investor
confidence in and accessibility to capital markets could decrease. If capital markets are not available to us over an extended period of time, we could be unable to fund operations, invest in capital
expenditures and fully carry out our research and development efforts, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial conditions.

If the current downturn in the semiconductor memory market persists, we may need to pursue cash conservation measures which may reduce the scale and efficiency of our
operations

If the current semiconductor industry downturn persists, we will be required to pursue cash conservation measures, including but not limited to, reductions in
our capital spending and reductions in our workforce. Any such measures may reduce the scale and efficiency of our operations.

The semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive

Some of our competitors receive government subsidies. To the extent that these practices continue, they may have the result of prolonging the current imbalance
in supply and demand in the semiconductor memory industry. In addition, the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive. We face
intense competition from a number of companies, including Elpida Memory, Inc., Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Infineon Technologies AG and Samsung Semiconductor, Inc. Some of these
competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor memory market, invest in technology and capitalize on growth
opportunities. Like us, these competitors aggressively seek to improve yields, reduce die size and decrease mask levels in their product designs. These factors have significantly increased worldwide
supply and put downward pressures on prices.


We are dependent on the personal computer ("PC") market as most of the memory products we sell are used in PCs or peripherals. If the growth rate of either PCs sold or the
amount of memory included in each PC decreases, sales of our memory products could decrease

In 2001, we sold most of our memory products to PC or peripheral markets. DRAMs are the most widely used semiconductor memory components in PCs. In
recent periods, the growth rate of PCs sold has slowed significantly or declined. In addition, the growth rate in 2001 for the average amount of memory included in each PC sold declined compared to
several years prior to 2001. These declining growth rates affected our 2001 results of operations. If we experience a sustained reduction in the growth rate of either PCs sold or the average amount of
memory included in each PC, sales of our memory products could decrease and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.

If any one of our major PC customers significantly reduces its purchases of DRAM from us, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected

We supply several major PC customers with more than 30% of their memory requirements. Aggregate sales to three of our PC customers approximated 25% of our net
sales in 2001. If any one of our major PC customers significantly reduces its purchases of DRAM from us, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Increased worldwide DRAM production could lead to further declines in average selling prices for DRAM

We and our competitors constantly seek to improve yields, reduce die size and use fewer manufacturing steps. These improvements increase worldwide supply of
DRAM. In addition, we and several of our competitors are evaluating plans to manufacture semiconductors in facilities that process 300-millimeter ("300mm") wafers. 300mm wafers have
approximately 130% greater usable surface area than 200mm wafers, the current industry standard. The widespread use of 300mm wafers in the industry, which is
expected to occur within the next two to five years, could lead to a significant increase in the worldwide supply of DRAM. Increases in worldwide supply of DRAM also result from DRAM fab capacity
expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to DRAM production. Increases in worldwide supply of DRAM, if not offset
by increases in demand, could lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

If our TECH joint venture experiences financial difficulty, or if our supply of memory products from TECH is interrupted, our results of operations could be adversely affected

TECH currently supplies us with approximately 20% of our total megabits of memory produced. We have agreements to purchase all of the production from TECH
subject to specific terms and conditions. Any reduction in supply could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. TECH has historically been required to seek additional external
financing to fund its ongoing operations and transition to next generation technologies. TECH is expected to require financing in the immediate future in order to continue operations, therefore our
source of supply may be interrupted if TECH is unable to obtain required financing. We have pledged $50 million as cash collateral to secure current TECH financing.

We may not be able to reduce per megabit manufacturing costs at the same rate as we have in the past

In recent years, we have decreased per megabit manufacturing costs through improvements in our manufacturing processes, including reducing the die size of our
existing products. In future periods, we


may not be able to reduce our per megabit manufacturing costs at historical rates. Our ability to reduce per megabit manufacturing costs in future periods may be affected because of the following:

•

our
ability to complete product and process technology upgrades in our international and joint venture facilities;

•

our
manufacturing yields may decrease as we implement more complex technologies;

•

our
ability to ramp the latest reduced die size versions of existing devices or new generation devices to commercial volumes; or

•

any
reduction in the scale of our operations, which would result in losing economies of scale.

An adverse determination that our products and processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business, results of operation and
financial condition

From time to time, others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or processes infringe their product or process technology rights. In
this regard, we are currently engaged in litigation with Rambus, Inc. ("Rambus") relating to certain of Rambus' patents and certain of our claims and defenses. Lawsuits between Rambus and us
are pending in the United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy. On August 28, 2000, we filed a declaratory judgment action against Rambus in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware. On February 1, 2001, we amended our complaint. Pursuant to our complaint, we are seeking (1) relief under the federal antitrust laws for violations by Rambus of
Section 2 of the Sherman Act; (2) a declaratory judgment that (a) certain Rambus patents are not infringed, are invalid and/or are unenforceable, (b) we have an implied
license to Rambus' patents, and (c) Rambus is estopped from enforcing its patents against us because of its conduct in the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council standards setting body; and
(3) damages and declaratory relief for Rambus' breach of contract, fraud, deceptive trade practices, negligent misrepresentation, and conduct requiring the application of equitable estoppel. On
February 15, 2001, Rambus filed an Answer and Counterclaim. Rambus denies that we are entitled to relief and has alleged willful infringement by us of eight Rambus patents. We cannot predict
the outcome of these suits. A determination that our manufacturing processes or products infringe the product or process rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require us to
make material changes to its products and/or manufacturing processes. Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

We
have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements. Some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments. We may need to obtain
additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms.

We face risks associated with our foreign sales and operations that could adversely affect our operating results

Foreign sales approximated 46% of our consolidated net sales in 2001. In addition, we have or support manufacturing operations in Italy, Singapore, Japan and
Scotland. Our foreign sales and foreign operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:

•

currency
fluctuations, export duties, changes to import and export regulations, and restrictions on the transfer of funds;

•

political
and economic instability;

•

problems
with the transportation or delivery of our products;

•

employee
turnover and labor unrest;


•

longer
payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; and

•

compliance
with a variety of foreign laws.

These
factors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Interruptions in our supply of raw materials could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position

Our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials; however, only a limited
number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards. Various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks,
chemicals, gases, lead frames and molding compound. In addition, any transportation problems could delay our receipt of raw materials. Although raw materials shortages or transportation problems have
not interrupted our operations in the past, shortages may occur from time to time in the future. Also, lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. If our supply of raw
materials is interrupted or our lead times extended, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are rumored to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on
us or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations

Because the design and production process for semiconductor memory is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with
customer specifications, contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. If, despite design review, quality control and product qualification procedures, problems with nonconforming,
defective or incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products, we could be adversely affected in one or both of the following ways:

•

we
may need to replace product or otherwise compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product, and

•

we
may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products.

If our manufacturing process is interrupted, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected

We manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and
performance. Difficulties in the manufacturing process can reduce yields or interrupt production and affect our ability to deliver products on time or cost-effectively. Additionally, if
production at a fabrication facility is interrupted for any reason, we may be unable to meet our customers' demand and they may purchase products from other suppliers. The resulting loss of revenues
and damage to customer relationships could be significant.

If we are unable to successfully transition our operations to 300mm wafer manufacturing processes, the results of our operations and cash flows could be adversely affected

We have in the past reduced our per megabit manufacturing costs by transitioning to larger wafer sizes. By transitioning to larger wafers, we should be able to
produce significantly more die for each wafer at a slightly higher cost for each wafer, resulting in substantially reduced costs for each die. Several of our competitors are evaluating plans to shift
part or all of their memory manufacturing operations to 300mm wafers in the near future. Some of these competitors have established pilot 300mm wafer lines. If these competitors are able to transition
operations to 300mm wafers before us, we could be at a cost disadvantage. Our transition to 300mm wafer processing will require us to make


substantial capital investments, which will depend on our ability to generate funds from operations or to obtain funds from external sources. We may also experience disruptions in manufacturing
operations and reduced yields during our initial transition stage to larger wafer sizes. If we are unable to successfully transition to 300mm wafer processing at the appropriate time, our results of
operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Substantially all of the Company's liquid investments and long-term debt are at fixed interest rates; therefore, the fair value of these
instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. However, substantially all of the Company's liquid investments mature within one year. As a result, the Company believes that the market
risk arising from its holdings of financial instruments is minimal. As of August 30, 2001, the Company held aggregate cash and receivables in foreign currency valued at approximately US
$48 million and aggregate foreign currency liabilities valued at approximately US $453 million (including debt and capital lease obligations denominated in Yen valued at approximately US
$281 million). Foreign currency payables and receivables are comprised primarily of Yen, British Pounds, Singapore Dollars and Euros.

MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All tabular amounts in millions except per share amounts)

Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of presentation:

Micron Technology, Inc., and its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to collectively as
the "Company") principally design, develop, manufacture and market semiconductor memory products. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Company's fiscal year
is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999 each contained 52 weeks and ended on August 30, 2001,
August 31, 2000, and September 2, 1999, respectively.

On
August 6, 2001, Micron Electronics, Inc. ("MEI"), completed a merger with Interland, Inc., in a stock-for- stock acquisition (the
"Interland Merger"). Upon completion of the Interland Merger, MEI changed its name to Interland, Inc. ("Interland"), and the Company's ownership interest was reduced from 61% to 43% of MEI's
outstanding common stock. On August 30, 2001, the Company contributed all of its shares of Interland common stock to the Micron Technology Foundation (the "Foundation"). MEI's 2001 financial
results are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements for eleven months through the date of the Interland Merger. The Company's consolidated financial statements for 2000 and 1999
include the financial results of MEI for the full year. (See "Gain (Loss) on Issuance of Subsidiary Stock" and "Other Non-Operating Income (Expense)" notes.)

Restatements and reclassifications:

As a result of MEI's disposal of its PC operations in 2001, the Company's
previously reported consolidated financial statements for 2000 and 1999 have been restated to present the discontinued PC Operations separate from continuing operations. (See "Discontinued PC
Operations" note.)

On
March 29, 2000, the Company's Board of Directors announced a 2-for-1 stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend to shareholders of record
as of April 18, 2000, and payable on May 1, 2000. The par value of the Company's common stock remained unchanged. Share and per share amounts were restated to reflect retroactively the
stock split, except for the historical share amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity. Certain other reclassifications have been made, none of
which affected the results of operations, to present the financial statements on a consistent basis.

Use of estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Revenue recognition:

Revenue from product sales to direct customers is recognized when title transfers to the customer,
primarily upon shipment. The Company defers recognition of sales to certain distributors that have rights of return and price protection until such distributors have sold the products. Net sales
include revenue from web-hosting and other internet services which are recognized as services are provided.

Stock-based compensation:

Employee stock plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."

Advertising:

Advertising costs are charged to operations as incurred. The Company incurred $24.1 million,
$33.1 million and $8.6 million of advertising costs in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.


Subsidiary stock sales:

Gains and losses on issuance of stock by a subsidiary are recognized in the Company's results
of operations.

Foreign currency:

The U.S. dollar is the Company's functional currency for substantially all of its operations. For
international operations where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income
and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period.

Earnings (loss) per share:

Basic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share incorporates the additional shares issued from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and common stock warrants using the "treasury
stock" method and conversion of convertible debentures using the "if-converted" method, when dilutive.

Financial instruments:

Cash equivalents include highly liquid short-term investments with original
maturities of three months or less, readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Investments with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are
classified as liquid investments. Investments with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as other long-term assets. Securities classified as
available-for-sale or trading are stated at market value. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are stated at amortized cost.

The
amounts reported as cash and equivalents, liquid investments, receivables, other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and equipment purchase contracts approximate their
fair values. The fair value of the Company's debt as of August 30, 2001 and August 31, 2000, approximated $491 million and $998 million, respectively. The fair value
estimates presented herein were based on market interest rates and other market information available to management as of each balance sheet date presented. The use of different market assumptions
and/or estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The approximate fair values do not take into consideration expenses that could be incurred in an
actual settlement.

Certain concentrations:

Approximately 70% of the Company's sales of semiconductor memory products for 2001 was to the
computer market. Certain components used by the Company in manufacturing semiconductor memory products are purchased from a limited number of suppliers.

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, investment securities and trade accounts receivable. The
Company invests cash through high-credit-quality financial institutions and performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions. The Company, by
policy, limits the concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single obligor. A concentration of credit risk may exist with respect to trade receivables, as a substantial
portion of the Company's customers are affiliated with the computer, telecommunications and networking industries. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers worldwide and generally
does not require collateral from its customers. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on receivables.

Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market. Cost includes labor, material and overhead
costs, including product and process technology costs.

Product and process technology:

Costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are
expensed as research and development. Costs incurred to establish patents and acquire product and process technology are capitalized. Capitalized costs are amortized using the


straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the technology, the patent term or the agreement, ranging up to 10 years. Fully-amortized costs are removed
from product and process technology and accumulated amortization.

Property, plant and equipment:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 5 to 30 years for buildings, 2 to 20 years for equipment and 2 to 5 years for software. When property or
equipment is retired or
otherwise disposed of, the net book value of the asset is removed from the Company's accounts and the net gain or loss is included in the determination of income.

The
Company capitalizes interest on borrowings during the active construction period of major capital projects. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and
is amortized over the useful lives of the assets. The Company capitalized interest costs of $9.8 million, $6.4 million and $1.3 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, in
connection with various capital projects.

The
Company reviews the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be
recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an
impairment loss would be recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets.

Recently issued accounting standards:

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for business combinations. It requires all business combinations to be accounted for by the purchase method and modifies the criteria for recognition of certain intangible
assets separate and apart from goodwill. SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and
other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but rather are periodically tested for impairment. SFAS No. 141 is effective for business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 142 in fiscal year 2003 but expects to adopt the standard the first quarter of 2002. The Company does not expect the
adoption of either SFAS No. 141 or No. 142 to have a significant impact on the Company's future results of operations or financial position.

In
August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated retirement costs. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 is effective for the Company in 2003. The
Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 143 to have a significant impact on the Company's future results of operations or financial position.

In
October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144 supersedes previous
guidance for financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and for segments of a business to be disposed of. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 is
effective for the Company in 2003. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 144 on its results of operations and financial position.

In
connection with the KMT Acquisition, the Company assumed $259.5 million in notes payable and $36.9 million in capital lease obligations. (See
"Acquisitions—KMT Semiconductor Limited" note.)

The
subordinated notes due October 2005 with a yield to maturity of 10.7% have a face value of $210.0 million and a stated interest rate of 6.5%. During 2001, the
Company's convertible subordinated notes due October 2005 were converted into 24.7 million shares of the Company's common stock.

Certain
notes payable are collateralized by plant and equipment with a total cost of $111.1 million and accumulated depreciation of $80.4 million as of August 30,
2001. Equipment under capital leases and accumulated amortization thereon were $30.3 million and $17.3 million, respectively, as of August 30, 2001, and $41.1 million and
$24.7 million, respectively, as of August 31, 2000.

The
Company has pledged as collateral $50.0 million in cash deposits for a $50.0 million revolving line of credit held by the Company's memory manufacturing joint
venture. On August 31, 2001, the joint venture drew on the entire revolving line of credit.

The
Company leases certain facilities and equipment under operating leases. Total rental expense on all operating leases was $25.0 million, $23.1 million and
$18.1 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Minimum future rental commitments under operating leases aggregate $38.1 million as of


August 30, 2001, and are payable as follows (in millions): 2002, $13.1; 2003, $11.6; 2004, $2.7; 2005, $2.5; 2006, $1.9 and 2007 and thereafter, $6.3.

Commitments and Contingencies

As of August 30, 2001, the Company had commitments of $291.3 million for equipment purchases and software infrastructure and $93.8 million
for the construction of facilities.

From
time to time, others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that the Company's products or its processes infringe their product or process technology rights. In this
regard, the Company is currently engaged in litigation with Rambus, Inc. ("Rambus") relating to certain patents of Rambus and certain of the Company's claims and defenses. Lawsuits between
Rambus and the Company are pending in the United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of these suits. A determination that the Company's
manufacturing processes or products infringe the product or process rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require the Company to make material changes to its products and/or
manufacturing processes. Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.

The
Company has accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of asserted and unasserted claims for alleged infringement prior to
the balance sheet date. The Company is currently a party to various other legal actions arising out of the normal course of business, none of which is expected to have a material effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

Shareholders' Equity

Common Stock Warrants

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company received $480.2 million from the issuance of warrants to purchase 29.1 million shares of the
Company's common stock. The warrants entitle the holders to exercise their warrants and purchase shares of Common Stock for $56.00 per share (the "Exercise Price") at any time through May 15,
2008 (the "Expiration Date"). Warrants exercised prior to the Expiration Date will be settled on a "net share" basis, wherein investors receive common stock equal to the difference between $56.00 and
the average closing sale price for the common shares over the 30 trading days immediately preceding the Exercise Date. At expiration, the Company may elect to


settle the warrants on a net share basis or for cash, provided certain conditions are satisfied. As of August 30, 2001, there have been no exercises of warrants and all warrants issued remain
outstanding.

Stock Purchase Plan

The Company's 1989 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company's common stock through payroll deductions.
The shares can be purchased for 85% of the lower of the beginning or ending closing stock prices of each offering period and are restricted from resale for a period of one year from the date of
purchase. Purchases are limited to 20% of an employee's eligible compensation. As of August 30, 2001, 14.6 million shares of the Company's common stock had been issued under the ESPP and
3.9 million shares were available for future issuance under the plan.


Miscellaneous Plan

As of August 30, 2001, 6,000 shares of the Company's common stock had been issued under the 1998 Non-Employee Directors Stock Incentive Plan
("DSIP Plan") and 494,000 shares were reserved for future issuance under the DSIP Plan. Shares are issued under the DSIP plan as compensation to non-employee directors of the Company.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company recognized $0.3 million, $3.9 million and $7.3 million of stock-based compensation in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Pro
forma income and per share data as if the fair value-based accounting method in SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," had been used to account for stock-based compensation
costs is as follows:

The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, the Black-Scholes model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility and option life. Because the Company's stock options granted to employees
have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's
opinion, existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Company's stock options granted to employees. For purposes of this valuation model, no dividends have
been assumed.

At
August 30, 2001, the Company had aggregate U.S. tax loss carryforwards of $38.6 million and U.S. tax credit carryforwards of $34.2 million, all of which expire
in various years through 2021. The Company also has unused state tax net operating loss carryforwards of $449.8 million for tax purposes which expire through 2021 and unused state tax credits
of $93.3 million for tax and financial reporting purposes which expire through 2015. The changes in valuation allowance of $57.4 million and $15.4 million in 2001 and 2000,
respectively, are primarily due to uncertainties of realizing certain net operating losses and certain tax credit carryforwards. Provision has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of
non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that dividend payments from such companies are expected to result in additional tax liability. The remaining undistributed earnings of
$242.4 million have been indefinitely reinvested; therefore, no provision has been made for taxes due upon remittance of these earnings. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax
liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable.

Minority Interests

Minority interests for 2001, 2000 and 1999 includes minority shareholders' interest in the SpecTek component recovery business and the Web-hosting
Operation. The component recovery business was purchased by the Company from MEI on April 5, 2001, at which time it became a wholly-owned operation of the Company and, as a result, the Company
no longer recorded minority interest in the earnings of the component recovery business after April 5, 2001. Approximately $18.1 million, $54.3 million and $17.7 million of
minority interest is attributable to the earnings of the component recovery business for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Discontinued PC Operations

On May 31, 2001, MEI completed the disposition of its PC business to Gores Technology Group ("GTG"). In connection with the disposal, GTG received
assets, including $76.5 million in cash, and


assumed specified liabilities of the PC Operations. Summary operating results for the discontinued PC Operations follow:

Operating Segment Information

The Company's reportable segments have been determined based on the nature of its operations and products offered to customers. Through 2001, the Company's two
reportable segments were Semiconductor Operations and Web-hosting Operations. As a result of the Interland Merger, the Company's only reportable segment is Semiconductor Operations. The
Semiconductor Operations segment's primary product is DRAM. The Web-hosting Operations segment provided web-hosting and other internet products and services. Other segments
primarily reflect activity of the Company's former flat-panel display and radio frequency identification devices operations.

The
accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the "Significant Accounting Policies" note. Segment operating results are measured based on operating income
(loss). Segment assets consist of assets that are identified to reportable segments and reviewed by the chief operating decision makers. Included in segment assets are cash, investment securities,
accounts receivable, inventories and property, plant and equipment. Deminimus amounts of intersegment eliminations of sales, operating income, capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization
have been included with Other.

Report of Independent Accountants

To
the Board of Directors and

Shareholders of Micron Technology, Inc.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Micron
Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries at August 30, 2001 and August 31, 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended August 30, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements
and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and the financial statement schedule
based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
