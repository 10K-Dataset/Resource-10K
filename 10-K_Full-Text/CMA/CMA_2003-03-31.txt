PART I

Item 1. Business

GENERAL

Comerica Incorporated (“Comerica” or the “Corporation”) is a multi-state financial services
provider, incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, headquartered in Detroit,
Michigan. Based on assets as of December 31, 2002, it was among the 20 largest banking companies in the United States and the largest bank holding company headquartered in Michigan
in terms of both total assets and total deposits. Comerica was formed in 1973 to acquire the
outstanding common stock of Comerica Bank (formerly Comerica Bank-Detroit), one of
Michigan’s oldest banks (“Comerica Bank”). Since that time, Comerica has acquired financial
institutions in California, Texas and Florida, and, in 1997, formed Comerica Bank-Mexico, S.A.
and Comerica Bank-Canada. In 2001, Comerica established its Canadian branch and the assets
and the majority of the liabilities of Comerica Bank-Canada were transferred to Comerica Bank’s
Canadian branch. As of December 31, 2002, Comerica owned directly or indirectly all the
outstanding common stock of five active banking and fifty-four non-banking subsidiaries. At
December 31, 2002, Comerica had total assets of approximately $53 billion, total deposits of
approximately $42 billion, total loans (net of unearned income) of approximately $42 billion and
common shareholders’ equity of approximately $5 billion.



BUSINESS STRATEGY

Comerica has strategically aligned its operations into three major lines of business: the Business
Bank, the Individual Bank and the Investment Bank. The Business Bank is comprised of middle
market lending, asset-based lending, large corporate banking, international financial services and
speciality businesses, including technology and life sciences, specialty deposit gathering and
entertainment lending. This line of business meets the needs of medium-size businesses,
multinational corporations and governmental entities by offering various products and services,
including commercial loans and lines of credit, deposits, cash management, capital market
products, international trade finance, letters of credit, foreign exchange management services and
loan syndication services.

The Individual Bank includes consumer lending, consumer deposit gathering, mortgage loan
origination, small business banking (annual sales under $10 million) and private banking. This
line of business offers a variety of consumer products, including deposit accounts, installment
loans, credit cards, student loans, home equity lines of credit and residential mortgage loans. In
addition, a full range of financial services is provided to small businesses and municipalities.
Private lending and personal trust services are also provided to meet the personal financial needs
of affluent individuals (as defined by individual net income or wealth).

The Investment Bank is responsible for institutional trust products, retirement services and
provides investment management and advisory services (including Munder), investment banking
and discount securities brokerage services. This line of business also offers the sale of mutual
fund and annuity products, as well as life, disability and long-term care insurance products.

Comerica has positioned itself to deliver financial services in its four primary geographic
markets: Michigan, California, Texas, and Florida, with operations in numerous other states,
Canada and Mexico.

In addition to the three major lines of business, the Finance segment is also significant. The
Finance segment includes Comerica’s securities portfolio and asset and liability management
activities. This segment is responsible for managing Comerica’s funding, liquidity and capital
needs, performing interest sensitivity gap and earnings simulation analysis and executing various
strategies to manage Comerica’s exposure to liquidity and interest rate risks.



SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

Banks, bank holding companies and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state
and federal level. Comerica is subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board
(“FRB”) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “Act”).

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 expanded the activities in which a bank holding company
registered as a financial holding company can engage. The conditions to be a financial holding
company, among others, include the requirement that each depository institution subsidiary of the
holding company be well capitalized and well managed.

Comerica became a financial holding company in 2000. As a financial holding company, in
addition to bank holding company powers, Comerica may affiliate with securities firms and
insurance companies and engage in activities that are financial in nature. Activities that are
“financial in nature” include, but are not limited to: securities underwriting; dealing and market
making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency;
merchant banking; travel agent services; and activities that the FRB has determined to be closely
related to banking. A bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company is
limited to engaging in banking and other activities previously determined by the FRB to be
closely related to banking.

Comerica Bank is chartered by the State of Michigan and is primarily supervised and regulated
by the Division of Financial Institutions, Office of Financial and Insurance Services of the State
of Michigan and the FRB. Comerica Bank-California is chartered by the State of California and
is primarily supervised and regulated by the California Department of Financial Institutions and
the FRB. Comerica Bank-Texas is chartered by the State of Texas and is primarily supervised
and regulated by the Texas Department of Banking and the FRB. Comerica Bank & Trust,
National Association is chartered under federal law and subject to supervision and regulation by
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). Comerica Bank, Comerica Bank-
California, Comerica Bank-Texas and Comerica Bank & Trust, National Association, are
members of the Federal Reserve System (“FRS”). The deposits of all the foregoing banks are
insured by the Bank Insurance Fund (“BIF”) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(“FDIC”) to the extent provided by law. Comerica Bank-Mexico, S.A. is chartered under the
laws of Mexico and is supervised and regulated by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, the
Bank of Mexico, and the Mexican National Banking Commission. Comerica Bank-Canada
(which is in the winding up process, with active operations conducted by the Canadian branch) is
chartered under the laws of Ontario, Canada and is supervised and regulated by the Office of the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada and the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation.



The FRB supervises non-banking activities conducted by companies owned by Comerica Bank,
Comerica Bank-California and Comerica Bank-Texas and the OCC supervises non-banking
activities conducted by companies owned by Comerica Bank & Trust, National Association. In
addition, Comerica’s non-banking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by
various state, federal and self-regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (in the case of Comerica Securities, Inc. and Comerica
Capital Markets Corporation), the Department of Insurance of the State of Michigan (in the case
of Comerica Insurance Services, Inc.), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (in the case
of Munder Capital Management, the Corporation’s investment advisory subsidiary).

In most cases, no FRB approval is required for Comerica to acquire a company, other than a bank
holding company or insured depository institution, engaged in activities that are financial in
nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the FRB. Prior
FRB approval is required before Comerica may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of
more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company or
bank. If any subsidiary bank of Comerica ceases to be “well capitalized” or “well managed”
under applicable regulatory standards, the Federal Reserve Board may place limitations on the
Corporation’s ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding
companies or impose any limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of the Corporation
or any of its affiliates as the Federal Reserve Board finds appropriate and consistent with the
purpose of the Bank Holding Company Act. If the deficiencies persist, the Federal Reserve
Board may order Comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or cease to engage in any activities
permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies.
Alternatively, Comerica may elect to conform its non-banking activities to those permissible for
a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company. If any subsidiary bank of
Comerica receives a rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 of less than
satisfactory, Comerica will be prohibited from engaging in new activities not permissible for
non-financial holding companies/bank holding companies or acquiring companies other than
bank holding companies or banks.

Various governmental requirements, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act
and Regulation W, limit borrowings by Comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries from its affiliate
insured depository institutions, and also limit various other transactions between Comerica and
its nonbank subsidiaries, on the one hand, and its affiliate insured depository institutions, on the
other. For example, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act limits to no more than 10% of its
total capital, the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s loans and
other “covered transactions” with any particular nonbank affiliate, and limits to no more than
20% of its total capital, the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s
covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates. Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act
also generally requires that an insured depository institution’s loans to its nonbank affiliates be
secured, and Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act generally requires that an insured
depository institution’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on arms-length terms.



Set forth below are summaries of selected laws and regulations applicable to Comerica and its
subsidiaries. The summaries are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by references to
the particular statutes and regulations, and are not intended as legal advise that should be relied
upon for any reason. A change in applicable law or regulation could have a material effect on the
business of Comerica.

Interstate Banking and Branching

Pursuant to the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the
“Interstate Act”), a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state,
without regard to the permissibility of such acquisition under state law, but subject to any state
requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to
exceed five years, and the requirement that the bank holding company, prior to and following the
proposed acquisition, control no more than ten percent of the total amount of deposits of insured
depository institutions in the United States and no more than thirty percent of such deposits in
that state (or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than thirty percent).

The Interstate Act also authorizes banks to acquire branch offices outside their home states by
merging with out-of-state banks, purchasing branches in other states and establishing de novo
branches in other states, thereby creating interstate branching; provided that in the case of
purchasing branches and establishing new branches in a state in which it does not already have
banking operations in such state, such state must have “opted-in” to the Act by enacting a law
permitting such de novo branching and, in the case of mergers, such state must not have “opted-
out” of that portion of the Act.

Since the provision permitting interstate bank acquisitions became effective, Comerica has had
enhanced opportunities to acquire banks in any state, subject to approval by the appropriate
federal and state regulatory agencies. Under the Interstate Act, Comerica has the opportunity to
consolidate its affiliate banks to create one bank with branches in more than one state, or to
establish branches in different states, subject to any state “opt-in” and “opt-out” provisions.

Dividends

Comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries. Most of
Comerica’s revenues result from dividends its bank subsidiaries pay it. There are statutory and
regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to Comerica
as well as by Comerica to its shareholders. Certain, but not all, of these requirements are
discussed below.

Each state bank subsidiary that is a member of the FRS and each national banking association is
required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the FRB or the OCC, as the case may be,
for the declaration and payment of dividends, if the total of all dividends declared by the board of
directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of (i) such bank’s retained net
income (as



defined and interpreted by regulation) for that year plus (ii) the retained net income
(as defined and interpreted by regulation) for the preceding two years, less any required transfers
to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock. Further, federal regulatory agencies can
prohibit a banking institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe and unsound
business practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends if such payment could be deemed
an unsafe and unsound banking practice. In addition, Comerica’s state bank subsidiaries are also
subject to limitations under state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as
dividends, and require prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels.

At January 1, 2003, Comerica’s subsidiary banks, without obtaining prior governmental
approvals, could declare aggregate dividends of approximately $101 million from retained net
profits of the preceding two years, plus an amount approximately equal to the net profits (as
measured under current regulations), if any, earned for the period from January 1, 2003 through
the date of declaration. Comerica’s subsidiary banks paid dividends of $647 million in 2002,
$578 million in 2001, and $339 million in 2000.

Source of Strength

According to Federal Reserve Board policy, bank holding companies are expected to act as a
source of strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support each subsidiary
bank. This support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to
provide such support. Similarly, under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act, in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC (either as a result of the
default of a banking or thrift subsidiary or related to FDIC assistance provided to a subsidiary in
danger of default) the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the FDIC’s loss, subject to
certain exceptions.

FDICIA

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (“FDICIA”) requires, among other
things, the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository
institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital
tiers: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly
undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital tier will
depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures, which,
among others, include a Tier 1 and total risk-based capital measure and a leverage ratio capital
measure, and certain other factors.

Regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that, for a depository institution to be
well capitalized it must have a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10 percent, a Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio of at least 6 percent, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 percent and not be
subject to any specific capital order or directive. For an institution to be adequately capitalized it
must have a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of
at least 4 percent and a Tier 1



leverage ratio of at least 4 percent (and in some cases 3 percent).
Under certain circumstances, the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized,
adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower
capital category. As of December 31, 2002, each of the banking subsidiaries of Comerica were
well capitalized under these regulations.

FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution
(including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the
depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository
institutions are subject to limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit
an acceptable capital restoration plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan
without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is
likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. In addition, for a capital
restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution’s parent holding company must
guarantee for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital restoration
plan. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the
lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5 percent of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it
became undercapitalized, or (ii) the amount that is necessary (or would have been necessary) to
bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such
institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit
or implement an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized.

Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and
restrictions. Specifically, such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the
following, among other things: sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized,
reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits, reduce its rate of asset growth, dismiss certain senior
executive officers or directors, and stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks. Critically
undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such
other action as the FDIC and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate.

FDICIA also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository
institutions including reporting requirements, regulatory standards for real estate lending, “truth
in savings” provisions, the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to
customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the
acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized
or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the FDIC. Comerica’s United
States subsidiary banks are all well-capitalized and may accept brokered deposits.



Capital Requirements

The FRB imposes, on Comerica, risk-based capital requirements and guidelines, which are
substantially similar to the capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the OCC and the
FDIC on depository institutions under their jurisdictions.

For this purpose, a depository institution’s or holding company’s assets and certain specified off-
balance sheet commitments are assigned to four risk categories, each weighted differently based
on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments. A depository
institution’s or holding company’s capital, in turn, is divided into two tiers: core (“Tier 1”)
capital, which includes common equity, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited
amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus (excluding auction rate
issues) and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual stock and minority interests in equity
accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets and
certain other assets; and supplementary (“Tier 2”) capital, which includes, among other items,
perpetual preferred stock not meeting the Tier 1 definition, mandatory convertible securities,
subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations, less
certain required deductions.

The Corporation, like other bank holding companies, currently is required to maintain Tier 1 and
“total capital” (the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) equal to at least 4% and 8% of its total risk-
weighted assets (including certain off-balance-sheet items, such as standby letters of credit),
respectively. At December 31, 2002, the Corporation met both requirements, with Tier 1 and
total capital equal to 8.05% and 11.72% of its total risk-weighted assets.

The FRB, FDIC and OCC rules require Comerica to incorporate market and interest rate risk
components into their risk-based capital standards. Under the market risk requirements, capital is
allocated to support the amount of market risk related to a financial institution’s ongoing trading
activities. The FRB also requires bank holding companies to maintain a minimum “leverage
ratio” (Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets) of 3% if the holding company has the highest
regulatory rating and meets certain other requirements, or of 3% plus an additional cushion of at
least 100 to 200 basis points if the holding company does not meet these requirements. At
December 31, 2002, the Corporation’s leverage ratio was 9.29%.

As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository
institutions, FDICIA requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain non-capital
safety and soundness standards for institutions they supervise. The standards relate generally to,
among others, earnings, liquidity, operations and management, asset quality, various risk and
management exposures (e.g. credit, operational, market, interest rate, etc.) and executive
compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet
such standards.

FDIC Insurance Assessments

Comerica’s subsidiary banks are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments to maintain the
Bank



Insurance Fund (the “BIF”) and the Savings Insurance Fund (the “SAIF”). As of December
31, 2002, the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries held approximately $39.7 billion and $1.1
billion, respectively, of BIF- and SAIF- assessable deposits. The Corporation currently pays no
deposit insurance assessments on these deposits under the FDIC’s risk related assessment system,
but could be required to pay insurance assessments in 2003.

Enforcement Powers of Federal Banking Agencies

The FRB and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers, including the
power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal
penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with applicable laws,
regulations and supervisory agreements could subject Comerica or its banking subsidiaries, as
well as officers and directors of these organizations, to administrative sanctions and potentially
substantial civil penalties.

Future Legislation

Changes to the laws of the states and countries in which the Corporation and its subsidiaries do
business can affect the operating environment of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries
in substantial and unpredictable ways. Comerica cannot accurately predict whether such changes
will occur or, if they occur, the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or
results of operations of the Corporation.

COMPETITION

Financial service provision is a highly competitive business. The Michigan banking subsidiary of
the Corporation competes primarily with banks based in the Midwest region of the United States
for loans, deposits and trust accounts. Through its offices in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois,
Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, Nevada, New York,
Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and Washington, Comerica competes with
other financial institutions for various deposits, loans and other products and services.

At year-end 2002, Comerica was the largest financial holding company headquartered in
Michigan in terms of total assets and deposits. Based on the Interstate Act as described above and
the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act, Comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic
markets will increase in the future. Comerica’s banking subsidiaries also face competition from
other financial intermediaries, including savings and loan associations, consumer finance
companies, leasing companies, credit unions, banks, insurance companies and securities firms.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2002, Comerica and its subsidiaries had 10,368 full-time and 1,440
part-time employees.

Item 2. Properties

The executive offices of the Corporation are located in the Comerica Tower at Detroit Center,
500 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, Michigan 48226. Comerica and its subsidiaries occupy 14
floors of the building, which is leased through Comerica Bank from an unaffiliated third party.
This lease extends through January 2007. As of December 31, 2002, Comerica, through its
banking affiliates, operates a total of 511 banking branches, trust services locations, and loan
production or other financial services offices, in the States of Michigan, California, Texas and
Florida. Of these, 226 were owned and 285 were leased. Affiliates also operate from leased
spaces in Phoenix, Arizona; Denver Colorado; Atlanta, Georgia; Barrington, Chicago and
Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois; Indianapolis, Indiana; New Orleans, Louisiana; Boston,
Massachusetts; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Durham and Charlotte, North Carolina; Princeton and
Red Bank, New Jersey; Las Vegas, Nevada; New York, New York; Beachwood, West Chester,
Westlake and Cincinnati, Ohio; Portland, Oregon; King of Prussia, Pennsylvania; Knoxville and
Memphis, Tennessee; Reston, Virginia; Kirkland and Olympia, Washington; Sao Paulo, Brazil;
Guadalajara, Mexico; Mexico City, Mexico; Queretaro, Mexico; Monterey, Mexico; Wanchai,
Hong Kong; and Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The Corporation owns a check processing center in Livonia, Michigan; a ten-story building in the
central business district of Detroit that houses certain departments of the Corporation and
Comerica Bank; and a building in Auburn Hills, Michigan, used mainly for lending functions and
operations.

In 1983, Comerica entered into a sale/leaseback agreement with an unaffiliated party covering an
operations center which was built in Auburn Hills, Michigan, and now is occupied by various
departments of the Corporation and Comerica Bank.



Item 3. Legal Proceedings

The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to various pending and threatened
legal proceedings, including certain purported class actions, arising out of the normal course of
business or operations. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such
matters, the Corporation cannot state what the eventual outcome of any such matters will be;
however, based on current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel, management
does not believe that the amount of any resulting liability arising from these matters will have a
material adverse effect on the Corporation’s consolidated financial position or results from
operations.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

The Corporation did not submit any matters for a shareholders’ vote in the fourth quarter of
2002.

initially approved by the shareholders on May 16, 1997, with the most recent amendments to the plan, which
required shareholder approval, approved on May 22, 2001.

(2)

Does not include shares of Common Stock purchased by employees under the Corporation Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, or contributed by the Corporation on behalf of the employees.

(3)

These shares are available for future issuance under the Corporation’s Amended and Restated 1997 Long-Term
Incentive Plan in the form of options, restricted stock, and other performance or non-performance related awards.
Not more than a total of 2.4 million shares may be used for restricted stock awards and not more than 2 million are
available for issuance pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options. No eligible individual during any calendar
year may receive more than the lesser of (i) 15% of the Shares available for Awards during such calendar year, or
(ii) 350,000 Shares. As of December 31, 2002, the Corporation had granted 376,833 shares of restricted stock to its
employees.



(4)

Consists of options to acquire shares of Common Stock, par value $5.00 per share, issued under the Amended
and Restated Comerica Incorporated Stock Option Plan for Non-employee Directors of Comerica Bank and
Affiliated Banks.

Most of the equity awards made by the Corporation are granted under the shareholder approved
Amended and Restated 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Plans not approved by Comerica’s
shareholders include:

Amended and Restated Comerica Incorporated Stock Option Plan for Non-employee Directors of
Comerica Bank and Affiliated Banks — Under this Plan, the Corporation may grant options to
acquire up to 450,000 shares of Common Stock, subject to equitable adjustment upon the
occurrence of events such as stock splits, stock dividends or recapitalizations. After each annual
meeting of shareholders, each member of the Board of Directors of a subsidiary bank of the
Corporation who is not an employee of the Corporation or of any of its subsidiaries will be
automatically granted an option to purchase 2,000 shares of the common stock of the
Corporation. Option grants under the Plan are in addition to annual retainers, meeting fees and
other compensation payable to non-employee directors in connection with their services as
directors. The Plan is administered by a committee of the Board of Directors. With respect to the
automatic grants, the Committee does not have discretion with respect to matters such as the
selection of directors to whom options will be granted, the timing of grants, the number of shares
to become subject to each option grant, the exercise price of options, or the periods of time
during which any option may be exercised. In addition to the automatic grants, the Committee
may grant options to the non-employee directors in its discretion. The exercise price of each
option granted is the fair market value of each share of common stock subject to the option on
the date the option is granted. The exercise price is payable in full upon exercise of the option
and may be paid in cash or by delivery of previously owned shares. The Committee may change
the option price per share following a corporate reorganization or recapitalization so that the
aggregate option price for all shares subject to each outstanding option prior to the change is
equivalent to the aggregate option price for all shares or other securities into which option shares
have been converted or which have been substituted for option shares. The term of each option
cannot be more than ten years.

Three-Year Incentive Plan — The Corporation grants cash awards to its eligible employees in
accordance with the terms of its incentive plans based on performance of the Corporation over
specified three year periods. The Corporation pays the award to each of the executive officers in
cash and fifty percent of the award automatically is invested in shares of non-transferable
common stock. If



the participant defers the award, one hundred percent of deferred awards are
deemed invested in Comerica common stock and are paid out in common stock. Executives may
not transfer stock awarded through this program until the executive’s employment with Comerica
terminates.

Employee Service Award Program  — This program provides a method to recognize and reward
employees for attaining specified years of service. From 1993 to December 31, 2002, the
Corporation issued 49,509 shares of Common Stock under this program. Each year, the Corporation authorizes the awards
of shares to employees who attain the requisite years of service. Currently under the program
employees receive 4, 5, 7 and 10 shares of common stock for attaining ten, fifteen, twenty and
twenty-five years of service, respectively. The number of shares awarded each year depends on
the employees who attain the requisite years of service. For the year
to date 2003, the Corporation has
issued 695 shares of Common Stock under this program.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan — Under the Corporation’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
“ESPP”), a total of 1.4 million shares of the Corporation’s common stock have been registered
for sale to eligible Corporation employees. Under the ESPP, participating employees have a
convenient and affordable way to purchase shares of Comerica Incorporated common stock,
through after-tax payroll deductions without being charged a brokerage fee. The Corporation
provides a 15 percent quarterly match and a 5 percent retention match on shares of Common
Stock held by the participants in the plan for two years. Matches are not made on employee
contributions over $25,000 per year. Under the ESPP, the Corporation common stock is
generally purchased in the open market by the ESPP plan administrator as soon as practicable
under the plan.

Directors Deferred Compensation Plans  —  The Corporation maintains two deferred
compensation plans for non-employee directors of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, the
Common Stock Deferral Plan and the Director Fee Deferral Plan. The Common Stock Deferral
Plan provides for the mandatory deferral of 50% of the annual retainer of each director of the
Corporation into shares of common stock of the Corporation. Such directors voluntarily may
defer the remaining 50% of their director fees and all other non-employee directors of the
Corporation’s subsidiaries may choose to defer up to 100% of their director fees into the
Common Stock Deferral Plan or into the Director Fee Deferral Plan which permits non-
corporation stock investments, or a combination of the two plans. The directors’ accounts under
the plans are increased in connection with the payment of dividends or other distributions paid on
the Corporation common stock to reflect the number of additional shares of Corporation common
stock that could have been purchased had the dividends or other distributions been paid on each
share of common stock underlying then outstanding stock units in the directors’ accounts.
Common Stock units are payable following termination of service as a director out of shares of
the Corporation’s common stock held in the plan.



1999 Deferred Compensation Plan  —  The Corporation maintains a Deferred Compensation Plan
for its eligible employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. The employees may voluntarily
defer specified portions of their salary and bonus into shares of common stock of the
Corporation. The employees’ accounts under the plan are increased in connection with the
payment of dividends or other distributions paid on the Corporation’s common stock to reflect
the number of additional shares of the Corporation’s common stock that could have been
purchased had the dividends or other distributions been paid on each share of common stock
underlying then outstanding stock units in the employees’ accounts. The deferred compensation
is payable following termination of service as an employee out of shares of the Corporation’s
common stock held in the plan.

effectiveness of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in

consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Corporation’s periodic filings under the
Exchange Act.

(B)  Changes in Internal Controls.

Since the Evaluation Date, there have not been any significant changes in the Corporation’s

materially form historical performance:

•

general political and economic conditions, either domestically or internationally, may be
less favorable that expected;

•

Latin America may continue to experience economic, political and social uncertainties;

•

developments concerning credit quality in various industry sectors may result in an
increase in the level of the Corporation’s provision for credit losses, nonperforming
assets, net charge-offs and reserve for credit losses;





particular types of risk;

•

terrorist activities or other hostilities, which may adversely affect the general economy,
financial and capital markets, specific industries, and the Corporation; and
