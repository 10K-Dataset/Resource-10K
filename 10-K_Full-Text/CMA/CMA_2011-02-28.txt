PART I

Item 1.  Business.

GENERAL

Comerica Incorporated (“Comerica”) is a financial services company, incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, and
headquartered in Dallas, Texas. As of December 31, 2010, it was among the 25 largest commercial bank holding companies in the United States. Comerica was formed in 1973 to acquire the outstanding common stock of Comerica Bank, which at such
time was a Michigan banking corporation and one of Michigan’s oldest banks (formerly Comerica Bank-Detroit). On October 31, 2007, Comerica Bank, a Michigan banking corporation, was merged with and into Comerica Bank, a Texas banking
association (“Comerica Bank”). As of December 31, 2010, Comerica owned directly or indirectly all the outstanding common stock of 2 active banking and 48 non-banking subsidiaries. At December 31, 2010, Comerica had total assets
of approximately $53.7 billion, total deposits of approximately $40.5 billion, total loans (net of unearned income) of approximately $40.2 billion and shareholders’ equity of approximately $5.8 billion.

Pending Acquisition

On
January 18, 2011, Comerica announced it had entered into a definitive agreement, dated January 16, 2011, with Sterling Bancshares, Inc. (“Sterling”) pursuant to which Comerica will acquire all of the outstanding shares of
Sterling common stock in a stock-for-stock transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, each outstanding share of Sterling common stock will be exchanged for 0.2365 shares of Comerica’s common stock upon closing. Following closing of the
transaction, Sterling will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Comerica. The transaction is expected to be completed by mid-year 2011 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the requisite approval of Sterling shareholders and required
regulatory approvals. Sterling is a Houston-based bank holding company with total assets of $5.2 billion at December 31, 2010, which operates banking centers in Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

Comerica has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank, and
Wealth & Institutional Management. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment.

The Business Bank is primarily comprised of the following businesses: middle market, commercial real estate, national dealer services, international finance, global corporate, leasing, financial services,
and technology and life sciences. This business segment meets the needs of medium-size businesses, multinational corporations and governmental entities by offering various products and services, including commercial loans and lines of credit,
deposits, cash management, capital market products, international trade finance, letters of credit, foreign exchange management services and loan syndication services.

The Retail Bank includes small business banking and personal financial services, consisting of consumer lending, consumer deposit gathering and mortgage loan origination. In addition to a full range of
financial services provided to small business customers, this business segment offers a variety of consumer products, including deposit accounts, installment loans, credit cards, student loans, home equity lines of credit and residential mortgage
loans.

Wealth & Institutional Management offers products and services consisting of fiduciary services, private
banking, retirement services, investment management and advisory services, investment banking and discount securities brokerage services. This business segment also offers the sale of annuity products, as well as life, disability and long-term care
insurance products.



The Finance segment includes Comerica’s securities portfolio and asset and liability
management activities. This segment is responsible for managing Comerica’s funding, liquidity and capital needs, performing interest sensitivity analysis and executing various strategies to manage Comerica’s exposure to liquidity, interest
rate risk and foreign exchange risk.

The Other category includes discontinued operations, the income and expense impact of
equity and cash, tax benefits not assigned to specific business segments and miscellaneous other expenses of a corporate nature.

In addition, Comerica has positioned itself to deliver financial services in its four primary geographic markets: Midwest, Western, Texas and Florida.

The Midwest market consists of Michigan, Ohio and Illinois. Currently, Michigan operations represent the significant majority of the
Midwest market.

The Western market consists of the states of California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Washington. Currently,
California operations represent the significant majority of the Western market.

The Texas and Florida markets consist of the
states of Texas and Florida, respectively.

In addition to the four primary geographic markets, Comerica also considers Other
Markets and International as market segments. Other Markets include businesses with a national perspective, Comerica’s investment management and trust alliance businesses as well as activities in all other markets in which Comerica has
operations, except for the International market. The International market represents the activities of Comerica’s international finance division, which provides banking services primarily to foreign-owned, North American-based companies and
secondarily to international operations of North American-based companies.

COMPETITION

The financial services business is highly competitive. Comerica’s banking subsidiaries compete primarily with banks based in its primary areas of operations in the United States for loans, deposits
and trust accounts. Through its offices in Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington, Comerica
competes with other financial institutions for various deposits, loans and/or other products and services.

Based on the
Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the “Interstate Act”) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act as described below, Comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will increase in the
future. In addition to banks, Comerica’s banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries, including savings and loan associations, consumer finance companies, leasing companies, venture capital funds, credit
unions, investment banks, insurance companies and securities firms. Competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase, with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and
nontraditional alternatives. The industry continues to consolidate, which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions, while strengthening the franchises of acquirers.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

Banks, bank holding companies and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state and federal level. Comerica is subject to supervision and regulation at the federal level by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended.

The
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act expanded the activities in which a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company can engage. The conditions to be a financial holding company include, among others, the requirement that each depository
institution subsidiary of the holding company be well capitalized and well managed.

Comerica became a financial holding
company in 2000. As a financial holding company, Comerica may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that are financial in nature. Activities that are “financial in nature” include, but are not
limited to: securities underwriting; securities dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking; travel agent services; and activities that the FRB has determined to be
financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity, provided that it does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of the depository institution or the financial system generally. A bank holding company that is
not also a financial holding company is limited to engaging in banking and other activities previously determined by the FRB to be closely related to banking.

Comerica Bank is chartered by the State of Texas and at the state level is supervised and regulated by the Texas Department of Banking. Comerica Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System
(“FRS”) and supervised and regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Comerica Bank & Trust, National Association is chartered under federal law and is subject to supervision and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency (“OCC”). Comerica Bank & Trust, National Association is also a member of the FRS. The deposits of Comerica Bank and Comerica Bank & Trust, National Association are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) to the extent provided by law.

The FRB supervises non-banking
activities conducted by companies directly and indirectly owned by Comerica. In addition, Comerica’s non-banking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various state, federal and self-regulatory agencies, including, but not
limited to, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (in the case of Comerica Securities, Inc. and Comerica Capital Markets Corporation), the Office of



Financial and Insurance Services of the State of Michigan (in the case of Comerica Securities, Inc. and Comerica Insurance Services, Inc.), and the Securities and Exchange Commission
(in the case of Comerica Securities, Inc., Comerica Capital Markets Corporation and World Asset Management, Inc.).

In most cases, no FRB approval is required for Comerica to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or
incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the FRB. Prior FRB approval, however, is required before Comerica may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of
the assets of a financial or bank holding company or a bank. Comerica’s current rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”) is “outstanding”. If any subsidiary bank of Comerica were to receive a rating under
the CRA of less than “satisfactory”, Comerica would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities. In addition, Comerica is “well capitalized” and “well managed” under FRB standards. If any subsidiary bank of
Comerica were to cease being “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards, the FRB could place limitations on Comerica’s ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for
financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of Comerica or its affiliates. If the deficiencies persisted, the FRB could order Comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any
activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies, or Comerica could elect to conform its non-banking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial
holding company.

Various governmental requirements, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the
FRB’s Regulation W, limit borrowings by Comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries from its affiliate insured depository institutions, and also limit various other transactions between Comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries, on the one hand, and its
affiliate insured depository institutions, on the other. For example, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s loans and other “covered transactions”
with any particular nonbank affiliate to no more than 10% of the institution’s total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no
more than 20% of its total capital. “Covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the
Federal Reserve Board) from the affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. Section 23A of the Federal
Reserve Act also generally requires that an insured depository institution’s loans to its nonbank affiliates be, at a minimum, 100% secured, and Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act generally requires that an insured depository
institution’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on arms-length terms. The Financial Reform Act significantly expands the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization. For example,
commencing in July 2011, the Financial Reform Act will require that the 10% of capital limit on covered transactions begin to apply to financial subsidiaries.

Set forth below are summaries of selected laws and regulations applicable to Comerica and its domestic banks and other subsidiaries. The summaries are not complete, are qualified in their entirety by
references to the particular statutes and regulations, and are not intended as legal advice. A change in applicable law or regulation could have a material effect on the business of Comerica.

Interstate Banking and Branching

The Interstate Banking and Branching
Efficiency Act (the “Interstate Act”), as amended by the Financial Reform Act, permits a bank holding company, with Federal Reserve Board approval, to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding
company’s home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law, but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the
requirement that the bank holding company, prior to and following the proposed acquisition, control no more than 10% of the total amount of



deposits of insured depository institutions in the United States and no more than 30% of such deposits in that state (or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than 30%).
The Interstate Act, as amended, also authorizes banks to operate branch offices outside their home states by merging with out-of-state banks, purchasing branches in other states and by establishing de novo branches in other states, subject to
various conditions. In the case of purchasing branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations, the “host” state must have “opted-in” to the Interstate Act by enacting a law permitting such branch
purchases. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the de novo interstate branching authority of banks beyond what had been permitted under the Interstate Act by eliminating the requirement that a state expressly “opt-in” to de novo branching, in
favor of a rule that de novo interstate branching is permissible if under the law of the state in which the branch is to be located, a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch. Effective July 21, 2011, the
Dodd-Frank Act also requires that a bank holding company or bank be well-capitalized and well-managed (rather than simply adequately capitalized and adequately managed) in order to take advantage of these interstate banking and branching provisions.

As permitted by the Interstate Act, Comerica has consolidated most of its banking business into one bank, Comerica Bank, with
branches in Texas, Michigan, California, Florida and Arizona.

Dividends

Comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries. Most of Comerica’s revenues result from
dividends its bank subsidiaries pay it. There are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to Comerica, as well as by Comerica to its shareholders. Certain, but not all, of these requirements
are discussed below.

Comerica Bank and Comerica Bank & Trust, National Association are required by federal law to
obtain the prior approval of the FRB and/or the OCC, as the case may be, for the declaration and payment of dividends, if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of
(i) such bank’s retained net income (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for that year plus (ii) the retained net income (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to
surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock. At January 1, 2011, Comerica’s subsidiary banks could declare aggregate dividends of approximately $364 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years. Comerica’s
subsidiary banks declared dividends of $28 million in 2010, $49 million in 2009, and $264 million in 2008 without the need for prior governmental approvals.

Further, federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a banking institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends under
circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice. In addition, Comerica Bank is also subject to limitations under Texas state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends, and
requiring prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels.

Source of Strength

FRB regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support
each subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations. Similarly, under the cross-guarantee provisions of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act, in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC (either as a result of the failure of a banking or thrift subsidiary or related to FDIC assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure), the
other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the FDIC’s loss, subject to certain exceptions.



FDICIA

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (“FDICIA”) requires, among other things, the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of
depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital tiers: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized”
and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures, which, among others, include a Tier 1 and total risk-based
capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure.

Regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that, for a
depository institution to be well capitalized, it must have a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5% and not be subject to any specific
capital order or directive. For an institution to be adequately capitalized, it must have a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4% (and in
some cases 3%). Under certain circumstances, the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category.

As of December 31, 2010, Comerica and its banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered
“well capitalized” under these regulations.

FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any
capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to limitations on
growth and certain activities and are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and
is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the institution’s parent holding company must guarantee for a specific time period that the institution
will comply with such capital restoration plan. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5% of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it
became undercapitalized, or (ii) the amount that is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with
the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized.

Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and restrictions. Specifically, such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the
following, among other things: sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits, reduce its rate of asset growth, dismiss certain senior executive officers or directors, or stop accepting
deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such other action as the FDIC and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate.

FDICIA also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including
reporting requirements, regulatory standards for real estate lending, “truth in savings” provisions, the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any
branch, and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the FDIC.

Capital Requirements

Comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the FRB and/or the OCC.



For this purpose, a depository institution’s or holding company’s assets and
certain specified off-balance sheet commitments are assigned to four risk categories, each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments. A depository institution’s or holding
company’s capital, in turn, is divided into two tiers: core (“Tier 1”) capital, which includes common equity, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related
surplus (excluding auction rate issues) and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets; and supplementary (“Tier 2”) capital,
which includes, among other items, perpetual preferred stock not meeting the Tier 1 definition, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt, and allowances for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations, less certain required
deductions. Bank holding companies that engage in trading activities, whose trading activities exceed specified levels, also are required to maintain capital for market risk. Market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account,
foreign exchange, and commodity positions, whether resulting from broad market movements (such as changes in the general level of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, or commodity prices) or from position specific factors.

Comerica, like other bank holding companies, currently is required to maintain Tier 1 and “total capital” (the
sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) equal to at least 4% and 8% of its total risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance-sheet items, such as standby letters of credit), respectively. At December 31, 2010, Comerica met both
requirements, with Tier 1 and total capital equal to 10.13% and 14.54% of its total risk-weighted assets, respectively.

Comerica is also required to maintain a minimum “leverage ratio” (Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets) of 3% to 5%,
depending upon criteria defined and assessed by the FRB. Comerica’s leverage ratio of 11.26% at December 31, 2010 reflects the nature of Comerica’s balance sheet and demonstrates a commitment to capital adequacy.

As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions, FDICIA requires federal bank
regulatory agencies to establish certain non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises. The standards relate generally to, among others, earnings, liquidity, operations and management, asset quality, various
risk and management exposures (

e.g.

, credit, operational, market, interest rate, etc.) and executive compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards.

FDIC Insurance Assessments

Comerica’s subsidiary banks are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”). Additionally, from the fourth quarter of 2008 through
June 30, 2010, Comerica and its subsidiary banks elected to participate in the FDIC’s Transaction Account Guarantee Program that requires the payment of additional insurance premiums to the FDIC. In April 2010, the FDIC adopted an interim
rule extending the Transaction Account Guarantee Program (“TAGP”) through December 31, 2010 for financial institutions that desired to continue TAGP participation. Comerica and its subsidiary banks elected to opt-out of the
FDIC’s TAGP extension, effective July 1, 2010. In July 2010, the Financial Reform Act reinstated, for all financial institutions, unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest-bearing accounts for the period from December 31, 2010
through December 31, 2012.

As of December 31, 2010, Comerica’s banking subsidiaries held approximately
$40 billion of DIF-assessable deposits. Prior to 2007, Comerica’s banking subsidiaries had not paid nor been assessed deposit insurance assessments on DIF-assessable deposits under the FDIC’s risk related assessment system. The
FDIC’s risk related assessment system was revised effective January 1, 2007, however, and Comerica’s banking subsidiaries were assessed deposit insurance premiums on a quarterly basis, beginning in June 2007. In 2008, these assessment
premiums totaled $26.8 million and were first applied against the remaining credit of $17.1 million. During the second quarter of 2009, the FDIC levied an industry-wide special assessment charge on



insured financial institutions as part of the agency’s efforts to rebuild DIF. In November 2009, the FDIC amended regulations that required insured institutions to prepay their estimated
quarterly risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010-2012. The prepaid assessments will be applied against future quarterly assessments (as they may be so revised) until the prepaid assessment is exhausted or the
balance of the prepayment is returned, whichever occurs first. Comerica paid such prepaid assessment on December 30, 2009, along with its regular quarterly risk-based deposit insurance assessment for the third quarter of 2009. In 2009, these
assessment premiums totaled $281 million, including the second quarter special assessment of $29 million and prepaid assessments of $200 million (which includes assessments that will be expensed by Comerica during 2010-2012). In 2010,
the assessment premiums applied against the prepayment totaled $50 million. The remaining prepayment at December 31, 2010 was $150 million, against which 2011 and 2012 DIF assessments will be applied.

In addition, on January 12, 2010, the FDIC announced that it would seek public comment on whether financial institutions with
compensation plans that encourage risky behavior should be charged higher deposit assessment rates than such financial institutions would otherwise be charged.

The FDIC is not precluded from changing assessment rates or from further revising the risk-based assessment system during the prepayment period or thereafter. Thus, Comerica may also be required to pay
significantly higher FDIC insurance assessments premiums in the future because market developments significantly depleted DIF and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits.

Enforcement Powers of Federal Banking Agencies

The FRB and other federal
banking agencies have broad enforcement powers, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could
subject Comerica or its banking subsidiaries, as well as officers and directors of these organizations, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties.

Capital Purchase Program

Pursuant to the Capital Purchase Program, on
November 14, 2008, Comerica issued to the U.S. Treasury, in exchange for aggregate consideration of $2.25 billion, (1) 2.25 million shares of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series F, no par value (the
“Series F Preferred Stock”), and (2) a warrant to purchase 11,479,592 shares of Comerica’s common stock at an exercise price of $29.40 per share (the “Warrant”). The number of shares of common stock to be issued
pursuant to the Warrant and the exercise price of the Warrant are subject to anti-dilution and other adjustments from time to time following, among other things, stock splits, subdivisions or combinations, certain issuances of common stock or
convertible securities and certain repurchases of common stock. The Series F Preferred Stock (a) had a liquidation amount per share equal to $1,000 for an aggregate value of $2.25 billion and (b) paid a cumulative annual dividend
of five percent (5%) for the first five years and nine percent (9%) on an annual basis thereafter. The Warrant expires ten years from the issuance date. Both the Series F Preferred Stock and the Warrant were accounted for as
components of Comerica’s regulatory Tier 1 capital. The letter agreement between the U.S. Treasury and Comerica, dated November 14, 2008, including the securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) concerning the
issuance and sale of the Series F Preferred Stock and the Warrant, granted the holders of the Series F Preferred Stock, the Warrant and Comerica common stock to be issued under the Warrant certain registration rights and imposed
restrictions on dividend and stock repurchases. For example, during Comerica’s participation in the Capital Purchase Program, Comerica was limited, without the consent of the U.S. Treasury, in its ability to (i) increase its quarterly
dividend above $0.33 per common share (the quarterly dividend rate in effect as of November 14, 2008) or (ii) repurchase any of its shares with limited exceptions, most significantly purchases in connection with benefit plans. In addition,
the terms of Purchase Agreement subjected Comerica to certain executive compensation limitations as set forth in the EESA.



On March 17, 2010, Comerica fully redeemed the Series F Preferred Stock previously
issued to the U.S. Treasury, and Comerica exited the Capital Purchase Program. Also, in May 2010, Comerica registered the Warrant with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Treasury auctioned the Warrant to the public. Prior to such
registration and public sale, the Warrant was separated into 11,479,592 warrants to purchase one share of Comerica’s common stock at an exercise price of $29.40 per share. The warrants are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. For
additional details about the Capital Purchase Program, please refer to pages 36 through 38 under the caption “Capital” and Note 14 on pages 117 through 118 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in
Comerica’s Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program

Among other programs and actions taken by the U.S. regulatory agencies during the financial crisis, the FDIC implemented
the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (“TLGP”) to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system. The TLGP was comprised of the Debt Guarantee Program (“DGP”) and the Transaction Account Guarantee Program
(“TAGP”). The DGP guaranteed all newly issued senior unsecured debt (e.g., promissory notes, unsubordinated unsecured notes and commercial paper) up to prescribed limits issued by participating entities beginning on October 14,
2008 and continuing through October 31, 2009. For eligible debt issued by that date, the FDIC provided the guarantee coverage until the earlier of the maturity date of the debt or December 31, 2012 (or June 30, 2012 for debt issued
prior to April 1, 2009). The TAGP offered full guarantee for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts held at FDIC-insured depository institutions. The unlimited deposit coverage was voluntary for eligible institutions and was in addition to
the $250,000 FDIC deposit insurance per account that was included as part of the EESA. The TAGP coverage became effective on October 14, 2008.

Initially, the TLGP programs, the DGP and TAGP, were provided at no cost for the first 30 days. On November 3, 2008, the FDIC extended the opt-out period to December 5, 2008 to provide
eligible institutions additional time to consider the terms before making a final decision regarding participation in the program through December 31, 2009. On December 5, 2008, Comerica announced that it and two of its subsidiaries,
Comerica Bank and Comerica Bank & Trust, National Association, formally elected to continue their participation in the TLGP. Participants in the DGP were charged an annualized fee ranging from 50 basis points (bps) to 100 bps (depending on
the maturity of the debt issued) multiplied by the amount of debt issued, and calculated for the maturity period of that debt, or through June 30, 2012, whichever is earlier. Based on the terms of the DGP, Comerica Bank could have issued up to
approximately $5.2 billion of qualifying senior debt securities covered by the DGP. As of December 31, 2010, there is no senior unsecured debt outstanding under the DGP.

Effective October 1, 2009, in order to assure an orderly phase out of the TAGP, FDIC extended the TAGP for six months until
June 30, 2010. Any insured depository institution that was participating in the TAG program as of October 1, 2009 was permitted to continue in the TAGP during the extension period that ends on June 30, 2010. The annual assessment rate
that applied to participating institutions during the extension period is either 15 basis points, 20 basis points or 25 basis points, depending on the “Risk Category” assigned to the institution under the FDIC’s risk-based premium
system. Any institution participating in the TAG program as of October 1, 2009 that desired to opt out of the TAG extension was required to submit its opt-out election to the FDIC on or before November 2, 2009, and any such election to opt
out was effective on January 1, 2010. In April 2010, the FDIC adopted an interim rule extending the TAGP through December 31, 2010 for financial institutions that desired to continue TAGP participation. Comerica, Comerica Bank
and Comerica Bank & Trust, National Association elected to opt out of such TAGP’s extension period, so they ceased to participate in the TAGP as of July 1, 2010.

However, in July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Financial Reform Act”)
reinstated, for all financial institutions, unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest-bearing and



certain interest-bearing demand deposit accounts for the period from December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2012. For further discussion of the Financial Reform Act, refer to
“The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act” section below in this “Supervisory and Regulation” section.

For additional details about the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, see pages 35 and 36 under the caption “Deposits and Borrowed Funds.”

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

Due to the recent financial crisis, there have been significant changes in the competitive landscape of the financial services industry and an overhaul of the legislative and regulatory landscape with the
passage of the Financial Reform Act, which was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Financial Reform Act provides for, among other matters, increased regulatory supervision and examination of financial institutions, the imposition of more
stringent capital requirements on financial institutions and increased regulation of derivatives and hedging transactions. Provided below is an overview of key elements of the Financial Reform Act relevant to Comerica. Most of the provisions
contained in the Financial Reform Act became effective immediately upon enactment; however, many have delayed effective dates. Implementation of the Financial Reform Act will require many new mandatory and discretionary rules to be made by federal
regulatory agencies over the next several years. The estimates of the impact on Comerica discussed below are based on the limited information currently available and, given the uncertainty of the timing and scope of the impact, are subject to change
until final rulemaking is complete.

•

Interest on Demand Deposits: Allows interest on commercial demand deposits, which could lead to increased cost of commercial demand deposits, depending
on the interplay of interest, deposit credits and service charges.

•

Unlimited Deposit Insurance Extension: Provides unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest-bearing accounts from December 31, 2010 to
December 31, 2012. There will not be a separate assessment for unlimited deposit insurance coverage for this period.

•

Deposit Insurance: Changes the definition of assessment base from domestic deposits to net assets (average consolidated total assets less average
tangible equity), increases the deposit insurance fund’s minimum reserve ratio and permanently increases general deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000. Comerica expects 2011 FDIC insurance expense to remain consistent with the
2010 expense.

•

Derivatives: Allows continued trading of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives. Requires banks to shift energy, uncleared commodities and
agriculture derivatives to a separately capitalized subsidiary within their holding company. Directly impacts client-driven energy derivatives business (approximately $1 million in annual revenue, based on full-year 2010 estimates).

•

Interchange Fee: Limits debit card transaction processing fees that card issuers can charge to merchants. Based on the options currently contemplated
in the draft, estimated annual revenue from debit card PIN and signature-based interchange fees in 2011 is expected to decrease by approximately $13 million to $15 million.

•

Trust Preferred Securities: Prohibits holding companies with more than $15 billion in assets from including trust preferred securities as Tier 1
capital, and allows for a phase-in period of three years, beginning on January 1, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, Comerica had no trust preferred securities outstanding.



The Financial Reform Act also:

•

requires that publicly traded companies give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and “golden parachute” payments, and
authorizes the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials;

•

established a new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Bureau of Consumer
Financial Protection has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The
Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets;

•

weakened the federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal
consumer protection laws; and

•

created a financial stability oversight council that may recommend to the Federal Reserve increasingly strict rules for capital, leverage, liquidity,
risk management and other requirements as companies grow in size and complexity.

The environment in which financial
institutions will operate after the recent financial crisis, including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital, liquidity, supervision, permissible activities, corporate governance and compensation, and changes in fiscal policy may have
long-term effects on the business model and profitability of financial institutions that cannot now be foreseen.

Other Recent Legislative
and Regulatory Developments

In response to global credit and liquidity issues involving a number of financial
institutions, the United States government, particularly the United States Department of the Treasury (the “U.S. Treasury”) and the FDIC, have taken a variety of extraordinary measures over the last couple years designed to restore
confidence in the financial markets and to strengthen financial institutions, including capital injections, guarantees of bank liabilities and the acquisition of illiquid assets from banks. Moreover, the environment in which banking organizations
are operating after the financial crisis has been impacted by recent developments, including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital, liquidity, supervision, permissible activities, and corporate governance and compensation.

On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the “EESA”) was signed into law. Pursuant to the
EESA, the U.S. Treasury was granted the authority to take a range of actions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets and has proposed several programs, including the purchase by the U.S. Treasury of
certain troubled assets from financial institutions (the “Troubled Asset Relief Program”) and the direct purchase by the U.S. Treasury of equity of healthy financial institutions (the “Capital Purchase Program”). The EESA also
temporarily raised the limit on federal deposit insurance coverage provided by the FDIC from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor.

On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the “ARRA”) was signed into law. Section 7001 of the ARRA amended Section 111 of the EESA in its
entirety. On June 10, 2009, the U.S. Treasury released an interim final rule (the “IFR”), effective June 15, 2009, that provided guidance on the compensation and governance standards for Troubled Asset Relief Program
(“TARP”) recipients, and promulgated regulations to implement the restrictions and standards set forth in Section 7001 of the ARRA. Among other things, the IFR and ARRA significantly expanded the executive compensation restrictions
previously imposed by the EESA. Such restrictions apply to any entity that has received or will receive financial



assistance under TARP, and shall generally continue to apply for as long as any obligation arising from financial assistance provided under TARP, including preferred stock issued under the
Capital Purchase Program, remains outstanding. As a result of our participation in the Capital Purchase Program, the restrictions and standards set forth in Section 7001 of the ARRA, as well as the IFR promulgated by the U.S. Treasury, were
applicable to Comerica prior to the redemption of the Series F Preferred Stock on March 17, 2010.

On May 20, 2009,
the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009, which extended the temporary increase in the standard maximum deposit insurance amount provided by the FDIC to $250,000 per depositor through December 31, 2013, was signed into law. This
extension of the temporary $250,000 coverage limit (pursuant to the EESA) became effective immediately upon the President’s signature. The legislation provides that the standard maximum deposit insurance amount provided by the FDIC will return
to $100,000 on January 1, 2014.

On October 22, 2009, the Federal Reserve issued a comprehensive proposal on
incentive compensation policies (the “Incentive Compensation Proposal”) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging
excessive risk-taking. This guidance sets expectations for banking organizations concerning their incentive compensation arrangements and related risk-management, control, and governance processes. The Incentive Compensation Proposal, which covers
all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon three primary principles: (i) balanced risk-taking incentives, (ii) compatibility with
effective controls and risk management, and (iii) strong corporate governance. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to
make acquisitions or perform other actions. In addition, under the Incentive Compensation Proposal, the Federal Reserve in appropriate circumstances may take enforcement action against a banking organization.

On November 12, 2009, the Federal Reserve adopted amendments to its Regulation E, effective July 1, 2010, that prohibit
financial institutions from charging clients overdraft fees on automated teller machines (“ATM”) and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those type of transactions.
Pursuant to the adopted regulation, clients must opt-in to an overdraft service in order for the financial institution to collect overdraft fees. If a consumer does not opt in, any ATM transaction or debit that overdraws the consumer’s account
will be denied. Overdrafts on the payment of checks and regular electronic bill payments are not covered by this new rule. Before opting in, the consumer must be provided a notice that explains the financial institution’s overdraft services,
including the fees associated with the service, and the consumer’s choices. Financial institutions must provide consumers who do not opt in with the same account terms, conditions and features (including pricing) that they provide to consumers
who do opt in.

On January 14, 2010, the current administration announced a proposal to impose a fee (the “Financial
Crisis Responsibility Fee”) on those financial institutions that benefited from recent actions taken by the U.S. government to stabilize the financial system. If implemented as initially proposed, the Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee will be
applied to firms with over $50 billion in consolidated assets, and, therefore, by its terms would apply to Comerica. The Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee was not included in the Financial Reform Act. On February 14, 2011, the administration
included a revised Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee in its proposed fiscal 2012 budget.

Effective July 1, 2010, the
Federal Reserve Board amended Regulation E to prohibit charging overdraft fees for ATM or point-of-sale debit card transactions unless the customer opts-in to the overdraft service. See above in “Other Recent Legislative and Regulatory
Developments” for more information on the Regulation E amendments as previously adopted by the Federal Reserve on November 12, 2009.

In June 2010, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC issued a comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking
organizations do



not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk
profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking
beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective
oversight by the organization’s board of directors. The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations based on the scope and complexity of
the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s
supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management
control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.

During the third quarter 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision revised the Capital Accord (“Basel III”), which
narrows the definition of capital and increases capital requirements for specific exposures. The new capital requirements will be phased-in over six years beginning in 2013. The final package of Basel III reforms was endorsed by G20 leaders on
November 12, 2010, and is subject to individual adoption by member nations, including the United States. If these revisions are adopted as endorsed, we estimate they would have a negligible impact on our regulatory capital ratios based on our
current understanding of the revisions to capital qualification. However, the ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity standards cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors, including treatment and implementation
by the U.S. banking regulators. We await clarification from our banking regulators on their interpretation of Basel III and any additional requirements to the stated thresholds.

On February 7, 2011, the Board of Directors of the FDIC approved a joint proposed rulemaking to implement Section 956 of the
Financial Reform Act. Although the FDIC Board acted on the proposal on February 7, 2011, the proposal is a joint rule making by the five federal members of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FDIC, FRS, OCC, Office of Thrift
Supervision and National Credit Union Administration), the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who must each independently approve the proposed rule before it is published in the Federal Register for comment.
Section 956 prohibits incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive, or that may lead to material losses. Consistent with the Financial Reform
Act, the proposed rule does not apply to banks with total consolidated assets of less than $1 billion, and contains heightened standards for institutions with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, which includes Comerica. For these
larger institutions, the rule requires that at least 50 percent of incentive-based payments be deferred for a minimum of three years for designated executives. Moreover, boards of directors of these larger institutions must identify employees who
individually have the ability to expose the institution to substantial risk, and must determine that the incentive compensation for these employees appropriately balances risk and rewards according to enumerated standards. The proposed rule would
move the U.S. closer to aspects of international compensation standards by (i) requiring deferral of a substantial portion of incentive compensation for executive officers of particularly large institutions described above;
(ii) prohibiting incentive-based compensation arrangements for covered persons that would encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation; (iii) prohibiting incentive-based compensation arrangements for covered persons
that would expose the institution to inappropriate risks by providing compensation that could lead to a material financial loss; (iv) requiring policies and procedures for incentive-based compensation arrangements that are commensurate with the
size and complexity of the institution; and (v) requiring annual reports on incentive compensation structures to the institution’s appropriate Federal regulator.



Future Legislation

Changes to the laws of the states and countries in which Comerica and its subsidiaries do business could affect the operating environment of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries in substantial
and unpredictable ways. Moreover, in light of recent events and current conditions in the U.S. financial markets and economy, Congress and regulators have continued to increase their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry.
Comerica cannot accurately predict whether legislative changes will occur or, if they occur, the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of Comerica.

UNDERWRITING APPROACH

The loan
portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk, so proper loan underwriting is critical to Comerica’s long-term financial success. Comerica extends credit to businesses, individuals and public entities based on sound lending principles
and consistent with prudent banking practice. During the loan underwriting process, a qualitative and quantitative analysis of potential credit facilities is performed, and the credit risks associated with each relationship are evaluated. Important
factors considered as part of the underwriting process for new loans and loan renewals include:

•

People: Including the competence, integrity and succession planning of customers;

•

Purpose: The legal, logical and productive purposes of the credit facility;

•

Payment: Including the source, timing and probability of payment;

•

Protection: Including obtaining alternative sources of repayment, securing the loan, as appropriate, with collateral and/or third-party guarantees and
ensuring appropriate legal documentation is obtained.

•

Perspective: The risk/reward relationship and pricing elements (cost of funds; servicing costs; time value of money; credit risk).

Comerica prices credit facilities to reflect risk, the related costs and the expected return, while
maintaining competitiveness with other banks. Loans with variable and fixed rates are underwritten to achieve expected risk-adjusted returns on the credit facilities and for the full relationship including the borrower’s ability to repay the
principal and interest based on such rates.

Credit Administration

Comerica maintains a Credit Administration Department (“Credit Administration”) which is responsible for the oversight and
monitoring of our loan portfolio. Credit Administration assists with underwriting by providing objective financial analysis, including an assessment of the borrower’s business model, balance sheet, cash flow and collateral. Each borrower
relationship is assigned an internal risk rating by Credit Administration. Further, Credit Administration updates the assigned internal risk rating for every borrower relationship as new information becomes available, either as a result of periodic
reviews of the credit quality or as a result of a change in borrower performance. The goal of the internal risk rating framework is to improve Comerica’s risk management capability, including its ability to identify and manage changes in the
credit risk profile of its portfolio, predict future losses and price the loans appropriately for risk.

Credit Policy

Comerica maintains a comprehensive set of credit policies. Comerica’s credit policies provide individual loan officers, as well as
loan committees, approval authorities based on our internal risk rating system and establish maximum exposure limits based on risk ratings and Comerica’s legal lending limit. Credit



Administration, in conjunction with the businesses units, monitors compliance with the credit policies and modifies the existing policies as necessary. New or modified policies/guidelines require
approval by the Strategic Credit Committee, chaired by Comerica’s Chief Credit Officer and comprising senior credit and market executives.

Commercial and Industrial Loan Portfolio

Commercial and Industrial Loans are underwritten using a comprehensive analysis of the borrower’s operations. The underwriting process includes an analysis of some or all of the factors listed below:

•

The borrower’s business model.

•

Periodic review of financial statements including financial statements audited by an independent certified public accountant when substantial credit
exposure exists.

•

The pro-forma financial condition including financial projections.

•

The borrower’s sources and uses of funds.

•

The borrower’s debt service capacity.

•

The guarantor’s financial strength.

•

A comprehensive review of the quality and value of collateral, including independent third-party appraisals of machinery and equipment and commercial
real estate, as appropriate, to determine the advance rates.

•

Physical inspection of collateral and audits of receivables, as appropriate.

Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Loan Portfolio

Comerica’s CRE loan portfolio consists of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans and includes both loans to real estate investors and developers, and loans secured by owner-occupied
real estate. Comerica’s CRE loan underwriting policies are consistent with the approach described above and provide maximum loan-to-value ratios that limit the size of a loan to a maximum percentage of the value of the real estate collateral
securing the loan. The loan-to-value percentage varies by the type of collateral and is limited by advance rates established by our regulators. Our loan-to-value limitations are, in certain cases, more restrictive than those required by regulators
and are determined by other risk factors such as the financial strength of the borrower or guarantor, the equity provided to the project and the viability of the project itself. CRE loans generally require cash equity. CRE loans are normally
originated with full recourse or limited recourse to all principals and owners. There are limitations to the size of a single project loan and to the aggregate dollar exposure to a single guarantor.

Consumer and Residential Mortgage Loan Portfolios

Comerica’s consumer and residential mortgage loans are originated consistent with the underwriting approach described above, but also includes an assessment of each borrower’s personal financial
condition, including verification of income, assets and FICO score. Comerica does not originate subprime loans. Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, Comerica defines subprime
loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers, including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors. These credit factors include low FICO scores, poor patterns of payment history, high debt-to-income ratios
and elevated loan-to-value. We consider subprime FICO scores to be those



below 620 on a secured basis (excluding loans with cash or near-cash collateral and adequate income to make payments) and below 660 for unsecured loans. Adjustable rate loans are limited to
standard conventional loan programs.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2010, Comerica and its subsidiaries had 8,636 full-time and 729 part-time employees.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.

This Report includes forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, Comerica
may make other written and oral communications from time to time that contain such statements. All statements regarding Comerica’s expected financial position, strategies and growth prospects and general economic conditions Comerica expects to
exist in the future are forward-looking statements. The words, “anticipates,” “believes,” “feels,” “expects,” “estimates,” “seeks,” “strives,” “plans,”
“intends,” “outlook,” “forecast,” “position,” “target,” “mission,” “assume,” “achievable,” “potential,” “strategy,” “goal,”
“aspiration,” “outcome,” “continue,” “remain,” “maintain,” “trend,” “objective” and variations of such words and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as
“will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “might,” “can,” “may” or similar expressions, as they relate to Comerica or its management, are intended to identify forward-looking
statements.

Comerica cautions that forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties,
which change over time. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statement is made, and Comerica does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect facts, circumstances, assumptions or events that occur after the date
the forward-looking statements are made. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance.

In addition to factors mentioned elsewhere in this Report or previously disclosed in Comerica’s SEC reports (accessible on the
SEC’s website at

www.sec.gov

or on Comerica’s website at

www.comerica.com

), the factors contained below, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, and future results could
differ materially from historical performance.

•

General political, economic or industry conditions, either domestically or internationally, may be less favorable than expected.

Local, domestic, and international economic, political and industry specific conditions affect the
financial services industry, directly and indirectly. Conditions such as or related to inflation, recession, unemployment, volatile interest rates, international conflicts and other factors, such as real estate values, energy costs, fuel prices and
government spending and the U.S. national debt, outside of our control may, directly and indirectly, adversely affect Comerica. As has been the case with impact of recent economic conditions, economic downturns could result in the delinquency of
outstanding loans, which could have a material adverse impact on Comerica’s earnings.



•

Governmental monetary and fiscal policies may adversely affect the financial services industry, and therefore impact Comerica’s financial
condition and results of operations.

Monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and
regulatory agencies, in particular the Federal Reserve Board, affect the financial services industry, directly and indirectly. The Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States and its monetary and fiscal
policies determine in a large part Comerica’s cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments. Changes in such policies, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination
of loans, the value of investments, the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits. Changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond Comerica’s control and difficult to predict.
Comerica’s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies.

•

Volatility and disruptions in global capital and credit markets may adversely impact Comerica’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Global capital and credit markets are sometimes subject to periods of extreme volatility
and disruption. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may limit Comerica’s ability to access capital and manage liquidity, which may adversely affect Comerica’s business, financial condition and results
of operations. Further, Comerica’s customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions, which could have a negative impact on Comerica’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

•

The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect Comerica.

Comerica’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of
other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and it routinely executes
transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one
or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led, and may further lead, to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions
could expose Comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. In addition, Comerica’s credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to
recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to Comerica. There is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect, possible materially in nature, Comerica.

•

Changes in regulation or oversight, including actions recently taken or proposed by the United States Department of Treasury, the Texas
Department of Banking, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Bank or other governmental entities, may have a material adverse impact on Comerica’s operations.

Comerica is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the United States Department of Treasury, the Texas
Department of Banking, the FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory bodies. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which Comerica may engage.
Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on Comerica’s operations, investigations and limitations related to Comerica’s securities, the
classification of Comerica’s assets and determination of the level of Comerica’s allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory
action, may have a material adverse impact on Comerica’s business, financial condition or results of operations.



In particular, Congress and other regulators have recently increased their focus on the
regulation of the financial services industry:

On May 20, 2009, the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009, which
extended the temporary increase in the standard maximum deposit insurance amount provided by the FDIC to $250,000 per depositor through December 31, 2013, was signed into law. This extension of the temporary $250,000 coverage limit (pursuant to
the EESA) became effective immediately upon the President’s signature.

During the second quarter of 2009, the FDIC
levied an industry-wide special assessment charge on insured financial institutions as part of the agency’s efforts to rebuild DIF. In November 2009, the FDIC amended regulations that required insured institutions to prepay their estimated
quarterly risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010-2012. The prepaid assessments will be applied against future quarterly assessments (as they may be so revised) until the prepaid assessment is exhausted or the
balance of the prepayment is returned, whichever occurs first. The FDIC is not precluded from changing assessment rates or from further revising the risk-based assessment system during the prepayment period or thereafter. Thus, we may also be
required to pay significantly higher FDIC insurance assessments premiums in the future because market developments significantly depleted DIF and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits.

Comerica’s participation in the TAGP required the payment of additional insurance premiums to the FDIC through June 30, 2010,
in addition to the FDIC’s regular and special assessments. Additionally, in July 2010, the Financial Reform Act reinstated, for all financial institutions, unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest-bearing accounts for the period from
December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2012.

In November 2009, the Federal Reserve adopted amendments to its
Regulation E that were effective on July 1, 2010. The changes affect the circumstances when Comerica is able to charge its clients overdraft fees.

On January 14, 2010, the current administration announced a proposal to impose a fee (the “Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee”) on those financial institutions that benefited from recent
actions taken by the U.S. government to stabilize the financial system. If implemented as initially proposed, the Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee will be applied to firms with over $50 billion in consolidated assets, and, therefore, by its terms
would apply to Comerica. On February 14, 2011, the administration included a revised Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee in its proposed fiscal 2012 budget.

On July 21, 2010, the Financial Reform Act was signed into law. The Financial Reform Act implements a variety of far-reaching changes and has been called the most sweeping reform of the financial
services industry since the 1930s. Many of the provisions of the Financial Reform Act will directly affect Comerica’s ability to conduct its business, including, but not limited to:

•

Creation of a financial stability oversight council that may recommend to the Federal Reserve Board increasingly strict rules for capital, leverage,
liquidity, risk management and other requirements as companies grow in size and complexity;

•

Application of the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies, such
as Comerica, which, among other things, will, after a three-year phase-in period which begins January 1, 2013, remove trust preferred securities as a permitted component of a holding company’s Tier 1 capital;

•

Increases in the FDIC assessment for depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more, such as Comerica Bank, and increases the minimum
reserve ratio for the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35%;



•

Repeal of the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on
business transaction and other accounts;

•

Establishment of a consumer financial protection bureau with broad authority to implement new consumer protection regulations and, for bank holding
companies with $10 billion or more in assets, to examine and enforce compliance with federal consumer laws; and

•

Amendment of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) to, among other things, give the Federal Reserve Board the authority to issue rules which are
expected to limit debit-card interchange fees.

Many provisions in the Financial Reform Act remain subject
to regulatory rule-making and implementation, the effects of which are not yet known.

In December 2009, the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) released proposed Basel III guidance on bank capital and liquidity. In September 2010, the Basel Committee proposed higher global minimum capital standards, including a minimum Tier 1 common capital ratio
and additional capital and liquidity requirements, with rules expected to be implemented between 2013 and 2019. Adoption in the U.S. is expected to occur over a similar timeframe, but the final form of the U.S. rules is uncertain.

The effects of such recently enacted legislation and regulatory actions on Comerica cannot reliably be determined at this time. Moreover,
as some of the legislation and regulatory actions previously implemented in response to the recent financial crisis expire, the impact of the conclusion of these programs on the financial sector and on the economic recovery is unknown. Any delay in
the economic recovery or a worsening of current financial market conditions could adversely affect Comerica. We can neither predict when or whether future regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be. The impact
of any future legislation or regulatory actions on Comerica’s businesses or operations cannot be reliably determined at this time, and such impact may adversely affect Comerica.

•

Unfavorable developments concerning credit quality could adversely affect Comerica’s financial results.

Although Comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business
relationships, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. Under such circumstances, Comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses, nonperforming assets, net
charge-offs and reserve for credit losses, which could adversely affect Comerica’s financial results.

•

Comerica’s proposed acquisition of Sterling Bancshares, Inc. may present certain risks to Comerica’s business and operations.

On January 16, 2011, Comerica and Sterling entered into a merger agreement providing for the
acquisition of Sterling by Comerica. The proposed acquisition presents the following risks, among others:

•

the possibility that expected benefits may not materialize in the timeframe expected or at all, or may be more costly to achieve;

•

that the transaction may not be timely completed, if at all;

•

that prior to the completion of the transaction or thereafter, Comerica’s and Sterling’s respective businesses may not perform as expected
due to transaction-related uncertainty or other factors;

•

that the parties are unable to successfully implement integration strategies, due to challenges associated with integrating complex systems,
technology, banking centers, and other assets of



Sterling in a manner that minimizes any adverse effect on customers, suppliers, employees, and other constituencies and integrating Sterling’s workforce while maintaining focus on providing
consistent, high quality customer service;

•

that required regulatory, shareholder or other approvals, including the approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the approval of Sterling
shareholders, are not obtained or other closing conditions are not satisfied in a timely manner or at all;

•

reputational risks and the reaction of the companies’ customers to the transaction; and

•

whether or not completed, the proposed acquisition may require diversion of the attention of Comerica’s management and other key employees from
ongoing business activities, including the pursuit of other opportunities that could be beneficial to Comerica.

•

Comerica may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements.

As discussed above, the Financial Reform Act creates a financial stability oversight council that may recommend to the Federal Reserve
increasingly strict rules for capital requirements as companies grow in size and complexity and applies the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies, which, among
other things, will, after a three-year phase-in period which begins January 1, 2013, remove trust preferred securities as a permitted component of a holding company’s Tier 1 capital. These requirements, and any other new regulations, could
adversely affect Comerica’s ability to pay dividends, or could require Comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition.

In addition, on September 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision, announced agreement on the calibration and phase-in arrangements for a strengthened set of capital requirements, known as Basel III. When fully phased in, Basel III will introduce a minimum Tier 1 common equity ratio to 4.5%,
net of regulatory deductions, and establish a capital conservation buffer of an additional 2.5% of common equity to risk-weighted assets above the regulatory minimum capital requirement, establishing a minimum common equity ratio plus capital
conservation buffer at 7%. This capital conservation buffer will impose capital distribution constraints when the Tier 1 capital ratio falls under 8.5% and the total capital ratio falls under 10.5%. In addition, Basel III introduces a
countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% of common equity or other loss absorbing capital above the regulatory capital minimum plus the capital conservation buffer for periods of excess credit growth. Basel III also introduces a non-risk
adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio based on a measure of total exposure rather than total assets, and new liquidity standards. The Basel III capital and liquidity standards will be phased in over a period of several years. The text of the final Basel
III capital and liquidity rules was published on December 16, 2010, and is now subject to individual adoption by member nations, including the United States.

Banking regulators could implement changes to the capital adequacy standards applicable to Comerica and Comerica Bank in light of Basel III. The ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity standards
cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors, including treatment and implementation by the U.S. banking regulators.

•

Problems faced by residential real estate developers could adversely impact Comerica.

Problems in the United States’ residential real estate development industry, specifically in Michigan (Midwest market) and both
northern and southern California (Western market), have materially and adversely impacted Comerica in recent periods. Recent economic conditions have resulted in decreased demand for residential housing, which, in turn, has adversely affected the
development and construction



efforts of residential real estate developers. Consequently, the ability of such residential real estate developer borrowers to repay these loans and the value of property used as collateral for
such loans has been adversely affected. These problems facing residential real estate developers have had, and the continuation or worsening of such problems may have, a material and adverse impact on the financial results of Comerica.

•

Businesses or industries in which Comerica has lending concentrations, including, but not limited to, the automotive production industry and the
real estate business, could suffer a significant decline which could adversely affect Comerica.

Comerica’s business customer base consists, in part, of lending concentrations in volatile businesses and industries such as the
automotive production industry and the real estate business. Recent economic conditions have significantly impacted such businesses, which has adversely affected Comerica. In the event of further decline in any one of those customers’
businesses or industries, Comerica could experience increased credit losses, and its business could be materially adversely affected.

•

The introduction, implementation, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies, including, but not limited to, the opening
of new banking centers, may be less successful or may be different than anticipated, which could adversely affect Comerica’s business.

Comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products. If Comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product needs,
it could result in Comerica incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue, which could result in a material adverse effect on its business.

•

Utilization of technology to efficiently and effectively develop, market and deliver new products and services.

The financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technology-driven products and
services. The efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Comerica’s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by
using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands and create additional efficiencies in Comerica’s operations. Comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technology-driven products and
services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers, which could have a material adverse impact on Comerica’s financial condition and results of operations.

•

Operational difficulties or information security problems could adversely affect Comerica’s business and operations.

Comerica is exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legal and
compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from computer or telecommunications systems
malfunctions. Comerica may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, which may include, for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages or
natural disasters. Such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to Comerica. In addition there is the risk that Comerica’s controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security
systems prove to be inadequate. Any such occurrences or failures could materially and adversely affect Comerica’s business and operations by exposing it to potential liability to customers, reputational damage and regulatory intervention.



•

Changes in the financial markets, including fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on deposit pricing, could adversely affect
Comerica’s net interest income and balance sheet.

The operations of financial institutions such as
Comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions, the trade, fiscal and
monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit, which in turn significantly affect financial institutions’ net interest
income. Volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation, which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments, such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles, which,
because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements, generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions. Comerica’s financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market
conditions.

•

Competitive product and pricing pressures among financial institutions within Comerica’s markets may change.

Comerica operates in a very competitive environment, which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions
in each market in which it operates. Comerica competes with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions in terms of products and pricing. If Comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and
pricing in its markets, business could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on Comerica’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

Changes in customer behavior may adversely impact Comerica’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Comerica uses a variety of financial tools, models and other methods to anticipate customer behavior as
a part of its strategic planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements. Individual, economic, political, industry-specific conditions and other factors outside of Comerica’s control, such as fuel prices, energy costs, real estate values
or other factors that affect customer income levels, could alter predicted customer borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices. Such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect Comerica’s ability to anticipate
business needs and meet regulatory requirements.

Current economic conditions have negatively affected consumer confidence
levels. A worsening of these conditions would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on Comerica, Comerica’s customers and others in the financial institutions industry.

•

Management’s ability to maintain and expand customer relationships may differ from expectations.

The financial services industry is very competitive. Comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers, but also
competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers. While management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships, Comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships
as its competitors attempt to capture its customers. Failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact Comerica’s earnings.

•

Management’s ability to retain key officers and employees may change.

Comerica’s future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel.
Comerica’s future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management, financial, technical, marketing, sales and support personnel.



Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and Comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. Comerica’s ability to retain key officers and employees may
be further impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and it may be increasingly difficult for Comerica to
hire personnel over time. Comerica’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees, or Comerica’s inability to attract and retain skilled employees.

On February 7, 2011, the Board of Directors of the FDIC approved a joint proposed rulemaking to implement
Section 956 of the Financial Reform Act. Although the FDIC Board acted on the proposal on February 7, 2011, the proposal is a joint rule making by the five federal members of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FDIC,
FRS, OCC, Office of Thrift Supervision and National Credit Union Administration), the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who must each independently approve the proposed rule before it is published in the
Federal Register for comment. Section 956 prohibits incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive, or that may lead to material losses.
Consistent with the Financial Reform Act, the proposed rule does not apply to banks with total consolidated assets of less than $1 billion, and contains heightened standards for institutions with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets,
which includes Comerica. For these larger institutions, the rule requires that at least 50 percent of incentive-based payments be deferred for a minimum of three years for designated executives. Moreover, boards of directors of these larger
institutions must identify employees who individually have the ability to expose the institution to substantial risk, and must determine that the incentive compensation for these employees appropriately balances risk and rewards according to
enumerated standards.

•

Legal and regulatory proceedings and related matters with respect to the financial services industry, including those directly involving Comerica
and its subsidiaries, could adversely affect Comerica or the financial services industry in general.

Comerica has been, and may in the future be, subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings. It is inherently difficult to assess
the outcome of these matters, and there can be no assurance that Comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation. Any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of Comerica’s efforts, which by itself could have a material
adverse effect on Comerica’s financial condition and operating results. Further, adverse determinations in such matters could result in actions by Comerica’s regulators that could materially adversely affect Comerica’s business,
financial condition or results of operations.

•

Methods of reducing risk exposures might not be effective.

Instruments, systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit, market and liquidity,
operational, compliance, business risks and enterprise-wide risk could be less effective than anticipated. As a result, Comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types
of risk, which could have a material adverse impact on Comerica’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

Terrorist activities or other hostilities may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, and
Comerica.

Terrorist attacks or other hostilities may disrupt Comerica’s operations or those of its
customers. In addition, these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the U.S. and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular, which could harm Comerica’s operations. Any of these events
could increase volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets, which could harm



Comerica’s stock price and may limit the capital resources available to Comerica and its customers. This could have a material adverse impact on Comerica’s operating results, revenues
and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of Comerica’s common stock.

•

Catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires and floods, may adversely affect the general economy,
financial and capital markets, specific industries, and Comerica.

Comerica has significant operations
and a significant customer base in California, Texas, Florida and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as tornadoes, hurricanes,
earthquakes, fires and floods. These types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy, Comerica’s business and customers and have posed physical risks to Comerica’s property. A significant catastrophic event
could materially adversely affect Comerica’s operating results.

Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff
Comments.

None.

Item 2.  Properties.

The executive offices of Comerica are located in the Comerica Bank Tower, 1717 Main Street, Dallas, Texas 75201. Comerica Bank leases five floors of the building, plus an additional 34,238 square feet on
the building’s lower level, from an unaffiliated third party. The lease for such space used by Comerica and its subsidiaries extends through September 2023. Comerica and its subsidiaries also currently lease 11 floors in the Comerica Tower at
One Detroit Center, 500 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, Michigan 48226. Such space is leased through Comerica Bank from an unaffiliated third party. The leases at that building extend through January 2012. Comerica is renovating its owned building at 411
W. Lafayette, Detroit, Michigan as its new Michigan headquarters and the majority of its employees at Comerica Tower will be relocated to that building. As of December 31, 2010, Comerica, through its banking affiliates, operated a total of 511
banking centers, trust services locations, and loan production or other financial services offices, primarily in the States of Texas, Michigan, California, Florida and Arizona. Of these offices, 222 were owned and 289 were leased. As of
December 31, 2010, affiliates also operated from leased spaces in Denver, Colorado; Wilmington, Delaware; Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois; Boston and Waltham, Massachusetts; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Princeton and Sea Girt, New Jersey; Las Vegas,
Nevada; New York, New York; Rocky Mount and Cary, North Carolina; Granville, Ohio; Memphis, Tennessee; Reston, Virginia; Bellevue and Seattle, Washington; Monterrey, Mexico; Toronto, Ontario, Canada and Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Comerica and its
subsidiaries own, among other properties, a check processing center in Livonia, Michigan, a 10-story building in the central business district of Detroit, Michigan that houses certain departments of Comerica and Comerica Bank, and three buildings in
Auburn Hills, Michigan, used mainly for lending functions and operations.

Item 3.  Legal
Proceedings.

Comerica and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to various pending or threatened legal proceedings
arising out of the normal course of business or operations. Comerica believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and, with respect to such legal proceedings, intends to
continue to defend itself vigorously, litigating or settling cases according to management’s judgment as to what is in the best interests of Comerica and its shareholders. On at least a quarterly basis, Comerica assesses its liabilities and
contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. On a case-by-case basis, reserves are established for those legal claims for which it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount
of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts



reserved. Based on current knowledge, and after consultation with legal counsel, management believes that current reserves are adequate, and the amount of any incremental liability arising from
these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on Comerica’s consolidated financial condition.

The
damages alleged by plaintiffs or claimants may be overstated, unsubstantiated by legal theory, unsupported by the facts, and/or bear no relation to the ultimate award that a court, jury or agency might impose. In view of the inherent difficulty of
predicting the outcome of such matters, Comerica cannot state with confidence a range of reasonably possible losses, nor what the eventual outcome of these matters will be. However, based on current knowledge and after consultation with legal
counsel, management believes the maximum amount of reasonably possible losses would not have a material adverse effect on Comerica’s consolidated financial condition.

future issuances under any of these plans other than the Comerica Incorporated Incentive Plan for Non-Employee Directors and Comerica’s Amended and Restated 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The Comerica Incorporated Incentive Plan for
Non-Employee Directors was approved by the shareholders on May 18, 2004. The 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (currently known as the Amended and Restated 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan) was approved by Comerica’s shareholders on May 16,
2006, its amendment and restatement was approved by Comerica’s shareholders on April 27, 2010 and its further amendment and restatement was approved by Comerica’s Board of Directors on February 22, 2011.

(2)

Does not include shares of common stock purchased or available for purchase by employees under the Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or
contributed or available for contribution by Comerica on behalf of the employees. The Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan was ratified and approved by the shareholders on May 18, 2004. Five million shares of Comerica’s common
stock have been registered for sale or awards to employees under the Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2010, 1,834,456 shares had been purchased by or contributed on behalf of employees, leaving 3,165,544
shares available for future sale or awards. If these shares available for future sale or awards under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan were included, the number shown in column (c) would be 10,640,149.

(3)

These shares are available for future issuance under Comerica’s Amended and Restated 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan in the form of options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards and other stock-based awards and under the Incentive Plan for Non-Employee Directors in the form of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
restricted stock units and other equity-based awards. Under the Amended and Restated 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan, not more than a total of 4.7 million shares may be used for awards other than options and stock appreciation rights and not more
than one million shares are available as incentive stock options. Further, no award recipient may



receive more than 350,000 shares during any calendar year, and the maximum number of shares underlying awards of options and stock appreciation rights that may be granted to an award recipient in
any calendar year is 350,000.

(4)

Consists of options to acquire shares of common stock, par value $5.00 per share, issued under the Amended and Restated Comerica Incorporated Stock Option Plan
for Non-Employee Directors of Comerica Bank and Affiliated Banks (terminated March 2004).

Most of the equity
awards made by Comerica during 2010 were granted under the shareholder-approved Amended and Restated 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan.

Plans not approved by Comerica’s shareholders include:

Amended and
Restated Comerica Incorporated Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Comerica Bank and Affiliated Banks (Terminated March 2004)

—Under the plan, Comerica granted options to acquire up to 450,000 shares of common stock, subject to
equitable adjustment upon the occurrence of events such as stock splits, stock dividends or recapitalizations. After each annual meeting of shareholders, each member of the Board of Directors of a subsidiary bank of Comerica who was not an employee
of Comerica or of any of its subsidiaries nor a director of Comerica (the “Eligible Directors”) automatically was granted an option to purchase 2,500 shares of the common stock of Comerica. Option grants under the plan were in addition to
annual retainers, meeting fees and other compensation payable to Eligible Directors in connection with their services as directors. The plan is administered by a committee of the Board of Directors. With respect to the automatic grants, the
committee does not and did not have discretion as to matters such as the selection of directors to whom options will be granted, the timing of grants, the number of shares to become subject to each option grant, the exercise price of options, or the
periods of time during which any option may be exercised. In addition to the automatic grants, the committee could grant options to the Eligible Directors in its discretion. The exercise price of each option granted was the fair market value of each
share of common stock subject to the option on the date the option was granted. The exercise price is payable in full upon exercise of the option and may be paid in cash or by delivery of previously owned shares. The committee may change the option
price per share following a corporate reorganization or recapitalization so that the aggregate option price for all shares subject to each outstanding option prior to the change is equivalent to the aggregate option price for all shares or other
securities into which option shares have been converted or which have been substituted for option shares. The term of each option cannot be more than ten years. This plan was terminated by the Board of Directors on March 23, 2004. Accordingly,
no new options may be granted under this plan.

Director Deferred Compensation Plans

—Comerica maintains two
deferred compensation plans for non-employee directors of Comerica, its subsidiaries and its advisory boards: the Amended and Restated Comerica Incorporated Common Stock Non-Employee Director Fee Deferral Plan (the “Common Stock Deferral
Plan”) and the Amended and Restated Comerica Incorporated Non-Employee Director Fee Deferral Plan (the “Mutual Fund Deferral Plan”). The Common Stock Deferral Plan allows directors to invest in units that correlate to, and are
functionally equivalent to, shares of common stock of Comerica, while the Mutual Fund Deferral Plan allows directors to invest in units that correlate to, and are functionally equivalent to, the shares of certain mutual funds offered under such
plan. The Common Stock Deferral Plan previously provided for the mandatory deferral of 50% of the annual retainer of each director of Comerica into shares of common stock of Comerica, but currently has no mandatory deferral. Until the mandatory
deferral requirement was discontinued, directors could voluntarily defer the remaining 50% of their director fees (and all other non-employee directors of Comerica’s subsidiaries could choose to defer up to 100% of their director fees) under
the Common Stock Deferral Plan or the Mutual Fund Deferral Plan, or a combination of the two plans. Currently, all eligible non-employee directors may defer any portion or none of their director fees under the Common Stock Deferral Plan or the
Mutual Fund Deferral Plan, or a combination of the two plans.



The directors’ accounts under the Common Stock Deferral Plan are increased to the
extent of dividends paid on Comerica common stock to reflect the number of additional shares of Comerica’s common stock that could have been purchased had the dividends been paid on each share of common stock hypothetically underlying
then-outstanding stock units in the directors’ accounts. Similarly, the directors’ accounts under the Mutual Fund Deferral Plan are increased in connection with the payment of dividends paid on the mutual fund shares to reflect the number
of additional shares of mutual fund shares that could have been purchased had the dividends or other distributions been paid on each share of stock hypothetically underlying then-outstanding mutual fund units in the directors’ accounts.
Following the applicable deferral period, the distribution of a participant’s Comerica stock unit account under the Common Stock Deferral Plan is made in Comerica’s common stock (with fractional shares being paid in cash), while the
distribution of a participant’s mutual fund account under the Mutual Fund Deferral Plan is made in cash.

Employee
Deferred Compensation Plans

—Comerica maintains two deferred compensation plans for eligible employees of Comerica and its subsidiaries: the 1999 Comerica Incorporated Amended and Restated Common Stock Deferred Incentive Award Plan (the
“Employee Common Stock Deferral Plan”) and the 1999 Comerica Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Employee Fund Plan”). Under the Employee Common Stock Deferral Plan, eligible employees may defer specified portions of
their incentive awards into units that correlate to, and are functionally equivalent to, shares of common stock of Comerica. The employees’ accounts under the Employee Common Stock Deferral Plan are increased in connection with the payment of
dividends paid on Comerica’s common stock to reflect the number of additional shares of Comerica’s common stock that could have been purchased had the dividends been paid on each share of common stock hypothetically underlying
then-outstanding stock units in the employees’ accounts. The deferred compensation under the Employee Common Stock Deferral Plan is payable in shares of Comerica’s common stock following termination of service as an employee.

Similarly, under the Employee Fund Plan, eligible employees may defer specified portions of their compensation, including salary, bonus
and incentive awards, into units that correlate to, and are functionally equivalent to, shares of certain mutual funds offered under the Employee Fund Plan. Beginning in 1999, no such funds are Comerica stock funds. The employees’ accounts
under the Employee Fund Plan are increased in connection with the payment of dividends paid on the fund shares to reflect the number of additional shares of the fund stock that could have been purchased had the dividends been paid on each share of
fund stock hypothetically underlying then-outstanding stock units in the employees’ accounts. The deferred compensation under the Employee Fund Plan is payable in cash following termination of service as an employee.

For additional information regarding Comerica’s equity compensation plans, please refer to Note 17 on pages 121 through
123 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Comerica’s Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2010.

common stock, as well as outstanding warrants to purchase up to 11,479,592 shares of Comerica’s common stock. There is no expiration date for Comerica’s repurchase program. The repurchase program superseded Comerica’s previous
repurchase programs approved on November 13, 2007 and November 14, 2006, each of which authorized the repurchase of 10 million shares. Comerica made no open market repurchases of its common stock or warrants to purchase its common
stock under its repurchase programs in the years ended December 31, 2010, December 31, 2009 or December 31, 2008. The following table summarizes Comerica’s monthly repurchase activity during the quarter ended
