PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

General

We are the largest commercial health benefits company in
terms of membership in the United States, serving approximately 34 million medical members as of December 31, 2005. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA, an association of independent health
benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield, or BCBS, licensee for Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City
area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (as BCBS in 10 New York city metropolitan counties, and as Blue Cross or BCBS in selected upstate counties only), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.), and Wisconsin. We
also serve our members throughout various parts of the United States as UniCare. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states through our subsidiaries and Puerto Rico through an affiliate.

We offer a broad spectrum of network-based managed care plans to the large
and small employer, individual, Medicaid and senior markets. Our managed care plans include preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, point-of-service plans, or POS plans, traditional indemnity plans and
other hybrid plans, including consumer-driven health plans, or CDHPs, hospital only and limited benefit products. In addition, we provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers, including claims processing, underwriting,
stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management and other administrative services. We also provide an array of specialty and other products and services including pharmacy benefit management, group life and
disability insurance, dental, vision, behavioral health benefits, workers compensation and long-term care insurance. For our insured products, we charge a premium and assume all or a portion of the health care risk. Under self-funded and partially
insured products, we charge a fee for services, and the employer or plan sponsor reimburses us for all or most of the health care costs. Approximately 93% of our 2005 operating revenue was derived from premium income, while approximately 7% was
derived from administrative services and other revenues.

Our
customer base primarily includes large groups with 51 to 4,999 eligible employees (48% of our medical members at December 31, 2005), and individuals under age 65 and small groups of one to 50 eligible employees, also known as ISG (17% of our
medical members as of December 31, 2005). Other major customer types include National Accounts (multi-state employer groups with 5,000 or more employees), BlueCard Host (enrollees of non-owned BCBS plans who receive benefits in our BCBS
markets), Senior (over age 65 individuals enrolled in Medicare Supplement or Medicare Advantage policies) and State Sponsored Programs (primarily Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Plans). We market our products through an extensive
network of independent agents and brokers (primarily for Individual, Small Group and Senior customers) and through our in-house sales force that are compensated on a commission basis for new sales and retention of existing business (primarily for
Large Group customers).

The aging of the population and other
demographic characteristics and advances in medical technology continue to contribute to rising health care costs. Our managed care plans and products are designed to encourage providers and members to participate in quality, cost-effective health
benefit plans by using the full range of our innovative medical management services, quality initiatives and financial incentives. Our leading market share enables us to realize the long-term benefits of investing in preventive and early detection
programs. Our ability to provide cost-effective health benefits products and services is enhanced through a disciplined approach to internal cost containment, prudent management of our risk exposure and successful integration of acquired businesses.

Our results of operations depend in large part on accurately
predicting health care costs and on our ability to manage future health care costs through underwriting criteria, medical management, product design and negotiation of favorable provider contracts.



We believe health care is local, and feel that we have the strong local presence required to understand
and meet local customer needs. Our local presence and national expertise have created opportunities for collaborative programs that reward physicians and hospitals for clinical quality and excellence. We feel that our commitment to health
improvement and care management provides added value to customers and health care professionals.

Our vision is to transform health care and become the most valued company in our industry. Our mission is to improve the lives of people we serve and the
health of our communities. One of the strategies to achieve our vision and fulfill our mission is automation of interactions with customers, brokers, agents, employees and other stakeholders through web-enabling technology and enhancing internal
operations. We continue to develop our e-business strategy with the goal of becoming widely regarded as an e-business leader in the health benefits industry. The strategy includes not only sales and distribution of health benefits products on the
Internet, but also implementation of advanced self-service capabilities benefiting customers, agents, brokers, partners and our associates.

Recent Transactions

We intend to continue our expansion through organic growth
and strategic acquisitions. Listed below are the more significant transactions that were completed by WellPoint during the last two years.

•

On December 28, 2005 (December 31, 2005 for accounting purposes) we completed our previously announced acquisition of WellChoice, Inc., or WellChoice. Under the terms of the
merger agreement, the stockholders of WellChoice received consideration of $38.25 in cash and 0.5191 of a share of WellPoint common stock for each share of WellChoice common stock outstanding. In addition, WellChoice stock options and other awards
were converted to WellPoint awards in accordance with the merger agreement. The purchase price including cash, fair value of stock and stock awards and estimated transaction costs was approximately $6.5 billion. WellChoice merged with and into
WellPoint Holding Corp., a direct and wholly-owned subsidiary of WellPoint, with WellPoint Holding Corp. as the surviving entity in the merger.

•

On June 9, 2005, we completed our acquisition of Lumenos, Inc., or Lumenos, for approximately $185.0 million in cash paid to the stockholders of Lumenos. Lumenos is
recognized as a pioneer and market leader in consumer-driven health programs.

•

On April 25, 2005, WellPoint’s Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of shares of common stock, which was effected in the form of a 100 percent
common stock dividend. All shareholders of record on May 13, 2005 received one additional share of WellPoint common stock for each share of



common stock held on that date. The additional shares of common stock were distributed to shareholders of record in the form of a stock dividend on
May 31, 2005. All applicable historical weighted average share and per share amounts and all references to stock compensation data and market prices of our common stock for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been
adjusted to reflect this two-for-one stock split.

•

On November 30, 2004, Anthem, Inc., or Anthem, and WellPoint Health Networks Inc., or WHN, completed their merger. WHN merged with and into Anthem Holding Corp., a direct and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Anthem, with Anthem Holding Corp. as the surviving entity in the merger. In connection with the merger, Anthem amended its articles of incorporation to change its name to WellPoint, Inc., or WellPoint. As a result of the
merger, each WHN stockholder received consideration of $23.80 in cash and one share of WellPoint common stock for each share of WHN common stock held. In addition, WHN stock options and other awards were converted to WellPoint awards in accordance
with the merger agreement. The purchase price including cash, fair value of stock and stock awards and estimated transaction costs was approximately $15.8 billion.

Industry Overview

The health benefits industry has experienced significant change in the last decade. The increasing focus on health care costs by employers, the government
and consumers has led to the growth of alternatives to traditional indemnity health insurance. HMO, PPO, CDHPs and hybrid plans, such as POS plans, are among the various forms of managed care products that have developed over the past decade.
Through these types of products, we attempt to contain the cost of health care by negotiating contracts with hospitals, physicians and other providers to deliver health care to our members at favorable rates. These products usually feature medical
management and other quality and cost optimization measures such as pre-admission review and approval for certain non-emergency services, pre-authorization of outpatient surgical procedures, network credentialing to determine that network doctors
and hospitals have the required certifications and expertise, and various levels of care management programs to help members better understand and navigate the medical system. In addition, providers may have incentives to achieve certain quality
measures, may share medical cost risk or have other incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost-effective manner. Members are charged periodic, pre-paid premiums and pay co-payments, coinsurance and deductibles when they receive
services. While the distinctions between the various types of plans have lessened over recent years, PPO and POS products generally provide reduced benefits for out-of-network services, while traditional HMO products generally provide little to no
reimbursement for non-emergency out-of-network utilization. An HMO plan may also require members to select one of the network primary care physicians to coordinate their care and approve any specialist or other services.

Recently, economic factors and greater consumer awareness have resulted in
the increasing popularity of products that offer larger, more extensive networks, more member choice related to coverage, physicians and hospitals, and a desire for greater flexibility for customers to assume larger deductibles and co-payments in
return for lower premiums. CDHPs, which are relatively high deductible PPO products and which are often paired with some type of member health care expenditure account that can be used at the member’s discretion to help fund member
out-of-pocket costs, help to meet this demand. CDHPs also usually incorporate member education, wellness, and care management programs, to help customers make better informed health care decisions. We believe we are well-positioned in each of our
regions to respond to these market preferences.

Each of the
BCBS companies, of which there where 38 independent primary licensees as of December 31, 2005, works cooperatively in a number of ways that create significant market advantages, especially when competing for very large multi-state employer
groups. As a result of this cooperation, each BCBS company is able to take advantage of other BCBS licensees’ substantial provider networks and discounts when any member from one state works or travels outside of the state in which the policy
is written. This program is referred to as BlueCard

®

, and is a source of revenue for providing member services in our states for individuals who are customers of BCBS plans not affiliated with us.



Competition

The managed care industry is highly competitive, both nationally and in our regional markets. Competition continues to be intense due to aggressive
marketing, business consolidations, a proliferation of new products and increased quality awareness and price sensitivity among customers.

Health benefits industry participants compete for customers mainly on the following factors:

•

price;

•

quality of service;

•

access to provider networks;

•

flexibility of benefit designs;

•

reputation (including National Committee on Quality Assurance, or NCQA, accreditation status);

•

brand recognition; and

•

financial stability.

Over the last few years, a health plan’s ability to interact with employers, members and other third parties (including health care professionals)
via the Internet has become a more important competitive factor. During the last several years, we have made significant investments in technology to enhance our electronic interaction with employers, members and third parties.

We believe our exclusive right to market products under the BCBS brand in
many of our markets provides us with an advantage over our competition. In addition, our provider networks in our regions enable us to achieve cost-efficiencies and service levels enabling us to offer a broad range of health benefits to our
customers on a more cost-effective basis than many of our competitors. We strive to distinguish our products through provider access, service, product value and brand recognition.

To build our provider networks, we compete with other health benefits plans for contracts with hospitals, physicians and
other providers. We believe that physicians and other providers primarily consider member volume, reimbursement rates, timeliness of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities along with the reduction of non-value added administrative
tasks when deciding whether to contract with a health benefits plan.

At the sales and distribution level, we compete for qualified agents and brokers to distribute our products. Strong competition exists among insurance companies and health benefits plans for agents and brokers with demonstrated ability to
secure new business and maintain existing accounts. We believe that commission structure, support services, reputation, prior relationships, quality and price of the products are the factors agents and brokers consider in choosing whether to market
our products. We believe that we have good relationships with our agents and brokers, and that our products, support services and commission structure compare favorably to our competitors in all of our regions.

Reportable Segments

We manage our operations through three reportable segments: Health Care, Specialty and Other.

Health Care

Our Health Care segment is an aggregation of various operating segments,
principally differentiated by geographic areas within which we offer similar health benefit products and services, including commercial accounts, senior, Medicaid and other state sponsored businesses. These geographic areas include California,
Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Virginia, and Wisconsin. In addition, UniCare provides services in various other areas of the United States.



Specialty

Our Specialty segment is comprised of businesses providing pharmacy benefit management, specialty pharmacy distribution,
group life and disability insurance benefits, dental, workers’ compensation and long-term care insurance. We also provide benefits for vision and behavioral health services.

Other

Our Other segment is comprised of our Medicare processing business, including AdminaStar Federal and United Government Services; Arcus Enterprises, which
works to develop innovative means to promote quality care, well being and education; intersegment revenue and expense eliminations; and corporate expenses not allocated to our Health Care or Specialty segments. Effective December 31, 2005, Empire
Medical Services, the Medicare processing company of the former WellChoice, was also included in our Other segment.

For additional information regarding the operating results of our segments, see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations and Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K.

Products and Services

Health Care

A general description of our health benefit products and services is provided below:

Preferred Provider Organization.

PPO products offer the member an option to select any health
care provider, with benefits reimbursed by us at a higher level when care is received from a participating network provider. Coverage is subject to co-payments or deductibles and coinsurance, with member cost sharing usually limited by out-of-pocket
maximums.

Traditional
Indemnity.

Indemnity products offer the member an option to select any health care provider for covered services. Coverage is subject to deductibles and coinsurance, with member cost sharing usually limited by
out-of-pocket maximums.

Health Maintenance
Organization.

HMO products include comprehensive managed care benefits, generally through a participating network of physicians, hospitals and other providers. A member in one of our HMOs must typically select a primary
care physician, or PCP, from our network. PCPs generally are family practitioners, internists or pediatricians who provide necessary preventive and primary medical care, and are generally responsible for coordinating other necessary health care
services. Preventive care services are emphasized in these plans. We offer HMO plans with varying levels of co-payments, which result in different levels of premium rates.

Point-of-Service.

POS products blend the characteristics of HMO and indemnity plans. Members
can have comprehensive HMO-style benefits through participating network providers with minimum out-of-pocket expense (co-payments) and also can go directly, without a referral, to any provider they choose, subject to, among other things, certain
deductibles and coinsurance. Member cost sharing is limited by out-of-pocket maximums.

Consumer-Driven Health Plans.

CDHPs provide consumers with increased financial responsibility, choice and control regarding how their health care dollars are spent. Generally, CDHPs
combine a high-deductible PPO plan with an employer-funded and/or employee-funded personal care account. Some or all of the dollars remaining in the personal care account at year-end can be rolled over to the next year for future health care needs.

Management Services.

In addition
to fully insured products, we provide administrative services to large group employers that maintain self-funded health plans. These administrative services include underwriting,



actuarial services, medical management, claims processing and administrative services for self-funded employers. Self-funded health plans are also able to
use our provider networks and to realize savings through our negotiated provider arrangements, while allowing employers the ability to design certain health benefit plans in accordance with their own requirements and objectives. We also underwrite
stop loss insurance for self-funded plans.

Senior
Plans.

We offer numerous Medicare supplemental plans, which typically pay the difference between health care costs incurred by a beneficiary and amounts paid by Medicare. We also offer a managed care alternative to the
Medicare program in certain geographic areas. Additionally, we offer Medicare Advantage plans, HMO fee-for-service and Medicare approved drug discount cards in certain geographic regions. Currently, our Medicare Advantage plans provide Medicare
beneficiaries with a managed care alternative to traditional Medicare. Our Medicare-approved drug discount cards afford Medicare beneficiaries, without prescription drug coverage, access to our drug discounts. Effective January 1, 2006, we began
marketing Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans, or Part D, to eligible Medicare beneficiaries in all 50 states.

BlueCard.

BlueCard host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which a WellPoint subsidiary is
the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer sponsored health plan serviced by a non-WellPoint controlled BCBS licensee, who is the “home” plan. We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard
host members, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan.

Medicaid Plans and Other State-Sponsored
Programs.

In California, a subsidiary holds contracts with the state to provide managed care programs to MediCal, California’s Medicaid program, in a large part of the state. We have also obtained Medicaid contracts
to serve members in several other states including, but not limited to Virginia, West Virginia and Connecticut (and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) in which we conduct business.

Specialty

Pharmacy Products.

We offer pharmacy services and pharmacy benefit management services to our members. Our pharmacy services
incorporate features such as drug formularies (where we develop lists of preferred, cost effective drugs), a pharmacy network and maintenance of a prescription drug database and mail order capabilities. Pharmacy benefit management services provided
by us include management of drug utilization through outpatient prescription drug formularies, retrospective review and drug education for physicians, pharmacists and members. Two of our subsidiaries are also licensed pharmacies and make
prescription dispensing services available through mail order for pharmacy benefit management clients. In July 2005, we launched Precision Rx Specialty Solutions, a full service specialty pharmacy designed to help improve quality and cost of care by
coordinating a relatively new class of prescription medications commonly referred to as biopharmaceuticals, also known as specialty medications.

In September 2005, we were awarded contracts to offer Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans, or Part D, to eligible Medicare beneficiaries in all
50 states. We began offering these plans to customers through our health benefit subsidiaries throughout the country and providing administrative services for Part D offerings through our pharmacy benefits management companies, on January 1,
2006.

Life Insurance.

We offer
an array of competitive group life insurance benefit products to both large and small group customers in conjunction with our health plans. The life products include term life, accidental death and dismemberment.

Disability.

We offer short-term and long-term
disability programs, usually in conjunction with our health plans.

Behavioral Health.

We offer specialized behavioral health plans and benefit management. These plans cover mental health and substance abuse treatment services on both an inpatient and an outpatient basis. We
have implemented employee assistance and behavioral managed care programs for a wide variety of businesses



throughout the United States. These programs are offered through our subsidiaries and through third party behavioral health networks.

Dental.

Our dental plans include networks in
certain states in which we operate. Many of the dental benefits are provided to customers enrolled in our health plans and are offered on both an insured and self-funded basis.

Vision Services.

Our vision plans include networks within the states we operate. Many of the
vision benefits are provided to customers enrolled in our health plans and are offered on both an insured and self-funded basis.

Long-Term Care Insurance.

We offer long-term care insurance products to our California members through a subsidiary. The
long-term care products include tax-qualified and non-tax qualified versions of a skilled nursing home care plan and comprehensive policies covering skilled, intermediate and custodial long-term care and home health services.

Workers Compensation Plan.

We offer workers
compensation products to employees principally in the states of Wisconsin, Illinois and Iowa. We ceased underwriting workers compensation business effective December 28, 2005; however, we continue to provide network rental and medical management
services to workers compensation carriers.

Other

Medicare Fiscal Intermediary
Operations.

Through our AdminaStar Federal and United Government Services subsidiaries, we serve as fiscal intermediaries for the Medicare program, which generally provides coverage for persons who are 65 or older and for
persons who are disabled or with end-stage renal disease. Part A of the Medicare program provides coverage for services provided by hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and other health care facilities. Part B of the Medicare program provides
coverage for services provided by physicians, physical and occupational therapists and other professional providers. As a fiscal intermediary, we receive reimbursement for certain costs and expenditures. Effective December 31, 2005, Empire Medical
Services, the Medicare processing company of the former WellChoice, was also included in our Other segment.

Customer Types

Our
products are generally developed and marketed with an emphasis on the differing needs of various customer groups. In particular, our product development and marketing efforts take into account the differing characteristics between the various
customer groups served by us, including individuals and small employers, large employers, seniors and Medicaid recipients, as well as the unique needs of educational and public entities, federal employee health and benefit programs, national
employers and state-run programs servicing low-income, high-risk and under-served markets. Each business unit is responsible for product design, pricing, enrolling, underwriting and servicing customers in specific customer groups. We believe that
one of the keys to our success has been the focus on distinct customer groups defined generally by employer size and geographic region, which better enables us to develop benefit plans and services that meet the unique needs of the distinct markets.

In each geographic region, we balance the need to customize
products with the efficiencies of product standardization. Overall, we seek to establish pricing and product designs to achieve an appropriate level of profitability for each of our customer categories. As of December 31, 2005, our customer
types include the following categories:

•

Large groups include employers with 51 to 4,999 employees eligible to participate as a member in one of our health plans as well as public entities that serve
educational and public sector clients. In addition, Large group includes customers with 5,000 or more eligible employees with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter’s state. These groups are generally sold through
brokers or consultants working with industry specialists from our in-house sales force. Large group cases may be experience rated or sold on a self-insured basis. The customer’s buying decision is typically based upon the size and breadth of
our networks, customer service, the quality of our medical management services,



the administrative cost included in our quoted price, our financial stability, and our ability to effectively service large complex accounts. Large group
also includes members in the Federal Employee Program. As a BCBSA licensee, we participate in a nationwide contract with the Federal government whereby we cover Federal employees and their dependents in our multi-state service area. Service area is
defined as the geographic area in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products. We participate in the overall financial risk for medical claims on a pooled basis with the other participating BCBS companies, and are reimbursed for our costs plus a
fee. Large groups accounted for 48% of our members at December 31, 2005.

•

Individual (under 65) and small groups are defined as members who purchase health insurance services as individuals or through employers with one to 50 eligible employees. While
individual policies are generally sold through independent agents and brokers or our in-house sales force, small groups are sold almost exclusively through independent agents and brokers. Small group cases are sold on a fully-insured basis.
Underwriting and pricing is typically done on a community rated basis. Conversely, individual business is also sold on a fully-insured basis and is usually medically underwritten at the point of initial issuance. Individual and small group customers
are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network, and the efficiency of administration. Account turnover is generally higher with individual and small groups as compared to large groups.
Individuals and small groups accounted for 17% of our members at December 31, 2005.

•

National Accounts are defined as multi-state employer groups headquartered in a WellPoint service area with 5,000 or more eligible employees, including 5% or more located in a
service area outside of the headquarter’s state. National Accounts are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer working with our in-house sales force. We have a significant advantage when competing for
very large National Accounts due to our ability to access the national provider networks of BCBS companies and take advantage of their provider discounts in their local markets. National Accounts represented 14% of our members at December 31,
2005.

•

BlueCard host customers are defined as enrollees of other BCBS plans, or the “home” plans, who receive health care services in our BCBS licensed markets. BlueCard host
membership accounted for 11% of our members at December 31, 2005.

•

Senior customers are defined as members age 65 and over with Medicare Supplement or Medicare Advantage policies. Medicare Supplement policies are sold to Medicare recipients as
supplements to the benefits they receive from the Medicare program. Rates are filed with and in some cases approved by state insurance departments. The Medicare Advantage program is the managed care alternative to the federally funded Medicare
program. Most of the premium is paid directly by the Federal government on behalf of the participant who may also be charged a small premium. Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products are marketed in the same manner. Senior business
accounted for 4% of our members at December 31, 2005.

•

State sponsored program membership is defined as eligible members with state sponsored managed care alternatives for the Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance programs
that we manage. In 2000, WHN entered into a joint venture with Medical Card Systems, Inc., a Puerto Rico-based group health and life insurer, to pursue contracts under the Health Reform Program in Puerto Rico. As of December 31, 2005, the
Company’s 50% share of this joint venture served approximately 254,000 members. Total state sponsored program business accounted for 6% of our members at December 31, 2005.

In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report
by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two principal funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our
policyholders against costs for health benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ health care costs. Some employers
choose to purchase stop-loss coverage to limit their retained risk. These employers are reported with our self-funded business.



The following tables set forth our medical membership by customer type and funding arrangement:


Includes 1,798 self-funded and 2,989 fully-insured members from the WellChoice acquisition
that closed on December 28, 2005.

For
additional information regarding the change in medical membership between years, see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Form 10-K.

Networks and Provider Relations

Our relationships with physicians, hospitals and professionals that provide
health care services to our members are guided by regional and national standards for network development, reimbursement and contract methodologies.

It is generally our philosophy not to delegate full financial responsibility to our physician providers in the form of capitation-based reimbursement.
However, in certain markets we believe capitation can be a useful method to lower costs and reduce underwriting risk, and we therefore have some capitation contracts.

We attempt to provide market-based hospital reimbursement along industry standards. We also seek to ensure physicians in our
network are paid in a timely manner at appropriate rates. We use multi-year contracting strategies, including case or fixed rates, to limit our exposure to medical cost inflation and increase cost predictability. In all regions, we seek to maintain
broad provider networks to ensure member choice while implementing programs designed to improve the quality of care received by our members.

Depending on the consolidation and integration of physician groups and hospitals, reimbursement strategies vary across markets. Fee-for-service is our
predominant reimbursement methodology for physicians. We generally use a resource-based relative value system, or RBRVS, fee schedule to determine fee for service reimbursement. However, we also use proprietary fee schedules in certain markets. The
RBRVS structure was developed and is maintained by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, and is used by the Medicare program and other major payers. The RBRVS and proprietary systems are independent of submitted fees and
therefore are not as vulnerable to inflation. In addition, we have implemented and continue to expand physician incentive contracting which recognizes clinical quality and performance as a basis for reimbursement.



Like our physician contracts, our hospital contracts provide for a variety of reimbursement arrangements
depending on the network. Our hospital contracts recognize unique hospital attributes, such as academic medical centers or community hospitals, and the volume of care performed for our members. Many hospitals are reimbursed on a fixed amount per day
for covered services (per diem) or a case rate basis similar to Medicare (Diagnosis Related Groups). Other hospitals are reimbursed on a discount from approved charge basis for covered services. Hospital outpatient services are reimbursed based on
fixed case rates, fee schedules or percent of charges. To improve predictability of expected cost, we frequently use a multi-year contracting approach and have been transitioning to case rate payment methodologies. Many of our hospital contracts
have reimbursement linked to improved clinical performance, patient safety and medical error reduction.

Medical Management Programs

Our medical management programs include a broad array of activities that facilitate improvements in the quality of care provided to our members and promote cost effective medical care. These medical management activities and programs are
administered and directed by physicians and trained nurses employed by us. One of the goals of our medical management strategies is to assure that the care delivered to our members is supported by appropriate medical and scientific evidence.

Precertification.

A traditional
medical management program involves assessment of the appropriateness of certain hospitalizations and other medical services prior to the service being rendered. For example, precertification is used to determine whether a set of hospital and
medical services is being appropriately applied to the member’s clinical condition, in accordance with criteria for medical necessity as that term is defined in the member’s benefits contract. Many of our health plans have implemented
precertification programs for certain high cost radiology studies, addressing an area of historically significant cost trends.

Concurrent review.

Another traditional medical management strategy we use is concurrent review, which is based on nationally
recognized criteria developed by third-party medical specialists. With concurrent review, the requirements and intensity of services during a patient’s hospital stay are reviewed, often by an onsite skilled nurse professional in collaboration
with the hospital’s medical and nursing staff, in order to coordinate care and determine the most effective transition of care from the hospital setting.

Disease management.

We use sophisticated care models built around disease management and advanced care management. These
programs focus on those members who have chronic and/or complex illness and require the greatest amount of medical services and allow us to provide important information to our physician providers and members to help them optimally manage the care
of their specific conditions. For example, certain therapies and interventions for patients with diabetes help prevent some of the serious, long-term medical consequences of diabetes and reduce the risks of kidney, eye and heart disease. Our
information systems can provide feedback to our physicians to enable them to improve the quality of care. For other prevalent medical conditions such as heart disease and asthma, our ability to correlate pharmacy data and medical management data
allows us to provide important information to our members, physicians and other providers, which enable them to more effectively manage these conditions.

Advanced care management.

A significant amount of health care expenditures are for services consumed by a small percent of
our members who suffer from complex or chronic illnesses. We have developed a series of programs aimed at helping our network physicians better manage and improve the health of these members. Often, these programs provide benefits for home care
services and other support to reduce the need for repeated, expensive hospitalizations.

Formulary management.

We have developed formularies, which are selections of drugs based on clinical quality and effectiveness. A pharmacy and therapeutics committee of physicians uses
scientific and clinical evidence to ensure that our members have access to the appropriate drug therapies.



Medical policy.

A medical policy group comprised of physician leaders from
all of our geographic regions, working in cooperation with academic medical centers, practicing community physicians and medical specialty organizations such as the American College of Radiology and national organizations such as the Centers for
Disease Control and the American Cancer Society, determines our national policy for the application of new technologies.

Quality programs.

We are actively engaged with our hospital networks to enable them to improve medical and surgical care and
achieve better outcomes for our members. We endorse, encourage and incent hospitals to support national initiatives to improve clinical care, patient outcomes and reduce medication errors and hospital infections. We have been recognized as a
national leader in developing hospital quality programs.

External review procedures.

In light of public concerns about health plans denying coverage of medical services, we work with outside experts through a process of external review to provide our members
scientifically and clinically, evidenced-based medical care. When we receive member concerns, we have formal appeals procedures that ultimately allow coverage disputes related to medical necessity decisions under the benefits contract to be settled
by independent expert physicians.

Service
management.

In HMO and POS networks, primary care physicians serve as the overall coordinators of members’ health care needs by providing an array of preventive health services and overseeing referrals to specialists
for appropriate medical care. In PPO networks, patients have access to network physicians without a primary care physician serving as the coordinator of care.

Health Care Quality Initiatives

Increasingly, the health care industry is able to define quality health care based on preventive health measurements, outcomes of care and optimal care
management for chronic disease. A key to our success has been our ability to work with our network physicians and hospitals to improve the quality and outcomes of the health care services provided to our members. Our ability to promote quality
medical care has been recognized by the NCQA, the largest and most respected national accreditation program for managed care health plans.

A range of quality health care measures, including the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set, or HEDIS, has been incorporated into the oversight
certification by NCQA. HEDIS measures range from preventive services, such as screening mammography and pediatric immunization, to elements of care, including decreasing the complications of diabetes and improving treatment for patients with heart
disease. For the HMO and POS plans, NCQA’s highest accreditation is granted only to those plans that demonstrate levels of service and clinical quality that meet or exceed NCQA’s rigorous requirements for consumer protection and quality
improvement. Plans earning this accreditation level must also achieve HEDIS results that are in the highest range of national or regional performance. For the PPO plans, NCQA’s highest accreditation is granted to those plans that have excellent
programs for quality improvement and consumer protection and that meet or exceed NCQA’s standards. Overall, our managed care plans have been rated “Excellent” by the NCQA, with certain plans scheduled to receive accreditation in the
near future.

In addition, we have initiated a broad array of
quality programs, including those built around smoking cessation and transplant management, and increasingly effective hospital and physician quality initiatives centered on women’s health care, diabetes and patient safety. During 2005, we
created a strategic partnership with WebMD Health, which provides members access to online health information products and provides members the ability to search for medically sound information and innovative ways to proactively manage their health.
Our online tool set offered through WebMD encourages members to adopt healthy behaviors and lifestyles that lead to better health outcomes and lower care costs associated with manageable and preventable chronic illnesses.



Pricing and Underwriting of Our Products

We price our products based on our assessment of current health care claim costs and emerging health care cost trends,
combined with charges for administrative expenses, risk and profit. We continually review our product designs and pricing guidelines on a national and regional basis so that our products remain competitive and consistent with our profitability goals
and strategies.

In applying our pricing to each employer group
and customer, we maintain consistent, competitive, strict underwriting standards. We employ our proprietary accumulated actuarial data in determining underwriting and pricing parameters. Where allowed by law and regulation, we underwrite individual
policies based upon the medical history of the individual applying for coverage, small groups based upon case specific underwriting procedures and large groups based on each group’s aggregate claim experience. Also, we employ credit
underwriting procedures with respect to our self-funded products.

In most circumstances, our pricing and underwriting decisions follow a prospective rating process in which a fixed premium is determined at the beginning of the contract period. Any deviation, favorable or unfavorable, from the medical
costs assumed in determining the premium is our responsibility. Some of our larger groups employ retrospective rating reviews, where positive experience is partially refunded to the group, and negative experience is charged against a rate
stabilization fund established from the group’s favorable experience, or charged against future favorable experience.

BCBSA License

We have filed for registration of and maintain several service marks, trademarks and trade names at the federal level and in various states in which we
operate. We have the exclusive right to use the BCBS names and marks for our health benefits products in California (Blue Cross only), Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City
area), Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.), and Wisconsin. In addition, following our December 28, 2005 acquisition of WellChoice, we have the exclusive right to use the Blue Cross
and Blue Shield names and marks in ten counties in the New York City metropolitan area and in six counties in upstate New York, and the non-exclusive right to use these names and marks in one upstate New York county. Further, we have an exclusive
right to use only the Blue Cross names and marks in seven counties in our upstate New York service area and a nonexclusive right to use only Blue Cross names and marks in an additional four upstate New York counties.

Each license requires an annual fee to be paid to the BCBSA. The fee is based
upon enrollment and premium. BCBSA is a national trade association of Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees, the primary function of which is to promote and preserve the integrity of the BCBS names and marks, as well as provide certain coordination
among the member companies. Each BCBSA licensee is an independent legal organization and is not responsible for obligations of other BCBSA member organizations. We have no right to market products and services using the BCBS names and marks outside
of the states in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products.

We believe that the BCBS names and marks are valuable identifiers of our products and services in the marketplace. The license agreements, which have a perpetual term, contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations
and our use of the BCBS names and marks. Upon termination of the license agreements, we would cease to have the right to use the BCBS names and marks in one or more of the states that we are authorized to use the marks and the BCBSA could thereafter
issue a license to use the BCBS names and marks in these states to another entity. Events that could cause the termination of a license agreement with the BCBSA include failure to comply with minimum capital requirements, a change of control or
violation of the BCBSA ownership limits on our capital stock, impending financial insolvency, the appointment of a trustee or receiver or the commencement of any action against a licensee seeking its dissolution.



The license agreements with the BCBSA contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our
operations and our use of the BCBS names and marks, including:

•

minimum capital and liquidity requirements;

•

enrollment and customer service performance requirements;

•

participation in programs that provide portability of membership between plans;

•

disclosure to the BCBSA relating to enrollment and financial conditions;

•

disclosures as to the structure of the BCBS system in contracts with third parties and in public statements;

•

plan governance requirements;

•

a requirement that at least 80% (or, in the case of Blue Cross of California, substantially all) of a licensee’s annual combined net revenue attributable to health benefit
plans within its service area must be sold, marketed, administered or underwritten under the BCBS names and marks;

•

a requirement that at least 66


/


% of a
licensee’s annual combined national revenue attributable to health benefits plans must be sold, marketed, administered or underwritten under the BCBS names and marks;

•

a requirement that neither a plan nor any of its licensed affiliates may permit an entity other than a plan or a licensed affiliate to obtain control of the plan or the licensed
affiliate or to acquire a substantial portion of its assets related to licensable services;

•

a requirement that limits beneficial ownership of our capital stock to less than 10% for institutional investors and less than 5% for non-institutional investors;

•

a requirement that we guarantee certain contractual and financial obligations of our licensed affiliates; and

•

a requirement that we indemnify the BCBSA against any claims asserted against us resulting from the contractual and financial obligations of any subsidiary that serves as a fiscal
intermediary providing administrative services for Medicare Parts A and B.

We believe that we and our licensed affiliates are currently in compliance with these standards. The standards under the license agreements may be modified in certain instances by the BCBSA.

Regulation

General

Our operations are subject to comprehensive and detailed state and federal regulation throughout the United States in the jurisdictions in which we do
business. Supervisory agencies, including state health, insurance and corporation departments, have broad authority to:

•

grant, suspend and revoke licenses to transact business;

•

regulate many aspects of our products and services;

•

monitor our solvency and reserve adequacy; and

•

scrutinize our investment activities on the basis of quality, diversification and other quantitative criteria.

To carry out these tasks, these regulators periodically examine our
operations and accounts.



Regulation of Insurance Company and HMO Business Activity

The federal government, as well as the governments of the states in which we
conduct our operations, have adopted laws and regulations that govern our business activities in various ways. These laws and regulations, which vary significantly by state, may restrict how we conduct our businesses and may result in additional
burdens and costs to us. Areas of governmental regulation include but are not limited to:

•

licensure;

•

premium rates;

•

benefits;

•

service areas;

•

market conduct;

•

utilization review activities;

•

prompt payment of claims;

•

universal health care regulation based on the availability to individuals and small groups of a government sponsored health plan administered by a private contractor and funded by
increased premium taxes;

•

assessments for state run immunization programs;

•

requirements that pharmacy benefit managers pass manufacturers’ rebates to customers;

•

member rights and responsibilities;

•

sales and marketing activities;

•

quality assurance procedures;

•

plan design and disclosures, including mandated benefits;

•

collection, access or use of protected health information;

•

eligibility requirements;

•

provider rates of payment;

•

surcharges on provider payments;

•

provider contract forms;

•

provider access standards;

•

premium taxes and assessments for the uninsured and or underinsured;

•

underwriting, marketing and rating restrictions for small group products;

•

member and provider complaints and appeals;

•

underwriting and pricing;

•

financial arrangements;

•

financial condition (including reserves and minimum capital or risk based capital requirements);

•

reimbursement or payment levels for government funded business; and

•

corporate governance.

These laws and regulations are subject to amendments and changing interpretations in each jurisdiction.



States generally require health insurers and HMOs to obtain a certificate of authority prior to
commencing operations. If we were to establish a health insurance company or an HMO in any state where we do not presently operate, we generally would have to obtain such a certificate. The time necessary to obtain such a certificate varies from
state to state. Each health insurer and HMO must file periodic financial and operating reports with the states in which it does business. In addition, health insurers and HMOs are subject to state examination and periodic license renewal. The health
benefits business also may be adversely impacted by court and regulatory decisions that expand the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations. It is uncertain whether we can recoup, through higher premiums or other measures, the increased
costs of mandated benefits or other increased costs caused by potential legislation, regulation or court rulings.

Medicare Changes

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, became law in December 2003. The MMA significantly changed and expanded
Medicare. In a pertinent part, the MMA added prescription drug benefits to Medicare for all Medicare eligible individuals starting January 1, 2006. Effective January 1, 2006, we began offering Medicare approved prescription drug plans to
Medicare eligible individuals in all regions of the country. In addition, we are also providing various administrative services for other entities offering prescription drug plans to their employees and retirees through our pharmacy benefit
management companies and other affiliated companies.

HIPAA
and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act

The federal Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA imposes obligations for issuers of health insurance coverage and health benefit plan sponsors. This law requires guaranteed health care coverage for small employers having 2 to 50 employees and
for individuals who meet certain eligibility requirements. It also requires guaranteed renewability of health care coverage for most employers and individuals. The law limits exclusions based on preexisting conditions for individuals covered under
group policies to the extent the individuals had prior creditable coverage.

The Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA imposed a number of requirements on covered entities (including insurers, HMOs, group health plans, providers and clearinghouses). These requirements include
uniform standards of common electronic health care transactions; privacy and security regulations; and unique identifier rules for employers, health plans and providers. We complied timely with requirements that have gone into effect, and intend to
comply with future requirements on or before the compliance dates.

Other federal legislation includes the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which generally placed restrictions on the disclosure of non-public information to non-affiliated third parties, and required financial institutions including insurers, to
provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal information is used, including an opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures. The federal law required state departments of insurance, and certain federal agencies,
to adopt implementing regulations, and as such, there has been a great deal of activity at the state and federal level. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also gives banks and other financial institutions the ability to affiliate with insurance companies,
which may lead to new competitors in the insurance and health benefits fields.

Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974

The provision of services to certain employee welfare benefit plans is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, a complex set of laws and regulations subject to
interpretation and enforcement by the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Labor, or DOL. ERISA regulates certain aspects of the relationships between us, the employers who maintain employee welfare benefit plans subject to ERISA and
participants in such plans. Some of our administrative services and other activities may also be subject to regulation under ERISA. In addition, certain states require licensure or registration of companies providing third party claims
administration services for benefit plans. We provide a variety of products and services to employee welfare benefit plans that are covered by ERISA. Plans subject to ERISA can



also be subject to state laws and the question of whether ERISA preempts a state law has been, and will continue to be, interpreted by many
courts.

HMO and Insurance Holding Company Laws

We are regulated as an insurance holding company and are
subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled. These acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or HMO and its affiliates. These
holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and HMOs within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states’
insurance departments certain reports describing capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. In addition, various notice and reporting requirements generally apply to
transactions between insurance companies and HMOs and their affiliates within an insurance holding company system, depending on the size and nature of the transactions. Some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory
approval or, in certain circumstances, prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies, HMOs, their parent holding companies and affiliates. Among other restrictions,
state insurance and HMO laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends.

Additionally, the holding company acts of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an
insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes, without such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company, which controls an insurance company or HMO, or
merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company. “Control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of
the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another person.

Guaranty Fund Assessments

Under insolvency or guaranty association laws in most states, insurance companies can be assessed for amounts paid by guaranty funds for policyholder
losses incurred when an insurance company becomes insolvent. Most state insolvency or guaranty association laws currently provide for assessments based upon the amount of premiums received on insurance underwritten within such state (with a minimum
amount payable even if no premium is received). Under many of these guaranty association laws, assessments against insurance companies that issue policies of accident or sickness insurance are made retrospectively. The amount and timing of any
future assessments, however, cannot be reasonably estimated and are beyond our control.

While the amount of any assessments applicable to life and health guaranty funds cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that future guaranty association assessments for insurer insolvencies will not have a
material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources.

Risk-Based Capital Requirements

The states of
domicile of our regulated subsidiaries have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies based on the RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to assess the capital adequacy of life and health
insurers, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The RBC Model Act sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance
risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under these laws, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the insurance department or insurance
commissioner of its state of domicile for each calendar year.

The law requires increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company’s RBC declines. The RBC Model Act provides for four different levels of regulatory attention depending on the



ratio of a company’s total adjusted capital (defined as the total of its statutory capital, surplus and asset valuation reserve) to its risk-based
capital. The level of regulatory oversight ranges from requiring the insurance company to inform and obtain approval from the domiciling insurance commissioner of a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its RBC, to mandatory regulatory
intervention requiring an insurance company to be placed under regulatory control in a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding. As of December 31, 2005, the RBC levels of our insurance subsidiaries exceeded all RBC thresholds.

Employees

At December 31, 2005, we had approximately 42,000 persons employed on a full-time basis. As of December 31, 2005,
a small portion of employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements: 156 employees in the Sacramento, California area with the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 29; 141 employees in the greater Detroit, Michigan
area with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, Local No. 614; 20 employees in New York city metropolitan area with the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 153; and
183 employees in Milwaukee, Wisconsin with the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 9. Our employees are an important asset, and we seek to develop them to their full potential. We believe that our relationship with our
employees is good.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

The
following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Such factors, among
others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and you should carefully consider them. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any
such list to be a complete statement of all our potential risks or uncertainties. Because of these and other factors, past performance should not be considered an indication of future performance.

Changes in state and federal regulations, or the application thereof, may
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our insurance, managed health care and health maintenance organization, or HMO, subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the insurance, managed health care or HMO regulatory authorities of
each state in which they are licensed or authorized to do business, as well as to regulation by federal and local agencies. We cannot assure you that future regulatory action by state insurance or HMO authorities will not have a material adverse
effect on the profitability or marketability of our health benefits or managed care products or on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because of our participation in government-sponsored programs such as
Medicare and Medicaid, changes in government regulations or policy with respect to, among other things, reimbursement levels, could also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure you
that application of the federal and/or state tax regulatory regime that currently applies to us will not, or future tax regulation by either federal and/or state governmental authorities concerning us could not, have a material adverse effect on our
business, operations or financial condition.

State
legislatures and Congress continue to focus on health care issues. From time to time, Congress has considered various forms of managed care reform legislation which, if adopted, could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under
ERISA. Additionally, there have been legislative attempts to limit ERISA’s preemptive effect on state laws. If adopted, such limitations could increase our liability exposure and could permit greater state regulation of our operations. Other
proposed bills and regulations, including those related to consumer-driven health plans and health savings accounts and insurance market reforms, at state and federal levels may impact certain aspects of our business, including premium receipts,
provider contracting, claims payments and processing and confidentiality of health information. While we cannot predict if any of



these initiatives will ultimately become effective or, if enacted, what their terms will be, their enactment could increase our costs, expose us to expanded
liability or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business. Further, as we continue to implement our e-business initiatives, uncertainty surrounding the regulatory authority and requirements in this area may make it difficult to ensure
compliance.

As a holding company, we are dependent on
dividends from our subsidiaries. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to state regulations, including restrictions on the payment of dividends and maintenance of minimum levels of capital.

We are a holding company whose assets include all of the outstanding shares
of common stock of our subsidiaries including our intermediate holding companies and regulated insurance and HMO subsidiaries. As a holding company, we depend on dividends from our subsidiaries. Among other restrictions, state insurance and HMO laws
may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. Our ability to pay dividends in the future to our shareholders and meet our obligations, including paying operating expenses and debt service on our outstanding and future
indebtedness, will depend upon the receipt of dividends from our subsidiaries. An inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends in the future in an amount sufficient for us to meet our financial obligations may materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Most
of our regulated subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital, known as RBC, standards, imposed by their states of domicile. These laws are based on the RBC Model Act adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, and
require our regulated subsidiaries to report their results of risk-based capital calculations to the departments of insurance and the NAIC. Failure to maintain the minimum RBC standards could subject our regulated subsidiaries to corrective action,
including state supervision or liquidation. Our regulated subsidiaries are currently in compliance with the risk-based capital or other similar requirements imposed by their respective states of domicile. As discussed in more detail below, we are a
party to license agreements with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations, including minimum capital and liquidity requirements, which could restrict the ability of our
regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends.

We face risks
related to litigation.

We are, or may be in the future, a
party to a variety of legal actions that affect any business, such as employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims and intellectual property-related litigation. In addition,
because of the nature of our business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, management and offering of our products and services. These could include: claims relating to the denial
of health care benefits; medical malpractice actions; allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities; provider disputes over compensation and termination of provider contracts; disputes related to self-funded business; disputes over
co-payment calculations; claims related to the failure to disclose certain business practices; and claims relating to customer audits and contract performance.

A number of class action lawsuits have been filed against us and certain of our competitors in the managed care business. The suits are purported class
actions on behalf of certain of our managed care members and network providers for alleged breaches of various state and federal laws. While we intend to defend these suits vigorously, we will incur expenses in the defense of these suits and cannot
predict their outcome.

Recent court decisions and legislative
activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. In some cases, substantial non-economic, treble or punitive damages may be sought. We currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities. Other potential
liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. In addition, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance,
and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. Any adverse judgment against us resulting in such damage awards could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of
operations and financial condition.



In addition, we are also involved in pending and threatened litigation of the character incidental to the
business transacted, arising out of our operations, and are from time to time involved as a party in various governmental investigations, audits, reviews and administrative proceedings. These investigations, audits and reviews include routine and
special investigations by various state insurance departments, state attorneys general and the U.S. Attorney General. Such investigations could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties and other sanctions. We believe that any
liability that may result from any one of these actions, or in the aggregate, is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

Our inability to contain health care costs, implement increases in premium
rates on a timely basis, maintain adequate reserves for policy benefits, maintain our current provider agreements or avoid a downgrade in our ratings may adversely affect our business and profitability.

Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting health care
costs and on our ability to manage future health care costs through underwriting criteria, medical management, product design and negotiation of favorable provider contracts. The aging of the population and other demographic characteristics and
advances in medical technology continue to contribute to rising health care costs. Government-imposed limitations on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement have also caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care costs.
Changes in health care practices, inflation, new technologies, the cost of prescription drugs, clusters of high cost cases, changes in the regulatory environment and numerous other factors affecting the cost of health care may adversely affect our
ability to predict and manage health care costs, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition to the challenge of managing health care costs, we face pressure to contain premium rates. Our customer contracts may be subject to
renegotiation as customers seek to contain their costs. Alternatively, our customers may move to a competitor to obtain more favorable premiums. Fiscal concerns regarding the continued viability of programs such as Medicare and Medicaid may cause
decreasing reimbursement rates for government-sponsored programs in which we participate. A limitation on our ability to increase or maintain our premium levels could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The reserves that we establish for health insurance policy
benefits and other contractual rights and benefits are based upon assumptions concerning a number of factors, including trends in health care costs, expenses, general economic conditions and other factors. Actual experience will likely differ from
assumed experience, and to the extent the actual claims experience is less favorable than estimated based on our underlying assumptions, our incurred losses would increase and future earnings could be adversely affected.

In addition, our profitability is dependent upon our ability to contract on
favorable terms with hospitals, physicians and other health care providers. The failure to maintain or to secure new cost-effective health care provider contracts may result in a loss in membership or higher medical costs. In addition, our inability
to contract with providers, or the inability of providers to provide adequate care, could adversely affect our business.

Claims-paying ability and financial strength ratings by recognized rating organizations have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the
competitive position of insurance companies and health benefits companies. Rating organizations continue to review the financial performance and condition of insurers. Each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no
assurance that our current ratings will be maintained in the future. We believe our strong ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to customers, since ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the
industry. If our ratings are downgraded or placed under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, the downgrade, surveillance or review could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These
ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders and creditors, and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common
stock.



A reduction in the enrollment in our health benefits programs could have an adverse effect on our
business and profitability.

A reduction in the number of
enrollees in our health benefits programs could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could contribute to a reduction in enrollment include: failure to obtain new customers or retain existing
customers; premium increases and benefit changes; our exit from a specific market; reductions in workforce by existing customers; negative publicity and news coverage; failure to attain or maintain nationally recognized accreditations; and general
economic downturn that results in business failures.

The
health benefits industry is subject to negative publicity, which can adversely affect our business and profitability.

The health benefits industry is subject to negative publicity. Negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry
practices, which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect profitability by: adversely affecting our ability to market our products and services; requiring us to change our products and services; or increasing the
regulatory burdens under which we operate.

In addition, as
long as we use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in marketing our health benefits products and services, any negative publicity concerning the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association or other Blue Cross Blue Shield Association licensees may
adversely affect us and the sale of our health benefits products and services. Any such negative publicity could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We face competition in many of our markets and customers and brokers have
flexibility in moving between competitors.

As a health
benefits company, we operate in a highly competitive environment and in an industry that is currently subject to significant changes from business consolidations, new strategic alliances, legislative reform, aggressive marketing practices by other
health benefits organizations and market pressures brought about by an informed and organized customer base, particularly among large employers. This environment has produced and will likely continue to produce significant pressures on the
profitability of health benefits companies.

We are dependent
on the services of independent agents and brokers in the marketing of our health care products, particularly with respect to individuals, seniors and small employer group members. Such independent agents and brokers are typically not exclusively
dedicated to us and may frequently also market health care products of our competitors. We face intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent agents and brokers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully
against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

A change in our health care product mix may impact our profitability.

Our health care products that involve greater potential risk generally tend
to be more profitable than administrative services products and those health care products where we are able to shift risk to employer groups. Individuals and small employer groups are more likely to purchase our higher-risk health care products
because such purchasers are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for health care expenditures. Typically, government-sponsored programs also involve our higher-risk health care products. From time to time, we have implemented
price increases in certain of our health care businesses. While these price increases may improve profitability, there can be no assurance that this will occur. Subsequent unfavorable changes in the relative profitability between our various
products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.



Our pharmacy benefit management companies operate in an industry faced with a number of risks and
uncertainties in addition to those we face with our core health care business.

The following are some of the pharmacy benefit industry-related risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:

•

the application of federal and state anti-remuneration laws;

•

compliance requirements for pharmacy benefit manager fiduciaries under ERISA, including compliance with fiduciary obligations under ERISA in connection with the development and
implementation of items such as formularies, preferred drug listings and therapeutic intervention programs; and potential liability regarding the use of patient-identifiable medical information;

•

a number of federal and state legislative proposals are being considered that could adversely affect a variety of pharmacy benefit industry practices, such as the receipt of rebates
from pharmaceutical manufacturers;

•

the application of state laws related to the operation of Internet and mail-service pharmacies.

We believe that our pharmacy benefit management business is currently being conducted in compliance in all material respects
with applicable legal requirements. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be subject to challenge under various laws and regulations, or that any such challenge will not have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

We are a
party to license agreements with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association that entitle us to the exclusive and in certain areas non-exclusive use of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in our geographic territories. The termination of these
license agreements or changes in the terms and conditions of these license agreements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks as identifiers for our products and services under licenses from the
Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. Our license agreements with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations and our use of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks, including:
minimum capital and liquidity requirements; enrollment and customer service performance requirements; participation in programs that provide portability of membership between plans; disclosures to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association relating to
enrollment and financial conditions; disclosures as to the structure of the Blue Cross Blue Shield system in contracts with third parties and in public statements; plan governance requirements; a requirement that at least 80% (or, in the case of
Blue Cross of California, substantially all) of a licensee’s annual combined local net revenue attributable to health benefits plans within its service areas must be sold, marketed, administered or underwritten under the Blue Cross and Blue
Shield names and marks; a requirement that at least 66 2/3% of a licensee’s annual combined national net revenue attributable to health benefits plans must be sold, marketed, administered or underwritten under the Blue Cross and Blue Shield
names and marks; a requirement that neither a plan nor any of its licensed affiliates may permit an entity other than a plan or a licensed affiliate to obtain control of the plan or the licensed affiliate or to acquire a substantial portion of its
assets related to licensable services; a requirement that we guarantee certain contractual and financial obligations of our licensed affiliates; and a requirement that we indemnify the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association against any claims asserted
against us resulting from the contractual and financial obligations of any subsidiary that serves as a fiscal intermediary providing administrative services for Medicare Parts A and B. Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements could result
in a termination of the license agreements.

The standards
under the license agreements may be modified in certain instances by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. For example, from time to time there have been proposals considered by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association to modify the terms of the
license agreements to restrict various potential business activities of licensees. These proposals have included, among other things, a limitation on the ability of a licensee to make



its provider networks available to insurance carriers or other entities not holding a Blue Cross or Blue Shield license. To the extent that such amendments
to the license agreements are adopted in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our future expansion plans or results of operations.

Upon the occurrence of an event causing termination of the license agreements, we would no longer have the right to use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield
names and marks in one or more of our geographic territories. Furthermore, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association would be free to issue a license to use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in these states to another entity. Events that
could cause the termination of a license agreement with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association include failure to comply with minimum capital requirements imposed by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, a change of control or violation of the
Blue Cross Blue Shield Association ownership limitations on our capital stock, impending financial insolvency and the appointment of a trustee or receiver or the commencement of any action against a licensee seeking its dissolution. We believe that
the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks are valuable identifiers of our products and services in the marketplace. Accordingly, termination of the license agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Upon termination of a license
agreement, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association would impose a “Re-establishment Fee” upon us, which would allow the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association to “re-establish” a Blue Cross and or Blue Shield presence in the vacated
service area. Through December 31, 2005 the fee was set at $80 per licensed enrollee. As of December 31, 2005, we reported 27.3 million Blue Cross and or Blue Shield enrollees. If the re-establishment fee was applied to our total Blue
Cross and or Blue Shield enrollees, we would be assessed approximately $2.2 billion by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.

Our investment portfolios are subject to varying economic and market conditions, as well as regulation. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we
may be required to sell certain investments.

The market
values of our investments vary from time to time depending on economic and market conditions. For various reasons, we may sell certain of our investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of the investments. In addition, in periods of
declining interest rates, bond calls and mortgage loan prepayments generally increase, resulting in the reinvestment of these funds at the then lower market rates. We cannot assure you that our investment portfolios will produce positive returns in
future periods. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of our investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain riskier investment categories, such as
below-investment-grade fixed income securities, mortgage loans, real estate and equity investments, which could generate higher returns on our investments. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations might cause investments exceeding
regulatory limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and risk-based capital, and, in some instances, require the sale of those investments.

As a Medicare fiscal intermediary, we are subject to complex regulations.
If we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be exposed to criminal sanctions and significant civil penalties.

Like a number of other Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies, we serve as a fiscal intermediary for the Medicare program, which generally provides coverage
for persons who are 65 or older and for persons with end-stage renal disease. Part A of the Medicare program provides coverage for services provided by hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and other health care facilities. Part B of the Medicare
program provides coverage for services provided by physicians, physical and occupational therapists and other professional providers. Part B also includes coverage for durable medical equipment such as diabetic supplies and wheelchairs. As a fiscal
intermediary, we receive reimbursement for certain costs and expenditures, which is subject to adjustment upon audit by CMS (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration, or HCFA). The laws and regulations governing fiscal intermediaries for
the Medicare programs are complex, subject to interpretation and can expose a fiscal intermediary to penalties for non-compliance. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to criminal fines, civil penalties or other
sanctions.



Regional concentrations of our business may subject us to economic downturns in those regions.

Our business operations include or consist of strategic
business units located in the Midwest, East and West with most of our revenues generated in the states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin.
Due to this concentration of business in these states, we are exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of an economic downturn in these states. If economic conditions in these states deteriorate, we may experience a reduction in existing
and new business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Large-scale medical emergencies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Large-scale medical emergencies can take many forms and can cause widespread
illness and death. For example, there have been various incidents of suspected bioterrorist activity in the United States. To date, these incidents have resulted in related isolated incidents of illness and death. However, federal and state law
enforcement officials have issued warnings about additional potential terrorist activity involving biological and other weapons. In addition, natural disasters such as the hurricanes experienced in the southeastern part of the United States in 2005
and the potential for a wide-spread pandemic of influenza coupled with the lack of availability of appropriate preventative medicines can have a significant impact on the health of the population of wide-spread areas. If the United States were to
experience more widespread bioterrorist or other attacks, large-scale natural disasters in our concentrated coverage areas or a large-scale pandemic, our covered medical expenses could rise and we could experience a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

We
have built a significant portion of our current business through mergers and acquisitions and we expect to pursue acquisitions in the future.

The following are some of the risks associated with acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations:

•

some of the acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flow;

•

we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us or which we under-estimated;

•

we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial
costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems;

•

acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures;

•

we may finance future acquisitions by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price, which could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders;

•

we may also incur additional debt related to future acquisitions; and

•

we would be competing with other firms, some of which may have greater financial and other resources, to acquire attractive companies.

We have substantial indebtedness outstanding and may incur additional
indebtedness in the future. As a holding company, we are not able to repay our indebtedness except through dividends from subsidiaries, some of which are restricted in their ability to pay such dividends under applicable insurance law and
undertakings. Such indebtedness could also adversely affect our ability to pursue desirable business opportunities.

As of December 31, 2005, we had indebtedness outstanding of approximately $6.8 billion and had available borrowing capacity under our amended and
restated revolving credit facility of approximately $898.6 million,



which credit facility expires on November 29, 2010. In January 2006, we incurred additional debt of $2.7 billion which was used to repay our bridge loan
and a portion of our commercial paper borrowings that were outstanding at December 31, 2005, and we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our debt service obligations require us to use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest
and principal on debt instead of for other corporate purposes, including funding future expansion. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations, we may be forced to seek extraordinary dividends from our
subsidiaries, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. However, these measures might be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service obligations.

As a holding company, we have no operations and are dependent on dividends
from our subsidiaries for cash to fund our debt service and other corporate needs. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities. Furthermore, our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us, and creditors of our subsidiaries will
have a superior claim to certain of our subsidiaries’ assets. State insurance laws restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends, and in some states we have made special undertakings that may limit the ability of our
regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, our subsidiaries’ ability to make any payments to us will also depend on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, business and tax considerations and other legal restrictions. We
cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will be able to pay dividends or otherwise contribute or distribute funds to us in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of or interest on the indebtedness owed by us.

We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to
restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. Our breach or failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements. If we default under our credit agreements, the
lenders could cease to make further extensions of credit or cause all of our outstanding debt obligations under our credit agreements to become immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If the indebtedness under our
notes or our credit agreements is accelerated, we may be unable to repay or finance the amounts due. Indebtedness could also limit our ability to pursue desirable business opportunities, and may affect our ability to maintain an investment grade
rating for our indebtedness.

We face intense competition to
attract and retain employees.

We are dependent on
retaining existing employees, attracting and retaining additional qualified employees to meet current and future needs and achieving productivity gains from our investments in technology. We face intense competition for qualified employees,
especially information technology personnel and other skilled professionals, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that such competition among potential employers will not result in increasing
salaries. There also can be no assurance that an inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The failure to effectively maintain and modernize our operations in an
Internet environment could adversely affect our business.

Our business depends significantly on effective information systems, and we have many different information systems for our various businesses. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and
enhance existing systems and develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences. In addition, we may from time to time
obtain significant portions of our systems-related or other services or facilities from independent third parties, which may make our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately. As a result of our merger and
acquisition activities, we have acquired additional systems. Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete
applications, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Also, like many of our competitors in the health benefits industry, our vision for the future includes
becoming a premier e-business organization by modernizing interactions with customers, brokers, agents, providers, employees and other stakeholders through web-enabling technology and redesigning internal operations. We are developing our e-business
strategy with the goal of becoming widely regarded as an e-business leader in the health benefits industry. The strategy includes not only sales and distribution of health benefits products on the Internet, but also implementation of advanced
self-service capabilities benefiting customers, agents, brokers, partners and employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to realize successfully our e-business vision or integrate e-business operations with our current method of
operations. The failure to develop successful e-business capabilities could result in competitive and cost disadvantages to us as compared to our competitors.

We are dependent on the success of our relationship with a large vendor for a significant portion of our information system resources and certain
other vendors for various other services.

We have an
agreement with International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, pursuant to which we outsourced a portion of our core applications development as well as a component of our data center operations and help desk to IBM. We are dependent upon IBM
for these support functions. If our relationship with IBM is terminated for any reason, we may not be able to find an alternative partner in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms. As a result, we may not be able to meet the demands of our
customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. The contract with IBM includes several service level agreements, or SLAs, related to issues such as performance and job disruption with significant
financial penalties if these SLAs are not met. We also outsource a component of our data center to another vendor, which could assume much of the IBM work and mitigate business disruption should a termination with IBM occur. We may not be adequately
indemnified against all possible losses through the terms and conditions of the agreement. In addition, some of our termination rights are contingent upon payment of a fee, which may be significant.

We have also entered into agreements with large vendors pursuant to which we
have outsourced certain functions such as data entry related to claims and billing processes and call center operations for member and provider queries as well as certain Medicare Part D sales. If these vendor relationships were terminated for any
reason, we may not be able to find alternative partners in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms. As a result, we may not be able to meet the full demands of our customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition and results of
operations may be harmed.

The anticipated potential
benefits of the merger between Anthem, Inc. and WellPoint Health Networks Inc. may not be realized.

We acquired WellPoint Health Networks Inc. in November 2004 because we believed the merger would be beneficial to our companies. Continuing to achieve the
anticipated benefits of the merger will depend in part upon whether anticipated synergies are achieved as a result of this merger. Because of the complex nature of the integration process, we cannot provide any assurances regarding the ultimate
achievement of anticipated synergies. Any inability of our management to successfully achieve anticipated synergies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may experience difficulties integrating the business of WellChoice with
our business and may incur substantial costs in connection with the integration, which could cause us to lose many of the anticipated potential benefits of the acquisition.

Integrating WellChoice’s operations into our operating platform will be a complex, time-consuming and expensive
process. Before the acquisition, we and WellChoice operated independently, each with our own business, products, customers, employees, culture and systems. We may experience unanticipated and material difficulties or expenses in connection with the
integration of WellChoice, especially given the relatively large size and complexity of WellChoice’s operations. The time and expense associated with this integration may



exceed management’s expectations and limit or delay the intended benefits of the transaction. Similarly, the process of combining sales and marketing
and network management forces, consolidating administrative functions, and coordinating product and service offerings can take longer, cost more, and provide fewer benefits than initially projected. To the extent any of these events occurs, the
benefits of the transaction may be reduced.

We may face
substantial difficulties, costs and delays in integrating WellChoice. These factors may include:

•

retaining and integrating management and other key employees;

•

costs and delays in implementing common systems and procedures, where applicable;

•

perceived adverse changes in product offerings available to customers or customer service standards, whether or not these changes do, in fact, occur;

•

difficulty comparing financial reports due to differing management systems;

•

diversion of management resources from our business;

•

retention of WellChoice’s provider networks;

•

difficulty in retaining existing customers of each company; and

•

reduction or loss of customer sales due to the potential for market confusion, hesitation and delay.

We may seek to combine certain operations and functions using common information and communication systems, operating
procedures, financial controls and human resource practices, including training, professional development and benefit programs. We may be unsuccessful in implementing the integration of these systems and processes. Any one of these factors may cause
increased operating costs, worse than anticipated financial performance or the loss of customers and employees.

We acquired WellChoice with the expectation that the acquisition will result in various benefits, including, among others, benefits relating to a stronger
and more diverse network of doctors and other health care providers, expanded and enhanced affordable health care services, enhanced revenues, a strengthened market position for us across the United States, cross-selling opportunities, technology,
cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether we integrate WellChoice in an efficient and effective manner, and general competitive factors
in the marketplace. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy and could materially impact our business, financial
condition and operating results.

Indiana law, and other
applicable laws, and our articles of incorporation and bylaws, may prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider in their best interest.

Indiana law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws may delay, defer,
prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may prevent our shareholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock
offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the
future.

We are regulated as an insurance holding company and
subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled, as well as similar provisions included in the health statutes and regulations of certain states where these subsidiaries are
regulated as managed care companies or HMOs. The insurance holding company acts and regulations and these similar health provisions restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory
approval.



Under those statutes and regulations, without such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security of a domestic insurance company or
HMO, or an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or HMO, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company, insurance company or HMO.
“Control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the
voting securities of another person.

In addition to the
restrictions described above, under the Indiana demutualization law, for a period of five years following November 2, 2001, the effective date of our demutualization, no person may acquire beneficial ownership of 5% or more of the outstanding
shares of our common stock without the prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner and our Board of Directors. Any of our shares acquired in violation of this restriction, without the prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner and
our Board of Directors, may not be voted at any shareholders’ meeting. This restriction does not apply to acquisitions made by us or made pursuant to an employee benefit plan or employee benefit trust sponsored by us. The Indiana Insurance
Commissioner has adopted rules under which passive institutional investors could purchase 5% or more but less than 10% of our outstanding common stock with the prior approval of our Board of Directors and prior notice to the Indiana Insurance
Commissioner.

Further, the Indiana corporation law contains
business combination provisions that, in general, prohibit for five years any business combination with a beneficial owner of 10% or more of our common stock unless the holder’s acquisition of the stock was approved in advance by our Board of
Directors. The Indiana corporation law also contains control share acquisition provisions that limit the ability of certain shareholders to vote their shares unless their control share acquisition is approved in advance.

Our articles of incorporation restrict the beneficial ownership of our
capital stock in excess of specific ownership limits. The ownership limits restrict beneficial ownership of our voting capital stock to less than 10% for institutional investors and less than 5% for non-institutional investors, both as defined in
our articles of incorporation. Additionally, no person may beneficially own shares of our common stock representing a 20% or more ownership interest in us. These restrictions are intended to ensure our compliance with the terms of our licenses with
the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. By agreement between us and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, these ownership limits may be increased. Our articles of incorporation prohibit ownership of our capital stock beyond these ownership limits
without prior approval of a majority of our continuing directors (as defined in our articles of incorporation). In addition, as discussed above in the risk factor describing our license agreements with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, such
license agreements are subject to termination upon a change of control and re-establishment fees would be imposed upon termination of the license agreements.

Certain other provisions included in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may also have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a
takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider in their best interests. In particular, our articles of incorporation and bylaws: permit our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock; divide our Board of Directors into
three classes serving staggered three-year terms; restrict the maximum number of directors; limit the ability of shareholders to remove directors; impose restrictions on shareholders’ ability to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors;
prohibit shareholders from calling special meetings of shareholders; impose advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at meetings of shareholders; and impose restrictions on
shareholders’ ability to amend our articles of incorporation and bylaws.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

Litigation

Multi-District Litigation Settlement Agreement

In May 2000, a case titled

California Medical Association vs. Blue
Cross of California, et. al.,

was filed in U.S. district court in San Francisco against Blue Cross of California (“BCC”), one of WHN’s subsidiaries at the time and now a Company subsidiary. The lawsuit alleges that BCC violated
the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”) (the “CMA Litigation”).



In August 2000, WHN was added as a defendant to

Shane v. Humana, et al.

, a class-action
lawsuit brought on behalf of health care providers nationwide alleging RICO violations (the “Shane Litigation”). Effective upon the November 30, 2004 merger with WHN, WHN became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. On
September 26, 2002, Anthem was added as a defendant to the Shane Litigation.

In May 2003, in a case titled

Kenneth Thomas, M.D., et al., v. Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, et al.

, (the “Thomas Litigation”) several medical providers filed suit in federal district court in
Miami, Florida against the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (“BCBSA”) and Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans across the country, including the Company and WellChoice. The suit alleges that the BCBSA and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans
violated RICO and challenges many of the same practices as the CMA Litigation and the Shane Litigation.

In October 2000, the federal Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (“MDL”) issued an order consolidating the CMA Litigation, the Shane
Litigation and various other pending managed care class-action lawsuits against the Company and other companies before District Court Judge Federico Moreno in the Southern District of Florida for purposes of pretrial proceedings. A mediator was
appointed by Judge Moreno and the parties have been conducting court-ordered mediation. On December 9, 2004, Judge Moreno issued a new scheduling order extending the expert discovery deadline to February 7, 2005 and setting trial for
September 6, 2005.

On July 11, 2005, the Company
entered into a settlement agreement (the “Agreement”) with representatives of more than 700,000 physicians nationwide to resolve the CMA Litigation, the Shane Litigation, the Thomas Litigation and certain other similar cases brought by
physicians. Under the Agreement, the Company has agreed to make cash payments totaling up to $198.0 million, of which $135.0 million will be paid to physicians and $5.0 million will be contributed to a not-for-profit foundation whose mission is to
promote higher quality health care and to enhance the delivery of care to the disadvantaged members of the public. In addition, up to $58.0 million will be paid in legal fees to be determined by the court. The Company also has agreed to implement
and maintain a number of operational changes such as standardizing the definition of medical necessity in physician contracts, creating a formalized Physician Advisory Committee and modifying some of the Company’s claims payment and physician
contracting provisions. The Agreement is subject to, and conditioned upon, review and approval by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The court preliminarily approved the settlement in an order filed July 15, 2005. The
hearing for final approval was held on December 2, 2005 in Miami, Florida. The Court issued a final order approving the settlement on December 22, 2005, and issued an amended final order approving the settlement on January 4, 2006.
Appeals have been filed by certain physicians. As a result of the Agreement, the Company incurred a pre-tax expense of $103.0 million, or $0.10 per diluted share after tax, for the year ended December 31, 2005, which represents the final
settlement amount of the Agreement that was not previously accrued.

The WellChoice transaction was closed on December 28, 2005, after the settlement was reached with the plaintiffs in the CMA Litigation, the Shane Litigation and the Thomas Litigation. The former WellChoice company, now one of our
wholly-owned subsidiaries, continues to be a defendant in the Thomas Litigation, and will not be affected by the settlement between the Company and plaintiffs. The Company intends to vigorously defend this proceeding; however, its ultimate outcome
cannot be presently determined.

Other Litigation

On June 27, 2002, in a case titled

Academy of Medicine of Cincinnati
and Luis Pagani, M.D. v. Aetna Health, Inc., Humana Health Plan of Ohio, Inc., Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and United Health Care of Ohio, Inc., No. A02004947

filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Hamilton County, Ohio and a case titled

Academy of Medicine of Cincinnati and A. Lee Greiner, M.D., Victor Schmelzer, M.D., and Karl S. Ulicny, Jr., M.D. v. Aetna Health, Inc., Humana, Inc., Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and United Health Care, Inc., No. 02-CI-903

filed
in the Boone County, Kentucky Circuit Court, the Academy and certain physicians allege that the defendants acted in combination and collusion with one another to reduce the reimbursement rates paid to physicians in the area. On September 30,
2005, the Company entered into a settlement agreement to resolve



the litigation. The settlement agreement has three components. First, the Company will increase the total annual reimbursement to physicians in the twelve
county area (six counties each in Ohio and Kentucky) by $35.0 million in 2005, an additional $20.0 million in 2006 and an additional $15.0 million in 2007. The increases will be measured against the total reimbursement amount for the same area in
2004. Second, the Company will pay $2.8 million to plaintiffs, with approximately $0.6 million for payments to retired doctors and incentive awards to the named plaintiffs and the remainder going to a charitable foundation to improve health care in
the affected area. Third, the Company will pay $9.6 million in attorneys’ fees to the plaintiffs’ class counsel. Both the Ohio court and the Kentucky court preliminarily approved the settlement on September 30, 2005. A final fairness
hearing was held on November 21, 2005. Both courts issued orders giving final approval of the settlement on November 21, 2005. The attorneys’ fees, incentive awards to plaintiffs, payments to retired doctors and charitable donation
were paid out December 27, 2005. The final terms of the settlement agreement did not have a significant impact on the financial results of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Prior to WHN’s acquisition of the group benefit operations
(“GBO”) of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company (“John Hancock”), John Hancock entered into a number of reinsurance arrangements, including with respect to personal accident insurance and the occupational accident component
of workers’ compensation insurance, a portion of which was originated through a pool managed by Unicover Managers, Inc. Under these arrangements, John Hancock assumed risks as a reinsurer and transferred certain of such risks to other
companies. Similar reinsurance arrangements were entered into by John Hancock following WHN’s acquisition of the GBO of John Hancock. These various arrangements have become the subject of disputes, including a number of legal proceedings to
which John Hancock is a party. The Company is currently in arbitration with John Hancock regarding these arrangements. The Company believes that it has a number of defenses to avoid any ultimate liability with respect to these matters and believes
that such liabilities were not transferred to the Company as part of the GBO acquisition. However, if the Company were to become subject to such liabilities, the Company could suffer losses that might have a material adverse effect on its financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Other Contingencies

From time to time, the Company and certain of its
subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings, many of which involve claims for coverage encountered in the ordinary course of business. The Company, like HMOs and health insurers generally, excludes certain health care services from
coverage under its HMO, PPO and other plans. The Company is, in its ordinary course of business, subject to the claims of its enrollees arising out of decisions to restrict or deny reimbursement for certain services. The loss of even one such claim,
if it results in a significant punitive damage award, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, the risk of potential liability under punitive damage theories may increase significantly the difficulty of obtaining reasonable
settlements of coverage claims.

In addition to the lawsuits
described above, the Company is also involved in other pending and threatened litigation of the character incidental to the business transacted, arising out of its operations and its 2001 demutualization, and is from time to time involved as a party
in various governmental investigations, audits, reviews and administrative proceedings. These investigations, audits and reviews include routine and special investigations by state insurance departments, state attorneys general and the U.S. Attorney
General. Such investigations could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties and other sanctions. The Company believes that any liability that may result from any one of these actions, or in the aggregate, is unlikely to have a
material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

I.    Executive Summary

We are the largest health benefits company in terms of membership in the United States, serving approximately 34 million medical members as of
December 31, 2005. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA, an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee in California and as the Blue Cross and
Blue Shield licensee for: Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (as BCBS in 10 New York City metropolitan counties, and as Blue Cross or
BCBS in selected upstate counties only), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the immediate suburbs of Washington, D.C.), and Wisconsin. We also serve customers throughout various parts of the country as UniCare. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations
in all 50 states through our subsidiaries and in Puerto Rico through an affiliate.

No other health benefits company has leading local market presence in so many geographic areas. This market position offers advantages in attracting physicians and hospitals to our networks at attractive rates and in
helping to keep our products affordable. While we hold the leading position in these markets, all have additional room for expansion.

Operating revenue reached an all-time high of $44.5 billion in 2005, a 118% increase over 2004. Operating revenue increases were
driven by the merger with WellPoint Health Networks Inc., which represented approximately 111% of this increase, supplemented by organic revenue growth, particularly in the individual and small group business, known as ISG, Large Group and
National Account businesses.

We have successfully executed our
strategy to deliver on our long-term goal of achieving at least 15% growth in fully diluted earnings per share, or EPS, which was exceeded in 2005 as our EPS increased by 29%. We have accomplished this by focusing on profitable enrollment
growth with innovative product offerings, pricing with discipline, implementing initiatives to optimize the cost of care, continuing to leverage administrative costs over a larger membership base, further penetrating our specialty businesses and by
using our cash flow effectively.

We intend to continue
expanding through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of the additional economies of scale provided by increased overall
membership as well as providing us access to new and evolving technologies and products. In addition, we believe geographic diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with
increased opportunities for growth. While we have achieved strong growth as a result of strategic mergers and acquisitions, we have also achieved organic growth in our existing markets by providing excellent service, offering competitively priced
products and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks.



II.    Overview

We manage our operations through three reportable segments: Health Care, Specialty and Other.

Our Health Care segment includes strategic business units delineated
primarily by geographic areas within which we offer similar products and services, including commercial accounts, individual, senior and government programs such as the Federal Employee Program, or FEP, and Medicaid. We offer a diversified mix of
managed care products, including preferred provider organizations or PPOs, health maintenance organizations or HMOs, traditional indemnity benefits, consumer-driven health plans or CDHPs and point of service or POS plans. We also offer a variety of
hybrid benefit plans, including consumer directed, hospital only and limited benefit products. Additionally, we provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers, including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance,
actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management and other administrative services.

Our Specialty segment is comprised of businesses providing pharmacy benefit management, group life and disability insurance benefits, behavioral health
benefits, dental, vision, workers’ compensation and long-term care insurance.

Our Other segment is comprised of our Medicare processing business, including AdminaStar Federal and United Government Services; Arcus Enterprises, which works to develop innovative means to promote quality care, well
being and education; intersegment revenue and expense eliminations; and corporate expenses not allocated to our Health Care or Specialty segments. Effective December 31, 2005, Empire Medical Services, the Medicare processing company of the former
WellChoice, was also included in our Other segment.

Our
operating revenue consists of premiums, administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue comes from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life benefits. Administrative fees come from
contracts where our customers are self-insured, or where the fee is based on either processing of transactions or a percent of network discount savings realized. Additionally, we earn administrative fee revenues from our Medicare processing business
and from other health-related businesses including disease management programs. Other revenue is principally generated from member co-payments and deductibles associated with the mail-order sale of drugs by our pharmacy benefit management companies.

Our benefit expense includes costs of care for health services
consumed by our members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the
cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with
the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of
actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises.

Our selling expense consists of external broker commission expenses, and generally varies with premium volume. Our general and administrative expense
consists of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Other costs are variable or discretionary in nature. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with
premium volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium, but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact
staffing levels, and thus salary and benefit expense. Discretionary costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes
in productivity.

Our cost of drugs consists of the amounts we
pay to pharmaceutical companies for the drugs we sell via mail order through our pharmacy benefit management companies, or PBM. This amount excludes the cost of drugs



related to customers of affiliated health plans, which are recorded in benefit expense. Our cost of drugs can be influenced by the volume of prescriptions at
our PBM, as well as cost changes, driven by prices set by pharmaceutical companies and mix of drugs sold.

Our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health care costs through effective contracting
with providers of care to our members and our medical management programs. Several economic factors related to health care costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage and direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies,
have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating health care costs as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers may impose further risks to our ability
to profitably underwrite our business, and may have a material impact on our results of operations.

This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this
Form 10-K.

III.    Significant Transactions

Merger with WellChoice, Inc.

On December 28, 2005 (December 31, 2005 for accounting purposes),
WellPoint and WellChoice, Inc., or WellChoice, completed their previously announced merger. The acquisition of WellChoice strengthened our leadership in providing health benefits to National Accounts and provided us with a strategic presence in New
York City, the headquarters of more Fortune 500 companies than any other U.S. city. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the stockholders of WellChoice (other than subsidiaries of WellPoint) received consideration of $38.25 in cash and 0.5191 of
a share of WellPoint common stock for each share of WellChoice common stock outstanding. In addition, WellChoice stock options and other awards were converted to WellPoint awards in accordance with the merger agreement. The purchase price including
cash, fair value of stock and stock awards and estimated transaction costs was approximately $6.5 billion.

Multi-District Litigation Settlement Agreement

On July 11, 2005, we announced that an agreement was reached with representatives of more than 700,000 physicians nationwide involved in two multi-district class-action lawsuits against us and other health
benefits companies. As part of the agreement, we have agreed to pay $135.0 million to physicians and to contribute $5.0 million to a not-for-profit foundation whose mission is to promote higher quality health care and to enhance the delivery of
care to the disadvantaged and underserved. In addition, up to $58.0 million will be paid in legal fees. As a result of the agreement, we incurred a pre-tax expense of $103.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, or $0.10 EPS, which
represents the final settlement amount of the agreement that was not previously accrued.

Acquisition of Lumenos, Inc.

On June 9, 2005, we announced the completion of our acquisition of Lumenos, Inc., or Lumenos, for approximately $185.0 million in cash paid to the stockholders of Lumenos. The acquisition of Lumenos provided us with market leading
consumer-driven health programs as well as the service experience with such programs and the customer tools that drive consumerism in health care today. Lumenos is recognized as a pioneer and market leader in consumer-driven health programs. Lumenos
served approximately 177,000 members as of the date of acquisition.

Two-For-One Stock Split

On April 25,
2005, WellPoint’s Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of shares of common stock, which was effected in the form of a 100 percent common stock dividend. All shareholders of record on May 13,



2005 received one additional share of WellPoint common stock for each share of common stock held on that date. The additional shares of common stock were
distributed to shareholders of record in the form of a stock dividend on May 31, 2005. All historical weighted average share and per share amounts and all references to stock compensation data and market prices of our common stock for all
periods presented in this MD&A have been adjusted to reflect this two-for-one stock split.

Merger with WellPoint Health Networks Inc.

On November 30, 2004, Anthem, Inc. and WellPoint Health Networks Inc., or WHN, completed their merger. The merger with WHN helped us to create the nation’s leading health benefits company and the largest
holder of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licenses in the country. Additionally, our merger with WHN increased our presence in several new strategic markets, most notably California. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the stockholders of WHN
(other than subsidiaries of WHN) received consideration of $23.80 in cash and one share of Anthem, Inc. common stock for each WHN share outstanding. In addition, WHN stock options and other awards were converted to WellPoint, Inc. awards in
accordance with the merger agreement. The purchase price including cash, fair value of stock and stock awards and estimated transaction costs was approximately $15.8 billion. Anthem, Inc., the surviving corporate parent, was renamed WellPoint, Inc.
concurrent with the merger.

IV.    Membership—December 31, 2005 Compared to December 31, 2004

Our medical membership includes six different customer types: Large Group, Individual and Small Group, National Accounts, BlueCard Host, Senior and State
Sponsored.

•

Large Group consists of those employer customers with 51 to 4,999 employees eligible to participate as a member in one of our health plans. In addition, Large Group includes
customers with 5,000 or more eligible employees with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside the headquarter’s state. Large Group also includes members in the FEP, which provides health insurance coverage to United States government
employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.

•

Individual and Small Group, or ISG, consists of individual customers under age 65 as well as those employer customers with one to 50 eligible employees.

•

National Accounts customers are multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in a WellPoint service area with 5,000 or more eligible employees, with at least 5% of eligible
employees located outside of the headquarter’s state. Service area is defined as the geographic area in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products.

•

BlueCard host members represent enrollees of non-owned Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans who receive health care services in our Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensed markets.
BlueCard membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which a WellPoint subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who
are covered under an employer sponsored health plan issued by a non-WellPoint controlled Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee (i.e., the “home” plan). We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard members, for which we receive
administrative fees from the BlueCard members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other
things, the average number of BlueCard claims received per member per month.

•

Senior members are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, a managed care alternative for the Medicare program, or who have
purchased Medicare Supplement benefit coverage.

•

State Sponsored membership represents eligible members with state sponsored managed care alternatives in Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance programs.



In addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement
according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. Our two funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. Fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health
benefits. Self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain some or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ health care costs. Some employers choose to purchase stop-loss coverage
to limit their retained risk. These employers are reported with our self-funded business.

The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and geographical region as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. Also included below are key metrics from our Specialty segment,
including prescription volume for our PBM and membership by product. The membership data presented is unaudited and in certain instances includes estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.




Amounts reported at December 31, 2005, include membership from the WellChoice
acquisition that closed on December 28, 2005 and from the Lumenos acquisition that closed on June 9, 2005.


Represents membership at December 31, 2005, resulting from the WellChoice acquisition.
Medical membership is shown net of overlapping BlueCard host membership.


WellPoint without WellChoice membership was calculated by subtracting membership resulting
from the WellChoice acquisition from WellPoint, Inc.’s reported membership at December 31, 2005.


Represents annual PBM prescription volume for mail order and retail prescriptions for the
full years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.


Changes from prior period information are not meaningful due to different counting
methodologies used by the former Anthem, Inc. and the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, total medical membership increased approximately 6,128,000, or 22%, primarily due to our
acquisition of WellChoice and organic growth in all customer types. Excluding the impact of the WellChoice acquisition: BlueCard membership increased 545,000, or 16%, representing membership growth in other Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees with
members who reside in or travel to our licensed areas; National Accounts membership increased 329,000, or 10%, primarily due to new sales, as well as, in-group increases in membership and members acquired from the acquisition of Lumenos; Large Group
membership increased 204,000, or 2% primarily due to our acquisition of Lumenos as well as new sales throughout the year; State Sponsored membership increased 148,000, or 9% due to new sales, primarily in the West region; and ISG membership
increased 97,000, or 2%, primarily due to the introduction of new, more affordable product designs and an overall increase in consumer awareness of our wide variety of quality products and services as well as efforts to market products to the
uninsured.

Self-funded medical membership increased 3,195,000
or 25%, primarily due to our merger with WellChoice and increases in our BlueCard, National Accounts and Large Group businesses. Fully-insured membership increased by 2,933,000 or 20%, due to our merger with WellChoice. However, on a comparable
basis, fully-insured membership decreased by 56,000 primarily due to a Large Group fully-insured account in the East region, which represented approximately 140,000 medical members, converting to self-funded during the third quarter of 2005. This
was partially offset by growth in our ISG and State Sponsored businesses, as well as new sales and positive in-group change in Large Group.

Our specialty metrics are derived from membership and activity from our specialty products. These products are often ancillary to our health business, and
can therefore be impacted by growth in our medical membership. The membership of these products can also be impacted by our efforts to increase the use of Specialty products by our medical members. Prescription volume at our PBM increased 8,080,000
prescriptions, or 2%, in 2005 primarily due to growth in both our mail order and retail operations. Behavioral Health membership increased 3,916,000, or 33%, in 2005. This growth was primarily due to the transition of 1,900,000 members from an
external vendor to our in-house operation, as well as growth within our existing health lines of business, our increased offerings of specialty products to our medical members and a change in counting methodologies contributed to increased
Behavioral Health’s membership growth.

V.    Cost
of Care

The following discussion summarizes our aggregate
cost of care trends for the full year 2005 for our Large Group and ISG fully-insured businesses only. In order to provide a more meaningful comparison to the current period due to the merger with WHN, cost of care information as discussed below is
presented as if pre-merger Anthem, Inc. and WHN were combined for all of 2004 and 2003. Accordingly, cost of care reported previously for pre-merger Anthem, Inc. is not comparable to the information presented below.

Our cost of care trends are calculated by comparing the year-over-year change
in average per member per month claim costs for which we are responsible, which excludes member co-payments and deductibles. While our cost of care trend varies by geographic location, our aggregate cost of care was less than 8.5% for the full year
2005.



Costs for outpatient and inpatient services are the primary drivers of overall cost trends, with
outpatient trends moderating from 2004 levels. Cost trend increases for outpatient services were primarily driven by higher per visit costs as more procedures are being performed during each visit to outpatient providers, particularly emergency room
visits, as well as the impact of price increases included within certain provider contracts. However, we are seeing the positive impact of our radiology management programs on our outpatient trends. These programs were implemented over most of our
East and Central regions in late 2004 and early 2005 and are designed to ensure appropriate use of radiology services by our members. We are currently expanding these programs to our other regions. Inpatient trends have been driven primarily by unit
cost, a reflection of negotiated contract increases with hospitals. Utilization (admissions per 1,000 members) remains flat, while average length of hospital stay and hospital days per 1,000 members have both decreased slightly.

Pharmacy benefit cost trend, which previously had been a primary driver of
overall trend increases, continues to decline as a result of an increase in generic usage rates, benefit plan design changes, improved pharmaceutical contracting resulting from the merger with WHN, the non-renewal of pharmacy only business from a
large state customer with historically high utilization and cost trends effective July 1, 2005 and the impact of lower utilization for the COX 2 Inhibitor therapeutic class of drugs. Late in the third quarter of 2004, the arthritis drug
VIOXX

®

was removed from the market due to concerns
about the risk of heart attacks in persons taking this drug for longer than 18 months. We have provided our network physicians with information regarding alternatives to VIOXX and our PBM companies have implemented a process to ensure appropriate
usage of the COX 2 Inhibitor therapeutic class of drugs.

In
response to cost trends, we continue to pursue contracting and plan design changes, promote and implement performance-based contracts that reward clinical outcomes and quality, and expand our radiology management, disease management and advanced
care management programs. In addition, we are expanding our specialty pharmacy programs and continuously evaluate our drug formulary to ensure the most effective pharmaceutical therapies are available for our members.



VI.    Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year Ended
December 31, 2004

We discuss our operations using
“comparable basis” information, which is presented in order to provide a more meaningful prior-year comparison to the current year, due to the merger with WHN. Comparable basis information is not calculated in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of WellPoint, Inc. had the merger been completed as of January 1, 2004. Comparable basis information for the year ended
December 31, 2004 was calculated by adding the reclassified historical statements of income for the former WHN for the 11 months ended November 30, 2004 to the reported results of WellPoint, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2004,
which includes one month of the former WHN. Comparable basis information contains no intercompany eliminations or pro forma adjustments resulting from the November 30, 2004 merger.


Represents the reclassification of certain WHN historical amounts to conform to a consistent
presentation with WellPoint.


Benefit expense ratio = Benefit expense ÷ Premiums.


Selling, general and administrative expense ratio = Total selling, general and administrative
expense ÷ Total operating revenue.



Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are discussed
in the following section.

Certain of the following definitions
are also applicable to all other results of operations tables in this discussion:


Financial results for 2004 include operations of the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc.
for the one month period ended December 31, 2004 and the former Anthem, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2004.


See “Comparable Basis Information” above for additional information.




For certain line items impacted by the merger of Anthem and WHN, comparable basis is not
meaningful due to related capitalization and purchase accounting.


NM = Not meaningful.


Benefit expense ratio = Benefit expense ÷ Premiums.


bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%.


Selling, general and administrative expense ratio = Total selling, general and administrative
expense ÷ Total operating revenue.

Premiums increased $22,445.1 million, or 120%, to $41,216.7 million in 2005. On a comparable basis, premium increased $2,649.9 million, or 7%, primarily due to premium rate increases in our Large Group, ISG and Senior businesses and
membership gains in our ISG, State Sponsored and Senior membership types. Partially offsetting the impact of premium rate increases was the conversion of some Large Group customers from fully-insured contracts to self-funded arrangements and the
non-renewal of certain fully-insured accounts.

Administrative
fees increased $1,293.0 million, or 90%, to $2,729.9 million in 2005. On a comparable basis, administrative fees increased $237.2 million, or 10%, primarily due to increased self-funded membership in our National and Large Group businesses. These
membership gains are driven by the popularity of the BlueCard program, as well as successful efforts to attract large self-funded accounts and the continuing trend towards self-funded arrangements over fully-insured contracts among our Large Group
customers.

Other revenue is comprised principally of
co-payments and deductibles associated with the sale of mail-order drugs by our PBM companies, which provides services to members of our Health Care segment and third party clients. Other revenue increased $314.1 million, or 124%, to $566.5 million
in 2005. On a comparable basis, other revenue increased $43.3 million, or 8%, primarily due to additional mail-order prescription revenue and increased prices of prescription drugs sold by our PBM companies. Increased mail-order prescription volume
resulted from both membership increases and additional utilization of our PBM’s mail-order pharmacy option.

Net investment income increased $321.4 million, or 103%, to $633.1 million in 2005 primarily resulting from invested assets acquired with the WHN merger
(net of cash used in the merger) and from growth in invested assets from reinvestment of cash generated from operations.

A summary of our net realized (losses) gains on investments for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 is as follows:


Includes operations of the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc. for the one month period ended December 31, 2004 and the former Anthem, Inc. for the year ended
December 31, 2004.

In 2005, net realized
gains and losses from the sale of fixed maturity and equity securities was primarily due to restructuring of our portfolio as a result of integration activities related to our merger with WHN. Net gains or losses on investments are
influenced by market conditions when an investment is sold, and will vary from year to year.



During 2004, we reallocated securities in our fixed maturity portfolio, primarily to optimize future
after-tax income by investing in a higher mix of tax-exempt fixed maturity securities. The sale of fixed maturity securities associated with this reallocation resulted in the majority of the net realized gains reported during the year ended
December 31, 2004.

Other-than-temporary impairments in
2005 were approximately equal between equity securities and fixed maturity securities, while in 2004, other-than-temporary impairments were substantially related to equity securities. Other-than-temporary impairments in both 2005 and 2004 are
primarily due to the length of time that such securities’ fair value had been less than cost.

Benefit expense increased $17,832.1 million, or 116%, to $33,219.9 million in 2005. On a comparable basis, benefit expense increased $1,938.7 million, or
6%, primarily due to increased cost of care, which was driven primarily by higher costs in outpatient and inpatient services. In addition, our benefit expense included $35.0 million in 2005 related to the multi-district litigation settlement
agreement discussed in “Significant Transactions” above. On a comparable basis, our benefit expense ratio decreased 50 basis points from 81.1% in 2004 to 80.6% in 2005. The decrease in our benefit expense ratio is driven by moderating cost
of care trends coupled with disciplined underwriting practices.

Selling, general and administrative expense increased $3,795.0 million, or 109%, to $7,272.7 million in 2005. On a comparable basis, selling, general and administrative expense increased $435.4 million, or 6%, primarily due to increases in
volume-sensitive costs such as higher commissions, premium taxes and other expenses associated with growth in our business; increased incentive compensation, including merger-related stay bonuses; and costs associated with the transition of
information technology infrastructure services to IBM. In addition, we incurred expenses related to the multi-district litigation settlement agreement discussed in “Significant Transactions” above; and start-up costs related to Medicare
Part D. On a comparable basis, our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 10 basis points to 16.3% in 2005, primarily due to growth in operating revenue and the leveraging of costs over a larger membership base, partially offset
by the factors noted above.

Cost of drugs increased $193.0
million, or 203%, to $288.0 million in 2005. On a comparable basis cost of drugs increased $18.2 million, or 7%, primarily due to higher retail and mail-order prescription volume at our PBM companies.

Interest expense increased $83.9 million, or 59%, to $226.2 million in 2005,
primarily due to additional interest expense on the debt incurred in conjunction with the WHN merger, partially offset by reduced interest expense from the repurchase of debt securities in December of 2004.

Amortization of other intangible assets increased $177.5 million, or 289%, to
$238.9 million in 2005, primarily due to a full year of additional amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets with finite lives resulting from the WHN merger.

Income tax expense increased $943.3 million, or 195%, to $1,426.5 million in 2005. Included in 2005 was $28.4 million in tax
benefits associated with a refund claim, recognizing the deductibility of capital losses on the sale of certain subsidiaries that occurred in prior years. Included in 2004 was $44.8 million in tax benefits associated with a change in Indiana laws
governing the state’s high-risk health insurance pool.

Our net income as a percentage of total revenue increased 90 basis points, from 4.6% in 2004 to 5.5% in 2005. The increase in this metric reflects a combination of all factors discussed above.

Reportable Segments

We manage our operations through three reportable segments: Health Care,
Specialty and Other.

We use operating gain to evaluate the
performance of our reportable segments, as described in FAS 131,

Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

. Operating gain is calculated as total



operating revenue less benefit expense, selling, general and administrative expense and cost of drugs. It does not include net investment income, net
realized gains (losses) on investments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, merger-related undertakings, loss on repurchase of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are
not the responsibility of operating segment management. For additional information, see Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. The discussions of segment results for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004 presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Our
segments’ operating revenue and operating gain for the year ended December 31, 2004 on a comparable basis are as follows. Comparable basis information was calculated as discussed above and is presented in order to provide investors with a
more meaningful prior-year comparison to the current year, due to the merger with WHN. Comparable basis information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of WellPoint, Inc. had the
merger been completed as of January 1, 2004.

Health Care

Our Health Care segment’s summarized results of operations for the
year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows:

Operating revenue
increased $22,843.0 million, or 116%, to $42,597.5 million. On a comparable basis, operating revenue increased $2,946.4 million, or 7%, primarily due to growth in premium income as a result of premium rate increases in our Large Group and ISG
businesses resulting from underwriting discipline. Also



contributing to premium revenue growth was higher membership, primarily in our ISG and State Sponsored businesses. Administrative fees also increased
primarily due to additional self-funded membership in National Accounts and Large Group businesses.

Operating gain increased $1,953.7 million, or 130%, to $3,459.0 million. On a comparable basis, operating gain increased $455.9, or 15%, primarily due to
premium rate increases mentioned above along with membership growth and lower than expected cost of care within our ISG, Senior and Large Group businesses. Partially offsetting this increase was the impact of the $103.0 million pre-tax expense
recognized in connection with the multi-district litigation settlement agreement in 2005.

Specialty

Our
Specialty segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows:

Operating revenue
increased $1,627.9 million, or 132%, to $2,863.1 million. On a comparable basis operating revenue increased $228.9 million or 9%, primarily due to increases in PBM operating revenue driven by improved pharmaceutical contracting and increased script
volume, particularly due to mail-order script volume. This increase was partially offset by decreases in behavioral health revenue due to the standardization in funding arrangements between Health Care and Specialty segments.

Operating gain increased $287.2 million, or 285%, to $388.1 million. On a
comparable basis operating gain increased $55.2 million or 17%, primarily due to an increase in PBM, behavioral health and dental businesses. On a comparable basis, PBM operating gain increased due to higher script volume and improved pharmaceutical
contracting. In addition, operating gain from behavioral health increased as we standardized funding arrangements between the Health Care and Specialty segments. Finally, membership growth, driven primarily by the transition of 1.9 million
behavioral health members from an outside vendor, also contributed to the improved results in Specialty segment. These gains are partially offset by decreased rates on workers’ compensation insurance in California driven by unfavorable
legislation.

Other

Our summarized results of operations for our Other segment for the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows:



Operating revenue from external customers increased $137.6 million, or 65%, to $350.4 million. On a
comparable basis, operating revenue from external customers decreased $22.4 million, or 6% primarily due to the movement of certain businesses from the Other segment to the Health Care segment. The elimination of intersegment revenue increased
$556.3 million, or 75%. On a comparable basis, the elimination of intersegment revenue increased $222.5 million or 21%, reflecting additional sales by our PBM companies to our Health Care segment.

Operating loss increased $8.8 million, or 8%, to $114.6 million. On a
comparable basis, operating loss decreased $27.0 million or 19%, primarily due to expenses not allocated to the Health Care or Specialty segments.

VII.    Membership—December 31, 2004 Compared to December 31, 2003

The following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and geographical region as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003. Also included below are key metrics from our Specialty segment, including prescription volume for our PBM and membership by product. The membership data presented is unaudited and in certain instances includes
estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period, rounded to the nearest thousand.




Represents the former Anthem, Inc. only.


“Comparable Basis” data were calculated by adding historical data for the former
WellPoint Health Networks Inc. to historical data for the former Anthem, Inc., and adjusting the combined totals to ensure a consistent approach for calculating membership and volume statistics and to eliminate overlapping BlueCard membership.


Represents prescription volume for mail order and retail prescriptions for the full years
ended 2004 and 2003, respectively. Prescription volume for 2004 and 2003 is shown on a “comparable” basis.


Changes from prior period information are not meaningful due to different counting
methodologies used by the former Anthem, Inc. and the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, total comparable medical membership increased approximately 1,678,000, or 6%, primarily in our
National Accounts, BlueCard, and ISG businesses. Our National Accounts comparable membership increased 544,000, or 20%, primarily due to recognition of the value of Blue Cross and Blue Shield networks and the discounts we can secure, the breadth of
our product offerings, and our distinctive customer service. BlueCard comparable membership increased 532,000, or 18%, representing increased sales by other Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees to accounts with members who reside in or travel to our
licensed areas. ISG comparable membership increased 332,000, or 7%, primarily due to the introduction of new, more affordable product designs and an overall increase in consumer awareness of our wide variety of quality products and services as well
as efforts to market products to the uninsured.

Self-funded
comparable medical membership increased 1,289,000, or 11%, primarily due to increases in our National Accounts and BlueCard businesses. Fully-insured comparable membership increased by 389,000 members, or 3%, primarily in our ISG business.

Prescription volume at our PBM increased 36,911,000
prescriptions, or 12%, on a comparable basis in 2004 primarily due to the integration of our Virginia health membership to our internal PBM, as well as increased mail-order utilization and growth within our other existing health lines of business.

Vision comparable membership increased 342,000, or 79%, due to
the integration of internal health members, as well as increased sales.



VIII.    Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to the Year Ended
December 31, 2003

Our consolidated results of
operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows:

Certain of the following definitions
are also applicable to all other results of operations tables in this discussion:


Financial results for 2004 include operations of the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc.
for the one month period ended December 31, 2004 and the former Anthem, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2004. Financial results for 2003 represent the results of the former Anthem, Inc. only and have been reclassified to conform to
current presentation.


NM = Not meaningful


Benefit expense ratio = Benefit expense ÷ Premiums.


bp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%.


Selling, general and administrative expense ratio = Total selling, general and administrative
expense ÷ Total operating revenue.

Premiums increased $3,603.9 million, or 24%, to $18,771.6 million in 2004, due to the impact of the merger with WHN, and premium rate increases in our Large Group and ISG businesses. Also contributing to premium



growth was higher fully-insured membership, primarily in our ISG business. Partially offsetting the growth were shifts by certain customers to self-funding
arrangements, resulting in lower revenues. Included in 2003 were premium refunds of $40.4 million issued to policyholders from our Health Care segment, as claims costs in certain lines of business were much lower than expected. Our premium yields,
net of buy-downs, for our fully-insured Large Group and ISG businesses were just less than 10% on a rolling 12-month basis as of December 31, 2004, including the business of pre-merger WHN for all periods.

Administrative fees increased $276.7 million, or 24%, to $1,436.9 million in
2004, primarily due to increased revenues from self-funded membership, principally in National businesses, and also due to the impact of the merger with WHN. These increases were partially offset by decreased administrative fees from AdminaStar
Federal’s 1-800 Medicare Help Line contract with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, which was substantially completed by June 30, 2003.

Other revenue is comprised principally of co-payments and deductibles associated with the sale of mail-order drugs by our
PBM, which provides its services to members of our Health Care segment and third party clients. Other revenue increased $93.2 million, or 59%, to $252.4 million in 2004, primarily due to additional mail-order prescription volume and increased prices
of prescription drugs sold by our PBM, and also due to the impact of the merger with WHN. Increased mail-order prescription volume resulted from both membership increases and additional utilization of our PBM’s mail-order pharmacy option.
Effective January 1, 2004, our PBM began to provide pharmacy benefit management services to Virginia customers of our Health Care segment.

Net investment income increased $33.6 million, or 12%, to $311.7 million in 2004 primarily due to the merger with WHN. Our investment income also
increased in 2004 due to the growth in invested assets from reinvestment of cash generated from operations, partially offset by a decrease in yields from new investments. Yields were lower in 2004 due in part to the impact of a portion of our fixed
maturity portfolio being invested in shorter duration investments in anticipation of the WHN merger and the use of cash upon completion of the WHN merger on November 30, 2004. Yields were also lower in part due to an increased allocation of tax
exempt securities in 2004, which is expected to enhance after tax income.

A summary of our net realized gains on investments for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 is as follows:

Other-than-temporary
impairments recognized in 2003 were substantially related to our equity security investments, primarily due to the length of time that the securities’ fair value had been less than cost.

Benefit expense increased $3,133.3 million, or 26%, to $15,387.8 million in
2004. Benefit expense increased due to the impact of the merger with WHN, and also due to increased cost of care, which was driven primarily by higher costs in outpatient services and drug costs. Included in the 2003 results was a $31.7 million net
favorable prior year reserve development recorded during the second quarter of 2003 and a $24.5 million favorable adjustment for resolution of a litigation matter in our Health Care segment in the first quarter of 2003. Our benefit expense ratio
increased 120 basis points from 80.8% in 2003 to 82.0% in 2004, increasing from lower than anticipated cost of care trends in 2003 and returning to more sustainable levels.



Selling, general and administrative expense increased $380.2 million, or 12%, to $3,477.7 million in
2004, primarily due to the impact of the merger with WHN, and also due to increases in volume-sensitive costs such as higher commissions, premium taxes and other expenses associated with growth in our business and higher salary and benefits costs.
These increases were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation in 2004, and $20.0 million of contributions to our charitable foundation made by our Health Care segment in 2003 which did not recur in 2004. Our selling, general and
administrative expense ratio decreased 180 basis points to 17.0% in 2004, primarily due to our growth in operating revenue and the leveraging of costs over these higher revenues.

Cost of drugs increased $56.3 million, or 145%, to $95.0 million in 2004, primarily due to higher mail-order prescription
volume at our PBM.

Interest expense increased $11.1 million,
or 8%, to $142.3 million in 2004, primarily due to additional interest expense on the $2.8 billion of debt initially incurred in conjunction with the WHN merger. Debt of $2.8 billion initially incurred in conjunction with the WHN merger was reduced
to approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2004. Interest expense for this merger-related debt was incurred in December 2004.

Amortization of other intangible assets increased $13.8 million, or 29%, to $61.4 million in 2004, primarily due to additional amortization expense on
identifiable intangible assets resulting from the WHN merger.

Merger-related undertakings were expenses recorded in 2004 related to certain obligations under our agreements with the California Department of Insurance, the California Department of Managed Health Care and the Georgia Department of
Insurance. These agreements were related to the merger with WHN.

The loss on repurchase of debt incurred in 2004 related to our tender offer for our high coupon surplus notes. Due to the high coupon on this debt and time remaining until stated maturity, the debt was repurchased at a significant premium
over book value, which was the driver of the loss.

Income tax
expense increased $45.6 million, or 10%, to $483.2 million in 2004. Included in 2004 was $44.8 million in tax benefits associated with a change in Indiana laws governing the state’s high-risk health insurance pool recorded during the first
quarter of 2004.

Health Care

Our Health Care segment’s summarized results of operations for the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows:

Operating revenue
increased $3,754.4 million, or 23%, to $19,754.5 million in 2004, due to the impact of the merger with WHN, as the results of the acquired health business is included effective November 30, 2004. Operating revenue also increased due to premium
rate increases in our Large Group, ISG, and Senior businesses. Also contributing to this growth were membership increases in our ISG and National Accounts businesses.

Operating gain increased $330.7 million, or 28%, to $1,505.3 million, due to our merger with WHN, improved underwriting
results in our Large Group business, and growth in our National Accounts businesses. Included in the 2003 results was a $31.7 million net favorable prior year reserve development recorded during the second quarter of 2003 and a $24.5 million
favorable adjustment for resolution of a litigation matter in the



first quarter of 2003. Also included in 2003 were premium refunds of $40.4 million issued to policyholders as claims costs in certain lines of business were
much lower than expected. Additionally, our Health Care segment made contributions of $20.0 million to our charitable foundation in 2003 that did not occur in 2004.

Specialty

Our Specialty segment’s summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows:

Operating revenue
increased $503.2 million, or 69%, to $1,235.2 million in 2004, due to the impact of the merger with WHN, as the results of the acquired specialty business is included effective November 30, 2004. Operating revenue also increased due to
increased mail-order prescription volume, including more specialty pharmacy prescriptions and increased wholesale drug costs which are passed through to customers of our PBM. Specialty pharmacy prescriptions include higher cost transactions for
biopharmaceutical and injectable medications, which are complex in design and administration, and are costly to ship and store. The increased mail-order prescription volume resulted from both membership increases and additional utilization of our
PBM’s mail-order pharmacy option. Effective January 1, 2004, our PBM began providing pharmacy benefit management services to our Virginia health members.

Operating gain increased $31.8 million, or 46%, to $100.9 million in 2004, due to the impact of the merger with WHN, and
increased mail-order prescription volume at our PBM. This improvement was partially offset by operating results in our other specialty businesses.

Other

Our summarized results of operations for our Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows:

Operating revenue from
external customers increased $15.0 million, or 8%, to $212.8 million in 2004, due to the impact of the merger with WHN, as well as an increase in revenues from our Medicare customer service software development contract with CMS. These were
partially offset by the loss of our 1-800 Medicare Help Line contract with CMS, which was substantially completed by June 30, 2003. Elimination of intersegment revenues increased $298.8 million, or 67%, reflecting additional sales by our
pharmacy benefit management company to our Health Care segment.

Operating loss decreased $41.5 million, or 28%, to $105.8 million in 2004, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses.



IX.    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this
Management’s Discussion and Analysis. We consider some of our most important accounting policies that require estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medial claims payable, income taxes, goodwill
and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005
included in this Form 10-K.

Medical Claims Payable

The most judgmental accounting estimate in our consolidated financial
statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2005, this liability was $4,923.4 million and represented 19% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for
pending claims and claims that are incurred but not reported, including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Pending claims are those received by us but not yet processed through our systems. Liabilities for both incurred but not reported
and reported but not yet paid claims are determined employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Actuarial Standards of Practice require that the claim liabilities be
adequate under moderately adverse circumstances. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not reported claims by following a detailed actuarial process that entails using both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging
medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical data of paid claims is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This
information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the
financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period. Actuarial estimates of claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims.

For the most recent incurred months, the percentage of claims
paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns;
rather they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or “trend factors”.

Because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational
and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves
include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns and claim submission patterns. A
comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In the actuarial process, the methods and assumptions are not changed as
reserves are recalculated, rather the availability of additional paid claims information drives our changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current
period benefit expense.

In addition to the pending claims and
incurred but not reported claims, the liability for medical claims payable includes reserves for premium deficiencies, if appropriate. Premium deficiencies are recognized when it is probable that expected claims and administrative expenses will
exceed future premiums on existing medical insurance contracts without consideration of investment income. Determination of premium deficiencies for



longer duration life and disability contracts includes consideration of investment income. For purposes of premium deficiencies, contracts are grouped in a
manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts.

We regularly review our assumptions regarding claim liabilities and make adjustments to benefit expense when necessary. If it is determined that our
assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit
expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to claim liabilities occur each quarter and are sometimes significant as compared to the
net income recorded in that quarter. Prior year development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior year liability is no longer needed or that additional liability should have been accrued. That
determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is accurate and will not fluctuate significantly with future development.

As described above, the completion factors and trend factors can have a significant impact on the claim liability. The
following example provides the estimated impact to our December 31, 2005 unpaid claims liability assuming hypothetical changes in the completion and trend factors:


Assumes (decrease) increase in the completion factors for the most recent four months


Assumes (decrease) increase in the claims trend factors for the most recent two months

In addition, assuming a hypothetical 1% total
difference between our December 31, 2005 estimated claims liability and the actual claims paid, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 would increase or decrease by $32.0 million, while basic and diluted net income per share would
increase or decrease by $0.05 per share.

As summarized below,
Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K provides historical information regarding the accrual and payment of our medical claims liability. Components of the total
incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements, the line labeled “incurred
related to prior years” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “incurred related to prior years” claims may be offset as we establish the estimate of “incurred related to
current year”. Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of
business, if material. We believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for unpaid claims liability at each reporting date.



A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is as follows:

Amounts incurred
related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled. Liabilities at any year end are continually reviewed and re-estimated as information regarding actual claims payments, or runout, becomes known.
This information is compared to the originally established year end liability. Negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated. The prior year redundancy of
$655.6 million shown in the table above and in Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005, represents an estimate based on paid claim activity from January 1, 2005 to December 31,
2005. Medical claim liabilities are usually described as having a “short tail”, which means that they are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the majority, or approximately
87%, of the $655.6 million redundancy relates to claims incurred in calendar year 2004, with the remaining 13% related to claims incurred in 2003 and prior.

The ratio of current year paid as a percent of current year incurred was 88.2% for 2005, 81.3% for 2004, and 85.6% for 2003. The 2004 ratio was impacted
by having only one month of medical claims incurred and paid during 2004 for the former WHN. If the former WHN had not been included during 2004, current year medical claims paid would have been $12,170.8 million, current year net incurred medical
claims would have been $13,942.8 million and the adjusted ratio would have been approximately 87.3% for 2004. Comparison of the 2005 ratio of 88.2%, the adjusted 2004 ratio of 87.3% and the 2003 ratio of 85.6% indicate that we are paying claims
faster. The increase is primarily attributable to improved processes and electronic connectivity with our provider networks. The result of these changes is an enhanced ability to adjudicate and pay claims more quickly.

We calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current period
to net incurred medical claims recorded in each prior year in order to demonstrate the development of the prior year reserves. This metric was



4.2% for 2005, 1.4% for 2004 and 2.3% for 2003. This ratio is calculated using the redundancy of $655.6 million, shown above, which represents an estimate
based on paid claim activity from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005. The 2005 ratio is impacted by having only one month of net incurred medical claims for WHN in 2004. If WHN had been included for the full year 2004 estimated prior
year net incurred medical claims would have been $31,281.2 million, and the adjusted ratio would have been approximately 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The 2.3% ratio for 2003 was impacted by having only five months of net incurred
medical claims in 2002 related to the former Trigon Healthcare, Inc. If the former Trigon Healthcare, Inc. had been included for the full year 2002, the ratio would have been approximately 2.0% for 2003.

The following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical
claims as reported in the above table for each of 2004 and 2003 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “net incurred medical claims—current year” for the year
shown and “net incurred medical claims – prior years (redundancies)” for the immediately following year):

The 2004 variance of
$483.2 million and variance to total incurred medical claims, as reported of 3.2% are impacted by having only one month of total incurred as reported for WHN during 2004. The adjusted variance would be approximately $146.7 million and the variance
to total incurred would be approximately 1.0% if the impact of WHN is removed. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2005 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2006. This table, adjusted for the impact of WHN,
shows that our estimates of this liability have approximated the actual development.

Income Taxes

We account for income
taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. This standard requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation
allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance.

At each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation
allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following:

•

the types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset;

•

the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim;

•

the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and

•

any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences.

During 2004 and 2003, the valuation allowance decreased by $33.8 million
and $81.9 million, respectively. The 2004 and 2003 reductions resulted from utilizing alternative minimum tax, or AMT, credits and net operating losses on our federal income tax return for which we had a deferred tax asset with a corresponding



valuation allowance. As deferred tax assets related to those deductions are available for use in the tax return, a valuation was no longer required and was
reduced. The decrease in the valuation allowance in 2004 was partially offset by an additional $5.6 million related to Indiana state taxes, as discussed below.

During 2004 and 2003, we recorded additional tax liabilities of $44.1 million and $81.9 million, respectively, offsetting the reduction in
valuation allowances discussed above. These additional liabilities were recorded for uncertainty on several tax issues, including the lack of clear guidance from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, on various tax issues relating to our conversion
in 1986 from tax exempt to tax paying status.

During 2005, a
refund claim we filed in 2003 was approved by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. The claim relates to initially disallowed losses on the sale of certain subsidiaries in the late 1990s. A tax benefit of $28.4 million related to this claim
was recorded in the first quarter of 2005. Net income related to this claim was $0.04 per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2005.

As a result of legislation enacted in Indiana on March 16, 2004, we recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities, with a corresponding net tax
benefit in our income statement of $44.8 million, or $0.15 per basic share and $0.14 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2004. The legislation eliminated the creation of tax credits resulting from the payment of future
assessments to the Indiana Comprehensive Health Insurance Association, or ICHIA. ICHIA is Indiana’s high-risk health insurance pool. Our historical ICHIA assessment payments far exceeded our Indiana income tax liability. Thus, the recognition
of a state deferred tax asset was not warranted, as a future Indiana tax liability was unlikely. Under the new legislation, ICHIA tax credits are limited to any unused ICHIA assessment paid prior to December 31, 2004. FAS 109 requires that
deferred assets or liabilities be established in the period a change in law is enacted. These deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits relating to our Indiana income tax
filings. Following guidance in FAS 109, a valuation allowance of $5.6 million was established for the portion of the deferred tax asset, which we believe will likely not be utilized. There is no carryforward limitation on the tax credits and the net
operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until 2018. We believe we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to offset these carryforwards; therefore, no additional valuation allowance was recorded.

We, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities
regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax
return filings, we record additional tax liability for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for tax exposures. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for,
our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given
future period could be materially impacted.

In the ordinary
course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and state authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and intend to defend our positions
vigorously through the IRS appeals process. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not
anticipate any material impact to earnings from these matters. As of December 31, 2005, the IRS concluded its examination of our 2001 and 2002 tax years and has initiated its examination of our 2003 and 2004 tax years. Various tax examinations
and proceedings also continue for pre-consolidation periods of subsidiaries.

For additional information, see Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K.



Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Our consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2005 was $13,469.1 million and other intangible assets were $9,686.4 million.
The sum of goodwill and intangible assets represents 45% of our total consolidated assets and 93% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2005.

We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,

Business Combinations

, and Statement of
Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. FAS 141 specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under FAS 142, goodwill and other
intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. We completed our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) for each of the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 and based upon these tests we have not incurred any impairment losses related to any goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives).

On December 28, 2005, we completed our merger with WellChoice and
purchased 100% of the outstanding common stock of WellChoice. In accordance with FAS 141, we allocated the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed. This allocation process included
the review of relevant information about the assets and liabilities, independent appraisals and other valuations to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The preliminary allocation resulted in $3.4 billion of non-tax
deductible goodwill and $1.7 billion of identifiable intangible assets. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and additional refinements may occur.

On November 30, 2004, we completed our merger with WHN and purchased 100% of the outstanding common stock of WHN. In accordance with FAS 141, we
allocated the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed. This allocation process included the review of relevant information about the assets and liabilities, independent appraisals and
other valuations to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation resulted in $7.6 billion of non-tax deductible goodwill and $7.0 billion of identifiable intangible assets.

While we believe we have appropriately allocated the purchase price of our
acquisitions, this allocation requires many assumptions to be made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. In addition, the annual impairment testing required under FAS 142 requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding
the estimated fair value of our goodwill and intangibles. Such assumptions include the discount factor used to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, which is ultimately used to identify potential goodwill impairment. Such estimated fair
values might produce significantly different results if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If we are unable to support a fair value estimate in future annual goodwill impairment tests or if significant impairment indicators
are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.

For additional information, see Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in
this Form 10-K.

Investments

Current and long term available-for-sale investment securities were $17,388.0
million at December 31, 2005 and represented 34% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2005. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities,

our fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as “available-for-sale” securities and are reported at fair value. We have determined that all available-for-sale investments in our portfolio, with the exception of
certain securities held for contractual or regulatory purposes, are available to support current operations, and accordingly, have classified such securities as current assets. Investment income is recorded when earned, and realized gains or losses,
determined by specific identification of investments sold, are included in income when the securities are sold.



In addition to available-for-sale investment securities, we held other long-term investments of $207.8
million, or 0.4% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2005. These long-term investments consist primarily of real estate and certain other investments. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term.

An impairment review of securities to determine if declines in
fair value below cost are other-than-temporary is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We evaluate our investment securities on a quarterly basis, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value
is other-than-temporary. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment
advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. If any declines are determined to be other-than-temporary, we charge the losses to income when that determination is made. We have a committee made up of certain accounting and
investment associates and management responsible for managing the impairment review process. The current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment
impairment. The same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. We recorded charges for other-than-temporary impairment of securities of $14.8 million, $0.8 million and $24.4 million, respectively, for the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The $24.4 million impairment for the year ended December 31, 2003 included a $22.3 million charge for other-than-temporary impairment of our equity securities; primarily due to the length of time
that such securities’ fair value had been less than cost.

Management believes it has adequately reviewed the Company’s investment securities for impairment and that its investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide
additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change management’s judgment regarding impairment. This could result in realized losses relating to other-than-temporary declines being charged against future
income.

A summary of available-for-sale investments with
unrealized losses as of December 31, 2005 along with the related fair value, aggregated by the length of time that investments have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, is as follows:

The Company’s
fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, which impact the fair value of individual securities. Unrealized losses reported above were primarily caused by the effect of a rising interest rate environment on
certain securities with stated interest rates currently below market rates. The Company currently has the ability and intent to hold these securities until their full cost can be recovered. Therefore, the Company does not believe the unrealized
losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment as of December 31, 2005.

The Company participates in securities lending programs whereby marketable securities in its investment portfolio are transferred to independent brokers or dealers based on, among other things, their creditworthiness
in exchange for collateral initially equal to at least 102% of the value of the securities on loan and is thereafter maintained at a minimum of 100% of the market value of the securities loaned. The market value of the securities on loan to each
borrower is monitored daily and the borrower is required to deliver additional collateral if the



market value of the collateral falls below 100% of the market value of the securities on loan. The fair value of the collateral amounted to $1,389.9 million
and $658.5 million, which represents 102% and 102% of the carrying value at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Under the guidance provided in FAS 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities

, the Company recognizes the collateral as an asset, which is reported as “securities lending collateral” on its balance sheet and the Company records a corresponding liability for the obligation to return the collateral to
the borrower, which is reported as “securities lending payable”. The securities on loan are reported in the applicable investment category on the balance sheet.

Through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in
interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage the market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits of investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could
have an impact on our future earnings and financial position.

We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $573.0 million
decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $534.9 million increase in fair value. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would
result in a fair value decrease of $144.8 million. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $144.8 million.

For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K,
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” and Note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K.

Retirement Benefits

Pension Benefits

We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for our employees, including plans
sponsored by WellChoice and WHN prior to the related mergers. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FAS 87,

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions

, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an
actuarial basis. As permitted by FAS 87, we calculate the value of plan assets described below. Further, the effects on our computation of pension expense from the performance of the pension plans’ assets and changes in pension liabilities are
amortized over future periods. Other than the former WellChoice plans, for each of our defined benefit pension plans, we use a September 30 measurement date for determining benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets. Plans sponsored by
the former WellChoice use a December 31 measurement date. Prior to 2005 plans sponsored by pre-merger WHN used a December 31 measurement date. The effective rates discussed below are based on a weighted average of all the plans and include
the effect of using two measurement dates.

An important factor
in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our last measurement dates, we selected an expected weighted average rate of return on plan assets of 7.80% for all plans (compared to a
weighted average 8.16% for 2005 expense recognition). We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities,
interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and historical returns are also
reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. The expected long-term rate of return is calculated by the geometric averaging method, which calculates an expected multi-period return, reflecting volatility drag on compound returns. We
believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase.



This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which
recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years producing the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. The difference between this expected return and the
actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average remaining service of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately,
future pension expense.

The discount rate reflects the current
rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our measurement dates. The weighted average discount rate for all plans is 5.31%, which was developed using a yield curve approach with consideration
of a benchmark rate of the Moody’s Aa Corporate Bonds index. Using yields available on high-quality fixed maturity securities with various maturity dates, the yield curve approach provides a “customized” rate, which is meant to better
match the expected cash flows of our specific benefit plans. Changes in the discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected pension expense, and the net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other
changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with FAS 87.

In managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of
investment grade fixed maturity securities and equity securities across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize the long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment
strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in the Company’s expense and cash flow.

As of our measurement dates, we had approximately 56% of plan assets invested in equity securities, 37% in fixed maturity securities and 7% in other assets. Approximately $13.1 million, or less than 1% of plan assets,
were invested in WellPoint common stock as of the measurement date.

We funded our cash balance pension plans in the amount of $117.8 million during 2005 and $10.0 million during 2004. For the year ending December 31, 2006, the Company does not expect any required contributions under ERISA. The Company
may elect to make discretionary contributions up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.

For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recognized consolidated pretax pension expense of $48.6 million, $40.8 million, and $21.3
million, respectively.

Effective January 1, 2006, we
curtailed the benefits under the Anthem Cash Balance Pension Plan, or the Plan. Most participants will no longer have pay credits added to their accounts, but will continue to earn interest on existing account balances. Participants will continue to
earn years of pension service for vesting. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2006, will not be eligible to participate in the Plan. Certain participants will be “grandfathered” into the Plan based on age and years of service in
previously merged plans. Grandfathered participants will continue to receive pay credits under the Plan formula. Expected savings that should be generated by the curtailment of benefits under the Plan will be mostly offset by increased matching
contributions to certain defined contribution plans.

Other Postretirement Benefits

We
provide most employees certain life, medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions including a discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for
our retiree benefits. We recognized a postretirement benefit liability of $472.3 million at December 31, 2005.

At our last measurement dates, the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 5.29%. We developed this rate using a yield curve approach with
consideration of a benchmark rate of the Moody’s Aa Corporate Bonds index.



The assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of other benefits at our last
measurement dates was 9.00% for 2006 with a gradual decline to 4.9% by the year 2011. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future. The health care cost trend assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For
example, an increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2005 by $51.5 million and would increase service and interest costs by
$3.5 million. Conversely, a decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by $43.5 million as of December 31, 2005 and would decrease service and interest
costs by $2.9 million.

For additional information regarding
retirement benefits, see Note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“FAS 123R”). FAS 123R eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic method of accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB
25”), and requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. Subsequent to the
issuance of FAS 123R, in April 2005, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued an amendment to Rule 4-01(a) of Regulation S-X regarding the compliance date for FAS 123R. Under this amendment, the effective date of FAS 123R
was extended to January 1, 2006, for most public companies with calendar year ends. The impact of adoption, effective January 1, 2006, on our consolidated results of operations is expected to amount to approximately 3% to 5% of net
earnings and is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for our current disclosures of pro forma stock compensation
expense.

On March 29, 2005, the SEC staff issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB 107”), which expresses the SEC staff’s view on FAS 123R. SAB 107 provides guidance regarding certain matters important to selecting and applying valuation models. We will consider SAB 107 in our
implementation of FAS 123R.

In November 2005, the FASB issued
FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS Nos. 115-1 and FAS 124-1,

The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.

In 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) issued EITF 03-1,

The
Meaning of Other-than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments

to provide detailed guidance on when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other-than-temporary, how to measure the impairment loss
and disclosures related to impaired securities. Because of concerns about the application of the guidance of EITF 03-1 that described whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, the FASB deferred the effective date of that portion of the
guidance. This FSP nullifies EITF 03-1 guidance on determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, and effectively retains the previous guidance in this area, which requires a careful analysis of all pertinent facts and circumstances. (In
addition, the FSP generally carries forward EITF 03-1 guidance for determining when an investment is impaired, how to measure the impairment loss and what disclosures should be made regarding impaired securities. The FSP is effective for reporting
periods subsequent to December 15, 2005. Our current analysis of impaired investments is consistent with the provisions of this FSP (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Investments”). Therefore, the adoption of this
FSP is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.

There were no other new accounting pronouncements issued during 2005 that had a material impact on our financial position, operating results or
disclosures.



X.     Liquidity and Capital Resources

Introduction

Our cash receipts result primarily from premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue, proceeds from the
sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes,
purchase of investment securities, interest expense, payments on long-term borrowings, capital expenditures and repurchase of our common stock. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future
decline in our profitability would likely have some negative impact on our liquidity.

We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor
our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy.

A substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering
expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities, to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make
investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Excess capital at our subsidiaries is paid annually by
subsidiaries in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations.

The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels,
debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. We have access to a $2.0 billion commercial paper program supported by a $2.5 billion senior credit facility, which allows us to maintain further operating and
financial flexibility.

Liquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2005
Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004

During
2005, net cash provided by operating activities was $3,256.7 million, as compared to $1,303.2 million in 2004, an increase of $1,953.5 million. The increase resulted from improved net income, including the impact of our merger with WHN. Net cash
provided by operating activities for 2005 included a full year of WHN cash flow activity following the merger.

Net cash used in investing activities was $4,420.2 million in 2005, compared to cash used of $2,373.9 million in 2004, an increase in cash used of
$2,046.3 million. The table below outlines the changes in investing cash flow between the two years:



The purchase of investment securities in 2005 increased from 2004 resulting from increased cash flows
from operations driven by improved net income, including the impact of our merger with WHN. The increase in 2005 subsidiary purchases resulted primarily from the use of cash for the WellChoice merger and Lumenos acquisition, as compared to cash used
for the WHN merger in 2004. The increase in 2005 sale of subsidiaries resulted primarily from the receipt of cash for the sale of certain subsidiaries, as compared to no activity in 2004.

Net cash flow provided by financing activities was $2,446.5 million in 2005 compared to cash provided by financing
activities of $2,063.4 million in 2004. The table below outlines the increase in cash flow provided by financing activities of $383.1 million between the two years:

The increase in
proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options reflects the significant increase in employees with vested options due to our merger with WHN. The increase in repurchases of common stock reflects the activity in our Board-approved common stock
repurchase program. The decrease in repayments of long-term debt resulted primarily from the significant amount of repayments in 2004 as new long-term debt was issued to partially pay off outstanding long-term debt and fund the WHN merger. The
decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under Equity Security Units stock purchase contracts reflects the maturity of these instruments in 2004.

On January 10, 2006, we issued $700.0 million of 5.000% notes due 2011; $1,100.0 million of 5.250% notes due 2016; and $900.0 million of 5.850%
notes due 2036 under a registration statement filed on December 28, 2005. The proceeds from this debt issuance were used to repay a bridge loan of $1,700.0 million and approximately $1,000.0 million in commercial paper borrowed to partially
fund the WellChoice merger.

Liquidity—Year Ended December 31,
2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

During 2004, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,303.2 million, as compared to $1,159.0 million in 2003, an increase of $144.2 million. The increase resulted from improved net income, including the impact of our merger with
WHN, partially offset by a decline in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Our decline in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities included the impact of long-term compensation payments of approximately $113.0 million
made during 2004 that had been accrued in prior years. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2004 included one month of WHN cash flow activity following the merger.



Net cash used in investing activities was $2,373.9 million in 2004, compared to cash used of $1,129.2
million in 2003, an increase in cash used of $1,244.7 million. The table below outlines the changes in investing cash flow between the two years:

The purchase of
investment securities in 2004 decreased from 2003 as operating cash was retained for the WHN merger. The increase in 2004 subsidiary purchases resulted primarily from the use of cash for the WHN merger, as compared to minimal activity in 2003. The
increase in net property and equipment purchases included one month of cash outflows for the pre-merger WHN companies.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $2,063.4 million in 2004 compared to cash used in financing activities of $260.2 million in 2003. Financing
activity related to the merger with WHN, as described below, contributed to the increase in cash provided by financing activities.

Effective with the WHN merger, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in our commercial paper program from $1,000.0 million to $2,000.0 million. In
December 2004, we initially borrowed $1,500.0 million under this commercial paper program, which was used to repay a portion of our senior credit facilities which were used at the date of the WHN merger to complete the transaction.

On December 9, 2004, we issued $300.0 million of 3.750% Notes due 2007,
$300.0 million of 4.250% Notes due 2009, $500.0 million of 5.000% Notes due 2014 and $500.0 million of 5.950% Notes due 2034. Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $1,583.7 million after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount
and estimated offering expenses. Proceeds from these notes were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our bridge loan and five year credit facility, which were used at the date of the WHN merger to complete the transaction. In addition, a
portion of the proceeds were used to fund the tender offer to purchase subsidiary surplus notes. The remainder of the proceeds was used to repay amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program described above.

During 2004, we received $159.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of
common stock related to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program. These proceeds were offset by $82.2 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock.

During 2003, $217.2 million was used to repurchase our common stock. In addition, $100.0 million was used to fund the
payment of senior guaranteed notes, which matured on July 15, 2003. These payments were offset by $57.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program.

Financial Condition

We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with
consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, of $20.3 billion at December 31, 2005. Since December 31, 2004, total cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, increased
by $4.5 billion, primarily resulting from the merger with WellChoice, as well as, improved net income driven by the merger with WHN.



Many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and
amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. Also, in connection with the WHN merger, the Company and certain of our subsidiaries in California and Georgia executed undertakings with the
California Department of Managed Health Care, the California Department of Insurance and the Georgia Department of Insurance which contained various commitments, including the commitment to provide $61.5 million of support for health benefit
programs in those states. Additional undertakings include the requirement to maintain certain capital levels at those subsidiaries. During 2005, we received $3.0 billion of dividends from our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005, we held at the
parent company approximately $2.5 billion of our consolidated $20.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments, which is available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, share and debt repurchases and
interest payments.

Our consolidated debt-to-total capital
ratio (calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt plus shareholders’ equity) was 21.4% as of December 31, 2005 and 18.6% as of December 31, 2004.

Our senior debt is rated “BBB+” by Standard & Poor’s, “A-” by Fitch, Inc.,
“Baa1” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “a-” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. A significant downgrade in our debt ratings could adversely affect our borrowing
capacity and costs.

Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity

On December 28, 2005, we filed a shelf
registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding terms of an offering and the securities being offered
will be provided at the time of that offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt, capitalization of our subsidiaries or the financing of possible acquisitions or
business expansion. On January 10, 2006, we issued $700.0 million of 5.000% notes due 2011; $1.1 billion of 5.250% notes due 2016; and $900.0 million of 5.850% notes due 2036 under this registration statement. The proceeds from this debt
issuance were used to repay a bridge loan of $1,700.0 million and $1,000.0 million in commercial paper borrowed to partially fund the WellChoice merger.

On November 29, 2005, we entered into a senior revolving credit facility, or the facility, with certain lenders for general corporate purposes. The
facility provides credit up to $2.5 billion (reduced for any commercial paper issuances) and matures on November 29, 2010. The interest rate on this facility is based on either (i) the LIBOR rate plus a predetermined percentage rate based
on our credit rating at the date of utilization, or (ii) a base rate as defined in the facility agreement. Our ability to borrow under this facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants. Commitment fees for the facility amounted to
$1.4 million in 2005. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005, we had $898.6 million available under this facility.

We have Board of Directors’ approval to borrow up to $2.0 billion under our commercial paper program. Proceeds from any
issuance of commercial paper may be used for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of our debt and common stock. Commercial paper notes are short-term senior unsecured notes, with a maturity not to exceed 270 days from date of
issuance. When issued, the notes bear interest at current market rates. There were $1.6 billion of borrowings outstanding under this commercial paper program as of December 31, 2005, The borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2005 are
classified as long-term debt as our intent is to replace short-term commercial paper for an uninterrupted period extending for more than one year or with borrowings under our senior credit facilities.

As discussed in “Financial Condition” above, many of our
subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we are currently estimating approximately $2.1 billion of dividends
to be paid to the parent company during 2006.



During December 2004, we completed a tender offer to purchase subsidiary surplus notes from the holders,
and purchased $258.0 million of 9.125% notes due 2010 and $174.9 million of 9.000% notes due 2027. Future interest payments on these portions of the notes will be paid by the subsidiary to the parent company, and are expected to be approximately
$39.2 million annually.

Under our Board of Directors’
authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. As of December 31, 2005, we had Board of
Directors’ authorization to purchase up to an additional $2.0 billion of common stock. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares because we believe it is a prudent use
of surplus capital. As previously disclosed, we were restricted from repurchasing shares in connection with WellChoice acquisition. Subsequent to the closing of the acquisition on December 28, 2005, we resumed the repurchase of our common stock
in January 2006. Given our liquidity and current market conditions, we have been able to execute repurchases under our program in accordance with our strategic plan.

Our current pension funding strategy is to fund an amount at least equal to the minimum required funding as determined under
ERISA with consideration of factors such as the minimum pension liability requirement and maximum tax deductible amounts. During the year ended December 31, 2005, no contributions under ERISA were required, however, the Company made tax
deductible discretionary contributions of $117.8 million.

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments

Our estimated contractual
obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2005 are as follows:


Includes estimated interest expense.


Relates to agreements with International Business Machines Corporation to provide information technology infrastructure services. See Note 18 to the audited
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 for further information.


Includes obligations related to IT service agreements and telecommunication contracts.

In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual
agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments.

We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our credit agreements
or from public or private financing sources will be sufficient for future operations and commitments and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions.

For additional information on our debt and lease commitments, see Notes 7 and 16, respectively, to our audited consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have agreed to guarantee up to $37.0 million of debt incurred by an unaffiliated entity to partially finance the purchase
of a hospital.

In connection with an investment in a joint
venture to develop and operate a well-being center in California, we may be required, based on specific targets, to make an additional $18.0 million contribution following completion of the well-being center. We anticipate the well-being center will
be completed during 2006.

In connection with the formation of
a joint venture providing Medicaid services in Puerto Rico, we agreed under certain circumstances to provide additional funding to the joint-venture entity. As of December 31, 2005, our maximum potential liability pursuant to this guarantee was
$30.3 million. We have not been required to make any payments under this guarantee and we do not currently expect any such payments will be made.

For additional information on these off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K.

Risk-Based Capital

Our regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile
have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies largely based on the NAIC’s RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk
characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks
with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under this Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each
calendar year. Our risk-based capital as of December 31, 2005, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, was in excess of all mandatory RBC thresholds. In addition to exceeding the RBC requirements, we are in compliance
with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

As a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates
and changes in equity market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on WellPoint’s financial position as of December 31, 2005. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary
objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive
after-tax total return.

Investments

Our investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit
quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk.

The primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit downgrade to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss
attributable to that downgrade. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers.
The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately AA. Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities, due to a change in market
interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which represent an exposure to changes in the level of
market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which
would allow us to realize full par value.

Our portfolio
includes corporate securities (approximately 38% of the total fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2005), which are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase prompted by
concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. This risk is managed through fundamental credit
analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately A.

Our equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities and index mutual funds. Our equity
portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market,



driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systematic risks cannot be managed through
diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio.

As of December 31, 2005, approximately 90% of our available-for-sale investments were fixed maturity securities. Market risk is addressed by actively
managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point
increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $573.0 million decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $534.9 million increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed
maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates
rise significantly.

Our available-for-sale equity securities
portfolio, as of December 31, 2005, was approximately 10% of our investments. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $144.8 million.
Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $144.8 million.

Long-Term Debt

Our total long-term debt at December 31, 2005 was $6.8 billion, and included $1.6 billion of commercial paper and $1.7 billion under a senior bridge
facility. The carrying value of the commercial paper and bridge facility approximates fair value as the underlying instruments have variable interest rates at market value. The remainder of the debt is subject to interest rate risk as these
instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates.

At December 31, 2005, we had $3.4 billion of senior unsecured notes with fixed interest rates. These notes, at par value, included $450.0 million at
6.375% due 2006, $200.0 million at 3.50% due 2007, $300.0 million at 3.75% due 2007, $300.0 million at 4.25% due 2009, $350.0 million at 6.375% due 2012, $800.0 million at 6.80% due 2012, $500.0 million at 5.00% due 2014 and $500.0 million at 5.95%
due 2034. These notes had combined carrying and estimated fair value of $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2005.

Our subordinated debt includes surplus notes issued by one of our insurance subsidiaries. Par value of amounts outstanding at December 31, 2005
included $42.0 million of 9.125% surplus notes due 2010 and $25.1 million of 9.000% surplus notes due 2027. Any payment of interest or principal on the surplus notes may be made only with the prior approval of the Indiana Department of Insurance.
The combined carrying value of the surplus notes was $66.5 million and $66.4 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The estimated fair value of the surplus notes exceeded the carrying value by $16.7 million and $22.4 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Should interest
rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly.

Derivatives

We use derivative financial instruments, specifically interest rate swap agreements, to hedge exposure in interest rate risk on our borrowings. Our
derivative use is generally limited to hedging purposes and we generally do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, we entered into two fair value hedges with a total notional value of $660.0 million. The first hedge is a
$360.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to exchange a fixed 6.8% rate for a LIBOR-based floating rate and expires on August 1, 2012. The second hedge is a $300.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement to
exchange a fixed 5.00% rate for LIBOR-based floating



rate and expires December 15, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we entered into a $300.0 million notional amount interest rate swap
agreement to exchange a fixed 3.75% rate for a LIBOR-based floating rate. This swap agreement expires on December 14, 2007.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, we entered into a floating to fixed rate cash flow hedge with a total notional value of $480.0 million. The
purpose of this hedge is to offset the variability of the cash flows due to the rollover of our variable-rate one-month commercial paper issuance. This swap agreement expires in December 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2005, no gain or
loss from hedged ineffectiveness was recorded in earnings and the commercial paper borrowings remain outstanding at December 31, 2005. The unamortized fair value included in accumulated comprehensive income at December 31, 2005 was $3.6
million.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, we
entered into forward starting pay fixed swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $875.0 million. The objective of these hedges was to eliminate the variability of cash flows in the interest payments on the debt securities to be issued to partially
fund the cash portion of the WellChoice merger. The unamortized fair value included in accumulated comprehensive income at December 31, 2005 was $12.5. As of December 31, 2005, the total amount of amortization over the next twelve months
is expected to increase interest expense by approximately $0.6 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, we entered into forward starting pay fixed swaps and treasury lock swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $2.0 billion. The objective of these hedges was to eliminate the variability of cash
flows in the interest payments on the debt securities to be issued to partially fund the cash portion of the WHN merger. Upon termination of these swaps in 2004, we received a net $15.7 million, the net fair value at the times of termination. In
addition, we recorded an unrealized gain of $10.2 million, net of tax, as accumulated other comprehensive income. Prior to the WHN merger, we reclassified $0.7 million ($0.5 million, net of tax) to net realized gains on investment for the portion of
the hedges that were deemed not probable of occurring. Following the completion of the WHN merger on November 30, 2004, we issued debt securities, and the unamortized fair value of the forward starting pay fixed swaps included in balances in
accumulated other comprehensive income began amortizing into earnings, as a reduction of interest expense, over the life of the debt securities. The unamortized fair value included in accumulated comprehensive income at December 31, 2005 was
$8.9 million. As of December 31, 2005, the total amount of amortization over the next twelve months will decrease interest expense by approximately $1.3 million.

Changes in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these swap agreements. As of December 31, 2005, we
recorded an asset of $5.6 million and a liability of $44.9 million, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swap’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in
interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $61.6 million increase in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $78.0 million decrease in fair
value.

throughout various parts of the United States as UniCare.

On
November 30, 2004, Anthem and WellPoint Health Networks Inc. (“WHN”) completed their merger. WHN merged with and into Anthem Holding Corp., a direct and wholly-owned subsidiary of Anthem, with Anthem Holding Corp. as the surviving
entity in the merger. In connection with the merger, Anthem amended its articles of incorporation to change its name to WellPoint, Inc. In addition, the ticker symbol for Anthem’s common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange was changed
to “WLP”. WHN’s operating results are included in WellPoint’s consolidated financial statements for the period following November 30, 2004.

2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation:

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts
of WellPoint and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Two-for-One Stock Split:

On April 25, 2005,
WellPoint’s Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of shares of common stock, which was effected in the form of a 100 percent common stock dividend. All shareholders of record on May 13, 2005 received one additional share of
WellPoint common stock for each share of common stock held on that date. The additional shares of common stock were distributed to shareholders of

record in the form of a stock dividend on May 31, 2005. All historical weighted average share and per share amounts and all references to stock
compensation data and market prices of WellPoint’s common stock for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect this two-for-one stock split.

Investments:

All fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as “available-for-sale” and are reported at fair value. The
Company has determined that certain of these investment securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, has classified such investment securities as current assets without regard for contractual maturities. Investments used
to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity. The unrealized gains or losses on both current and long-term fixed maturity and equity securities are included in
accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders’ equity, unless the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and the Company does not have the intent and ability to hold such securities until their
full cost can be recovered, in which case the securities are written down to fair value and the loss is charged to income. The Company evaluates its investment securities for other-than-temporary declines based on quantitative and qualitative
factors.

The Company uses the equity method of accounting for
investments in companies in which its ownership interest of the voting shares of an investee company enables the Company to influence the operating or financial decisions of the investee company, but the Company is without a controlling financial
interest. The Company’s proportionate share of equity in net income of these unconsolidated affiliates is reported with net investment income.

For asset-backed securities included in fixed maturity securities, the Company recognizes income using an effective yield based on anticipated prepayments
and the estimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments. The net investment in the securities is adjusted to the
amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the acquisition of the securities. Such adjustments are reflected in net investment income.

All securities sold resulting in investment gains and losses are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses are
determined on the basis of the cost or amortized cost of the specific securities sold.

The Company participates in securities lending programs whereby marketable securities in its investment portfolio are transferred to independent brokers or dealers based on, among other things, their creditworthiness
in exchange for collateral initially equal to at least 102% of the value of the securities on loan and is thereafter maintained at a minimum of 100% of the market value of the securities loaned. The market value of the securities on loan to each
borrower is monitored daily and the borrower is required to deliver additional collateral if the market value of the collateral falls below 100% of the market value of the securities on loan. The fair value of the collateral amounted to $1,389.9 and
$658.5, which represents 102% and 102% of the market value of the securities on loan at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Under the guidance provided in FAS 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities

, the Company recognizes the collateral as an asset, which is reported as “securities lending collateral” on its balance sheet and the Company records a corresponding liability for the obligation to return
the collateral to the borrower, which is reported as “securities lending payable.” The securities on loan are reported in the applicable investment category on the balance sheet.

Cash Equivalents:

All highly liquid investments with maturities
of three months or less when purchased are classified as cash equivalents.

Derivative Financial Instruments:

All investments in derivatives are recorded at fair value. A derivative is typically defined as an instrument whose value is “derived” from an underlying
instrument, index or rate, has a notional amount, requires little or no initial investment and can be net settled. WellPoint typically invests in the following types of derivative financial instruments: interest rate swaps, call options, embedded
derivatives and warrants. Derivatives embedded within non-derivative instruments (such as options embedded in convertible fixed maturity securities) are bifurcated from the host instrument when the embedded derivative is not clearly and closely
related to the host instrument.

The Company’s derivatives
are reported as other current assets or liabilities or other noncurrent assets or liabilities, as appropriate, with the exception of embedded derivative instruments not subject to bifurcation, which are reported together with their host instrument.
If certain correlation, hedge effectiveness and risk reduction criteria are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair value or cash flow. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative
depends on the intended use of the derivative and the nature of any hedge designation thereon.

Any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, as well as the ineffective portion of the gain or loss, are reported in results of operations immediately. If the derivative is not designated as a
hedge, the gain or loss resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in results of operations in the period of change.

The Company’s accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives is as follows:

The Company
discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that one of the following has occurred: (i) the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item; (ii) the
derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; (iii) the derivative is undesignated as a hedge instrument because it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur; (iv) a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the
definition of a firm commitment; or (v) management determines that the designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate.

If hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative will continue to be carried in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at its fair value. When
hedge accounting is discontinued because the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value hedge, the related hedged asset or liability will no longer be adjusted for fair value changes. When hedge accounting is discontinued because it
is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the accumulated unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in results of operations. When hedge accounting is discontinued
because the hedged item no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment, any asset or liability that was recorded pursuant to the firm commitment will be removed from the balance sheet and recognized as a gain or loss in current period results
of operations. In all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in current period results of operations.



WellPoint, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

The Company’s use of derivatives is limited by statutes and regulations promulgated by the various regulatory bodies to which it is subject, and by its own derivative policy.

Credit exposure associated with non-performance by the counterparties to
derivative instruments is generally limited to the uncollateralized fair value of the asset related to instruments recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company attempts to mitigate the risk of non-performance by selecting
counterparties with high credit ratings and monitoring their creditworthiness and by diversifying derivatives among multiple counterparties.

The Company has exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. The Company
attempts to mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk through active portfolio management, which includes rebalancing its existing portfolios of assets and liabilities, as well as changing the characteristics of investments to be purchased or sold
in the future. In addition, derivative financial instruments are used to modify the interest rate exposure of certain liabilities. These strategies include the use of interest rate swaps and forward contracts. These instruments are generally used to
lock interest rates or to hedge (on an economic basis) interest rate risks associated with variable rate debt. The Company has used these types of instruments as designated hedges against specific liabilities.

The contractual or notional amounts for derivatives are used to calculate the
exchange of contractual payments under the agreements and are not representative of the potential for gain or loss on these instruments. Interest rates and equity prices affect the fair value of derivatives. The fair values generally represent the
estimated amounts that WellPoint would expect to receive or pay upon termination of the contracts at the reporting date. Dealer quotes are available for substantially all of the Company’s derivatives. For derivative instruments not actively
traded, fair values are estimated using values obtained from independent pricing services, costs to settle or quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Premium and Self-Funded Receivables:

Premium and self-funded receivables include the uncollected amounts from insured and self-funded
groups, and are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $96.0 and $78.1 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical collection trends and management’s judgment
regarding the ability to collect specific accounts.

Other Receivables:

Other receivables include proceeds due from brokers on investment trades, government programs, pharmacy sales, reinsurance, claim recoveries and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. These
receivables have been reduced by an allowance for uncollectible amounts of $90.9 and $84.6 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which is based on historical collection trends and management’s judgment regarding the ability to
collect specific accounts.

The Company’s pharmacy benefit
managers (“PBM”) contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of whom provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers’ products by the PBM’s affiliated and non-affiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates receivable on a
monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The PBM bills these rebates to the manufacturers on a quarterly basis. The Company records rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction
to benefit expense. Rebates attributable to non-affiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to non-affiliated clients in accordance with their contracts is also
recorded. The Company generally receives rebates between two to five months after billing.

Property and Equipment:

Property and equipment is recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging
from 15 to



WellPoint, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

39 years for buildings, two to eight years for furniture and equipment, and three to ten years for computer software. Leasehold improvements are depreciated
over the term of the related lease. Certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal-use software are capitalized and amortized in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 98-1,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use

.

Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets:

The Company follows FAS 141,

Business Combinations

, and FAS 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. FAS 141 requires business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting
and it also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under FAS 142, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for
impairment at least annually. Goodwill represents the excess of cost of acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent the values assigned to subscriber bases, provider and hospital networks, Blue Cross and
Blue Shield trademarks, licenses, non-compete and other agreements. Goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reportable segments based on membership.

Retirement Benefits:

Pension benefits are recorded in accordance with FAS 87,

Employers’ Accounting
for Pensions

. Prepaid pension benefits represent prepaid costs related to defined benefit pension plans and are reported with other noncurrent assets. Liabilities for pension benefits are reported with other noncurrent liabilities.

Postretirement benefits represent outstanding obligations for retiree
medical, life, vision and dental benefits. These benefits are accrued in accordance with FAS 106,

Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

. The Company accrues the estimated costs of retiree health and other
postretirement benefits during the periods in which eligible employees render service to earn the benefits, and are reported with other noncurrent liabilities.

The “Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” became law in December 2003 and expanded Medicare, primarily
adding a prescription drug benefit for Medicare-eligible retirees starting January 1, 2006. The Company anticipates that the retiree medical benefits it pays in 2006 and beyond will be lower as a result of the new Medicare provisions. During
2004, the Company adopted accounting guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position (“FSP”) 106-1 and 106-2,

Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003.

The impact of adopting FSP 106-1 and 106-2, while accretive to earnings, is not material to the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Medical Claims Payable:

Liabilities for medical claims payable
include estimated provisions for both reported and unreported claims incurred on an undiscounted basis, as well as estimated provisions for expenses related to the processing of claims. The liabilities are developed using actuarial principles and
assumptions that consider, among other things, contractual requirements, historical utilization trends, claim submission and payment patterns, benefit changes, medical inflation, product mix, seasonality, membership and other relevant factors. The
liabilities are regularly reviewed and adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. Due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to claims liabilities occur each quarter. Although it is not possible
to measure the degree of variability inherent in such estimates, management believes these liabilities are adequate and has consistently applied the methodology in determining the best estimate for medical claims payable at each reporting date.



WellPoint, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Premium deficiencies are recognized when it is probable that expected claims and administrative expenses will exceed future premiums on existing medical insurance contracts without consideration of investment income.
Determination of premium deficiencies for longer duration life and disability contracts includes consideration of investment income. For purposes of premium deficiencies, contracts are deemed to be either short or long duration and are grouped in a
manner consistent with the Company’s method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. Once established, premium deficiencies are released commensurate with actual claims experience over the remaining life of the
contract.

Reserves for Future Policy Benefits:

Reserves for future policy benefits include liabilities for life and long-term disability insurance policy benefits based upon interest, mortality and morbidity assumptions from published actuarial tables, modified based upon the Company’s
experience. Future policy benefits also include liabilities for insurance policies for which some of the premiums received in earlier years are intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years. Future policy benefits are
continually monitored and reviewed, and when reserves are adjusted, differences are reflected in benefit expense. The current portion of reserves for future policy benefits relates to the portion of such reserves that the Company expects to pay
within one year. The Company believes that its liabilities for future policy benefits, along with future premiums received, are adequate to satisfy its ultimate benefit liability; however, these estimates are inherently subject to a number of
variable circumstances. Consequently, the actual results could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

Other Policyholder Liabilities:

Other policyholder liabilities include certain case-specific reserves as well
as rate stabilization reserves associated with retrospectively rated insurance contracts. Rate stabilization reserves represent accumulated premiums that exceed what customers owe based on actual claim experience and are paid based on contractual
requirements.

Revenue Recognition:

Gross
premiums for fully-insured contracts are recognized as revenue over the period insurance coverage is provided. Premiums applicable to the unexpired contractual coverage periods are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as
unearned income. Premiums include revenue from retrospectively rated contracts where revenue is based on the estimated ultimate loss experience of the contract. Premium revenue includes an adjustment for retrospectively rated refunds based on an
estimate of incurred claims. Premium rates for certain lines of business are subject to approval by the Department of Insurance of each respective state.

Administrative fees include revenue from certain group contracts that provide for the group to be at risk for all, or with supplemental insurance
arrangements, a portion of their claims experience. The Company charges these self-funded groups an administrative fee, which is based on the number of members in a group or the group’s claim experience. In addition, administrative fees include
amounts received for the administration of Medicare or certain other government programs. Under the Company’s self-funded arrangements, revenue is recognized as administrative services are performed. All benefit payments under these programs
are excluded from benefit expense.

Other revenue principally
includes amounts from mail-order prescription drug sales, which are recognized as revenue when the Company ships prescription drug orders.

Federal Income Taxes:

The Company files a consolidated income tax return. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws. The deferred tax benefits of the deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent realization of such benefits
is more likely than not. Deferred income tax expense or



WellPoint, Inc.

benefit generally represents the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year. Current income tax expense represents the tax
consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported.

Stock-Based Compensation:

The Company has a plan that provides for stock-based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock
awards and an employee stock purchase plan. Stock options are granted for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price at least equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of the grant. Restricted stock awards are issued at the fair value
of the stock on the grant date. The employee stock purchase plan allows for a purchase price per share which is 85% of the lower of the fair value of a share of common stock on (i) the first trading day of the plan quarter, or (ii) the
last trading day of the plan quarter. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”), and,
accordingly, recognizes no compensation expense related to stock options and employee stock purchases. For grants of restricted stock, other than those awarded under long-term incentive agreements, unearned compensation equivalent to the fair value
of the shares at the date of grant is recorded as a separate component of shareholders’ equity and subsequently amortized to compensation expense over the award’s vesting period. The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of
FAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(“FAS 123”), as amended by FAS 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure

.

On December 16, 2004, FAS 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“FAS 123R”), was issued. FAS 123R
is a revision of FAS 123, supersedes APB 25 and amends FAS 95,

Statement of Cash Flows

. Generally, the approach in FAS 123R is similar to the approach described in FAS 123. However, FAS 123R requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values and pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. Additionally, excess tax benefits, as defined in FAS 123R, will be
recognized as an addition to additional paid-in-capital and will be reclassified from operating cash flows to financing cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

The Company adopted FAS 123R on January 1, 2006, using the modified prospective transition method. Under the modified
prospective transition method, fair value accounting and recognition provisions of FAS 123R are applied to share-based awards granted or modified subsequent to the date of adoption and prior periods presented are not restated. In addition, for
awards granted prior to the effective date, the unvested portion of the awards shall be recognized in periods subsequent to the adoption based on the grant date fair value determined for recognition or pro forma disclosure purposes under FAS 123.
The overall impact of adopting FAS 123R will reduce 2006 earnings by approximately 3% to 5% given the Company’s current stock-based compensation programs and will reduce operating cash flows for the excess tax benefits that must be shown as
cash flows from financing activities. The Company does not expect that the adoption of FAS 123R will have a material impact on its financial position.

The Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans are described in Note 12. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of FAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation:

Earnings Per
Share:

Earnings per share amounts, on a basic and diluted basis, have been calculated based upon the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the period.

Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock and purchase contracts included in Equity Security Units, using the treasury stock
method. The treasury stock method assumes exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock and conversion of stock purchase rights under purchase contracts included in Equity Security Units, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common
stock at the average market price for the period. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares. The purchase contracts included in Equity Security Units were settled
in November 2004, and the common stock issued is included in the basic earnings per share calculation at December 31, 2004 and thereafter. Under long-term incentive plans, when cumulative net income, as defined, met or exceeded threshold
targets, contingently issuable shares were dilutive to earnings per share.

Reclassifications:

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

3. Business Combinations

Merger with WellChoice, Inc.

On December 28, 2005, the Company completed its merger with WellChoice, Inc. (“WellChoice”), which was announced on September 27,
2005. The merger was deemed effective December 31, 2005 for accounting purposes; accordingly, the operating results of WellChoice will be included in WellPoint’s consolidated financial statements in periods following December 31,
2005.



WellPoint, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

3. Business Combinations (continued)

Under the
merger agreement, WellChoice stockholders received thirty-eight dollars and twenty-five cents ($38.25) in cash and 0.5191 of a share of WellPoint common stock for each share of WellChoice common stock outstanding. The value of the transaction is
estimated to be approximately $6,452.0, including cash of $3,126.4, the issuance of 42.4 shares of common stock, valued at $3,180.8, 0.3 shares of WellChoice restricted stock and stock units converted to WellPoint stock, valued at $19.8, WellChoice
stock options converted to WellPoint stock options, valued at $113.4, and $11.6 of estimated transaction costs. The fair value of common stock issued was based on $74.97 per share, which represents the average closing price of the Company’s
common stock for the five trading days ranging from two days before to two days after September 27, 2005, the date the merger was announced.

In accordance with FAS 141 the purchase price was allocated to the fair value of WellChoice assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including
identifiable intangible assets. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired resulted in $3,445.2 of non-tax deductible goodwill which was allocated to the Health Care segment. The purchase price allocation is preliminary
and is subject to change as fair value estimates and opening balance sheet liabilities, including those related to employee terminations and other merger-related exit activities, are refined.

The estimated fair values of WellChoice assets acquired and liabilities
assumed at the date of the merger are summarized as follows:

Of the $1,729.5 of
acquired intangible assets, $1,152.8 was assigned to Blue Cross and Blue Shield trademarks, which are not subject to amortization due to their indefinite life. The remaining acquired intangible assets consist of $563.2 of subscriber base with an
average life of 15 years and $13.5 of provider contracts with a 20 year life. The values assigned to goodwill and intangible assets with finite and indefinite lives were determined based on independent third-party valuations.

The pro forma effects of this acquisition were not material to the
Company’s consolidated results of operations.

Lumenos, Inc.
Acquisition

On June 9, 2005, the Company
completed its acquisition of Lumenos, Inc. (“Lumenos”), a market leader in consumer-driven health programs. The total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $185.0 in cash paid to the stockholders of Lumenos. The acquisition
was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and was deemed effective June 1, 2005 for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the results of



WellPoint, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

3. Business Combinations (continued)

operations for Lumenos are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for periods following June 1, 2005. In accordance with
FAS 141, the purchase price was allocated to the fair value of Lumenos assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including identifiable intangible assets, and the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired resulted in
$119.5 of non-tax deductible goodwill, which was allocated to the Health Care segment. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and additional refinements may occur. The pro forma effects of this acquisition were not material to the
Company’s consolidated results of operations.

Merger with WellPoint
Health Networks Inc.

As described in Note 1, on
November 30, 2004, Anthem completed its merger with WHN and purchased 100% of the outstanding common stock of WHN. As a result of the merger, each WHN stockholder received twenty-three dollars and eighty cents ($23.80) in cash, without
interest, and one share of WellPoint common stock for each share of WHN common stock held. The purchase price was $15,773.6 and included cash of $3,718.8, the issuance of approximately 310.6 shares of WellPoint common stock, valued at $11,293.8, WHN
stock options converted to WellPoint stock options and other stock awards for approximately 43.7 shares, valued at $563.6, and $197.4 of estimated transaction costs. The fair value of common stock issued was based on $36.35 per share, which
represents the average closing price of the Company’s common stock for the five trading days ranging from two days before to two days after October 27, 2003, the date the merger was announced.

In accordance with FAS 141, the purchase price was allocated to the fair
value of WHN assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including identifiable intangible assets. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired resulted in $7,626.4 of non-tax deductible goodwill, of which $7,397.6 was
allocated to the Health Care segment and $228.8 to the Specialty segment.

The estimated fair values of WHN assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the merger, adjusted for final purchase price allocations, are summarized as follows:

Of the $7,031.7 of
acquired intangible assets, $4,370.0 was assigned to Blue Cross and Blue Shield and other trademarks, $271.0 was assigned to provider networks, and $258.0 was assigned to a license for a state sponsored program, which are not subject to amortization
due to their indefinite life. The remaining acquired intangible assets consist of $2,030.0 of subscriber base with an average life of 20 years and $102.7 of provider contracts with a 23 year life. The values assigned to goodwill and intangible
assets with finite and indefinite lives were determined based on independent third-party valuations.

The results of operations for WHN are included in WellPoint’s consolidated financial statements for the periods following November 30, 2004.

In
connection with the WHN merger, the Company executed certain undertakings with the California Department of Managed Health Care, the California Department of Insurance (“California DOI”), and the Georgia Department of Insurance
(“Georgia DOI”), which contained various commitments by the Company. Expenses for merger related undertakings of $61.5 were recorded in 2004 for certain obligations under these agreements with the California DOI and the Georgia DOI. Under
these obligations, during 2005, WellPoint donated $35.0 to community clinics in California and $15.0 for a program to be conducted through California community colleges to support the training of new nurses in California. Further, Blue Cross and
Blue Shield of Georgia, Inc. and Blue Cross and Blue Shield Healthcare Plan of Georgia, Inc., started to fund the establishment and administration of a telemedicine network to benefit health care in rural Georgia under the $11.5 commitment
established in connection with the WHN merger.

The unaudited
pro forma information includes the results of operations for WHN for the periods prior to the merger, adjusted for interest expense on long-term debt and reduced investment income related to the cash and investment securities used to fund the
acquisition, additional amortization and depreciation associated with the purchase and the related income tax effects. The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and may not be indicative of the
results of operations had WHN been owned by WellPoint for the full years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results of operations.

4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (continued)

Goodwill acquired in 2005 included $3,445.2 related to the merger with WellChoice, $119.5 related to the acquisition of Lumenos and $0.9 related to other acquisitions. Goodwill adjustments of $72.1 in 2005 relate primarily to adjustments
for costs associated with employee terminations and costs for exiting certain activities in connection with the WHN merger. The Company recorded an estimate of these liabilities at the merger date, which resulted in an increase to goodwill. For a
period of time after the merger date, adjustments to these initial estimates are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill. Subsequent to this purchase price allocation period, any additional changes are recorded as a charge to current operations,
except for adjustments to income taxes, which will continue to be adjusted to goodwill. Goodwill adjustments in 2005 also include reductions of $25.4 related to other purchase accounting adjustments related to the WHN merger and $161.1 related to
the tax benefit on the exercise of stock options issued as part of the WHN and Trigon Healthcare, Inc. (“Trigon”) acquisitions.

Goodwill acquired in 2004 included $7,579.6 related to the merger with WHN and $6.1 of additional goodwill related to a contingent earnout for a
subsidiary in the Company’s Health Care segment. Goodwill reductions of $17.9 in 2004 relate to the exercise of stock options issued as part of the WHN and Trigon acquisitions.

The following table represents a reconciliation of employee termination and other exit costs recorded in connection with the
WHN merger:

The components of
other intangible assets as of December 31 are as follows:

4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (continued)

As required by FAS 142, the Company completed its annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarters of 2005, 2004 and 2003. These tests involved the use of estimates
related to the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are allocated. There were no impairment losses recorded during 2005, 2004 and 2003.

As of December 31, 2005, estimated amortization expense for each of the
five years ending December 31, is as follows: 2006, $296.2; 2007, $280.1; 2008, $263.3; 2009, $246.0; and 2010, $226.4.

A summary of current and long-term investments, available-for-sale, is as follows:



WellPoint, Inc.

5. Investments (continued)

The following table
summarizes for fixed maturity securities and equity securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, the aggregate fair value and gross unrealized loss by length of time those securities have been continuously in an unrealized loss
position.

The Company’s
fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, which impact the fair value of individual securities. Unrealized losses reported above were generally caused by the effect of a rising interest rate environment on
certain securities with stated interest rates currently below market rates. The Company has the ability and intent to hold these securities until their full cost can be recovered. Therefore, the Company does not believe the unrealized losses
represent an other-than-temporary impairment as of December 31, 2005.

The amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2005, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities may be less than contractual maturities because the issuers of
the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.

Actual maturities may
differ from contractual maturities because certain securities may be called or prepaid with or without call or prepayment penalties.

The major
categories of net investment income for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

Net realized
investment (losses) gains and net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation in investments for the years ended December 31, were as follows:

Investment securities
are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market and credit. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of investment securities, it is possible that
changes in these risk factors in the near term could have an adverse material impact on the Company’s results of operations or shareholders’ equity.



WellPoint, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

5. Investments (continued)

A primary objective
in the management of the fixed maturity and equity portfolios is to maximize total return relative to underlying liabilities and respective liquidity needs. In achieving this goal, assets may be sold to take advantage of market conditions or other
investment opportunities as well as tax considerations. Sales will produce realized gains and losses.

A significant judgment in the valuation of investments is the determination of when an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. The Company
follows a consistent and systematic process for impairing securities that sustain other-than-temporary declines in value. The Company has established a committee responsible for the impairment review process.

The decision to impair a security incorporates both quantitative criteria and
qualitative information. The impairment review process considers a number of factors including, but not limited to: (a) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than book value, (b) the financial condition
and near term prospects of the issuer, (c) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in value, (d) whether the debtor is current on interest and
principal payments and (e) general market conditions and industry or sector specific factors. For securities that are deemed to be impaired, the security is adjusted to fair value and the resulting losses are recognized in realized gains or
losses in the consolidated statements of income. The new cost basis of the impaired securities is not increased for future recoveries in fair value.

Impairments recorded in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were primarily the result of the continued credit deterioration on specific issuers in the bond and equity
markets.

At December 31, 2005, no investments other than
investments in U.S. government agency securities exceeded 10% of shareholders’ equity.

The carrying value of fixed maturity investments that did not produce income during 2005 and 2004 was $4.7 and $0.0 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

As of December 31, 2005 the Company had committed approximately $22.6 to
future capital calls from various third-party limited partnership investments in exchange for an ownership interest in the related partnerships.

Restricted Investments

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, securities with carrying values of approximately $227.9 and $210.2 were deposited by the Company’s insurance
subsidiaries under requirements of regulatory authorities.

During 2005 and 2004, the Company entered into securities lending programs. Securities on loan under the Company’s securities lending programs are included in the investment captions shown on the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. Under these programs, brokers and dealers who borrow securities are required to deliver substantially the same security to the Company upon completion of the transaction. The fair value of securities on loan as of December 31, 2005 and
2004 was $1,360.1 and $643.8, respectively. Income earned on security lending transactions for the year ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $1.6, $0.1 and $0.0, respectively.

6. Derivative Financial Instruments

A summary of the aggregate contractual or notional amounts and estimated fair values related to derivative financial instruments at December 31 is as
follows:

For the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company recognized realized gains related to derivative financial instruments of $1.5 and $0.7, respectively. There were no realized gains or losses on derivative financial instruments for the years ended
December 31, 2003.

Fair Value Hedges

During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company entered into two
fair value hedges with a total notional value of $660.0. The first hedge is a $360.0 notional amount interest rate swap agreement to exchange a fixed 6.8% rate for a LIBOR-based floating rate and expires on August 1, 2012. The second hedge is a
$300.0 notional amount interest rate swap agreement to exchange a fixed 5.00% rate for LIBOR-based floating rate and expires December 15, 2014.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company entered into a $300.0 notional amount interest rate swap agreement to exchange a fixed 3.75%
rate for a LIBOR-based floating rate. The swap agreement expires December 14, 2007.

For the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company recognized $0.5 and $0.1 from these swap agreements, which were recorded as a reduction of interest expense.

Cash Flow Hedges

During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company entered into a floating to fixed rate cash flow hedge with a total
notional value of $480.0. The purpose of this hedge is to offset the variability of the cash flows due to the rollover of the Company’s variable-rate one-month commercial paper issuance. This swap agreement expires in December 2007. During the
year ended December 31, 2005, no gain or loss from hedged ineffectiveness was recorded in earnings and the commercial paper borrowings remain outstanding at December 31, 2005. The unrecognized gain included in accumulated other
comprehensive income at December 31, 2005 was $3.6.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company entered into forward starting pay fixed swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $875.0. The objective of these hedges was to eliminate the variability of cash flows in the
interest payments on the debt securities to be issued to partially fund the cash portion of the WellChoice merger. The unrecognized loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2005 was $12.5. As of December 31,
2005, the total amount of amortization over the next twelve months is expected to increase interest expense by approximately $0.6.



WellPoint, Inc.

6. Derivative Financial Instruments (continued)

During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company entered into forward starting pay fixed swaps and treasury lock swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $2,000.0. The objective of these hedges was to eliminate the variability of
cash flows in the interest payments on the debt securities to be issued to partially fund the cash portion of the WHN merger. These swaps were terminated in 2004, and the Company received a net $15.7, the net fair value at the time of termination.
In addition, the Company recorded an unrealized gain of $10.2, net of tax, as accumulated other comprehensive income. Prior to the WHN merger, the Company reclassified $0.7 ($0.5, net of tax) to net realized gains on investment for the portion of
the hedges that were deemed not probable of occurring. Following the completion of the WHN merger on November 30, 2004, the Company issued debt securities, and the unamortized fair value of the forward starting pay fixed swaps included in
balances in accumulated other comprehensive income began amortizing into earnings, as a reduction of interest expense, over the life of the debt securities. The unrecognized gain included in accumulated other comprehensive income at
December 31, 2005 was $8.9. As of December 31, 2005, the total amount of amortization over the next twelve months will decrease interest expense by approximately $1.3.

7. Long-Term Debt

The carrying value of long-term debt at December 31 consists of the following:

WellPoint had cash
requirements of approximately $3,138.0 for the WellChoice merger, including both the cash portion of the purchase price and estimated transaction costs. In anticipation of the merger, on December 28, 2005, WellPoint entered into a bridge loan
agreement under which it could borrow up to $3,000.0. On December 28, 2005, WellPoint borrowed $1,700.0 under this bridge facility to partially fund the WellChoice merger. The interest rate on this bridge loan is based on either (i) the
LIBOR rate plus a predetermined



WellPoint, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

7. Long-Term Debt (continued)

percentage rate based on the Company’s credit rating at the date of utilization, or (ii) a base rate as defined in the facility agreement. The
weighted-average interest rate on the bridge loan at December 31, 2005 was 7.250%. The bridge loan has been classified as long-term debt at December 31, 2005 in accordance with FAS 6,

Classification of Short-Term Obligations Expected to
Be Refinanced

(“FAS 6”), as this short-term borrowing was replaced with a long-term borrowing on January 10, 2006.

On December 28, 2005, WellPoint filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register an unlimited amount of any
combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. On January 10, 2006, the Company issued $700.0 of 5.000% notes due 2011; $1,100.0 of 5.250% notes due 2016; and $900.0 of 5.850% notes due 2036 under this registration
statement. The proceeds from this debt issuance were used to repay the bridge loan of $1,700.0 and to repay approximately $1,000.0 of commercial paper obtained to partially fund the WellChoice merger.

On November 29, 2005, the Company entered into a senior credit facility
(the “facility”) with certain lenders for general corporate purposes. The facility provides credit for up to $2,500.0 (reduced for any commercial paper issuances) and matures on November 29, 2010. The interest rate on this facility is
based on either (i) the LIBOR rate plus a predetermined percentage rate based on the Company’s credit rating at the date of utilization, or (ii) a base rate as defined in the facility agreement. The Company’s ability to borrow
under the facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants. Commitment fees for the facility were $1.4 in 2005 and there are no conditions that are probable of occurring under which the facility may be withdrawn. There were no amounts
outstanding under the senior credit facility as of December 31, 2005.

In August 2004, the Company issued $200.0 of 3.500% notes due 2007, which were used to exchange and retire $190.0 aggregate principal amount of 4.655% remarketed subordinated debentures. The Company also received
approximately $4.7 of cash proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses. These notes were issued under a shelf registration filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2002 for any combination of debt or equity
securities in one or more offerings up to an aggregate amount of $1,000.0. This shelf registration was cancelled in December of 2005.

On December 9, 2004, the Company issued $300.0 of 3.750% notes due 2007, $300.0 of 4.250% notes due 2009, $500.0 of 5.000% notes due 2014 and $500.0
of 5.950% notes due 2034. Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $1,583.7 after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and estimated offering expenses. Proceeds from these notes were used to repay borrowings at November 30,
2004 to partially fund the cash portion of the WHN purchase price and to fund the tender offer to purchase $500.0 of surplus notes of Anthem Insurance Companies, Inc. (“Anthem Insurance”). The remainder of the proceeds was used to repay
commercial paper.

The senior unsecured notes of 6.375% due
2006 and 6.375% due 2012 were obligations of WHN prior to the merger. This indebtedness was assumed by Anthem Holding Corp., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of WellPoint. As required by FAS 141, this debt was recorded at fair value as of the merger
date.

Surplus notes are unsecured obligations of Anthem
Insurance, a wholly owned subsidiary, and are subordinate in right of payment to all of Anthem Insurance’s existing and future indebtedness. Any payment of interest or principal on the surplus notes may be made only with the prior approval of
the Indiana Department of Insurance (“IDOI”), and only out of capital and surplus funds of Anthem Insurance that the IDOI determines to be available for the payment under Indiana insurance laws. During December 2004, WellPoint completed a
tender offer to purchase Anthem Insurance surplus notes from the holders, and purchased $258.0 of 9.125% notes



WellPoint, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

7. Long-Term Debt (continued)

due 2010 and $174.9 of 9.000% notes due 2027. The Company recorded a loss of $146.1 which has been recorded as loss on repurchase of debt securities in the
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2004.

The Company has an authorized commercial paper program of up to $2,000.0, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. The weighted-average interest rate on commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2005 and 2004
were 4.40% and 2.44%, respectively. Commercial paper borrowings have been classified as long-term debt at December 31, 2004 in accordance with FAS 6, as the Company’s practice and intent is to replace short-term commercial paper
outstanding at expiration with additional short-term commercial paper for an uninterrupted period extending for more than one year or with borrowings under the senior credit facility described above.

Interest paid during 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $238.7, $146.7 and $136.4,
respectively.

The Company was in compliance with all
applicable covenants under its outstanding debt agreements.

Future maturities of debt, including capital leases, are as follows: 2006, $3,782.6; 2007, $495.3; 2008, $9.0; 2009, $307.4; 2010, $45.5 and thereafter $2,166.1.

8. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

In the normal course of business, WellPoint invests in various financial assets, incurs various financial liabilities and enters into agreements involving
derivative securities.

Fair values are disclosed for all
financial instruments, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, whether or not such values are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Management attempts to obtain quoted market prices for these disclosures. Where quoted market
prices are not available, fair values are estimated using present value or other valuation techniques. These techniques are significantly affected by management’s assumptions, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows.
Potential taxes and other transaction costs have not been considered in estimating fair values. The estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize in a current market exchange.

Non-financial instruments such as real estate, property and equipment,
deferred income taxes and intangibles, and certain financial instruments such as policy liabilities are excluded from the fair value disclosures. Therefore, the fair value amounts cannot be aggregated to determine the underlying economic value of
the Company.

The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated
balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income, premium and self-funded receivables, other receivables, securities lending collateral, unearned income, accounts payable and accrued expenses, income taxes payable, security
trades pending payable and certain other current liabilities approximate fair value because of the short term nature of these items. These assets and liabilities are not listed in the following table.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instrument:

Current and long-term
investments, available-for-sale, at fair value:

The carrying amount approximates fair value, based on quoted market prices, where available. For securities not actively traded, fair values were estimated using values obtained from independent
pricing services or quoted market prices of comparable instruments.



WellPoint, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

8. Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued)

Other invested assets, long term

: The Company’s investments in limited partnerships are carried at its share in the partnerships’ undistributed retained earnings, which approximates fair value.

Other notes

: The fair value of other notes is based on quoted market
prices for the same or similar debt, or, if no quoted market prices were available, on the current rates estimated to be available to the Company for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities.

Commercial paper:

The carrying amount for commercial paper
approximates fair value as the underlying instruments have variable interest rates at market value.

Interest rate swaps:

The fair value of the interest rate swaps are based on the quoted market prices by the financial institution that is the
counterparty to the swap.

Equity warrants:

The fair
value of equity warrants are based on quoted market prices, where available. For securities not actively traded, fair values were estimated using values obtained from independent pricing services or quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

The carrying values and estimated fair values of the
Company’s financial instruments at December 31 are as follows:

9. Property and Equipment

A summary of property and equipment at December 31 is
as follows:



WellPoint, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

9. Property and Equipment (continued)

Property
and equipment includes assets purchased under noncancelable capital leases of $54.7 and $25.7 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Total accumulated amortization on leased assets at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $17.0 and $5.9,
respectively. Depreciation expense for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $102.7, $81.7 and $77.3, respectively. Amortization expense on leased assets, software and leasehold improvements for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $125.9, $54.0 and $50.5, respectively.
Capitalized costs related to the internal development of software of $409.9 and $330.9 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, are reported with computer software.

10. Medical Claims Payable

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for medical claims payable is as follows:

Amounts incurred
related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled. Liabilities at any year end are continually reviewed and re-estimated as information regarding actual claims payments becomes known. This
information is compared to the originally established year end liability. Negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated. The favorable development in medical
claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 is primarily attributable to actual medical cost experience being more favorable than that assumed at the time the liability was established.

11. Reinsurance

The Company reinsures certain of its risks with other companies and assumes risk from other companies and such reinsurance
is accounted for as a transfer of risk. The Company remains primarily liable to policyholders under ceded insurance contracts and is contingently liable for amounts recoverable from reinsurers in the event that such reinsurers do not meet their
contractual obligations.

12. Capital Stock

Shares Issued for the WellChoice Merger

On December 28, 2005, as partial consideration in the WellChoice merger, the Company issued .05191 of a share of WellPoint common stock for each share of WellChoice common stock outstanding, resulting in
additional outstanding shares of approximately 42.7. The $3,200.6 fair value of the common shares issued was determined based on $74.97 per share, which represents the average closing price of the Company’s common stock for the five trading
days ranging from two days before to two days after September 27, 2005, the date the merger was announced. Transaction costs of $11.6 reduced the aggregate fair value and $3,189.0 was recorded as par value of common stock and additional paid-in
capital.

Shares Issued for the WHN Merger

Effective November 30, 2004, as partial consideration in the WHN merger,
the Company issued one share of common stock for each WHN share outstanding, resulting in additional outstanding shares of approximately 310.6. The $11,293.8 fair value of the common shares issued was determined based on $36.35 per share, which
represents the average closing price of the Company’s common stock for the five trading days ranging from two days before to two days after October 27, 2003, the date the merger was announced. Offering costs of $8.3 reduced the aggregate
fair value and $11,285.5 was recorded as par value of common stock and additional paid-in capital.

Stock Incentive Plan

s

The Company’s 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (“Stock Plan”) provides for the granting of stock options, restricted stock awards, performance stock awards, performance awards and stock appreciation rights to
eligible employees and non-employee directors. The Stock Plan permits the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to make grants in such amounts and at such times as it may determine, including grants of shares of restricted and
unrestricted common stock in lieu of the Company’s obligations to pay cash under other plans and compensatory arrangements, including the Company’s Annual Incentive Plan and Long Term Incentive Plan.

In accordance with the Stock Plan, options to purchase shares of common stock
at an amount equal to the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant were granted to eligible employees and non-employee directors during 2005, 2004 and 2003. Options vest and expire over terms as set by the Compensation Committee at the
time of grant. In 2005, the Company changed the vesting provisions of newly granted options to six equal semi-annual vesting tranches. Options granted prior to 2005 vested in three equal annual tranches. All options expire ten years from the grant
date. Certain grants contain provision whereby the employee continues to vest in the award subsequent to termination due to retirement. The Company’s expense attribution methodology ignores such vesting provisions and the fair value of the
awards is amortized over the stated vesting periods. Effective with the adoption of FAS 123R, the Company will change its attribution method and will then consider all vesting provisions in determining the requisite service period over which the
fair value of the awards will be recognized.

In connection
with the WellChoice merger, the Company assumed the WellChoice, Inc. 2003 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which provided for the granting of stock options to employees and non-employee directors. WellChoice stock options were converted to WellPoint stock
options using the option exchange ratio as defined in the merger agreement. The converted stock options were recorded at the acquisition date as additional paid-in capital and valued at $113.4 using a binomial lattice model. The following
weighted-average assumptions were used for the conversion: risk free interest rate of 4.32%; volatility factor of 22.00%; expected dividend yield of 0.00%; and expected option life of three years.



WellPoint, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

12. Capital Stock (continued)

In connection
with the WHN merger, the Company assumed the WellPoint Health Networks Inc. 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, the WellPoint Health Networks Inc. 2000 Employee Stock Option Plan, the Cobalt Corporation Equity Incentive Plan, the RightCHOICE Managed Care,
Inc. 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, the RightCHOICE Managed Care, Inc. 1994 Equity Incentive Plan and the RightCHOICE Managed Care, Inc. Nonemployee Directors’ Stock Option Plan, which collectively provided for the granting of stock options to
employees and non-employee directors. WHN stock options were converted to WellPoint stock options using the option exchange ratio as defined in the merger agreement. The converted stock options were recorded at the acquisition date as additional
paid-in capital and valued at $559.9 using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following weighted-average assumptions were used for the conversion: risk free interest rate of 3.07%; volatility factor of 33.00%; expected dividend yield of
0.00%; and expected option life of three years.

A summary of stock option activity for the years ended December 31 is as follows:

Information about
stock options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2005 is summarized as follows:

During the year ended
December 31, 2005, pursuant to the Stock Plan, the Company granted 1.3 shares of restricted stock to eligible employees. The restricted stock vests in equal annual installments over three years.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, pursuant to the Stock Plan, the
Company granted 2.2 shares of stock, including 1.4 shares of restricted stock and 0.2 shares of WellPoint common stock under the Company’s 2001 Long-Term Incentive Plan.



WellPoint, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

12. Capital Stock (continued)

During the year
ended December 31, 2003, pursuant to the Stock Plan, the Company granted 0.1 of restricted stock and stock, primarily for restricted shares to Anthem Southeast employees under long-term incentive agreements and to non-employee directors. The
shares were issued at the fair value of the stock on the grant date. The restricted shares vest over periods defined by the long-term incentive agreements.

As of December 31, 2005, 2.6 shares of restricted stock remain unvested. For grants of restricted stock, other than those awarded under long-term
incentive agreements, unearned compensation equivalent to the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant is recorded as a separate component of shareholders’ equity and subsequently amortized to compensation expense over the vesting
period. Compensation expense totaling $81.2, $10.0 and $2.2 was recognized for these grants in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

As of December 31, 2005, there were 15.9 shares of common stock available for future grants under the Stock Plan.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has registered 6.0 shares of common stock for the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (“Stock Purchase Plan”) which is intended to provide a means to encourage and assist employees in acquiring a stock ownership interest in WellPoint. The Stock Purchase Plan was initiated in June 2002 and any employee that
meets the eligibility requirements, as defined, may participate. No employee will be permitted to purchase more than $25,000 (actual dollars) worth of stock in any calendar year, based on the fair market value of the stock at the beginning of each
plan quarter. Employees become participants by electing payroll deductions from 1% to 15% of gross compensation. Payroll deductions are accumulated during each quarter and applied toward the purchase of stock on the last trading day of each quarter.
Once purchased, the stock is accumulated in the employee’s investment account. The purchase price per share is 85% of the lower of the fair market value of a share of common stock on either the first or last trading day of the quarter. Employee
purchases under the Stock Purchase Plan were $52.2, $21.9 and $18.4, respectively, resulting in the issuance of approximately 1.0, 0.6 and 0.6 shares during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, there were approximately
3.4 shares of common stock available for issuance under the Stock Purchase Plan.

Fair Value

The pro forma information
regarding net income and earnings per share presented in Note 2 has been determined as if the Company accounted for its stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The Company has historically used a Black-Scholes option pricing model to
estimate the fair value of stock options. The inputs for volatility and expected term of the options were primarily based on historical information.

In 2005, the Company began using a binomial lattice valuation model to estimate the fair value of all future stock options granted. The binomial lattice
model is deemed to provide a more accurate estimate of the fair values of employee stock options as it incorporates the impact of employee exercise behavior and allows for the input of a range of assumptions. Expected volatilities utilized in the
lattice model are based on an analysis of implied volatilities of publicly traded options on WellPoint stock and historical volatility of WellPoint’s stock price. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury strip rates at the
time of the grant. The expected term of the options was derived from the outputs of the lattice model, which incorporates post-vesting forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The dividend yield was based on the Company’s
estimate of future dividend yields. Groups of employees that have similar exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The Company utilizes the multiple-grant approach for recognizing

compensation cost associated with the vesting tranches of the option grant. The following weighted-average assumptions were used to estimate the fair values
of options. In 2005, the expected life represents the fair value calculated by the binomial lattice model as the model does not require the input of an expected life assumption:

The binomial lattice
and Black-Scholes option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company’s stock option grants have characteristics significantly different from those of
traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s opinion, existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock
option grants.

The following weighted-average fair values were
determined for the years ending December 31:

Stock Repurchase Program

Under the Board of Directors’ authorization,
WellPoint maintains a common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. During 2005, WellPoint repurchased and retired approximately
5.1 shares at an average cost per share of $64.92 for an aggregate cost of $333.4. During 2004, the Company repurchased and retired 2.0 shares, at an average per share price of $41.12, for an aggregate cost of $82.3. During 2003, the Company
repurchased and retired approximately 6.8 shares, at an average per share price of $32.03, for an aggregate cost of $217.2. The excess of cost of the repurchased shares over par value is charged on a pro rata basis to additional paid-in capital and
retained earnings. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to an additional $2,000.0 of common stock. The Company’s stock repurchase program is discretionary as the Company is under no
obligation to repurchase shares. Shares are repurchased under the program because the Company believes it is a prudent use of capital.

Equity Security Units

At the time of its initial public offering on November 2, 2001, the Company issued 4.6 Equity Security Units at 6.00%. Each Equity Security Unit
contained a purchase contract under which the holder agreed to purchase, for twenty-five dollars, shares of the Company’s common stock on November 15, 2004. In November 2004, the Company received $230.0 for the issuance of approximately
10.6 shares of Anthem common stock pursuant to the purchase contract portion of the Equity Security Units. The number of shares purchased was determined based on the average trading price of the Company’s common stock at the time of settlement.

The net decrease
in the valuation allowance for 2005 and 2004 was $0.0 and $33.8, respectively. The valuation allowance is attributable to the uncertainty of alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) credits and net operating loss carryforwards. As deferred tax
assets related to these types of deductions are recognized in the tax return, the valuation allowance is no longer required and is reduced. During 2004, the valuation allowance change was due to utilization of AMT credits and net operating loss
carryforwards. Also the 2004 valuation allowance was increased by $4.7 as a result of the WHN merger.

Due to uncertainties, including industry issues, regarding both the timing and amount of deductions, the benefit of the 2004 valuation allowance release
was offset by an increase in additional income tax liabilities during 2004. The industry issues include the valuation and timing of tax deductions for intangible assets in existence as of the conversion of Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations to
taxable status, and the Special Tax Deduction for Blue Cross Blue Shield entities under Internal Revenue Code Section 833(b).

Significant components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, consist of the following:

A reconciliation of
income tax expense recorded in the consolidated statements of income and amounts computed at the statutory federal income tax rate for the years ended December 31, is as follows:

During the first
quarter of 2005, a refund claim filed by the Company in 2003, was approved by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. The claim relates to initially disallowed losses on the sale of certain subsidiaries in the late 1990s. A tax benefit of
$28.4 related to this claim was recorded in the first quarter of 2005. Net income per basic and diluted share related to this claim was $0.04 for the year ended December 31, 2005.

As a result of legislation enacted in Indiana on March 16, 2004, the Company recorded deferred tax assets and
liabilities, with a corresponding net tax benefit in the income statement of $44.8, or $0.15 per basic share and $0.14 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2004. The legislation eliminated the creation of tax

credits resulting from the payment of future assessments to the Indiana Comprehensive Health Insurance Association (“ICHIA”), Indiana’s
high-risk health insurance pool. Under the new legislation, ICHIA tax credits are limited to any unused ICHIA assessment paid prior to December 31, 2004. A valuation allowance of $5.6 was established for the portion of the deferred tax asset,
which the Company believes will likely not be utilized. There is no carryforward limitation on the tax credits and the net operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until 2018.

In certain states, the Company pays premium taxes in lieu of state income taxes. Premium taxes are reported with general and
administrative expense.

At December 31, 2005, the Company
had unused federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $202.8 to offset future taxable income. The loss carryforwards expire in the years 2006 through 2024. During 2005, 2004 and 2003 federal income taxes paid totaled $994.0,
$646.3 and $303.3, respectively.

The Company leases office space and certain computer and related equipment
using noncancelable operating leases. At December 31, 2005, future lease payments for operating leases with initial or remaining noncancelable terms of one year or more consisted of the following:

The Company has
certain lease agreements that contain contingent payment provisions. Under these provisions, the Company pays contingent amounts in addition to base rent, primarily based upon annual changes in the consumer price index. The schedule above contains
estimated amounts for potential future increases in lease payments based on the contingent payment provisions.

Lease expense for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $149.3, $62.8 and $51.3, respectively.



WellPoint, Inc.

17. Retirement Benefits

The Company sponsors various non-contributory defined benefit plans covering most employees.

The Anthem Cash Balance Pension Plan (the “Plan”) is a cash balance arrangement where participants have an account
balance and earn a pay credit equal to three to six percent of compensation, depending on years of service. The Plan covers part-time and temporary employees as well as full-time employees of Anthem prior to its merger with WHN who have completed
one year of continuous service and attained the age of twenty-one. In addition to the pay credit, participant accounts earn interest at a rate based on 10-year Treasury notes. Employees of WHN do not participate in the Plan.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company announced that effective
January 1, 2006, it would curtail the benefits under the Plan. Most participants will no longer have pay credits added to their accounts, but will continue to earn interest on existing account balances. Participants will continue to earn years
of pension service for vesting. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2006, will not be eligible to participate in the Plan. Certain participants will be “grandfathered” into the Plan based on age and years of service in previously
merged plans. Grandfathered participants will continue to receive pay credits under the Plan formula. The Company expects to record a curtailment gain in the first quarter of 2006, which is not anticipated to be material to the consolidated
operating results.

The Employees’ Retirement Plan of Blue
Cross of California covers employees of a collective bargaining unit. The WellPoint Health Networks Inc. Pension Accumulation Plan (the “WellPoint Pension Plan”), which was established on January 1, 1987, covers all eligible employees
of WHN prior to its merger with Anthem (employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement participate if the terms of the collective bargaining agreement permits) meeting certain age and service requirements. Effective January 1, 2004,
non-bargained employees covered by the WellPoint Pension Plan who are age 50 and over, with combined age and service totaling 65 or higher as of December 31, 2003, will continue to earn future contributions based on compensation. While other
non-bargained employees covered by the plan will continue to accrue interest on their pension account, generally no additional contributions based on the employee’s earnings will be made. Employees of WHN prior to its merger with Anthem hired
after December 31, 2003 are not eligible to participate in the WellPoint Pension Plan. Employees of Anthem do not participate in this plan.

Certain employees of the former Cobalt Corporation, parent company of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wisconsin and United Government Services, LLC
(“UGS”) are covered by the UGS Pension Plan which provides retirement benefits to covered employees (including certain employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement) based primarily on compensation and years of service. Effective
January 1, 2004, non-bargained employees covered by the UGS Pension Plan who are age 50 and over, with combined age and service totaling 65 or higher as of December 31, 2003, will continue to earn future contributions based on
compensation. While other non-bargained employees covered by the plan will continue to accrue interest on their pension account, generally no additional contributions based on the employee’s earnings will be made. Employees of UGS hired after
December 31, 2003 are not eligible to participate in the UGS Pension Plan.

WellChoice sponsors a cash balance defined benefit plan which covers substantially all employees of WellChoice prior to its merger with the Company. Effective January 1, 1999, this plan was redesigned to
consolidate multiple other plans, at which time each participant’s account was credited an amount based on the benefits earned in the prior plans. Participant accounts are credited additional amounts based on age and years of service and earn
interest each year. Employees of WHN and Anthem do not participate in this plan.

All of the plans’ assets consist primarily of common stocks, fixed maturity securities, investment funds and short-term investments. The funding policies for all plans are to contribute amounts at least
sufficient to meet the



WellPoint, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

17. Retirement Benefits (continued)

minimum funding requirements set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) and in accordance with income
tax regulations, plus such additional amounts as are necessary to provide assets sufficient to meet the benefits to be paid to plan participants.

In addition, the Company offers certain employees postretirement benefits including certain life, medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement.
There are several postretirement benefit plans, which differ in amounts of coverage, deductibles, retiree contributions, years of service and retirement age. The Company may fund certain benefit costs through discretionary contributions to a
Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (“VEBA”) trust and others are accrued, with the retiree paying a portion of the costs. Postretirement plan assets held in the VEBA trust consist primarily of bonds and equity securities.

The Company uses a September 30 measurement date for
determining benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets. However, all pre-merger WellChoice plans were determined using a December 31 measurement date. The Company will begin using a September 30 measurement date for pre-merger
WellChoice plans in 2006.

The following tables disclose
consolidated “pension benefits”, which include defined benefit pension plans described above, and consolidated “other benefits”, which include other postretirement benefits described above. Weighted average calculations were
computed using assumptions at the relevant measurement dates.

The effect of acquisitions on the consolidated benefit obligation and plan assets is reflected through the business combination lines of the tables below.

The reconciliation of the benefit obligation is as follows:

The changes in the
fair value of plan assets are as follows:

The
reconciliation of the funded status to the net benefit cost recognized is as follows:

The net amount
recognized in the consolidated balance sheets is as follows:

The change in the
additional minimum pension liability included within other comprehensive income is as follows:

The accumulated
benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension plans was $1,942.1 and $1,365.9 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

As of December 31, 2005, certain pension plans of the Company had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. For those same plans, the
projected benefit obligation was also in excess of plan assets. Such plans had a combined projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets of $68.8, $60.0 and $0.0, respectively.

The weighted-average assumptions used in calculating the benefit obligations
for all plans are as follows:



WellPoint, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

17. Retirement Benefits (continued)

The
components of net periodic benefit cost included in the consolidated statements of income are as follows:

The weighted-average
assumptions used in calculating the net periodic benefit cost for all plans are as follows:

The weighted average
assumed health care cost trend rates to be used for next year to measure the expected cost of other benefits is 9.00% with a gradual decline to 4.9% by the year 2011. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future. The health care
cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, an increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31,
2005 by $51.5 and would increase service and interest costs by $3.5. Conversely, a decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by $43.5 as of December 31, 2005
and would decrease service and interest costs by $2.9.

An
important factor in determining the Company’s pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The Company uses a total portfolio return analysis in the development of its assumption. Factors such as past
market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and



WellPoint, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

17. Retirement Benefits (continued)

equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional
return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. The expected long-term rate of return is calculated by the geometric averaging
method, which calculates an expected multi-period return, reflecting volatility drag on compound returns.

In managing the plan assets, the Company’s objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk to the Company. In addition to
producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in the Company’s expense and cash flow. Over time, the Company has increased the duration and allocation of fixed maturity securities to more closely match
the sensitivity of plan assets with the plan obligations.

Plan
assets include a diversified mix of investment grade fixed maturity securities and equity securities across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize the long-term return for a prudent level of risk. As of the measurement date, the
Company’s weighted-average targeted asset allocation and actual allocation by asset category are as follows:

The Company’s
current funding strategy is to fund an amount at least equal to the minimum required funding as determined under ERISA with consideration of factors such as the minimum pension liability requirement and maximum tax deductible amounts. The Company
may elect to make discretionary contributions up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2005, no contributions were required under ERISA, however, the Company made tax deductible discretionary
contributions of $117.8 to the defined benefit pension plans. Employer contributions related to other benefits represent payments to retirees for current benefits. Contributions to the VEBA are generally not material. The Company may elect to make
discretionary contributions, including on a quarterly basis, up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.

The
Company’s estimated future payments for pension benefits and postretirement benefits, including the estimated impact of the “Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003”, which reflect expected future
service, as appropriate, are as follows:

In addition to the
defined benefit plans, the Company has several qualified defined contribution plans covering substantially all employees. Eligible employees may only participate in one plan. Depending upon the plan, voluntary employee contributions are matched by
the Company subject to certain limitations. Contributions made by the Company totaled $74.6, $34.0 and $13.2 during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Multi-District Litigation Settlement Agreement

In May 2000, a case titled

California Medical Association vs. Blue Cross of California, et. al.,

was filed in U.S. district court in San Francisco against Blue Cross of California (“BCC”), one of
WHN’s subsidiaries at the time and now a Company subsidiary. The lawsuit alleges that BCC violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”) (the “CMA Litigation”).

In August 2000, WHN was added as a defendant to

Shane v. Humana, et
al.

, a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of health care providers nationwide alleging RICO violations (the “Shane Litigation”). Effective upon the November 30, 2004 merger with WHN, WHN became a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company. On September 26, 2002, Anthem was added as a defendant to the Shane Litigation.

In May 2003, in a case titled

Kenneth Thomas, M.D., et al., v. Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, et al.

, (the “Thomas Litigation”) several medical providers filed suit in federal district court in
Miami, Florida against the BCBSA and Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans across the country, including the Company and WellChoice. The suit alleges that the BCBSA and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans violated RICO and challenges many of the same
practices as the CMA Litigation and the Shane Litigation.

In
October 2000, the federal Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (“MDL”) issued an order consolidating the CMA Litigation, the Shane Litigation and various other pending managed care class-action lawsuits against the Company and
other companies before District Court Judge Federico Moreno in the Southern District of Florida for purposes of pretrial proceedings. A mediator was appointed by Judge Moreno and the parties have been conducting court-ordered mediation. On
December 9, 2004, Judge Moreno issued a new scheduling order extending the expert discovery deadline to February 7, 2005 and setting trial for September 6, 2005.

On July 11,
2005, the Company entered into a settlement agreement (the “Agreement”) with representatives of more than 700,000 physicians nationwide to resolve the CMA Litigation, the Shane Litigation, the Thomas Litigation and certain other similar
cases brought by physicians. Under the Agreement, the Company has agreed to make cash payments totaling up to $198.0, of which $135.0 will be paid to physicians and $5.0 will be contributed to a not-for-profit foundation whose mission is to promote
higher quality health care and to enhance the delivery of care to the disadvantaged members of the public. In addition, up to $58.0 will be paid in legal fees to be determined by the court. The Company also has agreed to implement and maintain a
number of operational changes such as standardizing the definition of medical necessity in physician contracts, creating a formalized Physician Advisory Committee and modifying some of the Company’s claims payment and physician contracting
provisions. The Agreement is subject to, and conditioned upon, review and approval by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The court preliminarily approved the settlement in an order filed July 15, 2005. The hearing for
final approval was held on December 2, 2005 in Miami, Florida. The Court issued a final order approving the settlement on December 22, 2005, and issued an amended final order approving the settlement on January 4, 2006. Appeals have
been filed by certain physicians. Until these appeals are resolved, the Company will not be required to tender the monetary payments included in this Agreement. As a result of the Agreement, the Company incurred a pre-tax expense of $103.0, or $0.10
per diluted share after tax, for the year ended December 31, 2005, which represents the final settlement amount of the Agreement that was not previously accrued.

The WellChoice transaction was closed on December 28, 2005, after the settlement was reached with the plaintiffs in the
CMA Litigation, the Shane Litigation and the Thomas Litigation. The former WellChoice company, now one of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, continues to be a defendant in the Thomas Litigation, and will not be affected by the settlement
between the Company and plaintiffs. The Company intends to vigorously defend this proceeding; however, its ultimate outcome cannot be presently determined.

Other Litigation

On June 27, 2002, in a case titled

Academy of Medicine of Cincinnati and Luis Pagani, M.D. v. Aetna Health, Inc., Humana Health Plan of Ohio,
Inc., Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and United Health Care of Ohio, Inc., No. A02004947

filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Hamilton County, Ohio and a case titled

Academy of Medicine of Cincinnati and A. Lee Greiner, M.D., Victor
Schmelzer, M.D., and Karl S. Ulicny, Jr., M.D. v. Aetna Health, Inc., Humana, Inc., Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and United Health Care, Inc., No. 02-CI-903

filed in the Boone County, Kentucky Circuit Court, the Academy and certain
physicians allege that the defendants acted in combination and collusion with one another to reduce the reimbursement rates paid to physicians in the area. On September 30, 2005, the Company entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the
litigation. The settlement agreement has three components. First, the Company will increase the total annual reimbursement to physicians in the twelve county area (six counties each in Ohio and Kentucky) by $35.0 in 2005, an additional $20.0 in 2006
and an additional $15.0 in 2007. The increases will be measured against the total reimbursement amount for the same area in 2004. Second, the Company will pay $2.8 to plaintiffs, with approximately $0.6 for payments to retired doctors and incentive
awards to the named plaintiffs and the remainder going to a charitable foundation to improve health care in the affected area. Third, the Company will pay $9.6 in attorneys’ fees to the plaintiffs’ class counsel. Both the Ohio court and
the Kentucky court preliminarily approved the settlement on September 30, 2005. A final fairness hearing was held on November 21, 2005. Both courts issued orders giving final approval of the settlement on November 21, 2005. The
attorneys’ fees, incentive awards to plaintiffs, payments to retired doctors and charitable donation were paid out December 27, 2005. The final terms of the settlement agreement did not have a significant impact on the financial results of
the Company for the year ended December 31, 2005.

18. Contingencies (continued)

Prior to
WHN’s acquisition of the group benefit operations (“GBO”) of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company (“John Hancock”), John Hancock entered into a number of reinsurance arrangements, including with respect to personal
accident insurance and the occupational accident component of workers’ compensation insurance, a portion of which was originated through a pool managed by Unicover Managers, Inc. Under these arrangements, John Hancock assumed risks as a
reinsurer and transferred certain of such risks to other companies. Similar reinsurance arrangements were entered into by John Hancock following WHN’s acquisition of the GBO of John Hancock. These various arrangements have become the subject of
disputes, including a number of legal proceedings to which John Hancock is a party. The Company is currently in arbitration with John Hancock regarding these arrangements. The Company believes that it has a number of defenses to avoid any ultimate
liability with respect to these matters and believes that such liabilities were not transferred to the Company as part of the GBO acquisition. However, if the Company were to become subject to such liabilities, the Company could suffer losses that
might have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Other Contingencies

From time to time, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings, many of which involve claims for coverage encountered in the ordinary course of business. The Company, like HMOs and health insurers
generally, excludes certain health care services from coverage under its HMO, PPO and other plans. The Company is, in its ordinary course of business, subject to the claims of its enrollees arising out of decisions to restrict or deny reimbursement
for certain services. The loss of even one such claim, if it results in a significant punitive damage award, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, the risk of potential liability under punitive damage theories may
increase significantly the difficulty of obtaining reasonable settlements of coverage claims.

In addition to the lawsuits described above, the Company is also involved in other pending and threatened litigation of the character incidental to the business transacted, arising out of its operations and its 2001
demutualization, and is from time to time involved as a party in various governmental investigations, audits, reviews and administrative proceedings. These investigations, audits and reviews include routine and special investigations by state
insurance departments, state attorneys general and the U.S. Attorney General. Such investigations could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties and other sanctions. The Company believes that any liability that may result from
any one of these actions, or in the aggregate, is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

On July 1, 2005, the Company entered into an agreement with International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”) to provide information
technology infrastructure services. These services were previously performed in-house and resulted in the transfer of approximately 380 related jobs from the Company to IBM. The Company’s commitment under this contract is approximately $718.6
over a seven year period. The Company has the ability to terminate this agreement with 120 days written notice, subject to certain early termination fees. WellChoice had entered into a similar agreement with IBM in 2002 that expires in 2012. Under
this agreement, IBM provides certain technology outsourcing services to WellChoice and is enhancing WellChoice’s systems applications. The remaining future contractual obligations under this agreement amount to approximately $366.4 at
December 31, 2005. WellChoice can terminate the agreement or portions of the agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, subject to certain early termination fees.

18. Contingencies (continued)

On July 15,
2004, the Company agreed to guarantee up to $37.0 of debt incurred by an unaffiliated entity to partially finance the purchase of a hospital. The maximum amount of the guaranty may be reduced after September 30, 2006 as determined by reference
to the leverage ratio (as defined in the guaranty) of the unaffiliated entity. The guaranty also provides for full payment of all obligations under the guaranty to become immediately due and payable under specified circumstances, including
(i) upon the failure by the unaffiliated entity or the Company to cure any payment default under the subject loan to the unaffiliated entity within 10 days after written notice to the unaffiliated entity and the Company and (ii) upon 10
days after written notice to the Company that the unaffiliated entity has become subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding. In connection with the guaranty, the unaffiliated entity agreed to reimburse the Company upon demand for any amounts
paid by the Company under the guaranty. The obligations of the unaffiliated entity under the reimbursement agreement are secured by a second lien on certain real estate collateral. In addition, the parent company of the unaffiliated entity has
provided a guaranty in favor of the Company guaranteeing the obligations of the unaffiliated entity under the reimbursement agreement.

In connection with an investment in July 2004 in a joint venture to develop and operate a well-being center in California, the Company may be required to
make an additional capital contribution of up to $18.0 during the first three years that the well-being center is in operation if cash flows and room nights generated by the Company do not exceed specified targets. It is currently anticipated that
construction of the well-being center will be completed during 2006.

In connection with the formation in 2000 of a joint venture providing Medicaid services in Puerto Rico, the Company agreed under certain circumstances to provide additional funds to the joint-venture entity. The Company agreed that it would
make a capital contribution to the joint venture of up to 80% of any amount necessary to increase the entity’s capital to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements if (i) applicable law or regulation requires an increase in the
entity’s capital and the entity does not then have capital sufficient to meet the increased requirement or (ii) the entity’s medical care ratio is 100% or greater during any 180-day period and the entity does not then meet statutory
capital requirements under the Puerto Rico Insurance Code. The amount of this guarantee will not exceed 80% of the amount necessary to provide the entity with a 12 to 1 premium-to-capital ratio. As of December 31, 2005, the Company’s
maximum potential liability pursuant to this guarantee was $30.3. Since the formation of the joint venture in 2000, the Company has not been required to make any payments under this guarantee and the Company does not currently expect that any such
payments will be made.

Vulnerability from Concentrations

Financial instruments that potentially subject the
Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investment securities, premium receivables and instruments held through hedging activities. All investment securities are managed by professional investment managers
within policies authorized by the Board of Directors. Such policies limit the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and prescribe certain investee company criteria. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to premium receivables are
limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute the Company’s customer base in the geographic regions in which it conducts business. As of December 31, 2005, there were no significant concentrations of financial
instruments in a single investee, industry or geographic location.

19. Segment Information

The Company has three reportable segments: Health Care, Specialty, and Other. The Health Care segment is an aggregation of various operating segments,
principally differentiated only by geography. These Health Care operating segments have similar economic, product, distribution, customer and regulatory characteristics, and meet the aggregation criteria as defined under paragraph 17 of FAS 131,

Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

(“FAS 131”).

The Company’s focus on regional concentration allows management to understand and meet customer needs while effectively managing the cost structure.
The Company’s chief operating decision maker (the Chief Executive Officer) reviews the results of operations on a regular basis and holds each division president accountable for his or her segment’s operating results. Operating segments
comprising the Health Care segment provide a broad spectrum of network-based health plans and other health care-related products to large and small employers and individuals. The Specialty segment is maintained as a separate segment providing
various products, including pharmacy benefits management, dental, life insurance, disability insurance, behavioral health, and workers’ compensation products and services. In addition to intersegment sales and expense eliminations and corporate
expenses not allocated to reportable segments, the Other segment includes results from the Company’s government health services and other businesses that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment defined under FAS 131.

Through its participation in various federal government
programs, the Company generated approximately 12%, 17% and 19% of its total consolidated revenues from agencies of the U.S. government for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These revenues are contained in all three
of the Company’s reportable segments.

The Company defines
operating revenues to include premium income, administrative fees and other revenues. Operating revenues are derived from premiums and fees received primarily from the sale and administration of health benefit products. Operating expenses are
comprised of benefit expense, selling expense, general and administrative expense and cost of drugs. The Company calculates operating gain or loss as operating revenue less operating expenses.

The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described
in the summary of significant accounting policies except that certain shared administrative expenses for each segment are recognized on a pro rata allocated basis, which in aggregate approximates the consolidated expense. Any difference between
the allocated expenses and actual consolidated expense is included in other expenses not allocated to reportable segments. Intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at cost, and eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The Company
evaluates performance of the reportable segments based on operating gain or loss as defined above. The Company evaluates investment income, interest expense, amortization expense and income taxes, and asset and liability details on a consolidated
basis as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of segment operating management.

21. Statutory Information

WellPoint’s insurance subsidiaries report their accounts in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by state insurance
regulatory authorities (“statutory”), which vary in certain respects from GAAP. Typical differences of GAAP reporting as compared to statutory reporting are the inclusion of unrealized gains or losses relating to fixed maturity securities
in shareholders’ equity, recognition of all assets including those that are non-admitted for statutory purposes and recognition of all deferred tax assets without regard to statutory limits. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(“NAIC”) developed a codified version of the statutory accounting principles, designed to foster more consistency among the states for accounting guidelines and reporting.

WellPoint’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in various jurisdictions. These subsidiaries prepare statutory
financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the respective jurisdictions’ insurance regulators. Prescribed statutory accounting practices are set forth in a variety of publications of the NAIC as well
as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules.

WellPoint’s ability to pay dividends and other credit obligations is significantly dependent on receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries. The payment of dividends to WellPoint by its insurance subsidiaries without prior approval of
the insurance departments of each subsidiary’s domiciliary jurisdiction is limited by formula. Dividends in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective state insurance departments.

WellPoint’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital
requirements. Risk-based capital is a method developed by the NAIC to determine the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile.
The formula for determining the amount of risk-based capital specifies various factors, weighted based on the perceived degree of risk, which are applied to certain financial balances and financial activity. Below minimum risk-based capital
requirements are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, all of WellPoint’s insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum risk-based capital requirements.

Statutory-basis capital and surplus for WellPoint’s
insurance subsidiaries was $7,487.0 and $6,094.9 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Statutory-basis net income of WellPoint’s insurance subsidiaries was $2,385.1, $1,545.9 and $565.0 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Statutory-basis net income includes WellChoice and WHN statutory results for the full year ended December 31, 2005 and WHN statutory results for the full year ended December 31, 2004.

Selected quarterly financial data is as follows:



ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

There have been no changes in or disagreements with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm on accounting or financial
disclosures.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Management, under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has established
disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Company is made known to the officers who certify the Company’s financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. Based
on their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company have concluded that as of December 31, 2005 the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management, under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of WellPoint, Inc. (the
“Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) (“Internal Control”). The Company’s Internal Control is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”). The Company’s Internal Control includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of
inherent limitations in any Internal Control, no matter how well designed, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Accordingly, even effective Internal Control can provide only reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

Management, under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the
effectiveness of the Company’s Internal Control as of December 31, 2005. Management’s assessment was based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission.

The Company completed its acquisition
of WellChoice, Inc. (“WellChoice”) on December 28, 2005. As permitted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, management’s assessment as of December 31, 2005 did not include the Internal Control of the former
WellChoice, whose balance sheet is included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2005. Such operations of WellChoice constituted approximately $3.6 billion and $1.1 billion of the Company’s total
assets and net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2005. No operating results of the former WellChoice were included in the Company’s consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2005.



Based on management’s assessment, which excluded an assessment of Internal Control of the acquired
operations of WellChoice, management has concluded that the Company’s Internal Control was effective as of December 31, 2005 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP.

Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2005, and has also issued an audit report dated
February 15, 2006, on management’s assessment of the Company’s Internal Control, which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

Changes to certain processes,
information technology systems, and other components of Internal Control resulting from the December 28, 2005 acquisition of WellChoice may occur and will be evaluated by management as such integration activities are implemented. Further, the
Company continues to integrate processes following the November 30, 2004 acquisition of WHN. There have been no changes in Internal Control that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2005 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s Internal Control.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Shareholders and Board of Directors

WellPoint, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that WellPoint, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO criteria”). WellPoint, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made



only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of WellChoice, Inc., which is included in the 2005 consolidated
financial statements of WellPoint, Inc. and constituted approximately $3.6 billion and $1.1 billion of total and net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2005. The Company completed its acquisition of WellChoice, Inc. on December 28,
2005, and as permitted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s guidance, management did not assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of WellChoice, Inc. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting of WellPoint, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of WellChoice, Inc.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that WellPoint, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, WellPoint, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the
COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of WellPoint, Inc. as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, and our report dated February 15, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

(Parent Company Only)

Notes to Condensed Financial Statements

3.    Long-Term Debt (continued)

WellPoint had cash requirements of approximately $3,138.0 for the WellChoice merger, including both the cash portion of the purchase price and estimated
transaction costs. In anticipation of the merger, on December 28, 2005, WellPoint entered into a bridge loan agreement under which it could borrow up to $3,000.0. On December 28, 2005, WellPoint borrowed $1,700.0 under this bridge
facility to partially fund the WellChoice merger. The interest rate on this bridge loan is based on either (i) the LIBOR rate plus a predetermined percentage rate based on the Company’s credit rating at the date of utilization, or
(ii) a base rate as defined in the facility agreement. The weighted-average interest rate on the bridge loan at December 31, 2005 was 7.250%. The bridge loan has been classified as long-term debt at December 31, 2005 in accordance
with FAS 6,

Classification of Short-Term Obligations Expected to Be Refinanced

(“FAS 6”), as WellPoint’s intent is to replace this short-term borrowing with a long-term borrowing at or before its maturity.

On December 28, 2005, WellPoint filed a shelf registration with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. On January 10, 2006, the Company issued $700.0 of 5.000% notes due 2011; $1,100.0 of 5.250% notes due
2016; and $900.0 of 5.850% notes due 2036 under this registration statement. The proceeds from this debt issuance were used to repay a bridge loan of $1,700.0 and $1,000.0 in commercial paper borrowed for the WellChoice merger.

On November 29, 2005, the Company entered into a senior credit facility
(the “facility”) with certain lenders for general corporate purposes. The facility provides credit for up to $2,500.0 (reduced for any commercial paper issuances) and matures on November 29, 2010. The interest rate on the facility is
based on either (i) the LIBOR rate plus a predetermined percentage rate based on the Company’s credit rating at the date of utilization, or (ii) a base rate as defined in the facility agreement. The Company’s ability to borrow
under the facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants. Commitment fees for the credit facility were $1.4 in 2005 and there are no conditions that are probable of occurring under which the facility may be withdrawn. There were no amounts
outstanding under the senior credit facility and the Company was in compliance with the covenants as of December 31, 2005.

In August 2004, the Company issued $200.0 of 3.500% notes due 2007, which were used to exchange and retire $190.0 aggregate principal amount of 4.655%
remarketed subordinated debentures. The Company also received approximately $4.7 of cash proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses. These notes were issued under a shelf registration filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in December 2002 for any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings up to an aggregate amount of $1,000.0. As of December 31, 2005, this shelf registration was cancelled.

On December 9, 2004, WellPoint issued $300.0 of 3.750% notes due 2007,
$300.0 of 4.250% notes due 2009, $500.0 of 5.000% notes due 2014 and $500.0 of 5.950% notes due 2034. Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $1,583.7 after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and estimated offering expenses.
Proceeds from these notes were used to repay borrowings at November 30, 2004 to partially fund the cash portion of the WHN purchase price and to fund the tender offer to purchase $500.0 of surplus notes of Anthem Insurance Companies, Inc.
(“Anthem Insurance”). The remainder of the proceeds was used to repay commercial paper.

The Company has an authorized commercial paper program of up to $2,000.0, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. The
weighted-average interest rate on commercial paper borrowing at

3.    Long-Term Debt (continued)

December 31, 2005 and 2004 were 4.40% and 2.44%, respectively. Commercial paper borrowings have been classified as long-term debt at December 31,
2005 and 2004 in accordance with FAS 6, as WellPoint’s practice and intent is to replace short-term commercial paper outstanding at expiration with additional short-term commercial paper for an uninterrupted period extending for more than one
year or with borrowings under the senior credit facility described above.

Interest paid during 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $181.6

$86.7 and $81.2, respectively.

Future maturities of long-term debt are as follows: 2006,
