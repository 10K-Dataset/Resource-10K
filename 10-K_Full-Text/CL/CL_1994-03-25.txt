ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

(a)       General Development of the Business

  Colgate-Palmolive Company (the "Company") is a corporation which was
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1923.  The Company
manufactures and markets a wide variety of products throughout the world for
use by consumers.  For recent business developments, refer to the
information set forth under the captions "Results of Operations" and
"Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Part II, Item 7 of this report.

(b)       Financial Information About Industry Segments

  For information about industry segments see Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included on page 22 of this report.

(c)       Narrative Description of the Business

  For information regarding description of the business refer to the caption
"Scope of Business" on page 13;  "Average number of employees" appearing
under "Historical Financial Summary" on page 45; and "Research and

Statements on page 31 of this report.
  The Company's products are generally marketed by a sales force employed by
each individual subsidiary or business unit.  In some instances outside jobbers 
and brokers are used.  Most raw materials used worldwide are purchased from
others, are available from several sources and are generally available in
adequate supply.  Products and commodities such as tallow and essential oils are
subject to wide price variations.  No one of the Company's raw materials
represents a significant portion of total material requirements.
  Trademarks are considered to be of material importance to the Company's
business; consequently the practice is followed of seeking trademark
protection by all available means.  Although the Company owns a number of
patents, no one patent is considered significant to the business taken as a
whole.
  The Company has programs for the operation and design of its facilities
which meet or exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations.
Compliance with such rules and regulations has not significantly affected
the Company's capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Capital expenditures for environmental control facilities totaled $9.4
million in 1993 and are budgeted at $13.9 million for 1994.  For future
years, expenditures are expected to be in the same range.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
         AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations

Net Sales

Worldwide sales in 1993 increased 2% to $7,141.3 from $7,007.2 in 1992.
Sales  would have grown 7%, excluding the negative effects  of  foreign
currency  declines.   Volume increased 5% for the  year,  including  1%
resulting from increased ownership of the Company's Indian operation to
majority control.

Sales  in  the Oral, Personal and Household Care segment were $6,243.2,
up 1% from $6,162.0 in 1992, and would have increased 7%, excluding the
impact  of  unfavorable currency translation.  Sales in the Asia/Africa
region  grew  20% on particularly strong volume gains led by  Malaysia,
Thailand  and  Hong  Kong along with the volume contribution  from  the
Indian  consolidation.  This sales increase was tempered by results  in
Australia/New  Zealand  and the Philippines,  which  were  impacted  by
foreign  currency declines, and in Africa, which was affected  by  poor
economic  conditions.   Sales  in  the European  region  decreased  12%
primarily  due  to  currency translation.  Volume  declines  of  3%  in
Western  Europe, due to difficult economic conditions, were  offset  by
volume increases in Central Europe led by Poland, Romania, and Turkiye.
Latin  America  sales increased 16% due to selling price increases  and
overall volume growth of 7%.  Sales increased in every country in Latin
America with particularly strong increases in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador
and  Central America.  United States and Canada sales were down 4%  due
primarily  to  the  effects of disinflationary pricing  in  the  United
States.





Sales  in the Specialty Marketing segment increased 6% to $898.1 versus
$845.2  in  1992.  Most of this growth came from Hill's Pet  Nutrition,
where  sales increased 11% on volume growth of 8% reflecting  continued
growth  in  pet  foods in both the domestic and international  markets,
particularly in Europe and Japan.  Hill's accounts for over 80% of  the
Specialty  Marketing  segment's  sales.   Sales  relating  to  non-core
businesses continued to decline in 1993.

Colgate's  1992  sales reflected a 16% increase over 1991  sales.   The
increase reflects sales growth in both industry segments.  Overall unit
volume   increased  11%,  including  5%  contributed  by   the   Mennen
acquisition.   Sales in the Oral, Personal and Household  Care  segment
grew  17% with all geographic regions contributing to this growth.   In
the  Asia/Africa  region, sales increased 18% versus  1991.   Sales  in
Europe,  despite recessionary conditions, grew 10%, including expansion
into  Central Europe.  Latin America and USA/Canada sales increased over
20%  through  internally generated new product activity and  the addition
of the Mennen personal care business.  Sales in the  Specialty Marketing
segment  were 6% higher than 1991, reflecting an 8% sales increase at 
Hill's Pet Nutrition.

Gross Profit

Gross  profit margin improved to 47.8% from 47.1% in 1992 and 45.6%  in
1991.   The  continuing  improvement  in  gross  profit  reflects   the
Company's strategy to shift product mix to higher margin personal  care
product   categories,   reduce  overhead  and   improve   manufacturing
efficiency  by  focusing investments in high-return  capital  projects.
Improvement  in  the  profitability of sales  enables  the  Company  to
generate  more  cash  from  operations  to  reinvest  in  its  existing
businesses  in  the  form of research and development  and  advertising,
to launch new products, to expand geographically, to  invest in  strategic
acquisitions  within its core  businesses,  and  to  pay dividends.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling,  general  and administrative expenses as a  percent  of  sales
decreased to 34% in 1993 as compared with 36% in 1992 and 35% in  1991.
The decrease in 1993 expenditures reflects the continued efforts of the
Company  to  reduce  overhead  expenses,  offset  in  part  by   higher
advertising  and  product  promotion  spending  as  well  as  increased
research  and  development  activity.  The increase  in  1992  reflects
increases  in  advertising  and  research  and  development  as   these
expenditures support current business growth levels and are investments
to  maintain the Company's competitive advantage in introducing new and
improved products in its strategic core businesses.

In   September   1991,  the  Company  announced  a  manufacturing   and
organizational   restructuring  program  designed  to   capitalize   on
opportunities created by movement to common markets in Europe and North
America, more sophisticated and efficient manufacturing techniques, and
consolidation opportunities created by several acquisitions around  the
world.  The program included organizational realignments, manufacturing
reconfigurations  and  the write-down of certain  property,  plant  and
equipment.  As a result, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $340.0
($243.0 aftertax or $1.80 per share) in 1991.

Other Expense and Income

Other  expense and income consists principally of earnings from  equity
investments, amortization of goodwill and other intangible  assets, and
minority  interest  in  earnings  of less-than-100%-owned  consolidated
subsidiaries.   Amortization expense in 1993 and  1992  increased  from
1991  due  to  higher  levels of intangible assets  stemming  from  the
Company's recent acquisitions, most notably Mennen, which continued the
Company's  expansion  into high-margin personal care  businesses.   The
decrease in equity earnings and increase in minority interest primarily
results  from increased ownership in the Company's Indian operation  to
majority control.





Earnings Before Interest and Taxes

Earnings  before interest and taxes (EBIT) increased 14% to  $883.0  in
1993 as compared with $777.9 in the prior year.  The Oral, Personal and
Household  Care  segment reported 12% growth in EBIT to  $731.5  versus
$653.2  in  1992,  with  gains  in  the developing  regions  offsetting
declines  in  the  developed world, which were  impacted  by  difficult
business climates.  Within this segment, United States and Canada  EBIT
decreased 5% to $177.8 as compared with the prior year primarily due to
lower  selling prices.  EBIT in Europe decreased 9% due to the negative
impact   of   foreign  currency  translation  and  difficult   economic
conditions.   In  Latin America, EBIT improved 30% to  $249.6  in  1993
versus  the  prior year while Asia/Africa increased 50%, including  the
consolidation  of India.  Overall, the higher margin  product  mix  and
reduced  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  allowed  for
increased  investment  in  advertising and  product  promotion  and  in
research and development, as well as the achievement of a higher  level
of  EBIT.  In the Specialty Marketing segment, EBIT was $156.9 in  1993
as  compared with  $142.9 in 1992.  The improvement results principally
from  higher  domestic unit  volume  growth  and expanded international
distribution at Hill's Pet Nutrition, particularly in Europe and Japan.

EBIT was $777.9 in 1992 as compared with $282.6 in 1991, which included
the  effects  of a restructuring charge.  Excluding the impact  of  the
1991 restructuring charge, EBIT increased 25%.  The Oral, Personal  and
Household Care segment reported EBIT of $653.2 versus $202.8  in  1991.
EBIT  in  this segment improved 32%, excluding the effects of  the 1991
charge, with all geographic regions contributing to this increase.  The
17%  increase  in  sales and the move to a higher  margin  product  mix
allowed for increased advertising and the achievement of a higher level
of  EBIT.  In the Specialty Marketing segment, EBIT was $142.9 in  1992
as  compared  with $100.4 in 1991, which included the  effects  of  the
restructuring  charge.  Excluding the 1991 provision for restructuring,
results  in  this  segment improved 11%, principally from  higher  unit
volume  growth  and  expanded  European  distribution  at  Hill's   Pet
Nutrition.

Net Interest Expense

Interest  expense, net of interest income, was $46.8 in  1993  compared
with  $50.0  in 1992 and $64.7 in 1991.  The decrease in  net  interest
expense  in  1993 in spite of higher debt, primarily to  finance  share
repurchases,  reflects  a general decline in  interest  rates  and  the
Company's  refinancing of higher rate long-term debt during  the  year.
The decrease in net interest expense in 1992 included the effect of the
Company's  equity  offering late in the fourth  quarter  of  1991,  the
proceeds of which were used to reduce borrowings, as well as a  decline
in  interest  rates and the Company's refinancings  early  in  1992  of
higher rate long-term debt.

Income Taxes

In  1993  and  1992, the effective tax rate on income was  34.5%.   The
increase  in the U.S. statutory tax rate in 1993 was in part offset  by
statutory rate reductions in several overseas jurisdictions.  In  1991,
the  effective tax rate was 43%, which reflected the lower tax benefits
recognized  on certain elements of the restructuring provision  outside
the   United   States.   Excluding  the  effect  of  the  restructuring
provision, the effective tax rate in 1991 was 34%.  Global tax  savings
strategies benefited the effective rate in 1993, 1992 and 1991.

Net Income

Net  income  was $189.9 in 1993 or $1.08 per share on  a primary  basis
compared with $477.0 or $2.92 per share in 1992.  Included in 1993  net
income and per share amounts is the cumulative one-time impact on prior
years  of adopting new mandated accounting standards effective  January
1,   1993   for   income  taxes,  other  postretirement  benefits   and
postemployment benefits.  Before the changes in accounting, 1993 income
increased  15%  to $548.1 or $3.38 per share on a primary  basis.   Net
income  was  $124.9 or $.77 per share in 1991.  Included  in  1991  net
income  and  per  share amounts is the provision for  restructuring  of
$243.0  net  of tax or $1.80 per share on a primary basis.

Return  on sales was  7.7% in 1993 (excluding the impact of  accounting
changes) compared with 6.8% in 1992 and 6.1% in 1991 (2.1% including the
restructuring charge), reflecting the Company's shift to higher  margin
categories and focus on cost containment.





Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net  cash  provided by operations increased to $710.4 in 1993  compared
with  $542.7  in  1992  and $485.7 in 1991.  The  improvement  in  cash
generated by operating activities from 7.7% of sales in 1992 to 9.9% of
sales  in  1993  reflects  the  Company's improving  profitability  and
continued management emphasis on working capital.  Cash generated  from
operations was used to finance acquisitions, repurchase shares and fund
an increased dividend level.

The  Company has additional sources of liquidity available in the  form
of lines of credit maintained with various banks.  Such lines of credit
amounted  to $1,303.2 at December 31, 1993.  The Company also  has  the
ability  to issue commercial paper at favorable interest rates to  meet
short-term liquidity needs.  These borrowings carry a Standard & Poor's
rating of A1 and a Moody's rating of P1.

During  the  1993  first quarter, the Company repaid  outstanding  debt
totaling  $85.7 which included $50.0 of 8.9% Swiss franc notes  due  in
1993.   During  the third quarter, the Company redeemed  $79.0  of  its
9.625% debentures issue due 2017.

During 1992, the Company increased the amount available under its shelf
registration  from $150.0 to $400.0.  In the fourth  quarter  of  1993,
$230.0  of  medium  term notes were issued under this  registration  in
addition  to $169.2 issued in the fourth quarter of 1992.  These  notes
are rated A1/A+ by Moody's and Standard & Poor's, respectively.

During  the  third  quarter of 1993, the Company  participated  in  the
formation of a business which purchases receivables, including  Company
receivables.  Outside institutions invested $60.0 in this entity.   The
Company  consolidates  this  entity and the  amounts  invested  by  the
outside institutions are classified as a minority interest.

Colgate's  reputation,  global presence  and  strong  capital  position
afford  it access to debt and equity markets around the world, enabling
the  Company  to  raise funds with a low effective cost.   The  Company
manages its exposure related to foreign currency borrowings through the
use  of various currency agreements.  The Company also actively manages
its debt position to optimize the maturities of debt issues as well  as
the  mix  of fixed and floating rate debt.  At December 31,  1993,  the
Company  had  in  place interest rate agreements with  banks  having  a
notional principal amount of $447.0.

Capital  expenditures in 1993 were $364.3 or  5.1% of sales as compared
with  $318.5 in 1992 and $260.7 in 1991.  The increase in 1993 spending
was  focused  primarily on projects that yield high  aftertax  returns,
thereby  reducing  the Company's cost structure.  Capital  expenditures
for 1994 are expected to continue at or slightly above the current rate
of approximately 5% of sales.

Other  investing  activities in 1993, 1992 and 1991 included  strategic
acquisitions  and equity investments worldwide.  In October  1993,  the
Company  acquired the liquid hand and body soap brands of S.C.  Johnson
Wax  in  Europe,  the South Pacific and other international  locations.
During  the year the Company also acquired the Cristasol glass  cleaner
business  in  Spain,  increased ownership of its  Indian  operation  to
majority  control  and made other investments.  The aggregate  purchase
price of all 1993 acquisitions was $222.5.

Acquisitions  totaled $718.4 in 1992 and $339.4 in  1991  and  included
businesses in the household care, fabric care, personal care  and  oral
care  categories.   In  March  1992, the Company  acquired  The  Mennen
Company  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $670.0.   The
purchase  price was paid with 11.6 million unregistered shares  of  the
Company's common stock and $127.0 in cash.  Other acquisitions included
significant ownership positions in joint ventures in China and  Eastern
Europe,  The  Murphy-Phoenix Company and the  Plax  worldwide  business
excluding  the  United States, Canada and Puerto  Rico.   Goodwill  and
other intangible assets increased as a result of these acquisitions.






During  1993, the Company repurchased common shares in the open  market
and  private transactions to provide for employee benefit plans and  to
maintain its target capital structure.  Aggregate repurchases  for  the
year  approximated  12 million shares with a total  purchase  price  of
$673.0.   In  the  first  quarter  of  1994,  the  Board  of  Directors
authorized the repurchase of up to an additional five million shares.

The ratio of debt to total capitalization (defined as the ratio of debt
to  debt  plus equity) increased to 48% during 1993 from 30%  in  1992.
The  return on average shareholders' equity, before accounting changes,
increased to 24% from 21% during the same period as this shift  towards
targeted  capitalization  benefited overall  shareholder  return.   The
decrease in debt to total capitalization in 1992 from the 1991 level of
36%  reflects the issuance of shares in connection with the acquisition
of The Mennen Company.

Dividend payments were $240.8 in 1993 ($231.4 aftertax), up from $211.1
($200.7  aftertax)  in 1992, reflecting a 16% increase  in  the  common
dividend  effective  in  the third quarter of  1993.   Common  dividend
payments  increased to $1.34 per share in 1993 from $1.15 per share  in
1992.   The Series B Preference Stock dividends were declared and  paid
at  the  stated  rate  of $4.88 per share.  The  increase  in  dividend
payments  in  1992  over  1991 reflects a 17% increase  in  the  common
dividend effective in the third quarter of 1992.

Internally  generated  cash  flows appear to  be  adequate  to  support
currently   planned  business  operations  and  capital   expenditures.
However,  certain  events,  such  as  significant  acquisitions,  could
require external financing.

The  Company  is  a party to various superfund and other  environmental
matters and is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, taxes  and
other  matters arising out of the normal course of business.  While  it
is  possible that the Company's cash flows and results of operations in
particular  quarterly or annual periods could be affected by  the  one-
time impacts of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion
of  management that the ultimate disposition of these matters,  to  the
extent not previously provided for, will not have a material impact  on
the Company's financial condition or ongoing cash flows and results  of
operations.

New Accounting Standards

In  May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
No.  115, "Accounting  for  Certain  Investments  in  Debt  and  Equity
Securities,"  which   addresses  the  accounting  and   reporting   for
investments  in  equity securities that have readily determinable  fair
values  and  for all investments in debt securities.  The Company  will
adopt  the provisions of this new standard effective January  1,  1994,
and  prior  periods will not be restated.  The effect of adoption  will
not  be material to financial condition, results of operations or  cash
flows.

Outlook

As  the  Company  enters  1994, continued  recessionary  conditions  in
certain  major markets present some uncertainty in the near term  while
further  expansion  into the markets of the developing  world  presents
strong opportunity for growth.  The global economic situation for  1994
is  not  expected to be materially different from that  experienced  in
1993.   Historically,  the consumer products  industry  has  been  less
susceptible  to changes in economic growth than many other  industries.
Over  the long term, Colgate's continued focus on its consumer products
business  and  the  strength  of  its global  brand  names,  its  broad
international  presence in both developed and developing  markets,  and
its  strong capital base all position the Company to take advantage  of
growth  opportunities  and  to continue to increase  profitability  and
shareholder value.

1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 Principles of Consolidation
 The  Consolidated  Financial Statements include the accounts  of  Colgate-
 Palmolive  Company  and  its  majority-owned  subsidiaries.   Intercompany
 transactions and balances have been eliminated.  Investments in  companies
 in  which the Company's interest is between 20% and 50% are accounted  for
 using the equity method.  The Company's share of the net income from  such
 investments  is  recorded as equity earnings and is  classified  as  other
 income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

 Revenue Recognition
 Sales  are  recorded at the time products are shipped to trade  customers.
 Net  sales reflect units shipped at selling list prices reduced  by  trade
 promotion allowances.

 Cash and Cash Equivalents
 The  Company  considers all highly liquid investments with  maturities  of
 three  months  or less when purchased to be cash equivalents for  purposes
 of  the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Consolidated Statement of  Cash
 Flows.   Investments  in  short-term  securities  that  do  not  meet  the
 definition of cash equivalents are classified as marketable securities  in
 the  Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Marketable securities  are  reported  at
 cost, which approximates market.

 Inventories
 Inventories  are  valued  at the lower of cost or  market.   The  last-in,
 first-out (LIFO) method is used to value substantially all inventories  in
 the  U.S.  as  well  as  in  certain overseas  locations.   The  remaining
 inventories are valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

 Property, Plant and Equipment
 Land, buildings, and machinery and equipment are stated at cost.
 Depreciation is provided, primarily using the straight-line method, over
 estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 40 years.

 Goodwill and Other Intangibles
 Goodwill  represents the excess of purchase price over the fair  value  of
 identifiable  tangible and intangible net assets of  businesses  acquired.
 Goodwill  and  other  intangibles are amortized on a  straight-line  basis
 over periods not exceeding 40 years.

 Income Taxes
 Effective January 1, 1993, deferred taxes are recognized for the  expected
 future  tax  consequences  of temporary differences  between  the  amounts
 carried  for  financial  reporting and tax purposes.   Provision  is  made
 currently  for  taxes  payable on remittances  of  overseas  earnings;  no
 provision is made for taxes on overseas retained earnings that are  deemed
 to be permanently reinvested.

 Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits
 Effective January 1, 1993, the cost of postretirement health care and
 other benefits is actuarially determined and accrued over the service
 period of covered employees.

 Translation of Overseas Currencies
 The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries, other than those operating  in
 highly  inflationary  environments, are translated into  U.S.  dollars  at
 year-end  exchange  rates,  with resulting translation  gains  and  losses
 accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity.   Income  and
 expense  items  are  converted  into U.S.  dollars  at  average  rates  of
 exchange prevailing during the year.







 For   subsidiaries   operating   in  highly   inflationary   environments,
 inventories and property, plant and equipment are translated at  the  rate
 of  exchange on the date the assets were acquired, while other assets  and
 liabilities  are  translated  at  year-end  exchange  rates.   Translation
 adjustments for these operations are included in net income.

 Geographic Areas and Industry Segments
 The  financial  and  descriptive information on the  Company's  geographic
 area and industry segment data, appearing on pages 13 and 14 of this report,
 is an integral part of these financial statements.

2. Acquisitions

 In  October  1993,  the Company acquired the liquid  hand  and  body  soap
 brands  of  S.C. Johnson Wax in Europe, the South Pacific and other
 international locations.  During  the year, the  Company also acquired the
 Cristasol glass cleaner  business  in Spain,  increased  ownership of its
 Indian operation to majority control and made other investments.  The
 aggregate purchase price of all 1993 acquisitions was $222.5.

 In  March 1992, the Company acquired The Mennen Company ("Mennen") for  an
 aggregate  purchase  price of $670.0, paid with 11.6 million  unregistered
 shares  of the Company's common stock and $127.0 in cash.  The acquisition
 included Mennen's personal care products business and businesses held  for
 sale  that were sold in August 1992.  The results of operations of Mennen
 have  been  included in the Consolidated Financial Statements since  March
 27, 1992.

 During  1992, the Company also acquired the remaining interest  in  Viset,
 an Italian  manufacturer of consumer products, and established significant
 ownership  positions in joint ventures in China and Eastern  Europe.   The
 aggregate purchase price of all 1992 acquisitions was $718.4.

 During 1991, the Company acquired the Murphy-Phoenix Company, which  owned
 an  all-purpose  cleaner business.  Internationally, the Company  acquired
 the  Plax  antiplaque  mouthwash business for worldwide markets  excluding
 the  U.S.,  Canada and Puerto Rico, the remaining interest in  the  Unisol
 Group  of  Companies in Portugal,  the personal care business  of  ICI  in
 Australia,  a  majority  interest in Haci Sakir,  a  soap  and  body  care
 business   in  Turkiye,  and  the  Brazilian  Pinesol  household   cleaner
 business.  The aggregate purchase price of 1991 acquisitions was $339.4.
                                     
 All  of  these  acquisitions have been accounted for  as  purchases,  and,
 accordingly,  the purchase prices were allocated to the net  tangible  and
 intangible assets acquired based on estimated fair values at the dates  of
 the  respective  acquisitions.   The  results  of  operations  have  been
 included  in  the Consolidated Financial Statements since  the  respective
 acquisition  dates.  The inclusion of pro forma financial data  for  these
 acquisitions  prior to the dates of acquisition would not have  materially
 affected reported results.

3.  Restructured Operations

 In   September   1991,   the  Company  announced   a   manufacturing   and
 organizational   restructuring   program   designed   to   capitalize   on
 opportunities  created by movement to common markets in Europe  and  North
 America,  more  sophisticated and efficient manufacturing techniques,  and
 consolidation  opportunities created by several  acquisitions  around  the
 world.   The  program included organizational realignments,  manufacturing
 reconfigurations  and  the  write-down  of  certain  property,  plant  and
 equipment.   As a result, the Company recorded a pretax charge  of  $340.0
 ($243.0 aftertax or $1.80 per share) in 1991.








4.    Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities

 Long-term debt consists of the following at December 31:


 Other  debt  consists  of  capitalized leases  and  individual  fixed  and
 floating   rate  issues  of  less  than  $50.0  with  various  maturities.
 Scheduled  maturities of debt outstanding at December 31, 1993,  exclusive
 of  capitalized lease obligations, are as follows: 1994 -  $13.5;  1995  -
 $37.5; 1996 - $38.1; 1997 - $46.8, and 1998 - $52.4.  Commercial paper is 
 classified as long-term debt in accordance with the Company's intent and 
 ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis.

 At  December 31, 1993, the Company had unused credit facilities  amounting
 to  $1,303.2.   Included  in  this total  is  a  $460.0  revolving  credit
 facility  that provides for general corporate  borrowings and  expires  in
 March  1995.  Interest on borrowings under the agreement is based on  Base
 (Prime)  rates,  Certificate of Deposit rates  or  Eurodollar  rates.   No
 borrowings  were outstanding under this credit agreement at  December  31,
 1993.  Commitment fees related to credit facilities are not material.
                                      
 The  Company has entered into various foreign exchange contracts to  hedge
 currency   exposures  associated  with  its  net  investment  in   foreign
 operations,  intercompany loans and other foreign  currency  transactions.
 At  December 31, 1993, the outstanding net face amounts of these contracts
 totaled approximately $440.7.

 The  Company  has  also  entered  into a  series  of  interest  rate  swap
 agreements with banks having a total notional principal amount  of  $447.0
 with  maturity  dates through 2023.  The contracts enable the  Company  to
 change  the  effective  interest rate on its debt according  to  corporate
 needs and market conditions.


















5.    Leases

  At December 31, 1993, future minimum rental payments under capital and
 operating leases were as follows:



 Rent expense for all operating leases totaled $91.5 in 1993 and $80.3 in
 1992 and 1991.

6   Capital Stock and Stock Option Plans  

  Preferred Stock
 Preferred  Stock consists of 250,000 authorized shares without par  value.
 It  is  issuable  in  series,  of  which one  series  of  125,000  shares,
 designated  $4.25 Preferred Stock, with a stated and redeemable  value  of
 $100  per  share,  has been issued and is outstanding.  Dividends  on  the
 $4.25  Preferred  Stock  are  cumulative.  Under  the  provisions  of  the
 Certificate   of  Incorporation,  the  Preferred  Stock  is   subject   to
 redemption only at the option of the Company.

  Preference Stock
 In  1988,  the  Company's  Certificate of  Incorporation  was  amended  to
 authorize  the  issuance of a new class of preferred stock  consisting  of
 50,000,000  shares of Preference Stock, without par value.  The Preference
 Stock,  which is convertible into two shares of common stock, ranks junior
 to  all  series  of  the Preferred Stock with respect to  the  payment  of
 dividends and the distribution of assets of the Company.  At December  31,
 1993  and  1992,  6,181,480  and 6,242,765  shares  of  Preference  Stock,
 respectively, were outstanding and issued to the Company's ESOP.

  Common Stock
 In  March 1992, the Company issued 11,648,693 unregistered shares  of  its
 common  stock  in connection with acquiring Mennen.  Certain  registration
 rights were granted for a portion of the shares issued in connection  with
 the transaction.

 In  November  1991,  the  Company issued an additional  11,500,000  common
 shares  through  a  public offering and simultaneously retired  11,500,000
 shares  of treasury stock. In connection with acquiring The Murphy-Phoenix
 Company, the Company also issued 1,571,730 shares of its common stock.
                                     
 At  December  31, 1993 and 1992, 507,855 and 476,185 shares, respectively,
 were  held  for  distribution under the Executive  Incentive  Compensation
 Plan,  which  provides for cash and common stock awards for  officers  and
 other  executives of the Company and its major subsidiaries.  The cost  of
 these shares totaled $22.7 at December 31, 1993 and $17.0 at December  31,
 1992.

 In  October 1988, the Board of Directors authorized the redemption of  the
 then outstanding common stock purchase rights for a total of $6.9.  A  new
 rights  plan was adopted, and stockholders received a distribution of  one
 Preference  Share Purchase Right ("Right") for each outstanding  share  of
 the  Company's common stock.  Each Right entitles stockholders to buy  one
 two-hundredth interest in a share of a new series of preference  stock  at
 an  exercise  price of $87.50.  Each interest is designed to make  it  the
 economic  equivalent of one share of common stock.  A Right is exercisable
 only  if  a person or group acquires 20% or more of the  Company's  common
 stock  or announces a tender offer, the consummation of which would result
 in ownership by a person or group of 20% or more of the common stock.




                                     
 If  the  Company  is  acquired in a merger or other  business  combination
 transaction,  each  Right  will entitle its holder  to  purchase,  at  the
 Right's  then current exercise price, a number of the acquiring  company's
 common  shares  having a market value at that time of  twice  the  Right's
 exercise  price.  In addition, if a person or group acquires 30%  or  more
 of  the Company's outstanding common stock, otherwise than pursuant  to  a
 cash  tender offer for all shares in which such person or group  increases
 its  stake  from below 20% to 80% or more of the outstanding shares,  each
 Right  will entitle its holder (other than such person or members of  such
 group)  to purchase, at the Right's then current exercise price, a  number
 of  shares  of the Company's common stock having a market value  of  twice
 the  Right's exercise price.  Further, at any time after a person or group
 acquires  30%  or  more  (but less than 50%) of the Company's  outstanding
 common stock, the Board of Directors may, at its option, exchange part  or
 all  of  the  Rights  (other than Rights held by the acquiring  person  or
 group) for shares of the Company's common stock on a one-for-one basis.
                                     
 Prior  to the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial ownership  of
 20%  or  more  of the Company's common stock, each Right is redeemable  at
 the option of the Board of Directors at a price of $.005.

 The Board of Directors is also authorized to reduce  the  20%  and  30%
 thresholds  referred to above to not less than 15%.  The new  Rights  will
 expire  on  October  24,  1998.  There were 149,256,603  Preference  Share
 Purchase  Rights  outstanding  at December 31,  1993  and  160,240,404  at
 December 31, 1992.

 Stock Option Plans
 The  Company's  1987 Stock Option Plan provides for the issuance  of  non-
 qualified  stock options to officers and key employees.  The non-qualified
 stock  options  permit optionees to acquire common stock  of  the  Company
 upon payments of cash or stock.

 Options are granted at prices not less than the fair market value  on  the
 date of grant.  At December 31, 1993, 6,726,478 shares were available  for
 future  grants.  The  Company's 1977 Stock Option Plan  terminated  during
 1987, except as to options granted.

 During 1992, an Accelerated Ownership feature was added to the 1987  Stock
 Option Plan.  The Accelerated Ownership feature provides for the grant  of
 new  options  when previously owned shares of Company stock  are  used  to
 exercise  existing options.  The number of new options granted under  this
 feature  is  equal  to  the number of shares of previously  owned  Company
 stock  used  to  exercise  the original options and  to  pay  the  related
 required  U.S. income tax.  The new options are granted at a  price  equal
 to  the  fair market value on the date of the new grant and have the  same
 expiration date as the original options exercised.

 Stock option plan activity is summarized below:







7.    Employee Stock Ownership Plan

 In  1989,  the Company expanded its employee stock ownership  plan  (ESOP)
 through  the introduction of a leveraged ESOP covering employees who  have
 met  certain  eligibility requirements.  The ESOP issued $410.0  of  long-
 term  notes  due through 2009 bearing an average interest  rate  of  8.6%.
 The long-term notes, which are guaranteed by the Company, are recorded  on
 the  accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The ESOP used the  proceeds
 of  the  notes  to  purchase 6.3 million shares of  Series  B  Convertible
 Preference  Stock  from the Company.  The Stock has a  minimum  redemption
 price  of $65 per share and pays semi-annual dividends equal to the higher
 of  $2.44  or  the  current dividend paid on two  common  shares  for  the
 comparable  six-month period.  Each share may be converted by the  Trustee
 into two shares of common stock.

 Dividends  on these preferred shares, as well as common shares  also  held
 by  the  ESOP,  are  paid  to the ESOP trust and,  together  with  Company
 contributions,  are used by the ESOP to repay principal  and  interest  on
 the  outstanding notes.  Preferred shares are released for  allocation  to
 participants  based upon the ratio of the current year's debt  service  to
 the  sum  of  total principal and interest payments over the life  of  the
 loan.   At December 31, 1993, 860,469 shares were allocated to participant
 accounts.

 Dividends  on  these  preferred  shares  are  deductible  for  income  tax
 purposes and, accordingly, are reflected net of their tax benefit  in  the
 Consolidated Statement of Retained Earnings.

 Annual  expense  related  to the leveraged ESOP,  determined  as  interest
 incurred on the notes, less dividends received on the shares held  by  the
 ESOP,  plus the higher of either principal repayments on the notes or  the
 cost  of  shares allocated, was $7.9 in 1993, $8.1 in 1992   and  $6.9  in
 1991.    Similarly,  unearned  compensation,  shown  as  a  reduction   in
 shareholders'  equity, is reduced by the higher of principal  payments  or
 the cost of shares allocated.

 Interest incurred on the ESOP's notes amounted to $34.5 in 1993, $35.1  in
 1992  and $35.3 in 1991.  The Company paid dividends on the stock held  by
 the  ESOP  of  $32.7 in 1993, $32.8 in 1992 and $34.0  in  1991.   Company
 contributions  to  the ESOP were $5.7 in 1993, $5.6 in 1992  and  $4.9  in
 1991.

8.    Retirement Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

 Retirement Plans
 The  Company,  its  U.S.  subsidiaries and  a  majority  of  its  overseas
 subsidiaries  maintain pension plans covering substantially all  of  their
 employees.   Most plans provide pension benefits that are based  primarily
 on  years  of  service and employees' career earnings.  In  the  Company's
 principal  U.S. plans, funds are contributed to trustees as  necessary  to
 provide  for  current  service  and for  any  unfunded  projected  benefit
 obligation  over  a  reasonable period.  To the extent these  requirements
 are  exceeded  by  plan  assets, a contribution  may  not  be  made  in  a
 particular  year.   Plan  assets  consist principally  of  common  stocks,
 deposit administration contracts with insurance companies, investments  in
 real estate funds and U.S. Government obligations.



















 Net periodic pension expense includes the following components:




 The following table sets forth the funded status of the plans at December
 31:










 The actuarial assumptions used to determine the above data were as
 follows:



Other Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries provides health care and life
insurance benefits for retired employees to the extent not provided by
government-sponsored plans.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions" (SFAS 106).  SFAS 106 requires the Company to change its method of
accounting for its postretirement life and health care benefits provided to
retirees from the "pay-as-you-go" basis to accruing such costs over the working 
lives of the employees.  The Company elected to recognize this change in 
accounting on the immediate recognition basis and utilizes a portion of its 
leveraged ESOP, in the form of future retiree contributions, to reduce its 
obligation to provide these postretirement benefits.  Postretirement benefits
currently are not funded.  The Company also adopted SFAS 112, "Employers' 
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."  SFAS 112 requires accrual accounting
for the estimated cost of benefits provided to former or inactive employees 
after employment but before retirement.

The cumulative effect on prior years of adopting SFAS 106 and 112 as of
January 1, 1993 resulted in a pretax charge of $195.7 ($129.2 aftertax or
$.83 per share) of which $189.5 related to SFAS 106 and $6.2 related to SFAS
112.  This non-cash charge represents the accumulated benefit obligation net
of related accruals previously recorded by the Company.

Postretirement benefits expense for 1993 included the following components:




The cash cost to the Company for postretirement benefits in 1992 and 1991,
excluding acquisitions, approximated $11.2 and $11.8, respectively.  The
pro forma effects of retroactive application of this mandated change in
accounting were not determinable.







The postretirement benefit obligation included in Other liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 1993 was comprised of the
following components:



The principal actuarial assumptions used in the measurement of the
accumulated benefit obligation were as follows:



The cost of these postretirement medical benefits is dependent upon a number
of factors, the most significant of which is the rate at which medical costs
increase in the future.  The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed medical 
cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit 
obligation by approximately $20.2; annual expense would not be materially
affected.

9.    Income Taxes

 Effective  January  1,  1993, the Company adopted Statement  of  Financial
 Accounting  Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes"  (SFAS  109).
 The  one-time  non-cash charge for the recalculation of income  taxes  was
 $229.0  ($1.47  per share), primarily as a result of the 1992  acquisition
 of  Mennen.   Prior years' financial statements have not been restated  to
 apply the provisions of SFAS 109.

 The provision  for  income taxes on income before changes in accounting
 consists of the following for the years ended December 31:








Differences   between  accounting   for   financial statement  purposes  and
accounting for  tax  purposes  result  in  taxes currently  payable  (lower)
higher than the total  provision  for  income taxes as follows:



In  addition, tax benefits of $21.3 in 1993 were recorded directly through
equity.

The  components of income before income taxes are as follows for the three
years ended December 31:



The difference  between the  statutory United States federal income tax
rate  and  the  Company's global effective tax rate as reflected in the
Consolidated Statement of Income is as follows:



The components of deferred taxes at December 31, 1993 are as follows:
                                     





10. Foreign Currency Translation

 Cumulative  translation  adjustments,  which  represent  the   effect   of
 translating  assets  and liabilities of the Company's  non-U.S.  entities,
 except those in highly inflationary economies, were as follows:



 Foreign  currency  charges,  resulting from  the  translation  of  balance
 sheets  of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments  and
 from  foreign currency transactions, were not material in 1993,  1992  and
 1991.

11. Earnings Per Share

 Primary  earnings per share are determined by dividing net  income,  after
 deducting  preferred  stock dividends net of related tax  benefits  ($21.6
 net  in  1993,  $20.7 net in 1992 and $20.8 net in 1991), by the  weighted
 average number of common shares outstanding (155.9 million in 1993,  156.5
 million in 1992 and 135.3 million in 1991).

 Fully  diluted  earnings  per  common share are  calculated  assuming  the
 conversion  of all potentially dilutive securities, including  convertible
 preferred  stock  and  outstanding options,  unless  the  effect  of  such
 conversion   is   antidilutive.   This  calculation   also   assumes,   if
 applicable,  reduction of available income by pro forma  ESOP  replacement
 funding, net of income taxes.

12. Supplemental Cash Flow Information


13. Other Income Statement Information

 Other expense (income), consists of the following for the years ended
 December 31:


 The following is a comparative summary of certain expense information for
 the years ended December 31:





14. Balance Sheet Information

  Supplemental balance sheet information is as follows:



 Inventories valued under LIFO amounted to $170.8 at December 31, 1993  and
 $207.3  at  December 31, 1992.  The excess of current cost over LIFO  cost
 at  the  end  of  each  year was $23.1 and $28.5, respectively.   In  1993,
 certain  inventory quantities were reduced, which resulted in  liquidations
 of LIFO inventory quantities.  The effect was to increase income by $1.7.
                                     


 Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 The  Company  estimates  that  the aggregate  fair  value of all financial
 instruments at December  31,  1993 does  not  differ  materially from the
 aggregate carrying values of its financial  instruments recorded in the
 Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.   The estimated  fair  value amounts have been
 determined by the  Company  using available  market  information  and
 appropriate  valuation  methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessarily
 required in interpreting market  data to  develop the estimates of fair value,
 and accordingly, the estimates are not  necessarily indicative of the amounts
 that the Company could realize in a current market exchange.

 In  May 1993,  the  Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
 No. 115, "Accounting for Certain  Investments  in Debt and Equity Securities,"
 which addresses the accounting and reporting for investments in equity
 securities that have readily  determinable fair values and for all investments
 in debt securities.  The Company will adopt the provisions of this new standard
 effective January 1, 1994, and prior periods will not  be  restated.  The
 effect of adoption will not be material to financial condition, results of
 operations or cash flows.






15. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

 The   Company   has  various  contractual  commitments  to  purchase   raw
 materials,  products  and services totaling $282.4  million  which  expire
 through 1998.

 The  Company  is  a  party  to various superfund and  other  environmental
 matters  and  is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits,  taxes  and
 other  matters arising out of the normal course of business.  While it  is
 possible  that  the  Company's cash flows and  results  of  operations  in
 particular  quarterly or annual periods could be affected by the  one-time
 impacts  of  the  resolution of such contingencies, it is the  opinion  of
 management  that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the  extent
 not  previously  provided  for, will not have a  material  impact  on  the
 Company's  financial  condition  or ongoing  cash  flows  and  results  of
 operations.

Report of Independent Public Accountants

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Colgate-Palmolive Company:

We  have  audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of  Colgate-
Palmolive Company (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of  December
31,  1993  and  1992,  and the related consolidated statements  of  income,
retained earnings, changes in capital accounts and cash flows for  each  of
the  three  years  in the period ended December 31, 1993.  These  financial
statements and the schedules referred to below are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits in accordance with generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit  to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of  material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test  basis,
evidence   supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in   the   financial
statements.   An  audit  also includes assessing the accounting  principles
used  and  significant estimates made by management, as well as  evaluating
the  overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our  audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In  our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in  all  material  respects,  the financial position  of  Colgate-Palmolive
Company  and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period  ended  December  31, 1993, in conformity  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles.

As  discussed  in  the  accompanying notes  to the  consolidated  financial
statements, in  1993, the  Company adopted  three new  accounting standards
promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, changing its methods
of accounting for income taxes, postretirement benefits other than pensions,
and postemployment benefits.

Our audit was for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial
statements  taken as  a  whole.  The schedules  listed in the index to the
financial  statements  are presented for purposes  of  complying  with the
Securities and Exchange Commission's  rules and  are not part of the basic
financial statements.  These schedules have been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic  financial statements and, in
our opinion,  fairly  state in  all material  respects the  financial data
required  to  be  set  forth  therein in relation  to the  basic financial
statements taken as a whole.

      The  Options shall expire at 11:59 p.m.  (Eastern
Standard Time) on January 12, 2003, or possibly sooner  (for
example, in the event of your death or termination of employment)
as provided in the Plan or under the circumstances set forth herein.

     In order to encourage you further to promote the growth
of  the Company and, consequently, more rapid growth in  the
value  of the common stock of the Company, this option shall
expire prior to January 12, 2003 as follows:





                                                EXHIBIT 10-N
                                                 Page 2 of 2

     (a) If  the closing price  per  share  of  common  stock of
         the Company shall not have exceeded $88.70 (as such price
         may be adjusted from time to time, as set forth herein,
         the "60% Hurdle") at some time prior to January 13, 1999,
         then  on such date the term of the Options, to the extent
         then unexercised, shall automatically expire, without any
         further  action  on your part or the part of the Company.

     (b) If  the closing price  per  share  of  common  stock of the
         Company  shall  not have  exceeded  $99.7875  (as  such  
         price  may  be  adjusted  from  time to time, as set forth  
         herein, the  "80%  Hurdle") at some time prior  to  January
         13,  2001,  then  on  such date  the  term  of  the  Options,
         to the  extent then  unexercised,  shall automatically  expire,
         without any  further  action  on your part or the part of the 
         Company.

For the purpose of determining the 60% Hurdle and the 80% Hurdle, closing
price shall  mean the  daily closing price, as  reported by  the New York
Stock Exchange Composite Transactions or other reporting system acceptable
to the Personnel and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors of
the Company.

      The  Options may be exercised only in accordance with the terms and
conditions  of the  Plan, as supplemented  by this  Agreement, and  not
otherwise.

      Nothing herein contained shall obligate the Company or any 
subsidiary of the Company to continue your employment for any particular
period or on any particular basis of compensation.

      This Agreement is subject to all terms, conditions,limitations
and restrictions contained in the Plan and may not be assigned or
transferred in whole or in part except as therein  provided.  You shall
not have any rights of a shareholder with respect to any of the shares 
which are the subject of  this Agreement until such shares are actually
issued to you.

      The number of shares and the exercise price per share are subject 
to  adjustment  as  provided  in  the  Plan.  In  the  event of any 
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split or
extraordinary distribution with respect to the common stock of the 
Company or other change in corporate structure affecting the common 
stock of the Company, the Committee shall make an appropriate adjustment
to the 60% Hurdle and the 80% Hurdle to reflect the effect of such
transaction on the market price of the common stock of the Company.

      You  assume all  risks incident to any change hereafter in  the 
applicable laws or regulations or incident to any change in the market
value of the stock after the exercise of  these incentives in whole or
in part.

      To confirm the foregoing, kindly sign and return one copy of this
Agreement as soon as possible.  


                                 Very truly yours,

                                 COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY

preferred and common stock dividends.  The fixed charges presented above 
include interest on ESOP indebtedness to the extent it is not funded 
through preferred and common stock dividends.
