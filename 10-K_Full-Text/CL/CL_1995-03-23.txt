                                     PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

(a) General Development of the Business 
Colgate-Palmolive Company (the "Company") is a corporation which was 
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1923. The Company 
manufactures and markets a wide variety of products throughout the world for 
use by consumers. For recent business developments, refer to the information 
set forth under the captions "Results of Operations" and "Liquidity and 
Capital Resources" in Part II, Item 7 of this report. 

(b) Financial Information About Industry Segments 
For information about industry segments refer to the information set forth 
under the caption "Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of this report. 

(c) Narrative Description of the Business 
For information regarding description of the business refer to the caption 
"Scope of Business" on page 5; "Average number of employees" appearing under 
"Historical Financial Summary" on page 36; and "Research and development" 
expenses appearing in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on 
page 27 of this report. 

The Company's products are generally marketed by a sales force employed by 
each individual subsidiary or business unit. In some instances outside 
jobbers and brokers are used. Most raw materials used worldwide are purchased 
from others, are available from several sources and are generally available 
in adequate supply. Products and commodities such as tallow and essential 
oils are subject to wide price variations. No one of the Company's raw 
materials represents a significant portion of total material requirements. 

Trademarks are considered to be of material importance to the Company's 
business; consequently the practice is followed of seeking trademark 
protection by all available means. Although the Company owns a number of 
patents, no one patent is considered significant to the business taken as a 
whole. 

The Company has programs for the operation and design of its facilities which 
meet or exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations. Compliance 
with such rules and regulations has not significantly affected the Company's 
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Capital expenditures 
for environmental control facilities totaled $11.6 million in 1994 and are 
budgeted at $17.6 million for 1995. For future years, expenditures are 
expected to be in the same range. 

(d) Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales
For information concerning geographic area financial data refer to the 
information set forth under the caption "Results of Operations" in Part II, 
Item 7 of this report. 

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
The Company owns and leases a total of 301 manufacturing, distribution, 
research and office facilities worldwide. Corporate headquarters is housed in 
leased facilities at 300 Park Avenue, New York, New York. 

In the United States, the Company operates 66 facilities, of which 26 are 
owned. Major U.S. manufacturing and warehousing facilities used by the Oral, 
Personal and Household Care segment are located in Kansas City, Kansas; 
Morristown, New Jersey; Jeffersonville, Indiana; and Cambridge, Ohio. The 
Company is transforming its former facilities in Jersey City, New Jersey into 
a mixed-use complex with the assistance of developers and other investors. 
The Specialty Marketing segment has major facilities in Bowling Green, 
Kentucky; Topeka, Kansas; and Richmond, Indiana. Research facilities are 
located throughout the world with the research center for Oral, Personal and 
Household Care products located in Piscataway, New Jersey. 

Overseas, the Company operates 235 facilities, of which 89 are owned, in over 
60 countries. Major overseas facilities used by the Oral, Personal and 
Household Care segment are located in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, 
Colombia, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Thailand, the United Kingdom and 
elsewhere throughout the world. In some areas outside the United States, 
products are either manufactured by independent contractors under Company 
specifications or are imported from the United States or elsewhere. 

All facilities operated by the Company are, in general, well maintained and 
adequate for the purpose for which they are intended. The Company conducts 
continuing reviews of its facilities with the view to modernization and cost 
reduction. 

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
On April 5, 1994, Region V of the United States Environmental Protection 
Agency (the "Region") issued to a Company plant in Jeffersonville, Indiana a 
Findings of Violations and Order for Compliance under Section 309 


 
(a) of the Clean Water Act (the "Order"). The Order, based in part on 
information supplied by the plant, stated that the plant, at certain times in 
late 1993 and early 1994, had discharged waste water containing substances in 
excess of amounts permitted by its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination 
System Permit (the "Permit"). The Order requires that the plant submit 
certain information and take certain actions to provide the Region with 
assurance that the plant will comply with the Permit. The plant is complying 
with the Order. 

EPA Region V and the Company have entered into a settlement of an 
administrative complaint filed separately by EPA under Section 309 (g) of the 
Clean Water Act on or about September 30, 1994. In connection with the 
settlement, the Company has paid an administrative civil penalty in the 
amount of $110,000. The settlement has been executed by the Acting Director 
of the Water Office at Region V and has been formally adopted as an order of 
the EPA Regional Administrator. 

On June 13, 1994, the Jeffersonville plant also received from Atlantic States 
Legal Foundation, Inc., a public interest group, a notice of its intention to 
bring a related citizen's suit under Section 505(b) of the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act (the "Act"). The Company intends to respond to this 
notice in accordance with the Act. 

For additional information regarding legal matters see Note 13 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements included on page 29 of this report.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Scope of Business 
The Company manufactures and markets a wide variety of products in the U.S. 
and around the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal and 
Household Care, and Specialty Marketing. Oral, Personal and Household Care 
products include toothpastes, oral rinses and toothbrushes, bar and liquid 
soaps, shampoos, conditioners, deodorants and antiperspirants, baby and shave 
products, laundry and dishwashing detergents, fabric softeners, cleansers and 
cleaners, bleaches, and other similar items. Specialty Marketing products 
include pet nutrition products and products previously sold by Princess House 
and VCA. Principal global trademarks and trade names include Colgate, 
Palmolive, Mennen, Ajax, Soupline/Suavitel, Fab, Science Diet and 
Prescription Diet in addition to various regional tradenames. 

The Company's principal classes of products accounted for the following 
percentages of worldwide sales for the past three years: 

                                              1994          1993          1992 
Oral Care ............................         26%           25%           23%
Personal Care ........................         24%           24%           23%
Household Surface Care ...............         17%           17%           18%
Fabric Care ..........................         18%           19%           20%
Pet Nutrition ........................         11%           11%           10%

Company products are marketed under highly competitive conditions. Products 
similar to those produced and sold by the Company are available from 
competitors in the U.S. and overseas. Product quality, brand recognition and 
acceptance, and marketing capability largely determine success in the 
Company's business segments. 

As shown in the geographic area and industry segment data that follow, more 
than half of the Company's net sales, operating profit and identifiable 
assets are attributable to overseas operations. Transfers between geographic 
areas are not significant.

  Total Net Sales ..........................   $7,587.9    $7,141.3    $7,007.2

* Amounts in Latin America and Asia/Africa relate to the Oral, Personal and 
  Household Care segment only. Sales of Specialty Marketing products to these 
  regions are primarily exported to local distributors and therefore are 
  included in North American results in all years to conform to the 
  current-year presentation. 

Net Sales 
Worldwide net sales in 1994 increased 6% to $7,587.9 from $7,141.3 in 1993. 
Excluding the sales of non-core businesses disposed of during 1994, sales 
increased 8% on volume growth of 7% reflecting the Company's increas- 


 
ing global strength and worldwide brand presence. Sales in the Oral, Personal 
and Household Care segment were $6,735.8, up 7% from $6,306.4 in 1993. Sales 
in the Asia/Africa Region continued a trend of strong growth, posting a 20% 
overall increase led by Malaysia, Hong Kong, India and South Africa. 
Australia and New Zealand showed volume improvements and also benefited from 
favorable currency translation that increased overall sales. Among the 
technologically advanced products contributing to 17% volume gains in this 
region are Colgate Total toothpaste, Palmolive Nouriche shampoo and Ajax Gel 
2-in-1 bleach/cleaner. The 1994 results include the impact of the July 1993 
consolidation of the Company's Indian operation. Sales in Europe were up 7% 
on 6% volume growth, including 4% from acquisitions. Sales growth in Europe 
was led by France, Italy, Greece, the United Kingdom, Spain and Eastern 
Europe. Sales in Latin America were up 14% overall on 11% volume growth, with 
notable growth in Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Central America. Colgate Total 
toothpaste, Colgate Precision/Total toothbrushes and the expansion of Mennen 
deodorants all contributed to the region's growth. 

North America was negatively impacted by trade downstocking of inventory and 
disinflationary pricing as sales were down 8% on volume declines of 4%. Sales 
growth in the Specialty Marketing segment was led by Hill's Pet Nutrition, 
which posted sales increases of 16% for the year on 14% volume growth, 
reflecting continued strength in the domestic market and further 
international expansion. Sales and volume growth were supported by the 
introduction of Hill's new Prescription Diet formula for improving oral 
health in dogs and Prescription Diet HealthBlend preventive care. Overall 
Specialty Marketing reported sales were up slightly versus the prior year as 
a result of the second-quarter 1994 sale of Princess House and VCA, two 
non-core businesses. 

The Company's overall sales in 1993 increased 2% over 1992 and would have 
reflected a 7% overall growth excluding the impact of foreign currency 
declines. Volume increased 5% during the year, including 1% resulting from 
increased ownership of the Indian operation to majority control. Sales in the 
Oral, Personal and Household Care segment were mixed. Asia/Africa and Latin 
America reported strong increases throughout the regions, while Europe was 
down 13%, due to currency declines and difficult economic conditions in 
Western Europe, and North America experienced the effects of disinflationary 
pricing as sales were down 4% from 1992. Sales for the Specialty Marketing 
segment were up 8%, reflecting continued growth in pet foods in both domestic 
and international markets, up 11% versus 1992, offset by declines in sales at 
non-core businesses. 

Gross Profit 
Gross profit margin in 1994 improved to 48.4% from 47.8% in 1993 and 47.1% in 
1992. The continuing improvement in gross profit reflects the Company's 
strategy to shift product mix to higher margin oral care, personal care and 
pet nutrition product categories, reduce overhead and improve manufacturing 
efficiency by focusing investments on high-return capital projects. 
Improvement in the profitability of sales enables the Company to generate 
more cash from operations to reinvest in its existing businesses in the form 
of research and development, advertising to launch new products, growing 
geographically, investing in strategic acquisitions within its core 
businesses, and paying dividends. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales was 35% in 
1994 versus 34% in 1993 and 36% in 1992. The 1994 and 1993 expenditures 
reflect the continued reduction of the Company's overhead expenses, while 
providing higher advertising and product promotion spending, which increased 
in 1994 in absolute dollar amounts and as a percentage of sales, while also 
increasing spending in research and development. These expenditures support 
current business growth levels and are investments to maintain the Company's 
competitive advantage in introducing new and improved products in its 
strategic core businesses. 

Other Expense and Income 
Other expense and income consists principally of amortization of goodwill and 
other intangible assets, minority interest in earnings of 
less-than-100%-owned consolidated subsidiaries, earnings from equity 
investments and income effects from the 1994 disposition of non-core 
businesses and other asset sales. Amortization expense increased in each of 
the three years ended 1994 due to higher levels of intangible assets stemming 
from the Company's recent acquisitions, most notably Cibaca in India and S.C. 
Johnson Wax in Europe, which affected 1994 expense and Mennen, which impacted 
expense recognition in 1993 for a full year and in 1992 from the date of 
acquisition. The decrease in equity earnings and increase in minority 
interest that occurred in 1993 and continues into 1994 primarily results from 
increased ownership in the Company's Indian operation to majority control. 
Loss on disposition of non-core businesses and gains on sale of miscellaneous 
assets make up the remainder of other expense and income in 1994. 


 
Earnings Before Interest and Taxes 
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) increased 9% in 1994 to $966.6 
compared with $883.0 in the prior year. EBIT for the Oral, Personal and 
Household Care segment was up 9%, with strong gains across all of the 
Company's developing markets and mixed results in the developed world. Lower 
returns were experienced in the developed world due principally to a 21% 
decline in North America as a result of trade downstocking and increased 
spending on advertising and research and development to position that region 
for future growth. EBIT for Europe increased 19%, primarily reflecting both 
sales growth and higher gross profit margins. Asia/Africa and Latin America 
both showed significant improvement: EBIT was up 20% for each on an already 
healthy base business. Specialty Marketing also contributed to the overall 
EBIT growth led by a 10% improvement at Hill's Pet Nutrition, which increased 
EBIT while investing in developing markets to expand its international reach. 

                                                1994        1993         1992

* Amounts in Latin America and Asia/Africa relate to the Oral, Personal and 
  Household Care segment only. Sales of Specialty Marketing products to these 
  regions are primarily exported to local distributors, and earnings are 
  included in North American results in all years to conform to the 
  current-year presentation. 

EBIT increased 14% to $883.0 in 1993 compared with $777.9 in 1992. The Oral, 
Personal and Household Care segment reported 11% growth to $740.6, with gains 
in the developing regions offsetting declines in the developed regions, which 
were impacted by difficult business climates. Within this group, North 
America EBIT decreased 6% to $187.0 compared with the prior year primarily 
due to lower selling prices. EBIT in Europe decreased 9% due to the negative 
impact of foreign currency translation and difficult economic conditions. In 
Latin America, EBIT improved 30% to $249.6 in 1993 versus the prior year 
while Asia/Africa increased 50%, including the consolidation of India. 
Overall, the higher margin product mix and reduced selling, general and 
administrative expenses allowed for increased investment in advertising, 
product promotion, and research and development, as well as the achievement 
of a higher level of EBIT. In the Specialty Marketing segment, EBIT was 
$147.8 in 1993 compared with $131.1 in 1992. The improvement results 
principally from higher domestic unit volume growth and expanded 
international distribution at Hill's Pet Nutrition, particularly in Europe 
and exports to Japan. 

Net Interest Expense 
Interest expense, net of interest income, was $86.7 in 1994 compared with 
$46.8 in 1993 and $50.0 in 1992. The increase in net interest expense in 1994 
versus the prior two years results from higher debt for the full year, 
incurred primarily to finance share repurchases and acquisitions, and 
slightly higher effective interest rates in 1994. 


 
Income Taxes 
The effective tax rate on income for 1994 was 34.1% versus 34.5% in 1993 and 
1992. The increase in the U.S. statutory tax rate in 1993 was in part offset 
by statutory rate reductions in several overseas jurisdictions. Global tax 
savings strategies benefited the effective rate in 1994, 1993 and 1992. 

Net Income 
Net income was $580.2 in 1994 or $3.82 per share on a primary basis compared 
with $189.9 or $1.08 per share in 1993. Included in 1993 net income and per 
share amounts is the cumulative one-time impact on prior years of adopting 
new mandated accounting standards effective January 1, 1993 for income taxes, 
other postretirement benefits and postemployment benefits. Excluding the 
changes in accounting in 1993 and the one-time charge for the sale of a 
non-core business in 1994, income increased 7% to $585.4 while primary 
earnings per share increased 14% to $3.86. 

Return on sales was 8% in 1994, consistent with the percentage return in 1993 
(excluding the impact of accounting changes), reflecting the Company's 
continuing shift to higher margin categories and focus on cost containment, 
while providing increased investments aimed at future growth. 

Subsequent Event 
On January 10, 1995 the Company acquired the worldwide Kolynos oral care 
business from American Home Products Corporation for $1,040.0 in cash. The 
acquisition was structured as a multinational acquisition of assets and 
stock, financed with the proceeds of commercial bank borrowings, and will be 
accounted for as a purchase. 

The Kolynos business is a multinational oral care business that is engaged in 
the production and sale of toothpaste, toothbrushes, dental floss and oral 
rinses operating primarily in South America. Kolynos adds significant 
strength to the Company's existing South American operations by providing a 
strong regional brand to complement the existing Colgate brand equity. The 
acquisition is subject to review by antitrust regulatory authorities in 
Brazil and Colombia. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Net cash provided by operations increased 17% to $829.4 in 1994 compared with 
$710.4 in 1993 and $542.7 in 1992. The improvement in cash generated by 
operating activities to 11% of sales in 1994 from 10% of sales in 1993 
reflects the Company's improving profitability and continued management 
emphasis on working capital. Cash generated from operations was used to 
finance acquisitions, repurchase shares and fund an increased dividend level. 

The Company has additional sources of liquidity available in the form of 
lines of credit maintained with various banks. Such lines of credit amounted 
to $1,439.8 at December 31, 1994. The Company also has the ability to issue 
commercial paper at favorable interest rates to meet short-term liquidity 
needs. These borrowings carry a Standard & Poor's rating of A1 and a Moody's 
rating of P1.

During the third quarter of 1994, the remaining outstanding principal ($32.0) 
of the 9.625% debentures due July 15, 2017 was retired. Also during the third 
quarter, the Company obtained a $50.0 7.25% term loan. During the second 
quarter, the Company entered into credit agreements totaling $750.0 replacing 
credit agreements then in place. In May 1994, the Company filed a shelf 
registration for $500.0 of debt securities. During the second quarter, $208.0 
of medium-term notes were issued under this registration. In connection with 
the acquisition of Kolynos, the Company borrowed approximately $1,100.0 from 
commercial banks in January 1995. As a result of the increase in debt to 
finance this acquisition, both Moody's and Standard and Poor's debt rating 
agencies reviewed and reaffirmed the Company's debt ratings. 

During the third quarter of 1993, the Company participated in the formation 
of a business that purchases receivables, including Company receivables. 
Outside institutions invested $60.0 in this entity, in 1993 and an additional 
$15.2 in 1994. The Company consolidates this entity and the amounts invested 
by the outside institutions are classified as a minority interest. During the 
1993 first quarter, the Company repaid outstanding debt totaling $85.7, which 
included $50.0 of 8.9% Swiss franc notes due in 1993. During the third 
quarter of 1993, the Company redeemed $79.0 of its 9.625% debentures due 
2017. 

During 1992, the Company increased the amount available under its shelf 
registration from $150.0 to $400.0. In the fourth quarter of 1993, $230.0 of 
medium-term notes were issued under this registration in addition to $169.2 
issued in the fourth quarter of 1992. These notes are rated A1/A+ by Moody's 
and Standard & Poor's, respectively. 

                                                  1994        1993        1992

Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year 
  presentation. 

Capital expenditures in 1994 were $400.8 (5.3% of sales) compared with $364.3 
(5.1% of sales) in 1993 and $318.5 (4.5% of sales) in 1992. The increase in 
1994 spending was focused primarily on projects that yield high aftertax 
returns, thereby reducing the Company's cost structure. Capital expenditures 
for 1995 are expected to continue at the current rate of approximately 5% of 
sales. 

Other investing activities in 1994, 1993 and 1992 included strategic 
acquisitions and equity investments worldwide. During 1994, the Company 
acquired the Cibaca toothbrush and toothpaste business in India, the NSOA 
laundry soap business in Senegal and several other regional brands across the 
Oral, Personal and Household Care segment. In October 1993, the Company 
acquired the liquid hand and body soap brands of S.C. Johnson Wax in Europe, 
the South Pacific and other international locations. Also in 1993, the 
Company acquired the Cristasol glass cleaner business in Spain, increased 
ownership of its Indian operation to majority control and made other 
investments. The aggregate purchase price of all 1994 and 1993 acquisitions 
was $149.8 and $222.5, respectively. 

Acquisitions totaled $718.4 in 1992 and included businesses in the personal 
care, household care, fabric care, and oral care categories, the most 
significant being the Mennen Company acquired for an aggregate purchase price 
of approximately $670.0. The purchase price was paid with 11.6 million 
unregistered shares of the Company's common stock and $127.0 in cash. 
Goodwill and other intangible assets increased as a result of these 
acquisitions. 

During 1994, the Company repurchased common shares in the open market and 
private transactions to provide for employee benefit plans and to maintain 
its targeted capital structure. Aggregate repurchases for the year 
approximated 6.9 million shares with a total purchase price of $411.1. During 
1993, 12.6 million shares were acquired with a total purchase price of 
$698.1. 

The ratio of debt to total capitalization (defined as the ratio of debt to 
debt plus equity) increased to 52% during 1994 from 48% in 1993 and 30% in 
1992. As a result of the Kolynos acquisition in January 1995, the proforma 
ratio of debt to total capitalization increased to 63%. The lower ratio of 
debt to total capitalization in 1992 reflects 


 
the issuance of shares in connection with the acquisition of The Mennen 
Company. The return on average shareholders' equity before accounting 
changes, increased to 31% in 1994 from 24% in 1993. 

Dividend payments were $255.6 in 1994 ($246.9 aftertax), up from $240.8 
($231.4 aftertax) in 1993, reflecting a 14% increase in the common dividend 
effective in the third quarter of 1994 partially offset by fewer shares 
outstanding. Common dividend payments increased to $1.54 per share in 1994 
from $1.34 per share in 1993. The Series B Preference Stock dividends were 
declared and paid at the stated rate of $4.88 per share. The increase in 
dividend payments in 1993 over 1992 reflects a 16% increase in the common 
dividend effective in the third quarter of 1993. 

The Company utilizes interest rate agreements and foreign exchange contracts 
to manage interest rate and foreign currency exposures. The principal 
objective of such contracts is to moderate rather than attempt to eliminate 
fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency movements. The Company, as 
a matter of policy, does not speculate in financial markets and therefore 
does not hold these contracts for trading purposes. The Company utilizes what 
it considers straightforward instruments, such as forward foreign exchange 
contracts and non-leveraged interest rate swaps, to accomplish its 
objectives. 

The Company primarily uses interest rate swap agreements to effectively 
convert a portion of its floating rate debt to fixed rate debt in order to 
manage interest rate exposures in a manner consistent with achieving a 
targeted fixed to variable interest rate ratio. Those interest rate 
instruments that do not qualify as hedge instruments for accounting purposes 
are marked to market and carried on the balance sheet at fair value. As of 
December 31, 1994 and 1993, the Company had agreements outstanding with an 
aggregate notional amount of $222.0 and $347.0, respectively, with maturities 
through 2001. 

The Company uses forward exchange contracts principally to hedge foreign 
currency exposures associated with its net investment in foreign operations 
and intercompany loans. This hedging minimizes the impact of foreign exchange 
rate movements on the Company's financial position. The terms of these 
contracts are rarely longer than three years. 

As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, the Company had approximately $390.7 and 
$439.0, respectively, of outstanding foreign exchange contracts in which 
foreign currencies were purchased, and approximately $6.9 in which foreign 
currencies were sold as of December 31, 1994. At December 31, 1994 and 1993, 
approximately 20% of outstanding foreign exchange contracts served to hedge 
net investments in foreign subsidiaries, 60% hedged intercompany loans, 10% 
hedged third-party firm commitments, and the remaining 10% hedged certain 
transactions that are anticipated to settle in accordance with their 
identified terms. The Company makes net settlements for foreign exchange 
contracts at maturity, based on rates agreed to at inception of the 
contracts. 

Gains and losses from contracts that hedge the Company's investments in its 
foreign subsidiaries are shown in the cumulative translation adjustment 
account included in shareholder's equity. Gains and losses from contracts 
that hedge firm commitments (including intercompany loans) are recorded in 
the balance sheets as a component of the related receivable or payable. 

The contracts that hedge anticipated sales and purchases do not qualify as 
hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the related gains and losses are 
calculated using the current forward foreign exchange rates and are recorded 
in the statements of income as other expense, net. 

Internally generated cash flows appear to be adequate to support currently 
planned business operations, acquisitions and capital expenditures. 
Significant acquisitions, including the acquisition of Kolynos discussed 
previously, require external financing. 

The Company is a party to various superfund and other environmental matters 
and is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, taxes and other matters 
arising out of the normal course of business. Management proactively reviews 
and manages its exposure to and the impact of environmental matters. While it 
is possible that the Company's cash flows and results of operations in 
particular quarterly or annual periods could be affected by the one-time 
impacts of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of 
management that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not 
previously provided for, will not have a material impact on the Company's 
financial condition or ongoing cash flows and results of operations. 

Outlook 
Looking forward into 1995, the Company is well positioned for strong growth 
in developing markets, particularly South America as a result of the Kolynos 
acquisition in early 1995. Economic uncertainty in Mexico could impact 
overall results from that country, as previously anticipated growth will be 
tempered in at least the near term 


 
until the peso currency is stabilized. Several new products including 
Palmolive Dishwashing Liquid and Antibacterial Hand Soap, Irish Spring 
Waterfall Clean soap and Murphy's Kitchen Care cleaning products were 
introduced into the North American market in late 1994. Growth is also 
anticipated due to new product introductions in Colgate-International 
operations and in Hill's. Overall, the global economic situation for 1995 is 
not expected to be materially different from that experienced in 1994, and 
the Company expects its positive momentum to continue. Historically, the 
consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic 
growth than many other industries, and therefore the Company constantly 
evaluates projects which will focus operations on opportunities for enhanced 
growth potential. Over the long term, Colgate's continued focus on its 
consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names, its 
broad international presence in both developed and developing markets, and 
its strong capital base all position the Company to take advantage of growth 
opportunities and to continue to increase profitability and shareholder 
value.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Principles of Consolidation 
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of 
Colgate-Palmolive Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany 
transactions and balances have been eliminated. Investments in companies in 
which the Company's interest is between 20% and 50% are accounted for using 
the equity method. The Company's share of the net income from such 
investments is recorded as equity earnings and is classified as other 
expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Revenue Recognition 
Sales are recorded at the time products are shipped to trade customers. Net 
sales reflect units shipped at selling list prices reduced by trade promotion 
allowances. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three 
months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents for purposes of the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
Investments in short-term securities that do not meet the definition of cash 
equivalents are classified as marketable securities in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets. Marketable securities are reported at cost, which equals 
market. 

Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The last-in, first-out 
(LIFO) method is used to value substantially all inventories in the U.S. as 
well as in certain overseas locations. The remaining inventories are valued 
using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. 

Property, Plant and Equipment 
Land, buildings, and machinery and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation 
is provided, primarily using the straight-line method, over estimated useful 
lives ranging from 3 to 40 years. 

Goodwill and Other Intangibles 
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of 
identifiable tangible and intangible net assets of businesses acquired. 
Goodwill and other intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over 
periods not exceeding 40 years. The recoverability of carrying values of 
intangible assets is evaluated on a recurring basis. The primary indicators 
of recoverability are current or forecasted profitability of a related 
acquired business. For the three-year period ended December 31, 1994, there 
were no adjustments to the carrying values of intangible assets resulting 
from these evaluations. 

Income Taxes 
For 1994 and 1993, deferred taxes are recognized for the expected future tax 
consequences of temporary differences between the amounts carried for 
financial reporting and tax purposes. Provision is made currently for taxes 
payable on remittances of overseas earnings; no provision is made for taxes 
on overseas retained earnings that are deemed to be permanently reinvested. 

Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits 
Effective January 1, 1993, the cost of postretirement health care and other 
benefits is actuarially determined and accrued over the service period of 
covered employees. 

Translation of Overseas Currencies 
The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries, other than those operating in 
highly inflationary environments, are translated into U.S. dollars at 
year-end exchange rates, with resulting translation gains and losses 
accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity. Income and 
expense items are converted into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange 
prevailing during the year. 


 
For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories 
and property, plant and equipment are translated at the rate of exchange on 
the date the assets were acquired, while other assets and liabilities are 
translated at year-end exchange rates. Translation adjustments for these 
operations are included in net income. 

Geographic Areas and Industry Segments 
The financial and descriptive information on the Company's geographic area 
and industry segment data, appearing in the tables contained in Item 7 of 
this report, is an integral part of these financial statements. 

2. Acquisitions 
During 1994, the Company acquired the Cibaca toothpaste and toothbrush 
business in India, the NSOA laundry soap business in Senegal, Nevex 
non-chlorine bleach in Venezuela, and Na Pancha laundry soap in Peru as well 
as several other regional brands in the Oral, Personal and Household Care 
segment. The aggregate purchase price of all 1994 acquisitions was $149.8. 

In October 1993, the Company acquired the liquid hand and body soap brands of 
S.C. Johnson Wax in Europe, the South Pacific and other international 
locations. During that year, the Company also acquired the Cristasol glass 
cleaner business in Spain, increased ownership of its Indian operation to 
majority control and made other investments. The aggregate purchase price of 
all 1993 acquisitions was $222.5. 

In March 1992, the Company acquired The Mennen Company ("Mennen") for an 
aggregate purchase price of $670.0, paid with 11.6 million unregistered 
shares of the Company's common stock and $127.0 in cash. The acquisition 
included Mennen's personal care products business as well as non-core 
businesses that were sold in August 1992. The results of operations of Mennen 
have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements since March 27, 
1992. 

During 1992, the Company also acquired the remaining interest in Viset, an 
Italian manufacturer of consumer products, and established significant 
ownership positions in joint ventures in China and Eastern Europe. The 
aggregate purchase price of all 1992 acquisitions was $718.4. 

All of these acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases, and, 
accordingly, the purchase prices were allocated to the net tangible and 
intangible assets acquired based on estimated fair values at the dates of the 
respective acquisitions. The results of operations have been included in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements since the respective acquisition dates. The 
inclusion of pro forma financial data for these acquisitions prior to the 
dates of acquisition would not have materially affected reported results. 

3. Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities 

Long-term debt consists of the following at December 31: 


Other debt consists of capitalized leases and individual fixed and floating 
rate issues of less than $30.0 with various maturities. Scheduled maturities 
of debt outstanding at December 31, 1994, exclusive of capitalized lease 
obligations, are as follows: 1995-$23.4; 1996-$34.0; 1997-$104.4; 1998-$58.1, 
and 1999-$158.0. Commercial paper is classified as long-term debt in 
accordance with the Company's intent and ability to refinance such 
obligations on a long-term basis. 


 
At December 31, 1994, the Company had unused credit facilities amounting to 
$1,439.8. Commitment fees related to credit facilities are not material. The 
weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings as of December 31, 
1994 and 1993 was 7.9% and 6.6%, respectively. 

4. Leases 
At December 31, 1994, future minimum rental payments under capital and 
operating leases were as follows: 

                                                   Capital      Operating 
Year Ending December 31,

Rent expense for all operating leases totaled $83.4 in 1994, $91.5 in 1993 
and $80.3 in 1992. 

5. Capital Stock and Stock Option Plans 

Preferred Stock 
Preferred Stock consists of 250,000 authorized shares without par value. It 
is issuable in series, of which one series of 125,000 shares, designated 
$4.25 Preferred Stock, with a stated and redeemable value of $100 per share, 
has been issued and is outstanding. Dividends on the $4.25 Preferred Stock 
are cumulative. Under the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, the 
Preferred Stock is subject to redemption only at the option of the Company. 

Preference Stock 
In 1988, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation was amended to authorize 
the issuance of a new class of preferred stock consisting of 50,000,000 
shares of Preference Stock, without par value. The Preference Stock, which is 
convertible into two shares of common stock, ranks junior to all series of 
the Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the 
distribution of assets of the Company. At December 31, 1994 and 1993, 
6,091,375 and 6,181,480 shares of Preference Stock, respectively, were 
outstanding and issued to the Company's ESOP. 

Common Stock 
In March 1992, the Company issued 11,648,693 unregistered shares of its 
common stock in connection with acquiring Mennen. Certain registration rights 
were granted for a portion of the shares issued in connection with the 
transaction. 

In October 1988, the Board of Directors authorized the redemption of the then 
outstanding common stock purchase rights for a total of $6.9. A new rights 
plan was adopted, and stockholders received a distribution of one Preference 
Share Purchase Right ("Right") for each outstanding share of the Company's 
common stock. Each Right entitles stockholders to buy one two-hundredth 
interest in a share of a new series of preference stock at an exercise price 
of $87.50. Each interest is designed to make it the economic equivalent of 
one share of common stock. A Right is exercisable only if a person or group 
acquires 20% or more of the Company's common stock or announces a tender 
offer, the consummation of which would result in ownership by a person or 
group of 20% or more of the common stock. 

If the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination 
transaction, each Right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the Right's 
then current exercise price, a number of the acquiring company's common 
shares 


 
having a market value at that time of twice the Right's exercise price. In 
addition, if a person or group acquires 30% or more of the Company's 
outstanding common stock, otherwise than pursuant to a cash tender offer for 
all shares in which such person or group increases its stake from below 20% 
to 80% or more of the outstanding shares, each Right will entitle its holder 
(other than such person or members of such group) to purchase, at the Right's 
then current exercise price, a number of shares of the Company's common stock 
having a market value of twice the Right's exercise price. Further, at any 
time after a person or group acquires 30% or more (but less than 50%) of the 
Company's outstanding common stock, the Board of Directors may, at its 
option, exchange part or all of the Rights (other than Rights held by the 
acquiring person or group) for shares of the Company's common stock on a 
one-for-one basis. 

Prior to the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial ownership of 20% 
or more of the Company's common stock, each Right is redeemable at the option 
of the Board of Directors at a price of $.005. 

The Board of Directors is also authorized to reduce the 20% and 30% 
thresholds referred to above to not less than 15%. The new Rights will expire 
on October 24, 1998. There were 144,404,237 Preference Share Purchase Rights 
outstanding at December 31, 1994 and 149,256,603 at December 31, 1993. 

At December 31, 1994 and 1993, 596,478 and 507,855 shares, respectively, were 
held for distribution under the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan, which 
provides for cash and common stock awards for officers and other executives 
of the Company and its major subsidiaries. The cost of these shares totaled 
$29.8 at December 31, 1994 and $22.7 at December 31, 1993. 

Stock Option Plans 
The Company's 1987 Stock Option Plan provides for the issuance of 
non-qualified stock options to officers and key employees. The non-qualified 
stock options permit optionees to acquire common stock of the Company upon 
payments of cash or stock. 

Options are granted at prices not less than the fair market value on the date 
of grant. At December 31, 1994, 4,287,890 shares were available for future 
grants. The Company's 1977 Stock Option Plan terminated during 1987, except 
as to options granted. 

During 1992, an Accelerated Ownership feature was added to the 1987 Stock 
Option Plan. The Accelerated Ownership feature provides for the grant of new 
options when previously owned shares of Company stock are used to exercise 
existing options. The number of new options granted under this feature is 
equal to the number of shares of previously owned Company stock used to 
exercise the original options and to pay the related required U.S. income 
tax. The new options are granted at a price equal to the fair market value on 
the date of the new grant and have the same expiration date as the original 
options exercised. 

Stock option plan activity is summarized below: 

                                                     1994              1993

Option price range at December 31 .......... $13.28 to $99.79  $11.88 to $99.79

6. Employee Stock Ownership Plan 
In 1989, the Company expanded its employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) 
through the introduction of a leveraged ESOP covering employees who have met 
certain eligibility requirements. The ESOP issued $410.0 of long- term notes 
due through 2009 bearing an average interest rate of 8.6%. The long-term 
notes, which are guaranteed by the Company, are recorded on the accompanying 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The ESOP used the proceeds of the notes to 
purchase 6.3 million shares of Series B Convertible Preference Stock from the 
Company. The Stock has a minimum redemption price of $65 per share and pays 
semi-annual dividends equal to the higher of $2.44 or the current dividend 
paid on two common shares for the comparable six-month period. Each share may 
be converted by the Trustee into two shares of common stock. 


 
Dividends on these preferred shares, as well as common shares also held by 
the ESOP, are paid to the ESOP trust and, together with Company 
contributions, are used by the ESOP to repay principal and interest on the 
outstanding notes. Preferred shares are released for allocation to 
participants based upon the ratio of the current year's debt service to the 
sum of total principal and interest payments over the life of the loan. At 
December 31, 1994, 1,017,757 shares were allocated to participant accounts. 

Dividends on these preferred shares are deductible for income tax purposes 
and, accordingly, are reflected net of their tax benefit in the Consolidated 
Statements of Retained Earnings. 

Annual expense related to the leveraged ESOP, determined as interest incurred 
on the notes, less dividends received on the shares held by the ESOP, plus 
the higher of either principal repayments on the notes or the cost of shares 
allocated, was $8.0 in 1994, $7.9 in 1993 and $8.1 in 1992. Similarly, 
unearned compensation, shown as a reduction in shareholders' equity, is 
reduced by the higher of principal payments or the cost of shares allocated. 

Interest incurred on the ESOP's notes amounted to $34.2 in 1994, $34.5 in 
1993 and $35.1 in 1992. The Company paid dividends on the stock held by the 
ESOP of $32.3 in 1994, $32.7 in 1993 and $32.8 in 1992. Company contributions 
to the ESOP were $5.7 in 1994 and 1993, and $5.6 in 1992. 

7. Retirement Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Retirement Plans 
The Company, its U.S. subsidiaries and a majority of its overseas 
subsidiaries maintain pension plans covering substantially all of their 
employees. Most plans provide pension benefits that are based primarily on 
years of service and employees' career earnings. In the Company's principal 
U.S. plans, funds are contributed to trustees as necessary to provide for 
current service and for any unfunded projected benefit obligation over a 
reasonable period. To the extent these requirements are exceeded by plan 
assets, a contribution may not be made in a particular year. Plan assets 
consist principally of common stocks, deposit administration contracts with 
insurance companies, investments in real estate funds and U.S. Government 
obligations. 

Net periodic pension expense of the plans includes the following components: 



 
The following table sets forth the funded status of the plans at December 31: 



The actuarial assumptions used to determine the projected benefit obligations 
of the plans were as follows: 


When remeasuring the pension obligation, the Company reassesses each 
actuarial assumption. In accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, the settlement rate assumption is pegged to long-term bond rates 
to reflect the cost to satisfy the pension obligation currently, and the 
other assumptions reflect the long-term outlook of rates of compensation 
increases and return on assets. 

Other Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits 
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries provide health care and life 
insurance benefits for retired employees to the extent not provided by 
government-sponsored plans. 

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement 
Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS 106). SFAS 106 requires the Company to 
change its method of accounting for its postretirement life and health care 
benefits provided to retirees from the "pay-as-you-go" basis to accruing such 
costs over the working lives of the employees. The Company elected to 
recognize this change in accounting on the immediate recognition basis and 
utilizes a portion of its leveraged ESOP, in the form of future retiree 
contributions, to reduce its obligation to provide these postretirement 
benefits. Postretirement benefits currently are not funded. The Company also 
adopted SFAS 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." SFAS 
112 requires accrual accounting for the estimated cost of benefits provided 
to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement. 

The cumulative effect on prior years of adopting SFAS 106 and 112 as of 
January 1, 1993 resulted in a pretax charge during 1993 of $195.7 ($129.2 
aftertax or $.83 per share), of which $189.5 related to SFAS 106 and $6.2 
related to SFAS 112. This non-cash charge represented the accumulated benefit 
obligation net of related accruals previously recorded by the Company as of 
January 1, 1993. 


 
Postretirement benefits expense included the following components: 

                                                               1994       1993
Service cost-benefits earned during the period ...........    $ 2.2      $ 3.7
Annual ESOP allocation ...................................     (5.7)      (6.2)
Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit
  obligation .............................................     14.2       16.4
Amortization of unrecognized net (gain) ..................      (.1)        --  
  Net postretirement expense .............................    $10.6      $13.9

The cash cost to the Company for postretirement benefits in 1992, excluding 
acquisitions, approximated $11.2. 

The actuarial present value of postretirement benefit obligations included in 
Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was comprised of the 
following components, at December 31: 

                                                              1994        1993 
Retirees ...............................................     $144.9      $155.2
Active participants eligible for retirement ............        2.9        11.3
Other active participants ..............................       17.0        25.1
Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation ..........      164.8       191.6
Unrecognized net gain ..................................       38.5        14.2
Accrued postretirement benefit liability ...............     $203.3      $205.8

The principal actuarial assumptions used in the measurement of the 
accumulated benefit obligation were as follows: 

                                                            1994         1993 
Discount rate ........................................      8.75%        7.25%
Current medical cost trend rate ......................     10.00%       10.00%
Ultimate medical cost trend rate .....................      6.25%        5.00%
Medical cost trend rate decreases ratably to
  ultimate in year ...................................      2001         2001 
ESOP growth rate .....................................     10.00%       10.00%

When remeasuring the accumulated benefit obligation, the Company reassesses 
each actuarial assumption. 

The cost of these postretirement medical benefits is dependent upon a number 
of factors, the most significant of which is the rate at which medical costs 
increase in the future. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed medical 
cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit 
obligation by approximately $17.3; annual expense would not be materially 
affected. 

8. Income Taxes 
Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109). The 
one-time non-cash charge for the recalculation of income taxes was $229.0 
($1.47 per share), which was recorded in the 1993 Statement of Income, 
primarily as a result of the 1992 acquisition of Mennen. 

The provision for income taxes on income before changes in accounting 
consists of the following for the years ended December 31: 

                                           1994            1993            1992 
United States ..................         $ 43.3          $ 75.9          $ 70.3
Overseas .......................          256.4           212.2           180.6
                                         $299.7          $288.1          $250.9



 
Differences between accounting for financial statement purposes and 
accounting for tax purposes result in taxes currently payable (lower) higher 
than the total provision for income taxes as follows: 

                                                  1994        1993        1992 
Excess of tax over book depreciation .......    $(32.8)     $(18.7)     $(18.0)
Net restructuring (spending) accrual .......     (19.0)      (24.2)      (22.0)
Other, net .................................       5.6       (13.8)       (9.4)
                                                $(46.2)     $(56.7)     $(49.4)

The components of income before income taxes are as follows for the three 
years ended December 31: 

                                          1994            1993            1992 
United States ..................         $181.8          $256.9          $247.6
Overseas .......................          698.1           579.3           480.3
                                         $879.9          $836.2          $727.9

The difference between the statutory United States federal income tax rate 
and the Company's global effective tax rate as reflected in the Consolidated 
Statements of Income is as follows: 

% of Income Before Tax                                1994       1993       1992
Tax at U.S. statutory rate ........................  35.0%      35.0%      34.0%
State income taxes, net of federal benefit ........    .6         .7        1.0
Earnings taxed at other than U.S. statutory rate ..   (.3)       (.2)        .3
Other, net ........................................  (1.2)      (1.0)       (.8)
Effective tax rate ................................  34.1%      34.5%      34.5%

In addition, tax benefits of $16.0 in 1994 and $15.8 in 1993 were recorded 
directly through equity. 

The components of deferred taxes at December 31: 


The major component of the 1994 and 1993 valuation allowance relates to the 
uncertainty of realizing certain foreign deferred tax assets. 


 
9. Foreign Currency Translation 
Cumulative translation adjustments, which represent the effect of translating 
assets and liabilities of the Company's non-U.S. entities, except those in 
highly inflationary economies, were as follows: 

                                                   1994        1993        1992 
Balance, January 1 .........................    $(372.9)    $(308.5)    $(216.9)
Effect of balance sheet translations .......      (66.4)      (64.4)      (91.6)
Balance, December 31 .......................    $(439.3)    $(372.9)    $(308.5)

Foreign currency charges, resulting from the translation of balance sheets of 
subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments and from foreign 
currency transactions, were not material in 1994, 1993 and 1992. 

10. Earnings Per Share 
Primary earnings per share are determined by dividing net income, after 
deducting preferred stock dividends net of related tax benefits ($21.6 net in 
1994 and 1993, and $20.7 net in 1992), by the weighted average number of 
common shares outstanding (146.2 million in 1994, 155.9 million in 1993 and 
156.5 million in 1992). 

Fully diluted earnings per common share are calculated assuming the 
conversion of all potentially dilutive securities, including convertible 
preferred stock and outstanding options, unless the effect of such conversion 
is antidilutive. This calculation also assumes, if applicable, reduction of 
available income by pro forma ESOP replacement funding, net of income taxes. 

11. Other Income Statement Information 
Other expense (income) consists of the following for the years ended December 
31: 

                                                 1994        1993         1992 
Amortization of intangibles ..............     $ 56.3       $51.2       $ 47.7

                                               $ 82.8       $71.3       $ 20.7

The following is a comparative summary of certain expense information for the 
years ended December 31: 

                                              1994          1993          1992

Media advertising costs ..............       $543.2        $508.3        $516.6

12. Balance Sheet Information 
Supplemental balance sheet information is as follows: 

Inventories                                              1994             1993 
Raw materials and supplies ...................          $280.3           $250.0
Work-in-process ..............................            38.4             28.7
Finished goods ...............................           395.2            399.3
                                                        $713.9           $678.0

Inventories valued under LIFO amounted to $163.6 at December 31, 1994 and 
$170.8 at December 31, 1993. The excess of current cost over LIFO cost at the 
end of each year was $39.6 and $23.1, respectively. In 1994 and 1993, certain 
inventory quantities were reduced, which resulted in liquidations of LIFO 
inventory quantities. The effect was to increase income by $2.8 and $1.7 in 
1994 and 1993, respectively.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
In assessing the fair value of financial instruments at December 31, 1994 and 
1993, the Company has used available market information and other valuation 
methodologies. Some judgment is necessarily required in interpreting market 
data to develop the estimates of fair value, and, accordingly, the estimates 
are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize 
in a current market exchange. 

The estimated fair value of the Company's financial instruments at December 
31, are summarized as follows: 



Financial Instruments and Rate Risk Management 
The Company utilizes interest rate agreements and foreign exchange contracts 
to manage interest rate and foreign currency exposures. The principal 
objective of such contracts is to moderate rather than attempt to eliminate 
fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency movements. The Company, as 
a matter of policy, does not speculate in financial markets and therefore 
does not hold these contracts for trading purposes. The Company utilizes what 
it considers straightforward instruments, such as forward foreign exchange 
contracts and non-leveraged interest rate swaps, to accomplish its 
objectives. 


 
The Company primarily uses interest rate swap agreements to effectively 
convert a portion of its floating rate debt to fixed rate debt in order to 
manage interest rate exposures in a manner consistent with achieving a 
targeted fixed to variable interest rate ratio. The net effective cash 
payment of these instruments combined with the related interest payments on 
the debt that they hedge are accounted for as interest expense. Those 
interest rate instruments that do not qualify as hedge instruments for 
accounting purposes are marked to market and carried on the balance sheet at 
fair value. As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, the Company had agreements 
outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $222.0 and $347.0, 
respectively, with maturities through 2001. 

The Company uses forward exchange contracts principally to hedge foreign 
currency exposures associated with its net investment in foreign operations 
and intercompany loans. This hedging minimizes the impact of foreign exchange 
rate movements on the Company's financial position. The terms of these 
contracts are rarely longer than three years. 

As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, the Company had approximately $390.7 and 
$439.0, respectively, of outstanding foreign exchange contracts in which 
foreign currencies were purchased, and approximately $6.9 in which foreign 
currencies were sold as of December 31, 1994. At December 31, 1994 and 1993, 
approximately 20% of outstanding foreign exchange contracts served to hedge 
net investments in foreign subsidiaries, 60% hedged intercompany loans, 10% 
hedged third-party firm commitments, and the remaining 10% hedged certain 
transactions that are anticipated to settle in accordance with their 
identified terms. The Company makes net settlements for foreign exchange 
contracts at maturity, based on rates agreed to at inception of the 
contracts. 

Gains and losses from contracts that hedge the Company's investments in its 
foreign subsidiaries are shown in the cumulative translation adjustments 
account included in shareholders' equity. Gains and losses from contracts 
that hedge firm commitments (including intercompany loans) are recorded in 
the balance sheets as a component of the related receivable or payable. 

The contracts that hedge anticipated sales and purchases do not qualify as 
hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the related gains and losses are 
calculated using the current forward foreign exchange rates and are recorded 
in the statements of income as other expense, net. These contracts mature in 
less than one year. 

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by 
counterparties on interest rate agreements and foreign exchange contracts; 
however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is 
the Company's policy to contract only with counterparties that have a 
long-term debt rating of A or higher. The amount of any such exposure is 
generally the unrealized gain on such contracts, which at December 31, 1994 
was not significant. 

Effective January 1, 1994 the Company adopted Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and 
Equity Securities," which addresses the accounting and reporting for 
investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values 
and for all investments in debt securities. The effect of adoption had no 
impact on results of operations or cash flows and was not material to 
financial condition. 

13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
The Company has various contractual commitments to purchase raw materials, 
products and services totaling $184.9 that expire through 1998. 

The Company is a party to various superfund and other environmental matters 
and is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, taxes and other matters 
arising out of the normal course of business. Management proactively reviews 
and manages its exposure to, and the impact of, environmental matters. While 
it is possible that the Company's cash flows and results of operations in 
particular quarterly or annual periods could be affected by the one-time 
impacts of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of 
management that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not 
previously provided for, will not have a material impact on the Company's 
financial condition or ongoing cash flows and results of operations. 

As discussed in Note 16, the acquisition of Kolynos is subject to review by 
antitrust regulatory authorities in Brazil and Colombia. While it is not yet 
possible to definitively determine whether or not approval will be obtained, 
management believes the acquisition, or some variation thereof, will 
eventually be approved. 


 
14. Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) 

Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts 


(1) Reflects a first-quarter 1993 charge for changes in accounting for Other 
Postretirement Benefits, Postemployment Benefits and Income Taxes of $358.2. 

(2) The sum of the quarterly earnings per share amounts in 1993 was not equal 
to the full year because the computations of the weighted average number of 
shares outstanding and the potential impact of dilutive securities for each 
quarter and for the full year were made independently. 


 
15. Market and Dividend Information 
The Company's common stock and $4.25 Preferred Stock are listed on the New 
York Stock Exchange. The trading symbol for the common stock is CL. Dividends 
on the common stock have been paid every year since 1895, and the amount of 
dividends paid per share has increased for 32 consecutive years.

16. Subsequent Event--Purchase of Kolynos Oral Care Business 
On January 10, 1995, the Company acquired the worldwide Kolynos oral care 
business ("Kolynos") from American Home Products Corporation for $1,040.0 in 
cash. Kolynos is a multinational oral care business operating primarily in 
South America and having a presence in Greece, Taiwan and Hungary. The 
acquired assets of the Kolynos business, located principally in Argentina, 
Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay, include trademarks and other 
intellectual property, accounts receivable, inventories, and property, plant 
and equipment that is utilized in the production of toothpaste, toothbrushes, 
dental floss and oral rinses. 

The transaction was structured as a multinational acquisition of assets and 
stock and will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, with 
the results of operations of Kolynos included with the results of the Company 
from January 10, 1995. The acquisition will be reviewed by antitrust 
regulatory authorities in Brazil and Colombia. The financing used to acquire 
the Kolynos business was provided by commercial banks. 

The net book value of Kolynos's assets was approximately $50.0. The Company 
is currently evaluating the business in order to determine the fair value of 
assets acquired, including intangibles and goodwill. 

The Company expects the acquisition to have a first-year (unaudited) dilutive 
effect of less than 5% on total Company earnings. Although the Company 
intends to operate Kolynos in Brazil as a separate operation, there are 
certain other benefits that are anticipated to be realized from the 
implementation of the Company's integration plans. The Company believes that 
future growth opportunities, as well as the benefits of such integration 
plans when fully implemented, will reduce and eventually more than offset any 
dilutive impact on earnings per share.

                    Report of Independent Public Accountants

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Colgate-Palmolive Company: 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 
Colgate-Palmolive Company (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of 
December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated statements of 
income, retained earnings, changes in capital accounts and cash flows for 
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994. These 
financial statements and the schedule referred to below are the 
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express 
an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the financial position of Colgate-Palmolive Company 
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their 
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period 
ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles. 

As discussed in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial 
statements, in 1993, the Company adopted three new accounting standards 
promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, changing its methods 
of accounting for income taxes, postretirement benefits other than pensions, 
and postemployment benefits. 

Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic 
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in the index to 
financial statements is presented for purposes of complying with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the basic 
financial statements. The schedule has been subjected to the auditing 
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our 
opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data required 
to be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken 
as a whole.
