OVERVIEW

We
      are a
      multi-line healthcare enterprise operating primarily in two segments: Medicaid
      Managed Care and Specialty Services. Our Medicaid Managed Care segment provides
      Medicaid and Medicaid-related health plan coverage to individuals through
      government subsidized programs, including Medicaid, the State Children’s Health
      Insurance Program, or SCHIP, and Supplemental Security Income, or SSI. Medicaid
      currently accounts for 79% of our membership, while SCHIP and SSI account for
      19% and 2%, respectively. Our Specialty Services segment provides specialty
      services, including behavioral health, disease management, long-term care
      programs, managed vision, nurse triage, pharmacy benefits management and
      treatment compliance, to state programs, healthcare organizations and other
      commercial organizations, as well as to our own subsidiaries on market-based
      terms. Our FirstGuard health plans exited the Kansas and Missouri markets
      effective January 1 and February 1, 2007, respectively.

Our
      Medicaid Managed Care membership totaled approximately 1.3 million as of
      December 31, 2006, an increase of 45% from December 31, 2005. That membership
      includes 107,000 and 31,900 members in Kansas and Missouri, respectively. We
      currently have six health plan subsidiaries offering healthcare services in
      Georgia, Indiana, New Jersey, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin. We provide
      member-focused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing
      care, coordinating referrals to related health and social services and
      addressing member concerns and questions. We also provide education and outreach
      programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality, appropriate
      healthcare services.

We
      believe our local approach to managing our subsidiaries, including provider
      and
      member services, enables us to provide accessible, quality, culturally-sensitive
      healthcare coverage to our communities. Our disease management, educational
      and
      other initiatives are designed to help members best utilize the healthcare
      system to ensure they receive appropriate, medically necessary services and
      effective management of routine, severe and chronic health problems, resulting
      in better health outcomes. We combine our decentralized local approach for
      care
      with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance,
      information systems and claims processing.

Our
      initial health plan commenced operations in Wisconsin in 1984. We were organized
      in Wisconsin in 1993 as a holding company for our initial health plan and
      reincorporated in Delaware in 2001. Our corporate office is located at 7711
      Carondelet Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri 63105, and our telephone number is (314)
      725-4477.

      10-K,
      quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and any
      amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or
      15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we
      electronically file such material with, or furnish such material to, the SEC.

INDUSTRY

We
      provide our services to organizations and individuals primarily through
      Medicaid, SCHIP and SSI programs. The Congressional Budget Office, or CBO,
      estimated the total Medicaid market was approximately $330 billion in 2005,
      and
      the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, estimate the
      market will grow to over $450 billion by 2010. According to the most recent
      information provided by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured,
      Medicaid spending increased by 2.8% in fiscal 2006 and states appropriated
      an
      increase of 5.0% for Medicaid in fiscal 2007 budgets.

Established
      in 1965, Medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the United States,
      providing health insurance to low-income families and individuals with
      disabilities. Authorized by Title XIX of the Social Security Act, Medicaid
      is an
      entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and
      administered by the states. The majority of funding is provided at the federal
      level. Each state establishes its own eligibility standards, benefit packages,
      payment rates and program administration within federal standards. As a result,
      there are 56 Medicaid programs—one for each U.S. state, each U.S. territory and
      the District of Columbia. A growing number of states have mandated that their
      Medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans as a means of delivering
      quality healthcare and controlling costs. Currently, 37 of the 56 programs,
      including each of the six states in which we operate health plans, have mandated
      managed care for some or all of their Medicaid recipients. Eligibility is based
      on a combination of household income and assets, often determined by an income
      level relative to the federal poverty level. Historically, children have
      represented the largest eligibility group.

Established
      in 1972, and authorized by Title XVI of the Social Security Act, SSI covers
      low-income persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health
      impairments. SSI beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all Medicaid
      recipients. In addition, SSI recipients typically utilize more services because
      of their critical health issues.


Table
            of Contents

The
      Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created SCHIP to help states expand coverage
      primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for Medicaid,
      yet not enough to afford private health insurance. Some states include the
      parents of these children in their SCHIP programs. SCHIP is the single largest
      expansion of health insurance coverage for children since the enactment of
      Medicaid. Costs related to the largest eligibility group, children, are
      primarily composed of pediatrics and family care. These costs tend to be more
      predictable than other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult
      population.

A
      portion
      of Medicaid beneficiaries are dual eligibles, low-income seniors and people
      with
      disabilities who are enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare. According to
      information provided by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured,
      dual eligibles account for 14% of Medicaid enrollees. These dual eligibles
      may
      receive assistance from Medicaid for Medicaid benefits, such as nursing home
      care and/or assistance with Medicare premiums and cost sharing. Dual eligibles
      also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues.
      We serve dual eligibles through our SSI and long-term care programs.

While
      Medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford
      or
      otherwise maintain health insurance coverage, they did not initially address
      the
      inefficient and costly manner in which the Medicaid population tends to access
      healthcare. Medicaid recipients in non-managed care programs typically have
      not
      sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions, such as
      asthma and diabetes. Rather, they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency
      rooms, which tends to be more expensive. As a result, many states have found
      that the costs of providing Medicaid benefits have increased while the medical
      outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory.

Since
      the
      early 1980s, increasing healthcare costs, combined with significant growth
      in
      the number of Medicaid recipients, have led many states to establish Medicaid
      managed care initiatives. Continued pressure on states’ Medicaid budgets should
      cause public policy to recognize the value of managed care as a means of
      delivering quality health care and effectively controlling costs. A growing
      number of states, including each of the six states in which we operate health
      plans, have mandated that their Medicaid recipients enroll in managed care
      plans. Other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach.
      As a result, a significant market opportunity exists for managed care
      organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct
      socio-economic, cultural and healthcare needs of the Medicaid, SCHIP and SSI
      populations. We believe our approach and strategy enable us to be a growing
      participant in this market.

OUR
      COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS

Our
      multi-line managed care approach is based on the following key attributes:

Ÿ

Sustained
                Historic Operating Performance

.
                We have a historical trend of increasing revenues as we have grown
                in
                existing markets and expanded into new markets. We entered the Wisconsin
                market in 1984, the Indiana market in 1995, the Texas market in 1999,
                the
                New Jersey market in 2002, the Ohio market in 2004 and the Georgia
                market
                in 2006. We have also increased membership by acquiring Medicaid
                businesses, contracts and other related assets from competitors in
                existing markets, most recently in Ohio in 2005 and 2006. We have
                increased our total membership from 409,600 in 2002 to 1,262,200
                as of
                December 31, 2006, a 32% Compound Annual Growth Rate, or CAGR. For
                the
                year ended December 31, 2006, we had revenue of $2.3 billion, representing
                a 49% CAGR since the year ended December 31, 2002. We generated total
                cash
                flow from operations of $195.0 million during the year ended December
                31,
                2006.

Ÿ

Medicaid
                Expertise.

Over
                the last 20 years, we have strived to develop a specialized Medicaid
                expertise that has helped us establish and maintain relationships
                with
                members, providers and state governments. We have implemented programs
                developed to achieve savings for state governments and improve medical
                outcomes for members by reducing inappropriate emergency room use,
                inpatient days and high cost interventions, as well as by managing
                care of
                chronic illnesses. Our experience in working with state regulators
                helps
                us implement and deliver programs and services efficiently and affords
                us
                opportunities to provide input regarding Medicaid industry practices
                and
                policies in the states in which we operate. We work with state agencies
                on
                redefining benefits, eligibility requirements and provider fee schedules
                in order to maximize the number of uninsured individuals covered
                through
                Medicaid, SCHIP and SSI and expand these types of benefits offered.
                Our
                approach is to accomplish this while maintaining adequate levels
                of
                provider compensation and protecting our profitability.

Ÿ

Diversified
                Business Lines.

We
                continue to broaden our service offerings to address areas that we
                believe
                have been traditionally underserved by Medicaid managed care
                organizations. In addition to our Medicaid and Medicaid-related managed
                care services, our service offerings include behavioral health, disease
                management, long-term care programs, managed vision, nurse triage,
                pharmacy benefits management and treatment compliance. Through the
                utilization of a multi-business line approach, we are able to diversify
                our revenue and help control our medical costs.

Ÿ

Localized
                Approach with Centralized Support Infrastructure.

We
                take a localized approach to managing our subsidiaries, including
                provider
                and member services. This approach enables us to facilitate access
                by our
                members to high quality, culturally sensitive healthcare services.
                Our
                systems and procedures have been designed to address these
                community-specific challenges through outreach, education, transportation
                and other member support activities. For example, our community outreach
                programs work with our members and their communities to promote health
                and
                self-improvement


Table
            of Contents

through
      employment
      and education on how best to access care. We complement this localized approach
      with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance,
      information systems and claims processing, which allows us to minimize general
      and administrative expenses and to integrate and realize synergies from
      acquisitions. We believe this combined approach allows us to efficiently
      integrate new business opportunities in both Medicaid and specialty services
      while maintaining our local accountability and improved access.

Ÿ

Specialized
                and Scalable Systems and Technology

.
                Through our specialized information systems, we work to strengthen
                relationships with providers and states which help us grow our membership
                base. Our specialized information systems allow us to support our
                core
                processing functions under a set of integrated databases which are
                designed to be both replicable and scalable. Physicians can use claims,
                utilization and membership data to manage their practices more
                efficiently, and they also benefit from our timely payments. State
                agencies can use data from our information systems to demonstrate
                that
                their Medicaid populations receive quality health care in an efficient
                manner. These systems also help identify needs for new healthcare
                and
                specialty programs. We have the ability to leverage our platform
                for one
                state configuration into new states or for health plan acquisitions.
                Our
                ability to access data and translate it into meaningful information
                is
                essential to operating across a multi-state service area in a
                cost-effective manner.

Ÿ

Experienced
                Management Team

.
                We have a management team who possess significant industry experience.
                Michael Neidorff, our Chairman and CEO, has been with us since 1996
                and
                has over 20 years of experience in all aspects of managed care. Per
                Brodin, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has
                extensive experience as a financial and accounting officer both at
                Centene
                and other organizations. The other members of our senior management
                team
                are well-seasoned professionals with a broad range of capabilities
                including industry experience and functional expertise. This team
                has
                successfully managed the growth of our health plans and specialty
                businesses, while maintaining operational
                discipline.

OUR
      STRATEGY

Our
      objective is to become the leading multi-line healthcare enterprise focusing
      on
      Medicaid and Medicaid-related services. We intend to achieve this objective
      by
      implementing the following key components of our strategy:

Ÿ

Increase
                Penetration of Existing State Markets.

We
                seek to continue to increase our Medicaid membership in states in
                which we
                currently operate through alliances with key providers, outreach
                efforts,
                development and implementation of community-specific products and
                acquisitions. In 2006, we were awarded two regions in connection
                with
                Ohio’s statewide restructuring of its Medicaid managed care program,
                expanding the number of counties we serve from three to 27. We also
                were
                awarded a Medicaid Aged, Blind or Disabled, or ABD, contract in four
                regions in Ohio. In Texas, we expanded our operations to the Corpus
                Christi market in 2006 and began managing care for SSI recipients
                in
                February 2007. We may also increase membership by acquiring Medicaid
                businesses, contracts and other related assets from our competitors
                in our
                existing markets or by enlisting additional providers. For example,
                in
                2005 and 2006, we acquired certain Medicaid-related assets in Ohio.

Ÿ

Diversify
                Business Lines.

We
                seek to broaden our business lines into areas that complement our
                existing
                business to enable us to grow and diversify our revenue. For instance,
                in
                October 2006, we commenced operations under our managed care program
                contracts to provide long-term care services in Arizona, and in January
                2006, we completed the acquisition of US Script, a pharmacy benefits
                manager. We are also considering other premium-based or fee-for-service
                lines of business that would provide additional diversity. We employ
                a
                disciplined acquisition strategy that is based on defined criteria
                including internal rate of return, accretion to earnings per share,
                market
                leadership and compatibility with our information systems. We engage
                our
                executives in the relevant operational units or functional areas
                to ensure
                consistency between the diligence and integration process.

Ÿ

Address
                Emerging State Needs.

We
                work to assist the states in which we operate in addressing the operating
                challenges they face. We seek to assist the states in balancing premium
                rates, benefit levels, member eligibility, policies and practices,
                and
                provider compensation. For example, in 2005 we began performing under
                our
                contracts with the State of Arizona to facilitate the delivery of
                mental
                health and substance abuse services to behavioral health recipients
                in
                Arizona. Effective January 1, 2005, we were awarded a behavioral
                health
                contract to serve SCHIP members in Kansas. By helping states structure
                an
                appropriate level and range of Medicaid, SCHIP and specialty services,
                we
                seek to ensure that we are able to continue to provide those services
                on
                terms that achieve targeted gross margins, provide an acceptable
                return
                and grow our business.

Ÿ

Develop
                and Acquire Additional State Markets.

We
                continue to leverage our experience to identify and develop new markets
                by
                seeking both to acquire existing business and to build our own operations.
                We expect to focus expansion on states where Medicaid recipients
                are
                mandated to enroll in managed care organizations because we believe
                member
                enrollment levels are more predictable in these states. For example,
                effective June 1, 2006, we began managing care for Medicaid and SCHIP
                members in Georgia.

Ÿ

Leverage
                  Established Infrastructure to Enhance Operating
                  Efficiencies.

We
                  intend to continue to invest in infrastructure to further drive
                  efficiencies in operations and to add functionality to improve
                  the service
                  provided to members and other organizations at a low cost. Our
                  centralized
                  functions enable us to add members and markets quickly and economically.
                  For example, during 2005, we opened an additional claims processing
                  facility to accommodate our planned growth initiatives for this
                  centralized function.

Ÿ

Maintain
                Operational Discipline.

We
                monitor our cost trends, operating performance, regulatory relationships
                and the Medicaid political environment in our existing markets. We
                seek to
                operate in markets that allow us to meet our internal metrics including
                membership growth, plan size, market leadership and operating efficiency.
                We may divest contracts or health plans in markets where the state’s
                Medicaid environment, over a long-term basis, does not allow us to
                meet
                our targeted performance levels. We use multiple techniques to monitor
                and
                reduce our medical costs, including on-site hospital review by staff
                nurses and involvement of medical management and finance personnel
                in
                reviewing significant cases. Our health economics unit and health
                plan
                controllers evaluate the financial impact of proposed changes in
                provider
                relationships. We also conduct monthly reviews of member demographics
                for
                each health plan.

Represents
                Medicaid and SCHIP membership as of December 31, 2006 as a percentage
                of
                total eligible Medicaid and SCHIP members in each state, based on
                data
                provided by each state. SSI programs are
                excluded.

Benefits
      to States

Our
      ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve
      results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while
      reducing and managing costs, and from our specialized programs in working with
      state governments. Among the benefits we are able to provide to the states
      with
      which we contract are:

Ÿ

Significant
                  cost savings compared to state paid reimbursement for
                  services

.
                  We bring bottom-line management experience to our health plans.
                  On the
                  administrative and management side, we bring experience including
                  quality
                  of care improvement methods, utilization management procedures,
                  an
                  efficient claims payment system, and provider performance reporting,
                  as
                  well as managers and staff experienced in using these key elements
                  to
                  improve the quality of and access to
                  care.

Ÿ

Data-driven
                  approaches to balance cost and verify eligibility

.
                  Our Medicaid health plans have conducted enrollment processing
                  and
                  activities for state programs since 1984. We ensure effective enrollment
                  procedures that move members into the plan, then educate them and
                  ensure
                  that they receive needed services as quickly as possible. Our IT
                  department has created mapping/translation programs for loading
                  membership
                  and linking membership eligibility status to all of Centene’s subsystems.

Ÿ

Establishment
                  of realistic and meaningful expectations for quality deliverables.

We
                  have collaborated with state agencies in redefining benefits, eligibility
                  requirements and provider fee schedules with the goal of maximizing
                  the
                  number of uninsured individuals covered through Medicaid and SSI
                  programs.

Ÿ

Managed
                  care expertise in government subsidized programs

.
                  Our expertise in Medicaid has helped us establish and maintain
                  strong
                  relationships with our constituent communities of members, providers
                  and
                  state governments. We provide access to services through local
                  providers
                  and staff that focus on the cultural norms of their individual
                  communities. To that end, systems and procedures have been designed
                  to
                  address community-specific challenges through outreach, education,
                  transportation and other member support activities.

Improved
                  medical outcomes

.
                  We have implemented programs developed to achieve savings for state
                  governments and improve medical outcomes for members by reducing
                  inappropriate emergency room use, inpatient days and high cost
                  interventions, as well as by managing care of chronic
                  illness.

Ÿ

Timely
                  payment of provider claims

.
                  We are committed to ensuring that our information systems and claims
                  payment systems meet or exceed state requirements. We continuously
                  endeavor to update our systems and processes to improve the timeliness
                  of
                  our provider payments.

Ÿ

Cost
                  saving outreach and specialty programs

.
                  Our health plans have adopted a physician-driven approach where
                  network
                  providers are actively engaged in developing and implementing healthcare
                  delivery policies and strategies. This approach is designed to
                  eliminate
                  unnecessary costs, improve services to members and simplify the
                  administrative burdens placed on providers. The combination of
                  a
                  decentralized local approach to health plan operations and a centralized
                  approach to administrative functions such as finance, information
                  systems
                  and claims processing allows us to quickly and economically integrate
                  new
                  business opportunities in both the Medicaid Managed Care and Specialty
                  Services segments.

Ÿ

Responsible
                  collection and dissemination of utilization

data

.
                  We gather utilization data from multiple sources, allowing for
                  an
                  integrated view of our members’ utilization of services. These sources
                  include medical and behavioral health claims and encounter data,
                  pharmacy
                  data, vision and dental vendor claims and authorization data from
                  Care
                  Enhanced Case Management Systems, or CCMS, the authorization and
                  case
                  management system utilized by us to coordinate care.

Ÿ

Timely
                  and accurate reporting

.
                  Our information systems have robust reporting capabilities which
                  have been
                  instrumental in identifying the need for new and/or improved healthcare
                  and specialty programs. For state agencies, our reporting capability
                  is
                  instrumental in demonstrating an auditable program.

Member
      Programs and Services

We
      recognize the importance of member-focused delivery of quality managed care
      services. Our locally-based staff assist members in accessing care, coordinating
      referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns
      and questions. While covered healthcare benefits vary from state to state,
      our
      health plans generally provide the following services:

We
      also
      provide the following education and outreach programs to inform and assist
      members in accessing quality, appropriate healthcare services in an efficient
      manner:

Ÿ

CONNECTIONS

is
                a community face-to-face outreach and education program designed
                to create
                a link between the member and the provider and help identify potential
                challenges or risk elements to a member’s health, such as nutritional
                challenges and health education shortcomings. CONNECTIONS representatives
                also contact new members by phone or mail to discuss managed care,
                the
                Medicaid program and our services. Our CONNECTIONS representatives
                make
                home visits, conduct educational programs and represent our health
                plans
                at community events such as health fairs.

Ÿ

Start
                Smart For Your Baby

is
                a prenatal and infant health program designed to increase the percentage
                of pregnant women receiving early prenatal care, reduce the incidence
                of
                low birth weight babies, identify high risk pregnancies, increase
                participation in the federal Women, Infant and Children program,
                and
                increase well-child visits. The program includes risk assessments,
                education through face-to-face meetings and materials, behavior
                modification plans, assistance in selecting a provider for the infant
                and
                scheduling newborn follow-up visits.

Ÿ

EPSDT
                Case Management

is
                a preventive care program designed to educate our members on the
                benefits
                of Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment, or EPSDT,
                services. We have a systematic program of communicating, tracking,
                outreach, reporting and follow-through that promotes state EPSDT
                programs.

Ÿ

Disease
                Management Programs

are designed to help members understand their disease and treatment
                plan
                and improve their health outcomes in a cost effective manner. These
                programs address medical conditions that are common within
                the


Table
            of Contents

Medicaid population such as asthma, diabetes and prenatal care. Our Specialty
      Services segment manages many of our disease management programs. Our SSI
      program uses a proprietary assessment tool that effectively identifies barriers
      to care, unmet functional needs, available social supports and the existence
      of
      behavioral health conditions that impede a member’s ability to maintain a proper
      health status. Care coordinators develop individual care plans with the member
      and healthcare providers ensuring the full integration of behavioral, social
      and
      acute care services. These care plans, while specific to an SSI member,
      incorporate “Condition Specific” practices in collaboration with physician
      partners and community resources.

Providers

For
      each
      of our service areas, we establish a provider network consisting of primary
      and
      specialty care physicians, hospitals and ancillary providers. As of December
      31,
      2006, the health plans we currently serve contracted with the following number
      of physicians and hospitals:

Our
      network of primary care physicians is a critical component in care delivery,
      management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members. Primary
      care physicians include family and general practitioners, pediatricians,
      internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists. Specialty
      care
      physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the
      primary care physicians. Specialty care physicians include orthopedic surgeons,
      cardiologists and otolaryngologists. We also provide education and outreach
      programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality, appropriate
      healthcare services.

Our
        health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily
        through contracts with our providers. Our contracts with primary and specialty
        care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to two-year periods and
        renew
        automatically for successive one-year terms, but generally are subject to
        termination by either party upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice. In
        the
        absence of a contract, we typically pay providers at state Medicaid
        reimbursement levels. We pay physicians under a fee-for-service or capitation
        arrangement.

Ÿ

Under
                  our fee-for-service contracts with physicians, particularly specialty
                  care
                  physicians, we pay a negotiated fee for covered services. This
                  model is
                  characterized as having no financial risk for the physician. In
                  addition,
                  this model requires management oversight because our total cost
                  may
                  increase as the units of services increase or as more expensive
                  services
                  are replaced for less expensive services. We have prior authorization
                  procedures in place that are intended to make sure that certain
                  high cost
                  diagnostic and other services are medically appropriate.

Ÿ

Under
                  our capitated contracts, primary care physicians are paid a monthly
                  fee
                  for each of our members assigned to his or her practice and are
                  at risk
                  for all costs related to primary and specialty physician and emergency
                  room services. In return for this payment, these physicians provide
                  all
                  primary care and preventive services, including primary care office
                  visits
                  and EPSDT services. If these physicians also provide non-capitated
                  services to their assigned members, they may receive payment under
                  fee-for-service arrangements at Medicaid rates.

We
      work with physicians
      to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization
      information, physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical
      management programs. Our programs are also designed to help the physicians
      coordinate care outside of their offices. In addition, we are governed by state
      prompt payment policies.

We
      believe our collaborative approach with physicians gives us a competitive
      advantage in entering new markets. Our physicians serve on local committees
      that
      assist us in implementing preventive care programs, managing costs and improving
      the overall quality of care delivered to our members. This approach is designed
      to eliminate unnecessary costs, improve services to our members and simplify
      the
      administrative burdens on our providers. It has enabled us to strengthen our
      provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that,
      in
      turn, have helped to increase our membership base. The following are among
      the
      services we provide to support physicians:

Ÿ

Customized
                Utilization Reports

provide certain of our contracted physicians with information that
                enables
                them to run their practices more efficiently and focuses them on
                specific
                patient needs. For example, quarterly detail reports update physicians
                on
                their status within their risk pools. Equivalency reports provide
                physicians with financial comparisons of capitated versus fee-for-service
                arrangements.

Case
                Management Support

helps the physician coordinate specialty care and ancillary services
                for
                patients with complex conditions and direct members to appropriate
                community resources to address both their health and socio-economic
                needs.

Ÿ

Web-based
                Claims and Eligibility Resources

have been implemented in selected markets to provide physicians with
                on-line access to perform claims and eligibility inquiries.

Our
      contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to
      our
      members, including the CONNECTIONS, EPSDT case management and disease management
      programs. For example, the CONNECTIONS staff facilitates doctor/patient
      relationships by connecting members with physicians, the EPSDT programs
      encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the disease
      management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic
      disease.

Where
      appropriate, our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations
      to provide services and programs such as behavioral health, disease management,
      managed vision, nurse triage, pharmacy benefit management, and treatment
      compliance. When necessary, we also contract with third-party providers on
      a
      negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy, home healthcare, vision care,
      diagnostic laboratory tests, x-ray examinations, ambulance services and durable
      medical equipment. Additionally, we contract with dental vendors in markets
      where routine dental care is a covered benefit.

Quality
      Management

Our
      medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that
      have the greatest impact on our members. We employ strategies, including disease
      management and complex case management, that are adjusted for implementation
      in
      our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local
      physician leaders. This process promotes physician participation and support,
      both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement
      program.

We
      have
      implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality
      management activities. Information is drawn from our data warehouse, clinical
      databases and our membership and claims processing system, to identify
      opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions
      implemented to achieve those improvements. Some examples of these intervention
      programs include:

Ÿ

a
                prenatal case management program aimed at helping women with high-risk
                pregnancies deliver full-term, healthy infants;

Ÿ

a
                program to reduce the number of inappropriate emergency room visits;
                and

Ÿ

a
                disease management program to improve the ability of those with asthma
                and
                their families to control their disease and thereby reduce the need
                for
                emergency room visits and hospitalizations.

We
      provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse. State and Health
      Employer Data and Information Set, or HEDIS, reporting constitutes the core
      of
      the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts.
      This
      reporting is monitored by Plan Quality Improvement Committees and our corporate
      medical management team.

In
      an
      effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks, we undertake to verify
      the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are
      supported by the National Committee for Quality Assurance.

Information
      Technology

The
      ability to access data and translate it into meaningful information is essential
      to operating across a multi-state service area in a cost-effective manner.
      Our
      centralized information systems which are located in St. Louis, Missouri,
      support our core processing functions under a set of integrated databases and
      are designed to be both replicable and scalable to accommodate organic
      growth and growth from acquisitions. We believe we have the ability to leverage
      the platform we have developed for our existing states for configuration into
      new states or health plan acquisitions.

Our
      integrated approach helps to assure that consistent sources of claim and member
      information are provided across all of our health plans. Our membership and
      claims processing system is capable of expanding to support additional members
      in an efficient manner as needed.

We
      have a
      disaster recovery and business resumption plan developed and implemented in
      conjunction with a third party. This plan allows us complete access to the
      business resumption centers and hot-site facilities provided by the plan.

SPECIALTY
      SERVICES

Our
        Specialty
        Services segment is a key component of our healthcare enterprise and complements
        our core Medicaid Managed Care business. The specialty services diversify
        our
        revenue stream, provide higher quality health outcomes to our membership
        and
        others, and assist in controlling costs. Our specialty services are provided
        primarily through the following interrelated businesses:

Ÿ

                  to
                  determine the best course of treatment for a given diagnosis and
                  helps
                  ensure members and their providers are aware of the full array
                  of services
                  available. Our networks feature a range of services so that patients
                  can
                  be treated at an appropriate level of care. We also run school-based
                  programs in Arizona that focus on students with special needs.
                  We acquired

                  respiratory disease management and cardiac disease management.
                  Through
                  their specialization in respiratory management, AirLogix uses self-care
                  therapies, in-home interaction and informatics processes to deliver
                  highly
                  effective clinical results, enhanced patient-provider satisfaction
                  and
                  greater cost reductions in respiratory management. We acquired
                  AirLogix in
                  July 2005. Through a people-centered, multi-disciplinary and integrated
                  approach, Cardium uses primary health coaches, customized care
                  plans, and
                  disease-specific education to assist patients in achieving their
                  health
                  goals and deliver enhanced patient-provider satisfaction and greater
                  cost
                  reductions in chronic disease management. We acquired Cardium in
                  May
                  2006.

                  health plans through ongoing participation with community groups
                  to
                  address situations that might be barriers to quality care and independent
                  living. Bridgeway commenced operations in October

CORPORATE
        COMPLIANCE

Our
      Corporate Ethics and Compliance Program was first established in 1998 and
      provides methods by which we further enhance operations, safeguard against
      fraud
      and abuse, improve access to quality care and helps assure that our values
      are
      reflected in everything we do.

The
      two
      primary standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare
      industry are measured are the 1991 Federal Organizational Sentencing Guidelines
      and the “Compliance Program Guidance” series issued by the Office of the
      Inspector General, or OIG, of the Department of Health and Human
      Services.


Table
            of Contents

Our
      program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the Sentencing
      Guidelines and the OIG guidance. These key components are:

Ÿ

written
                standards of conduct;

Ÿ

designation
                of a corporate compliance officer and compliance committee;

Ÿ

effective
                training and education;

Ÿ

effective
                lines for reporting and communication;

Ÿ

enforcement
                of standards through disciplinary guidelines and actions;

Ÿ

internal
                monitoring and auditing; and

Ÿ

prompt
                response to detected offenses and development of corrective action
                plans.

Our
      internal Corporate Compliance website, accessible by all employees, contains
      our
      Business Ethics and Conduct Policy, our Mission, Values and Philosophies and
      Compliance Programs, a company-wide policy and procedure database and our
      toll-free hotline to allow employees or other persons to report suspected
      incidents of fraud, abuse or other violations. The audit committee and the
      board
      of directors review a full compliance report, including an incident log, on
      a
      quarterly basis.

COMPETITION

We
      continue to face varying and increasing levels of competition as we expand
      in
      our existing service areas or enter new markets as federal regulations require
      at least two competitors in each service area. Healthcare reform proposals
      may
      cause a number of commercial managed care organizations to decide to enter
      or
      exit the Medicaid market.

In
      our
      business, our principal competitors for state contracts, members and providers
      consist of the following types of organizations:

Ÿ

Medicaid
                Managed Care Organizations

focus solely on providing healthcare services to Medicaid recipients.
                Many
                of these operate in one city or state and are owned by providers,
                primarily hospitals.

Ÿ

National
                and Regional Commercial Managed Care Organizations

have Medicaid members in addition to members in private commercial
                plans.
                Some of these organizations offer a range of specialty services including
                pharmacy benefits management, behavioral health management, disease
                management, and nurse triage call support
                centers.

Ÿ

Primary
                Care Case Management Programs

are programs established by the states through contracts with primary
                care
                providers. Under these programs, physicians provide primary care
                services
                to Medicaid recipients, as well as limited medical management oversight.

We
      compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state
      contracts. In order to grant a contract, state governments consider many
      factors. These factors include quality of care, financial requirements, an
      ability to deliver services and establish provider networks and infrastructure.
      In addition, our specialty companies also compete with other providers, such
      as
      disease management companies and pharmacy benefits managers for non-governmental
      contracts.

We
      also
      compete to enroll new members and retain existing members. People who wish
      to
      enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically
      choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered, ease of access
      to services, a specific provider being part of the network and the availability
      of supplemental benefits. In certain markets, where recipients select a
      physician instead of a health plan, we are able to grow our membership by adding
      new physicians to our provider base.

We
      also
      compete with other managed care organizations to enter into contracts with
      physicians, physician groups and other providers. We believe the factors that
      providers consider in deciding whether to contract with us include existing
      and
      potential member volume, reimbursement rates, medical management programs,
      speed
      of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities. See “Risk Factors -
      Competition May Limit Our Ability to Increase Penetration of the Markets That
      We
      Serve.”

FINANCIAL
      INFORMATION

All
      of
      our revenue is derived from operations within the United States and its
      territories. Our managed care subsidiaries in Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Texas
      and Wisconsin had revenues from their respective state governments that each
      exceeded 10% of our consolidated total revenues in 2006. Other financial
      information about our segments is found in Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated
      Financial Statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
      Condition and Results of Operations” included elsewhere in this Form
      10-K.

REGULATION

Our
      healthcare and specialty operations are regulated at both state and federal
      levels. Government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and
      services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to
      jurisdiction. Regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations
      and interpret and enforce laws and rules. Changes in applicable laws and rules
      also may occur periodically.

Our
      regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance
      organizations and/or insurance companies in their respective states. In each
      of
      the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are regulated by the relevant health,
      insurance and/or human services departments that oversee the activities of
      managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to
      Medicaid enrollees.

The
      process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization
      is
      complex and requires demonstration to the regulators of the adequacy of the
      health plan’s organizational structure, financial resources, utilization review,
      quality assurance programs, complaint procedures, provider network adequacy
      and
      procedures for covering emergency medical conditions. Under both state managed
      care organization statutes and state insurance laws, our health plan
      subsidiaries must comply with minimum statutory capital requirements and other
      financial requirements, such as deposit and reserve requirements. Insurance
      regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other
      managed care organizations’ businesses and the payment of dividends, as well as
      notice for loans or the transfer of funds. Our subsidiaries are also subject
      to
      periodic reporting requirements. In addition, each health plan must meet
      criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before
      implementing operational changes, including the development of new product
      offerings and, in some states, the expansion of service areas.

States
        have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results
        of
        operations. These regulations in certain states include:

Ÿ

premium
                  and maintenance taxes;

State
      Contracts

In
      order
      to be a Medicaid Managed Care organization in each of the states in which we
      operate, we must operate under a contract with the state’s Medicaid agency.
      States generally use either a formal proposal process, reviewing a number of
      bidders, or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for
      entry to the program. We receive monthly payments based on specified capitation
      rates determined on an actuarial basis. These rates differ by membership
      category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted
      by
      each state.

Our
        contracts with the states and regulatory provisions applicable to us generally
        set forth the requirements for operating in the Medicaid sector, including
        provisions relating to:

A
      health
      plan’s compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state
      regulators and by CMS. A health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive
      quality assurance evaluations by a third-party reviewing organization and
      generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the
      health plan. A health plan must also submit reports to various regulatory
      agencies, including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and
      utilization reports.

HIPAA

In
      1996,
      Congress enacted the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
      1996, or HIPAA. The Act is designed to improve the portability and continuity
      of
      health insurance coverage and simplify the administration of health insurance
      claims. Among the main requirements of HIPAA are standards for the processing
      of
      health insurance claims and related transactions.

The
      regulation’s requirements apply to transactions conducted using “electronic
      media.” Since “electronic media” is defined broadly to include “transmissions
      that are physically moved from one location to another using magnetic tape,
      disk
      or compact disk media,” many communications are considered to be electronically
      transmitted. Under the HIPAA regulations, health plans are required to have
      the
      capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized
      electronic format. Penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these
      requirements.

HIPAA
      regulations also protect the privacy of medical records and other personal
      health information maintained and used by healthcare providers, health plans
      and
      healthcare clearinghouses. We have implemented processes, policies and
      procedures to comply with the HIPAA privacy regulations, including education
      and
      training for employees. In addition, the corporate privacy officer and health
      plan privacy officials serve as resources to employees to address any questions
      or concerns they may have. Among numerous other requirements, the privacy
      regulations:

Ÿ

limit
                certain uses and disclosures of private health information, and require
                patient authorizations for such uses and disclosures of private health
                information;

Ÿ

guarantee
                patients rights to access their medical records and to know who else
                has
                accessed them;

Ÿ

limit
                most disclosure of health information to the minimum needed for the
                intended purpose;

Ÿ

establish
                procedures to ensure the protection of private health
                information;

Ÿ

authorize
                access to records by researchers and others;
                and

Ÿ

impose
                criminal and civil sanctions for improper uses or disclosures of
                health
                information.

The
      preemption provisions of HIPAA provide that the federal standards will not
      preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal
      requirements. In addition, the Secretary of HHS may grant

exceptions

allowing
      state laws to prevail if one or more of a number of conditions are met,
      including but not limited to the following:

Ÿ

the
                state law is necessary to prevent fraud and abuse related to the
                provision
                of and payment for healthcare;

Ÿ

the
                state law is necessary to ensure appropriate state regulation of
                insurance
                and health plans;

Ÿ

the
                state law is necessary for state reporting on healthcare delivery
                or
                costs; or

Ÿ

the
                state law addresses controlled
                substances.

In
      2003,
      HHS published final regulations relating to the security of electronic
      individually identifiable health information. Compliance was required by April
      2005. These rules require healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare
      clearinghouses to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards
      to
      ensure the privacy and confidentiality of such information when it is
      electronically stored, maintained or transmitted through such

devices
      as user authentication mechanisms and system activity audits. In addition,
      numerous states have adopted personal data security laws that provide for,
      among
      other things, private rights of action for breaches of data security and
      mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained
      without authorization.

Patients’
      Rights Legislation

The
      United States Senate and House of Representatives passed different versions
      of
      patients’ rights legislation in June and August 2001, respectively. Both
      versions included provisions that specifically apply protections to participants
      in federal healthcare programs, including Medicaid beneficiaries. Although
      no
      such federal legislation has been enacted, patients’ rights legislation is
      frequently proposed in Congress. If enacted, this type of legislation could
      expand our potential exposure to lawsuits and increase our regulatory compliance
      costs. Depending on the final form of any patients’ rights legislation, such
      legislation could, among other things, expose us to liability for economic
      and
      punitive damages for making determinations that deny benefits or delay
      beneficiaries’ receipt of benefits as a result of our medical necessity or other
      coverage determinations. We cannot predict when or whether patients’ rights
      legislation will be enacted into law or, if enacted, what final form such
      legislation might take.

Other
      Fraud and Abuse Laws

Investigating
      and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse became a top priority for law
      enforcement entities in the last decade. The focus of these efforts has been
      directed at participants in public government healthcare programs such as
      Medicaid. The laws and regulations relating to Medicaid fraud and abuse and
      the
      contractual requirements applicable to health plans participating in these
      programs are complex and changing and may require substantial
      resources.

EMPLOYEES

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we had approximately 2,600 employees. Our employees are
      not
      represented by a union. We believe our relationships with our employees are
      good.

Risk
      Factors

You
      should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment
      decision. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of
      these risks, in which case you could lose all or part of your investment. You
      should also refer to the other information in this filing, including our
      consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties
      described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our
      Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that
      we
      currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our
      Company.

Risks
      Related to Being a Regulated Entity

Reduction
      in Medicaid, SCHIP and SSI funding could substantially reduce
      our

profitability.

Most
      of
      our revenues come from Medicaid, SCHIP and SSI premiums. The base premium rate
      paid by each state differs, depending on a combination of factors such as
      defined upper payment limits, a member’s health status, age, gender, county or
      region, benefit mix and member eligibility categories. Future levels of
      Medicaid, SCHIP and SSI funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing
      government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected
      by
      state and federal budgetary constraints. Additionally, state and federal
      entities may make changes to the design of their Medicaid programs resulting
      in
      the cancellation or modification of these programs.

For
      example, in August 2006, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or
      CMS, published an interim final rule regarding the estimation and recovery
      of
      improper payments made under Medicaid and SCHIP. This rule requires a CMS
      contractor to sample selected states each year to estimate improper payments
      in
      Medicaid and SCHIP and create national and state specific error rates. States
      must provide information to measure improper payments in Medicaid managed care,
      as well as in fee-for-service Medicaid. Each state will be selected for review
      once every three years for each program. States are required to repay to CMS
      the
      federal share of any overpayments identified.

On
      February 8, 2006, President Bush signed the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 to
      reduce the size of the federal deficit. The Act reduces federal spending by
      nearly $40 billion over the next 5 years, including a $5 billion reduction
      in
      Medicaid. The Act reduces spending by cutting Medicaid payments for prescription
      drugs and gives states new power to reduce or reconfigure benefits. This law
      may
      also lead to lower Medicaid reimbursements in some states. The Bush
      administration’s budget proposal also seeks to further reduce total federal
      funding for the Medicaid program by $14 billion over the next five years. In
      addition, the Bush administration has proposed freezing federal spending for
      SCHIP at the levels set in 2007 for ten years. States also periodically consider
      reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for Medicaid, SCHIP
      and
      SSI. In recent years, the majority of states have implemented measures to
      restrict Medicaid, SCHIP and SSI costs and eligibility.

Changes
      to Medicaid, SCHIP and SSI programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled
      in or eligible for these programs, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment
      levels, or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under those programs.
      We believe that reductions in Medicaid, SCHIP and SSI payments could
      substantially reduce our profitability. Further, our contracts with the states
      are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the
      event of unavailability of state funds.

If
      SCHIP is not reauthorized, our business could suffer.

The
      authorization for SCHIP expires at the end of federal fiscal year 2007. We
      cannot guarantee that federal funding of SCHIP will be reauthorized and if
      it
      is, what changes might be made to the program following reauthorization. If
      SCHIP is not reauthorized, by September 30, 2007, it will continue to be funded
      at the current 2006 federal funding levels. We expect Congress to begin the
      reauthorization process in early February, 2007. At this time, it is not clear
      whether the relevant congressional committees of jurisdiction over this program
      will be able to reach agreement on an SCHIP reauthorization package that could
      cost $50 billion in additional federal spending.

Several
      states face a shortfall in federal SCHIP funding, which could have an impact
      on
      our business.

States
      receive matching funds from the federal government to pay for their SCHIP
      programs, which matching funds have a per state annual cap. It is predicted
      that
      two states in which we have SCHIP contracts, Georgia and New Jersey, will spend
      all of their federal allocation for fiscal year 2007 prior to the end of the
      year. In December 2006, Congress passed legislation that will redistribute
      funds
      that were not spent in prior years to the states that are facing these
      shortfalls. The Congressional Research Service estimates that this legislation
      will delay the shortfall to the first part of May 2007. We cannot predict
      whether the U.S. Congress will appropriate additional funds or take other
      legislative action to cover the shortfalls. Further, we cannot predict if states
      will provide additional funding to cover the federal shortfall. Our contracts
      with Georgia and New Jersey expire at the end of June and we cannot guarantee
      that they will be renewed and if renewed, whether the terms will be modified.
      If
      either of the contracts is not renewed or if either state delays paying us
      or
      fails to pay the full amount owed due to the shortfall, our business could
      suffer.

If
      our Medicaid and SCHIP contracts are terminated or are not renewed, our
      business

will
      suffer.

We
      provide managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving
      benefits under federal assistance programs, including Medicaid, SCHIP and SSI.
      We provide those healthcare services under contracts with regulatory entities
      in
      the areas in which we operate. Our contracts with various states are generally
      intended to run for one or two years and may be extended for one or two
      additional years if the state or its agent elects to do so. Our current
      contracts are set to expire between June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2011. When
      our contracts expire, they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare
      providers. There is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended.
      For example, on August 25, 2006, we received notification from the Kansas Health
      Policy Authority that FirstGuard Health Plan Kansas, Inc.’s contract with the
      state would not be renewed or extended, and as a result, our contract ended
      on
      December 31, 2006. Further, our contracts with the states are subject to
      cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of
      unavailability of state funds. Our contracts could also be terminated if we
      fail
      to perform in accordance with the standards set by state regulatory agencies.
      For example, the Indiana contract under which we operate can be terminated
      by
      the State without cause. If any of our contracts are terminated, not renewed,
      or
      renewed on less favorable terms, our business will suffer, and our operating
      results may be materially affected.

Changes
      in government regulations designed to protect the financial interests
      of

providers
      and members rather than our investors could force us to change how
      we

operate
      and could harm our business.

Our
      business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by
      the
      federal government. The applicable laws and regulations are subject to frequent
      change and generally are intended to benefit and protect the financial interests
      of health plan providers and members rather than investors. The enactment of
      new
      laws and rules or changes to existing laws and rules or the interpretation
      of
      such laws and rules could, among other things:

Ÿ

force
                us to restructure our relationships with providers within our
                network;

Ÿ

require
                us to implement additional or different programs and
                systems;

Ÿ

mandate
                minimum medical expense levels as a percentage of premium
                revenues;

Ÿ

restrict
                revenue and enrollment growth;

Ÿ

require
                us to develop plans to guard against the financial insolvency of
                our
                providers;

Ÿ

increase
                our healthcare and administrative costs;

Ÿ

impose
                additional capital and reserve requirements;
                and

Ÿ

increase
                or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by
                our
                providers.

For
      example, Congress has previously considered various forms of patient protection
      legislation commonly known as the Patients’ Bill of Rights and such legislation
      may be proposed again. We cannot predict the impact of any such legislation,
      if
      adopted, on our business.

Regulations
      may decrease the profitability of our health plans.

Certain
      states have enacted regulations which require us to maintain a minimum health
      benefits ratio, or establish limits on our profitability. Other states require
      us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive our
      full
      contractual revenue. For example, our Texas plan is required to pay a rebate
      to
      the State of Texas in the event profits exceed established levels. These
      regulatory requirements, changes in these requirements or the adoption of
      similar requirements by our other regulators may limit our ability to increase
      our overall profits as a percentage of revenues. Certain states, including
      but
      not limited to Georgia, Indiana, New Jersey and Texas have implemented
      prompt-payment laws and are enforcing penalty provisions for failure to pay
      claims in a timely manner. Failure to meet these requirements can result in
      financial fines and penalties. In addition, states may attempt to reduce their
      contract premium rates if regulators perceive our health benefits ratio as
      too
      low. Any of these regulatory actions could harm our operating
      results.


Table
            of Contents

We
                face periodic reviews, audits and investigations under our contracts
                with
                state

government
                agencies, and these audits could 
                have adverse findings, which may

negatively impact
                our business.

We
      contract with various state governmental agencies to provide managed health
      care
      services. Pursuant to these contracts, we are subject to various reviews, audits
      and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable
      laws and regulations. Any adverse review, audit or investigation could result
      in:

Ÿ

refunding
                of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our
                contracts;

Ÿ

imposition
                of fines, penalties and other sanctions on
                us;

Ÿ

loss
                of our right to participate in various markets;

Ÿ

increased
                difficulty in selling our products and services;
                and

Ÿ

loss
                of one or more of our licenses.

Failure
      to comply with government regulations could subject us to civil and
      criminal

penalties.

Federal
      and state governments have enacted fraud and abuse laws and other laws to
      protect patients’ privacy and access to healthcare. In some states, we may be
      subject to regulation by more than one governmental authority, which may impose
      overlapping or inconsistent regulations. Violation of these and other laws
      or
      regulations governing our operations or the operations of our providers could
      result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, the cancellation of
      our
      contracts to provide services, the suspension or revocation of our licenses
      or
      our exclusion from participating in the Medicaid, SCHIP and SSI programs. If
      we
      were to become subject to these penalties or exclusions as the result of our
      actions or omissions or our inability to monitor the compliance of our
      providers, it would negatively affect our ability to operate our
      business.

The
      Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, broadened
      the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies. HIPAA
      created civil penalties for, among other things, billing for medically
      unnecessary goods or services. HIPAA established new enforcement mechanisms
      to
      combat fraud and abuse, including civil and, in some instances, criminal
      penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy,
      security and electronic transmission of most individually identifiable health
      information. It is possible that Congress may enact additional legislation
      in
      the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under
      HIPAA, which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations
      of
      the privacy rules.

We
      may incur significant costs as a result of compliance with government
      regulations,

and
      our management will be required to devote time to
      compliance.

Many
      aspects of our business are affected by government laws and regulations. The
      issuance of new regulations, or judicial or regulatory guidance regarding
      existing regulations, could require changes to many of the procedures we
      currently use to conduct our business, which may lead to additional costs that
      we have not yet identified. We do not know whether, or the extent to which,
      we
      will be able to recover from the states our costs of complying with these new
      regulations. The costs of any such future compliance efforts could have a
      material adverse effect on our business.

In
      addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented
      by
      the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, have imposed various
      requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate
      governance practices. Our management and other personnel will continue to devote
      time to these new compliance initiatives.

The
      Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective
      internal control over financial reporting. In particular, we must perform system
      and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial
      reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal
      controls over our financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the
      Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent
      registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal
      controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses.
      Our
      compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting
      expense and expend significant management efforts. Moreover, if we are not
      able
      to comply with the requirements of Section 404, or if we or our independent
      registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal
      control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses,
      the
      market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions
      or
      investigations by the NYSE, SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would
      require additional financial and management resources.

Changes
      in healthcare law and benefits may reduce our
      profitability.

Numerous
      proposals relating to changes in healthcare law have been introduced, some
      of
      which have been passed by Congress and the states in which we operate or may
      operate in the future. Changes in applicable laws and regulations are
      continually being


Table
            of Contents

considered,
      and interpretations of existing laws and rules may also change from time to
      time. We are unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or what effect
      any particular change may have on our business. For example, these changes
      could
      reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll in Medicaid, reduce
      the reimbursement or payment levels for medical services or reduce benefits
      included in Medicaid coverage. We are also unable to predict whether new laws
      or
      proposals will favor or hinder the growth of managed healthcare in general.
      Legislation or regulations that require us to change our current manner of
      operation, benefits provided or our contract arrangements may seriously harm
      our
      operations and financial results.

If
      a state fails to renew a required federal waiver for mandated Medicaid
      enrollment

into
      managed care or such application is denied, our membership in that state
      will

likely
      decrease.

States
      may administer Medicaid managed care programs pursuant to demonstration programs
      or required waivers of federal Medicaid standards. Waivers and demonstration
      programs are generally approved for two-year periods and can be renewed on
      an
      ongoing basis if the state applies. We have no control over this renewal
      process. If a state does not renew such a waiver or demonstration program or
      the
      Federal government denies a state’s application for renewal, membership in our
      health plan in the state could decrease and our business could
      suffer.

Changes
      in federal funding mechanisms may reduce our
      profitability.

The
      Bush
      administration previously proposed a major long-term change in the way Medicaid
      and SCHIP are funded. The proposal, if adopted, would allow states to elect
      to
      receive, instead of federal matching funds, combined Medicaid-SCHIP “allotments”
for acute and long-term healthcare for low-income, uninsured persons.
      Participating states would be given flexibility in designing their own health
      insurance programs, subject to federally-mandated minimum coverage requirements.
      It is uncertain whether this proposal will be enacted. Accordingly, it is
      unknown whether or how many states might elect to participate or how their
      participation may affect the net amount of funding available for Medicaid and
      SCHIP programs. If such a proposal is adopted and decreases the number of
      persons enrolled in Medicaid or SCHIP in the states in which we operate or
      reduces the volume of healthcare services provided, our growth, operations
      and
      financial performance could be adversely affected.

In
      April
      2004, the Bush administration adopted a policy that seeks to reduce states’ use
      of intergovernmental transfers for the states’ share of Medicaid program
      funding. By restricting the use of intergovernmental transfers, this policy,
      if
      continued, may restrict some states’ funding for Medicaid, which could adversely
      affect our growth, operations and financial performance.

Recent
      legislative changes in the Medicare program may also affect our business. For
      example, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act
      of
      2003 revised cost-sharing requirements for some beneficiaries and requires
      states to reimburse the federal Medicare program for costs of prescription
      drug
      coverage provided to beneficiaries who are enrolled simultaneously in both
      the
      Medicaid and Medicare programs. The Bush administration has also proposed to
      further reduce total federal funding for the Medicaid program by
      $14 billion over the next five years. These changes may reduce the
      availability of funding for some states’ Medicaid programs, which could
      adversely affect our growth, operations and financial performance. In addition,
      the new Medicare prescription drug benefit is interrupting the distribution
      of
      prescription drugs to many beneficiaries simultaneously enrolled in both
      Medicaid and Medicare, prompting several states to pay for prescription drugs
      on
      an unbudgeted, emergency basis without any assurance of receiving reimbursement
      from the federal Medicaid program. These expenses may cause some states to
      divert funds originally intended for other Medicaid services which could
      adversely affect our growth, operations and financial performance.

If
      state regulatory agencies require a statutory capital level higher than the
      state

regulations,
      we may be required to make additional capital
      contributions.

Our
      operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries, which include
      health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, and managed care organizations,
      or
      MCOs. HMOs and MCOs are subject to state regulations that, among other things,
      require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined
      by
      each state. Additionally, state regulatory agencies may require, at their
      discretion, individual HMOs to maintain statutory capital levels higher than
      the
      state regulations. If this were to occur to one of our subsidiaries, we may
      be
      required to make additional capital contributions to the affected subsidiary.
      Any additional capital contribution made to one of the affected subsidiaries
      could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to
      grow.

If
      we are unable to participate in SCHIP programs, our growth rate may be
      limited.

SCHIP
      is
      a federal initiative designed to provide coverage for low-income children not
      otherwise covered by Medicaid or other insurance programs. The programs vary
      significantly from state to state. Participation in SCHIP programs is an
      important part of our growth strategy. If states do not allow us to participate
      or if we fail to win bids to participate, our growth strategy may be materially
      and adversely affected.


Table
            of Contents

If
      state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by
      our

subsidiaries
      to us, we may not have sufficient funds to implement our
      business

strategy.

We
      principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries. If funds normally
      available to us become limited in the future, we may need to rely on dividends
      and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations. These
      subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends
      and
      distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of, or notification
      to, state regulators. If these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries’ request
      to pay dividends to us, the funds available to us would be limited, which could
      harm our ability to implement our business strategy.

Risks
      Related to Our Business

Ineffectiveness
      of state-operated systems and subcontractors could adversely
      affect

our
      business.

Our
      health plans rely on other state-operated systems or sub-contractors to qualify,
      solicit, educate and assign eligible clients into the health plans. The
      effectiveness of these state operations and sub-contractors can have a material
      effect on a health plan’s enrollment in a particular month or over an extended
      period. When a state implements new programs to determine eligibility, new
      processes to assign or enroll eligible clients into health plans, or chooses
      new
      contractors, there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on
      the
      overall number of members assigned into the health plans.

Failure
      to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect
      our

reported
      results.

Our
      medical expenses include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet
      reported, or IBNR. We estimate our IBNR medical expenses monthly based on a
      number of factors. Adjustments, if necessary, are made to medical expenses
      in
      the period during which the actual claim costs are ultimately determined or
      when
      criteria used to estimate IBNR change. We cannot be sure that our IBNR estimates
      are adequate or that adjustments to those estimates will not harm our results
      of
      operations. For example, in the three months ended June 30, 2006 we adjusted
      our
      IBNR by $9.7 million for adverse medical cost development from the first quarter
      of 2006. In addition, when we commence operations in a new state or region,
      we
      have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liabilities.
      For example, we commenced operations in the Atlanta and Central regions of
      Georgia on June 1, 2006 and the Southwest region of Georgia on September 1,
      and have based our estimates on state provided historical actuarial data and
      limited 2006 actual incurred and received data. From time to time in the past,
      our actual results have varied from our estimates, particularly in times of
      significant changes in the number of our members. Our failure to estimate IBNR
      accurately may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions,
      further harming our results.

Receipt
      of inadequate or significantly delayed premiums would negatively affect
      our

revenues
      and profitability.

Our
      premium revenues consist of fixed monthly payments per member and supplemental
      payments for other services such as maternity deliveries. These premiums are
      fixed by contract, and we are obligated during the contract periods to provide
      healthcare services as established by the state governments. We use a large
      portion of our revenues to pay the costs of healthcare services delivered to
      our
      members. If premiums do not increase when expenses related to medical services
      rise, our earnings will be affected negatively. In addition, our actual medical
      services costs may exceed our estimates, which would cause our health benefits
      ratio, or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium
      revenue, to increase and our profits to decline. In addition, it is possible
      for
      a state to increase the rates payable to the hospitals without granting a
      corresponding increase in premiums to us. If this were to occur in one or more
      of the states in which we operate, our profitability would be harmed. In
      addition, if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums to offset
      previously incurred health benefits costs, our earnings could be negatively
      impacted.

Failure
      to effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs
      would

reduce
      our profitability.

Our
      profitability depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to predict and
      effectively manage expenses related to health benefits. We have less control
      over the costs related to medical services than we do over our general and
      administrative expenses. Because of the narrow margins of our health plan
      business, relatively small changes in our health benefits ratio can create
      significant changes in our financial results. Changes in healthcare regulations
      and practices, the level of use of healthcare services, hospital costs,
      pharmaceutical costs, major epidemics, new medical technologies and other
      external factors, including general economic conditions such as inflation
      levels, are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to predict and
      effectively control the costs of providing health benefits. We may not be able
      to manage costs effectively in the future. If our costs related to health
      benefits increase, our profits could be reduced or we may not remain
      profitable.

Difficulties
      in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect
      our

business.

Historically,
      the acquisition of Medicaid and specialty services businesses, contract rights
      and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas
      and
      in new markets has accounted for a significant amount of our growth. Many of
      the
      other potential purchasers have greater financial resources than we have. In
      addition, many of the sellers are interested either in (a) selling, along
      with their Medicaid assets, other assets in which we do not have an interest
      or
      (b) selling their companies, including their liabilities, as opposed to the
      assets of their ongoing businesses.


Table
            of Contents

We
      generally are required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state
      agencies when making acquisitions. In the case of an acquisition of a business
      located in a state in which we do not currently operate, we would be required
      to
      obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state. In addition, even if
      we
      already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business, we would be
      required to obtain additional regulatory approval if the acquisition would
      result in our operating in an area of the state in which we did not operate
      previously, and we could be required to renegotiate provider contracts of the
      acquired business. We cannot assure you that we would be able to comply with
      these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner, or at
      all.
      In deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition, state regulators may
      consider a number of factors outside our control, including giving preference
      to
      competing offers made by locally owned entities or by not-for-profit
      entities.

We
      also
      may be unable to obtain sufficient additional capital resources for future
      acquisitions. If we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy,
      our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be
      harmed.

Our
      acquisitions may increase costs ,increase liabilities, or create disruptions
      in
      our

business.

We
      pursue
      acquisitions of other companies or businesses from time to time. Although we
      review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire, even an
      in-depth review of records may not reveal existing or potential problems or
      permit us to become familiar enough with a business to assess fully its
      capabilities and deficiencies. As a result, we may assume unanticipated
      liabilities or adverse operating conditions, or an acquisition may not perform
      as well as expected. We face the risk that the returns on acquisitions will
      not
      support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire such businesses,
      or
      the capital expenditures needed to develop such businesses. We also face the
      risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions into our existing
      operations effectively without substantial expense, delay or other operational
      or financial problems. Integration may be hindered by, among other things,
      differing procedures, including internal controls, business practices and
      technology systems. We may need to divert more management resources to
      integration than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue
      other profitable activities.

In
      addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating
      acquisitions, we will also be required to integrate and consolidate any acquired
      business or assets with our existing operations. This may include the
      integration of:

Ÿ

additional
                personnel who are not familiar with our operations and corporate
                culture;

Ÿ

provider
                networks that may operate on different terms than our existing
                networks;

Ÿ

existing
                members, who may decide to switch to another healthcare plan;
                and

Ÿ

disparate
                administrative, accounting and finance, and information
                systems.

Accordingly,
      we may be unable to identify, consummate and integrate future acquisitions
      successfully or operate acquired businesses profitably.

If
      competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services
      from

us,
      we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying
      our

business
      lines.

We
      are
      seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our Medicaid
      business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on
      Medicaid risk reimbursement. In order to diversify our business, we must succeed
      in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed
      care plans, but to programs operated by third-parties. Some of these third-party
      programs may compete with us in some markets, and they therefore may be
      unwilling to purchase specialty services from us. In any event, the offering
      of
      these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly
      from
      the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our Medicaid programs.
      Our
      inability to market specialty services to other programs may impair our ability
      to execute our business strategy.

Failure
      to achieve timely profitability in any business would negatively affect
      our

results
      of operations.

Start-up
      costs associated with a new business can be substantial. For example, in order
      to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions, we must first
      establish a provider network, have systems in place and demonstrate our ability
      to obtain a state contract and process claims. If we were unsuccessful in
      obtaining the necessary license, winning the bid to provide service or
      attracting members in numbers sufficient to cover our costs, any new business
      of
      ours would fail. We also could be obligated by the state to continue to provide
      services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing
      costs or recover start-up costs. The expenses associated with starting up a
      new
      business could have a significant impact on our results of operations if we
      are
      unable to achieve profitable operations in a timely fashion.


Table
            of Contents

We
      derive a majority of
      our premium revenues from operations in a small number
      of

states,
      and our operating results would be materially affected by a decrease
      in

premium

revenues
      or profitability in any one of those states.

Operations
      in Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Texas and Wisconsin have accounted for most of
      our
      premium revenues to date. If we were unable to continue to operate in each
      of
      those states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states
      were significantly curtailed, our revenues could decrease materially. Our
      reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue
      and
      profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative
      or
      other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions, economic conditions
      and
      similar factors in those states. For example, our Medicaid contract with Kansas
      terminated December 31, 2006. Our inability to continue to operate in any of
      the
      states in which we operate would harm our business.

Competition
      may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that
      we

serve.

We
      compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider
      network, benefits provided and quality of service. We compete with numerous
      types of competitors, including other health plans and traditional state
      Medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided. Subject to
      limited exceptions by federally approved state applications, the federal
      government requires that there be choices for Medicaid recipients among managed
      care programs. Voluntary programs and mandated competition may limit our ability
      to increase our market share.

Some
      of
      the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other
      resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do. In addition,
      significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care
      industry, as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us, such as the
      hospital, physician, pharmaceutical, medical device and health information
      systems businesses. To the extent that competition intensifies in any market
      that we serve, our ability to retain or increase members and providers, or
      maintain or increase our revenue growth, pricing flexibility and control over
      medical cost trends may be adversely affected.

In
      addition, in order to increase our membership in the markets we currently serve,
      we believe that we must continue to develop and implement community-specific
      products, alliances with key providers and localized outreach and educational
      programs. If we are unable to develop and implement these initiatives, or if
      our
      competitors are more successful than we are in doing so, we may not be able
      to
      further penetrate our existing markets.

If
      we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks,
      our

profitability
      may be harmed.

Our
      profitability depends, in large part, upon our ability to contract favorably
      with hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers. Our provider
      arrangements with our primary care physicians, specialists and hospitals
      generally may be cancelled by either party without cause upon 90 to
      120 days prior written notice. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
      continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts enabling
      us
      to service our members profitably.

From
      time
      to time providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate
      noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us. Even if
      these allegations represent attempts to avoid or renegotiate contractual terms
      that have become economically disadvantageous to the providers, it is possible
      that in the future a provider may pursue such a claim successfully. In addition,
      we are aware that other managed care organizations have been subject to class
      action suits by physicians with respect to claim payment procedures, and we
      may
      be subject to similar claims. Regardless of whether any claims brought against
      us are successful or have merit, they will still be time-consuming and costly
      and could distract our management’s attention. As a result, we may incur
      significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business
      effectively.

We
      will
      be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new
      markets. We may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets
      on a timely basis or under favorable terms. If we are unable to retain our
      current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on
      favorable terms, our profitability will be harmed.

We
      may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.

We
      are
      highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to
      operate and expand our business. If we lose one or more members of our senior
      management team, including our chief executive officer, Michael Neidorff, who
      has been instrumental in developing our business strategy and forging our
      business relationships, our business and operating results could be harmed.
      Our
      ability to replace any departed members of our senior management or other key
      employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because
      of
      the limited number of individuals in the Medicaid managed care and specialty
      services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate
      and successfully expand a business such as ours. Competition to hire from this
      limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate
      these personnel.

Negative
      publicity regarding the managed care industry may harm our business
      and

operating
      results.

The
      managed care industry has received negative publicity. This publicity has led
      to
      increased legislation, regulation, review of industry practices and private
      litigation in the commercial sector. These factors may adversely affect our
      ability to market our services,


Table
            of Contents

require
      us to change our services, and increase the regulatory burdens under which
      we
      operate. Any of these factors may increase the costs of doing business and
      adversely affect our operating results.

Claims
      relating to medical malpractice could cause us to incur significant
      expenses.

Our
      providers and employees involved in medical care decisions may be subject to
      medical malpractice claims. In addition, some states, including Texas, have
      adopted legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable
      for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations. Claims
      of
      this nature, if successful, could result in substantial damage awards against
      us
      and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance
      coverage. Therefore, successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against
      us,
      our providers or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition
      and profitability. Even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or
      without merit, they would still be time-consuming and costly and could distract
      our management’s attention. As a result, we may incur significant expenses and
      may be unable to operate our business effectively.

Loss
      of providers due to increased insurance costs could adversely affect
      our

business.

Our
      providers routinely purchase insurance to help protect themselves against
      medical malpractice claims. In recent years, the costs of maintaining
      commercially reasonable levels of such insurance have increased dramatically,
      and these costs are expected to increase to even greater levels in the future.
      As a result of the level of these costs, providers may decide to leave the
      practice of medicine or to limit their practice to certain areas, which may
      not
      address the needs of Medicaid participants. We rely on retaining a sufficient
      number of providers in order to maintain a certain level of service. If a
      significant number of our providers exit our provider networks or the practice
      of medicine generally, we may be unable to replace them in a timely manner,
      if
      at all, and our business could be adversely affected.

Growth
      in the number of Medicaid-eligible persons during economic downturns
      could

cause
      our operating results to suffer if state and federal
      budgets

decrease
      or do not increase.

Less
      favorable economic conditions may cause our membership to increase as more
      people become eligible to receive Medicaid benefits. During such economic
      downturns, however, state and federal budgets could decrease, causing states
      to
      attempt to cut healthcare programs, benefits and rates. We cannot predict the
      impact of changes in the United States economic environment or other economic or
      political events, including acts of terrorism or related military action, on
      federal or state funding of healthcare programs or on the size of the population
      eligible for the programs we operate. If federal funding decreases or remains
      unchanged while our membership increases, our results of operations will
      suffer.

Growth
      in the number of Medicaid-eligible persons may be countercyclical, which
      could

cause
      our operating results to suffer when general economic conditions
      are

improving.

Historically,
      the number of persons eligible to receive Medicaid benefits has increased more
      rapidly during periods of rising unemployment, corresponding to less favorable
      general economic conditions. Conversely, this number may grow more slowly or
      even decline if economic conditions improve. Therefore, improvements in general
      economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease, thereby causing
      our operating results to suffer, which could lead to decreases in our stock
      price during periods in which stock prices in general are
      increasing.

If
      we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively,
      our

operations
      could be disrupted.

Our
      operations depend significantly on effective information systems. The
      information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in,
      among other things, monitoring utilization and other cost factors, processing
      provider claims, and providing data to our regulators. Our providers also depend
      upon our information systems for membership verifications, claims status and
      other information.

Our
      information systems and applications require continual maintenance, upgrading
      and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements.
      Moreover, our acquisition activity requires frequent transitions to or from,
      and
      the integration of, various information systems. We regularly upgrade and expand
      our information systems’ capabilities. If we experience difficulties with the
      transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain
      or
      expand our information systems, we could suffer, among other things, from
      operational disruptions, loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting
      new members, regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses.
      In
      addition, our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be
      impaired as the result of events outside our control, including acts of nature,
      such as earthquakes or fires, or acts of terrorists.

We
      rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by state
      governments.

Inaccuracies
      in those lists would negatively affect our results of
      operations.

Premium
      payments to us are based upon eligibility lists produced by state governments.
      From time to time, states require us to reimburse them for premiums paid to
      us
      based on an eligibility list that a state later discovers contains individuals
      who are not in fact eligible for a government sponsored program or are eligible
      for a different premium category or a different program. Alternatively,
      a


Table
            of Contents

state
      could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment. Our
      results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of such
      reimbursement to the state if we had made related payments to providers and
      were
      unable to recoup such payments from the providers.

We
      may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate
      insurance.

We
      maintain liability insurance, subject to limits and deductibles, for claims
      that
      could result from providing or failing to provide managed care and related
      services. These claims could be substantial. We believe that our present
      insurance coverage and reserves are adequate to cover currently estimated
      exposures. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain adequate
      insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs or that we will not incur
      significant liabilities in excess of policy limits.

From
      time to time, we may become involved in costly and time-consuming litigation
      and

other
      regulatory proceedings, which require significant attention from
      our

management.

We
      are a
      defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to
      our
      business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory
      proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such
      proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on
      our
      business and operating results. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any
      litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are costly and require
      significant attention from our management. For example, we have been named
      in
      two recently-filed securities class action lawsuits that are now consolidated.
      In addition, we may in the future be the target of similar litigation. As with
      other litigation, securities litigation could be costly and time consuming,
      require significant attention from our management and could harm our business
      and operating results.

Properties

Our
      corporate office headquarters building is located in St. Louis, Missouri. The
      real estate we own surrounding this building is adequate to accommodate office
      expansion needs to support future company growth. Effective December 30, 2005,
      we executed an agreement with the City of Clayton, Missouri, a suburb of St.
      Louis, for the redevelopment of certain properties surrounding our corporate
      offices. Our primary purpose for the agreement is to accommodate office
      expansion needs for future company growth. The total scope of the project
      includes building two new office towers and street-level retail space. We plan
      to occupy a portion of those towers. The total expected cost of the project
      is
      approximately $190 million. It is not our intent to serve as developer of the
      project or finance the project construction costs. We operate claims processing
      facilities in Missouri and Montana. We lease space in the states where our
      health plans and specialty companies operate. We are required by various
      insurance and regulatory authorities to have offices in the service areas where
      we provide benefits. We believe our current facilities are adequate to meet
      our
      operational needs for the foreseeable future.

Legal
      Proceedings

As
      previously disclosed, two class action lawsuits were filed against us and
      certain of our officers and directors in the United States District Court for
      the Eastern District of Missouri, one in July 2006, or the July Class Action
      Lawsuit, and one in August 2006, or the August Class Action Lawsuit. The July
      Class Action Lawsuit and the August Class Action Lawsuit were consolidated
      on
      November 2, 2006 and an amended consolidated complaint was filed in the United
      States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri on January 17, 2007,
      which we refer to as the Consolidated Class Action Lawsuit. The Consolidated
      Class Action Lawsuit alleges, on behalf of purchasers of our common stock from
      April 25, 2006 through July 17, 2006, that we and certain of our officers and
      directors violated federal securities laws by issuing a series of materially
      false statements prior to the announcement of our fiscal 2006 second quarter
      results. According to the Consolidated Class Action Lawsuit, these allegedly
      materially false statements had the effect of artificially inflating the price
      of our common stock, which subsequently dropped after the issuance of a press
      release announcing our preliminary fiscal 2006 second quarter earnings and
      revised guidance.

We
      believe the case is without merit and have filed a motion to dismiss the
      Consolidated Class Action Lawsuit.

Additionally,
      in August 2006, a separate derivative action was filed on behalf of Centene
      Corporation against us and certain of our officers and directors in the United
      States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. Plaintiff purports
      to bring suit derivatively on behalf of the Company against our directors for
      breach of fiduciary duties, gross mismanagement and waste of corporate assets
      by
      reason of the directors’ alleged failure to correct the misstatements alleged in
      the Consolidated Class Action Lawsuits discussed above. The derivative complaint
      largely repeats the allegations in the Consolidated Class Action Lawsuits.
      Based
      on discussions that have been held with plaintiff’s counsel, it is our
      understanding that plaintiff does not intend to pursue this action until the
      Consolidated Class Action Lawsuits proceed past the dismissal stage. Although
      this matter is in its early stages and no precise prediction of its outcome
      can
      be made, we believe the case is without merit and plan to vigorously defend
      against this lawsuit.


Table
            of Contents

In
        addition, we routinely are subjected to legal proceedings in the normal course
        of business. While the ultimate resolution of such matters is uncertain,
        we do
        not expect the results of any of these matters discussed
        above individually, or in the aggregate, to have a material effect on our
        financial position or results of operations.

Issuer
      Purchases of Equity Securities

In
      November 2005, our board of directors adopted a stock repurchase program
      authorizing us to repurchase up to four million shares of common stock from
      time
      to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The
      repurchase program extends through October 31, 2007, but we reserve the right
      to
      suspend or discontinue the program at any time. During the year ended December
      31, 2006, we repurchased 397,400 shares at an average price of $19.71 and an
      aggregate cost of $7.8 million. We have established a trading plan with a
      registered broker to repurchase shares under certain market conditions. During
      the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not repurchase any shares other than
      through this publicly announced program.

OVERVIEW

We
      are a
      multi-line healthcare enterprise operating in two segments. Our Medicaid Managed
      Care segment provides Medicaid and Medicaid-related programs to organizations
      and individuals through government subsidized programs, including Medicaid,
      the
      State Children’s Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, and, Supplemental Security
      Income, or SSI. Our Specialty Services segment provides specialty services,
      including behavioral health, disease management, long-term care programs,
      managed vision, nurse triage, pharmacy benefits management and treatment
      compliance,

to
      state
      programs, healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations, as well
      as to our own subsidiaries on market-based terms.

During
      2006, we were notified by the Kansas Health Policy Authority that our Medicaid
      contract in Kansas would not be renewed beyond December 31, 2006, and
      w

e
      reached
      a definitive agreement to sell the operating assets of FirstGuard Health Plan,
      Inc., our Missouri

health
      plan. This development is discussed below under the caption “Impairment Loss.”

Our
          financial performance for 2006 is summarized as follows:

—

Year-end
                      Medicaid Managed Care membership of 1,262,200, including 138,900
                      members
                      in Kansas and Missouri.

—

Total
                      revenues of $2.3 billion.

—

Medicaid
                      and SCHIP health benefits ratio, or HBR, of 82.6%, SSI HBR
                      of 87.6%,
                      Specialty Services HBR of 82.5%.

Medicaid
                      Managed Care general and administrative, or G&A, expense ratio of
                      12.6% and Specialty Services G&A ratio of
                      16.9%.

                      or
                      $2.04 per share, charges for intangible asset impairment and costs
                      to
                      exit Kansas and Missouri.

Total
                      operating cash flows of $195.0
                      million.

Over
      the
      last two years we have experienced membership and revenue growth in our Medicaid
      Managed Care segment including membership growth of 63.3%. Excluding our
      membership in Kansas and Missouri from the total membership as of December
      31,
      2006, our membership growth was 45.4%. The following new contracts and
      acquisitions contributed to our growth:

—

Effective
                September 1, 2006, we began operating under a new contract and expanded
                operations in Texas to include 11,500 Medicaid and SCHIP members

                markets.

—

In
                Georgia, we began managing care for Medicaid and SCHIP members in

                Atlanta and Central regions effective June 1, 2006 and Southwest
                region
                effective September 1, 2006. At December 31, 2006, our membership
                in
                Georgia was 308,800.

—

We
                began operating under new contracts with the State of Ohio to manage
                care
                for 37,200 Medicaid members by entering seven new counties in the
                East
                Central market on July 1, 2006, and 17 new counties in the Northwest
                market on October 1, 2006.

                operations of this entity are included in our consolidated financial
                statements beginning June 1, 2006.

—

Effective
                May 1, 2005, we acquired the operating assets of SummaCare, Inc.
                The
                results of operations of this entity are included in our consolidated
                financial statements beginning May 1,
                2005.

We
        have
        been awarded the following new contracts to expand our operations in Ohio
        and
        Texas:

—

During
                  the second quarter of 2006, we were awarded a contract in Texas
                  to provide
                  managed care for SSI recipients in the San Antonio and Corpus Christi
                  markets. Membership operations commenced in February 2007.

—

During
                  2006, we received notification of an award in Ohio to provide managed
                  care
                  for Medicaid Aged, Blind or Disabled, or ABD, members in four regions.
                  Operations commenced in the Northeast and Southwest regions on
                  January 1
                  and February 1, 2007, respectively. Implementation is expected
                  to take
                  place in the Northwest region in March 2007 and in the East Central
                  region
                  in April 2007.

Revenues
      and Revenue Recognition

Our
      Medicaid Managed Care segment generates revenues primarily from premiums we
      receive from the states in which we operate health plans. We receive a fixed
      premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts. We generally
      receive premium payments during the month we provide services and recognize
      premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services
      to our members. Some states enact premium taxes or similar assessments,
      collectively, premium taxes, and these taxes are recorded as G&A expenses.
      Some contracts allow for additional premium related to certain supplemental
      services provided such as maternity deliveries. Revenues are recorded based
      on
      membership and eligibility data provided by the states, which may be adjusted
      by
      the states for updates to this data. These adjustments have been immaterial
      in
      relation to total revenue recorded and are reflected in the period known.

Our
      Specialty Services segment generates revenues under contracts with state
      programs, healthcare organizations, and other commercial organizations, as
      well
      as from our own subsidiaries on market-based terms. Revenues are recognized
      when
      the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period
      of services.

Premium
      and service revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue.
      For
      performance-based contracts, we do not recognize revenue subject to refund
      until
      data is sufficient to measure performance. Premium and service revenues due
      to
      us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of
      an
      allowance based on historical trends and our management’s judgment on the
      collectibility of these accounts. As we generally receive payments during the
      month in which services are provided, the allowance is typically not significant
      in comparison to total revenues and does not have a material impact on the
      presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.


Table
            of Contents

Our
      total
      revenue increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 over the previous year
      primarily through 1) membership growth in the Medicaid Managed Care segment,
      2)
      premium rate increases, and 3) growth in our Specialty Services segment.

Membership
                growth

From

During
      2006, our subsidiary, Peach State Health Plan, commenced operations in the
      Atlanta and Central regions of Georgia in June and in the Southwest region
      in
      September. We increased our membership in Ohio through the MediPlan acquisition
      while also adding members under our new contract in the East Central and
      Northwest markets. In Texas, we increased our membership through new contracts
      in the Corpus Christi, Austin, and Lubbock markets. Our membership decreased
      in
      Wisconsin because of more stringent state eligibility requirements for the
      Medicaid and SCHIP programs and eligibility administration issues. Our
      membership decreased in Indiana primarily due to provider terminations. The
      revenue associated with our Kansas and Missouri health plans was $317.0 and
      $273.7 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

In
      2005,
      we increased our membership in Ohio through our acquisition of the
      Medicaid-related assets of SummaCare, Inc. Our membership increased in Indiana,
      New Jersey and Wisconsin from additions to our provider networks, expansion
      into
      SSI in Wisconsin, increases in counties served and growth in the overall number
      of Medicaid beneficiaries. In Kansas, we increased our membership by eliminating
      a ceiling on our membership total with the State. Our membership decreased
      in
      Missouri and Texas because of more stringent eligibility requirements for the
      Medicaid and SCHIP programs.

2.

Premium
                rate increases

In
      2006,
      we received premium rate increases ranging from 1.8% to 9.5%, or 5.6% on a
      composite basis across our markets. In 2005, we received premium rate increases
      ranging from 0.6% to 8.7%, or 3.2% on a composite basis across our
      markets.

3.

Specialty
                Services segment growth

In
      2005,
      we began performing under our behavioral health contracts with the states of
      Arizona and Kansas. In July 2005, we began offering disease management services
      through our acquisition of AirLogix. In January 2006, we began offering pharmacy
      benefits management through our acquisition of US Script, representing most
      of
      the 2006 increase in service revenue. Additionally, in May 2006, we expanded
      our
      disease management services through our acquisition of Cardium. In July 2006,
      we
      began offering managed vision care through our acquisition of OptiCare. In
      October 2006, our subsidiary, Bridgeway Health Solutions began performing under
      our long-term care contract in Arizona. The increase in service revenue reflects
      the acquisitions of US Script AirLogix, and Cardium. At December 31, 2006,
      our
      behavioral health company, Cenpatico, provided behavioral health services
      to

      members in Arizona and 36,600 members in Kansas, compared to 94,700 members
      in
      Arizona and 38,800 members in Kansas, at December 31, 2005.

Operating
      Expenses

Medical
      Costs

Our
      medical costs include payments to physicians, hospitals, and other providers
      for
      healthcare and specialty services claims. Medical costs also include estimates
      of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported, or IBNR, and estimates of
      the
      cost to process unpaid claims. Monthly, we estimate our IBNR based on a number
      of factors, including inpatient hospital utilization data and prior claims
      experience. As part of this review, we also consider the costs to process
      medical claims and estimates of amounts to cover uncertainties related to
      fluctuations in physician billing patterns, membership, products and inpatient
      hospital trends. These estimates are adjusted as more information becomes
      available. We employ actuarial professionals and use the services of independent
      actuaries who are contracted to review our estimates quarterly. While we believe
      that our process for estimating IBNR is actuarially sound, we cannot assure
      you
      that healthcare claim costs will not materially differ from our estimates.

Our
      results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses related to health
      benefits and to accurately predict costs incurred. Our health benefits ratio,
      or
      HBR, represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues and reflects
      the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services
      provided. The table below depicts our HBR for our external membership by member
      category:

Our
      Medicaid and SCHIP HBR for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 82.6%, an
      increase of 0.8% over 2005. The HBR for the year ended December 31, 2005
      included $4.5 million for settlement of a lawsuit with Aurora Health Care,
      Inc.,
      or Aurora, a provider of medical professional services to our Wisconsin health
      plan. This settlement increased the HBR 0.3% for the year ended December 31,
      2005. The increase in HBR for the year ended December 31, 2006 is caused
      primarily by increased cost trends for maternity related costs including
      neonatal intensive care costs, increased physician costs, and increased pharmacy
      costs.

Our
      Specialty Services HBR for 2006 includes twelve months of the behavioral health
      contracts in Arizona and Kansas, six months of OptiCare and three months of
      Bridgeway. The 2005 results include twelve months of our behavioral health
      contract in Kansas and six months of Arizona results.

Our
      Medicaid and SCHIP HBR increased in 2005 due to our settlement of a lawsuit
      with
      Aurora and expansion into new markets previously unmanaged by us. For example,
      we experienced higher cost trends in Indiana where we added membership in 2005
      as the state expanded their Medicaid managed care program to include all
      Medicaid and SCHIP enrollees.

Cost
      of Services

Our
      cost
      of services expense includes all direct costs to support the local functions
      responsible for generation of our services revenues. These expenses consist
      of
      the salaries and wages of the professionals and teachers who provide the
      services and expenses related to facilities and equipment used to provide
      services. Cost of services also includes the pharmaceutical
      costs associated with our PBM's external revenues. Cost of services
      rose $54.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, over the comparable
      period in 2005. The increase in cost of services reflects the acquisitions
      of US
      Script, AirLogix, and Cardium.

General
      and Administrative Expenses

Our
      general and administrative, or G&A, expenses primarily reflect wages and
      benefits, including stock compensation expense, and other administrative costs
      related to our health plans, specialty companies and centralized functions
      that
      support all of our business units. Our major centralized functions are finance,
      information systems and claims processing. Premium taxes are also classified
      as
      G&A expenses. G&A expenses increased in the year ended December 31, 2006
      over the comparable period in 2005 primarily due to expenses for additional
      facilities and staff to support our growth, especially in Arizona and Georgia,
      an increase in premium taxes, the adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006
      and
      the exit costs for our FirstGuard operations. Premium taxes totaled $42.5
      million in the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $9.8 million for the
      comparable period in 2005. The results for the year ended December 31, 2006,
      include $13.9 million of implementation expenses in Georgia, $9.9 million of
      additional stock compensation expense and $13.4 million of FirstGuard exit
      costs.

            of Contents

Our
      G&A expense ratio represents G&A expenses as a percentage of total
      revenues and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs
      necessary to earn those revenues. The following table sets forth the G&A
      expense ratios by business segment:

The
      increase in the Medicaid Managed Care G&A expense ratio in 2006 primarily
      reflects the increase in premium taxes, the adoption of SFAS 123R and exit
      costs
      of our FirstGuard operations offset by the overall leveraging of our expenses
      over higher revenues.

The
      decrease in the Medicaid Managed Care G&A expense ratio in 2005 reflects the
      overall leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues and lower compensation
      costs related to our performance bonus plans. These factors were partially
      offset by implementation costs in Georgia of $6.2 million, higher spending
      on
      information systems process improvements and increased charitable contributions.

The
      Specialty Services G&A ratio varies depending on the nature of the services
      provided and will generally be higher than the Medicaid Managed Care G&A
      expense ratio. The 2006 results reflect the operations of our behavioral health
      company in Arizona, the acquisitions of US Script and AirLogix, as well as
      the
      acquisition of Cardium effective May 9, 2006, and OptiCare effective July 1,
      2006. The results for the year ended December 31, 2006 include approximately
      $0.7 million in implementation costs related to our long-term care contract
      in
      Arizona. The 2005 results reflect the operations of our behavioral health
      company in Arizona, including $1.5 million in implementation costs, and $0.2
      million in Georgia implementation costs.

In
      2006,
      we reassessed the calculations used to determine the proportion of certain
      costs
      allocated among each of our two segments. This assessment included an evaluation
      of whether the costs should be allocated based on revenue, number of claims,
      or
      headcount measures and altered the proportion of certain G&A costs. The
      altered percentages resulted in the allocation of an additional $13.6 million
      to
      the Medicaid Managed Care segment for the year ended December 31, 2006 than
      would have been allocated under the previous formulas.

Other
      Income (Expense)

Other
      income (expense) consists principally of investment income from our cash and
      investments and interest expense on our debt.

Investment
      and other income increased $7.2 million in 2006 primarily as a result of an
      increase in market interest rates and larger investment balances. Interest
      expense increased $6.6 million primarily from increased borrowings under our
      credit facilities.

Income
      Tax Expense

We
      recorded $22.0 million of income tax expense in 2006 despite having a $21.6
      million pre-tax loss because the $81.1 million goodwill impairment loss is
      not
      deductible for income tax purposes.  Excluding the goodwill impairment, our
      2006 effective tax rate was 37.0% compared to 35.2% for the corresponding
      period in 2005. The 2005 effective tax rate included lower expense resulting
      from the resolution of state income tax examinations and the recognition of
      deferred tax benefits related to a change in law.

Impairment
      Loss

In
      August
      2006, FirstGuard Health Plan Kansas, Inc., or FirstGuard Kansas, our wholly
      owned subsidiary, received notification from the Kansas Health Policy Authority
      that its Medicaid contract scheduled to terminate December 31, 2006 would not
      be
      renewed. We appealed this decision and initiated litigation in an attempt to
      renew this Medicaid contract.  These actions were unsuccessful and the
      contract terminated December 31, 2006.  In 2006, we also evaluated the
      strategic alternatives for our FirstGuard Missouri health plan and decided
      to
      divest the business.  The sale of the operating assets of FirstGuard
      Missouri was completed effective February 1, 2007.  FirstGuard Kansas and
      FirstGuard Missouri are reported in the Medicaid Managed Care
      segment.

As
      a
      result of the notification from the Kansas Health Policy Authority, we conducted
      an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill of
      the
      FirstGuard reporting unit, which encompassed both the FirstGuard Kansas and
      FirstGuard Missouri health plans.  The fair value of the FirstGuard
      reporting unit was determined using discounted expected cash flows and estimated
      market value.  The impairment analysis resulted in a goodwill impairment of
      $81.1 million recorded as impairment loss in the consolidated statement of
      operations.  The goodwill impairment is not deductible for tax
      purposes; however, a tax benefit for the stock of FirstGuard Kansas may be
      realized in 2007.  The cash proceeds in 2007 from the FirstGuard Missouri
      sale and tax benefit for the stock of FirstGuard Kansas are estimated to total
      between $30 and $40 million.

Earnings
      per share and shares outstanding

Our
      earnings per share calculations in 2006 reflect lower diluted weighted average
      shares outstanding resulting from the exclusion of the effect of outstanding
      stock awards which would be anti-dilutive to net earnings.

LIQUIDITY
      AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We
      finance our activities primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings
      under our revolving credit facility. Our total operating activities provided
      cash of $195.0 million in 2006, $74.0 million in 2005 and $99.4 million in
      2004.
      The increase in cash flow from operations in 2006 reflects an increase in
      medical claims liabilities primarily from the commencement of our operations
      in
      Georgia and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Those
      increases are partially offset by an increase in premium and related receivables
      in 2006 that reflect an increase in maternity delivery receivables,
      reimbursements due to us from providers including amounts due under capitated
      risk-sharing contracts and the inclusion of US Script receivables. Cash flow
      from operations in 2005 reflects an increase in premium and related receivables
      and a $4.5 million increase in medical claims liabilities. The increase in
      receivables resulted primarily from the timing of delivery receivable
      collections. The increase in medical claims liabilities, lower than in prior
      years, reflects the $9.5 million payment made to Aurora to settle a lawsuit,
      information systems improvements to reduce our claims processing cycle time
      and
      the effect of our behavioral health contract in Arizona.

Our
      investing activities used cash of $150.3 million in 2006, $56.4 million in
      and $122.5 million in 2004. During 2006, our investing activities primarily
      consisted of the acquisitions of US Script, Cardium, MediPlan, and OptiCare.
      Our
      investing activities in 2006 also included additions to the investment
      portfolios of our regulated subsidiaries. During 2005, our investing activities
      primarily consisted of the acquisitions of AirLogix and the operating assets
      of
      SummaCare, Inc. Our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity,
      preserve capital and maximize total return on invested assets within our
      investment guidelines. Net cash provided by and used in investing activities
      will fluctuate from year to year due to the timing of investment purchases,
      sales and maturities. As of December 31, 2006, our investment portfolio
      consisted primarily of fixed-income securities with an average duration of
      1.2
      years. Cash is invested in investment vehicles such as municipal bonds,
      corporate bonds, insurance contracts, commercial paper and instruments of the
      U.S. Treasury. The states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments
      in which our regulated subsidiaries may invest their cash.

We
      spent
      $50.3 million, $26.9 million and $25.0 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively, on capital assets consisting primarily of software and hardware
      upgrades, and furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements related to office
      and market expansions. The expenditures in 2006 included $27.7 million for
      computer hardware and software. We anticipate spending $60 million on additional
      capital expenditures in 2007 primarily related to system upgrades and market
      expansions.

The
      expenditures in 2006 also included $9.5 million to purchase several properties
      contiguous to our corporate headquarters as part of our redevelopment agreement
      with the City of Clayton, Missouri.  We anticipate spending approximately
      $20 million for additional property in Clayton, Missouri related to this
      agreement.  In the second quarter of 2006, our subsidiary executed a
      three-year, $25 million non-recourse revolving credit facility to finance the
      property already acquired or expected to be acquired under the redevelopment
      agreement. As of December 31, 2006 we had $8.4 million in borrowings outstanding
      under this credit facility.

Our
      primary purpose for the redevelopment agreement is to accommodate office
      expansion needs for future company growth. The total scope of the project
      includes building two new office towers and street-level retail space. We plan
      to occupy a portion of those towers. The total expected cost of the project
      is
      approximately $190 million. It is not our intent to serve as developer of the
      project or finance the project construction costs.

Our
      financing activities provided cash of $78.9 million in 2006, $45.7 million
      in
      2005 and $42.8 million in 2004. During 2006 and 2005, our financing activities
      primarily related to proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility. These
      borrowings were used primarily for our investing activities in conjunction
      with
      the acquisition of SummaCare, AirLogix, US Script, Cardium and
      MediPlan.

At
      December 31, 2006, we had working capital, defined as current assets less
      current liabilities, of $63.9 million as compared to $58.0 million at December
      31, 2005. We manage our short-term and long-term investments to ensure that
      a
      sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be
      sold
      to fund short-term capital requirements as needed.

Cash,
      cash equivalents and short-term investments were $338.0 million at December
      31,
      2006 and $204.1 million at December 31, 2005. Long-term investments were $170.7
      million at December 31, 2006 and $146.2 million at December 31, 2005, including
      restricted deposits of $25.3 million and $22.6 million, respectively. At
      December 31, 2006, cash and investments held by our unregulated entities totaled
      $28.9 million while cash and investments held by our regulated entities totaled
      $479.8 million.

In
      September 2006, we executed an amendment to our revolving credit agreement.
      The
      amendment increases the total amount available under the credit agreement to
      $300 million from $200 million, including a sub-facility for letters of credit
      in an aggregate amount up to $75 million. Borrowings under the agreement bear
      interest based upon LIBOR rates, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate.
      There
      is a commitment fee on the unused portion of the agreement that ranges from
      0.15% to 0.275% depending on the


Table
            of Contents

total
      debt to EBITDA ratio. The agreement contains non-financial and financial
      covenants, including requirements of minimum fixed charge coverage ratios,
      maximum debt to EBITDA ratios and minimum tangible net worth. The agreement
      will
      expire in September 2011. As of December 31, 2006, we had $149.0 million in
      borrowings outstanding under the agreement and $15.6 million in letters of
      credit outstanding, leaving availability of $135.4 million. As of December
      31,
      2006, we were in compliance with all covenants.

We
      have a
      stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to four million shares
      of common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately
      negotiated transactions. The repurchase program extends through October 31,
      2007, but we reserve the right to suspend or discontinue the program at any
      time. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased 397,400 shares
      at
      an average price of $19.71. We have established a trading plan with a registered
      broker to repurchase shares under certain market conditions.

We
      have a
      shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the Securities and
      Exchange Commission, or the SEC, covering the issuance of up to
      $300 million of securities including common stock and debt securities. No
      securities have been issued under the shelf registration. We may publicly offer
      securities from time-to-time at prices and terms to be determined at the time
      of
      the offering.

Based
      on
      our operating plan, we expect that our available cash, cash equivalents and
      investments, cash from our operations and cash available under our credit
      facility will be sufficient to finance our operations and capital expenditures
      for at least 12 months from the date of this filing. Additionally, the cash
      and
      investments in our Kansas and Missouri health plans are sufficient to satisfy
      the remaining liabilities. We expect the excess funds will become available
      to
      us for general corporate purposes when our regulatory obligations have been
      satisfied.

Our
      principal contractual obligations at December 31, 2006 consisted of medical
      claims liabilities, debt, operating leases and purchase obligations. Our debt
      consists of borrowings from our credit facilities, mortgages and capital leases.
      The purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchase and maintenance
      contracts in addition to agreements pertaining to the expansion of our corporate
      headquarters. The contractual obligations over the next five years and beyond
      are as follows (in thousands):

REGULATORY
      CAPITAL AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

Our
      Medicaid Managed Care operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. As
      managed care organizations, these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations
      that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory
      capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing, payment and amount
      of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us. Generally, the
      amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary
      without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on
      the
      entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and
      surplus.

Our
      subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed
      by
      various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate. As
      of
      December 31, 2006, our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus
      of $248.9 million, compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory
      capital and surplus requirements of $154.0 million.

The
      National Association of Insurance Commissioners has adopted rules which set
      minimum risk-based capital requirements for insurance companies, managed care
      organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage. As of
      December 31, 2006, our Georgia, Indiana, New Jersey, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin
      health plans were in compliance with the risk-based capital requirements enacted
      in those states. Had Kansas or Missouri adopted risk-based capital requirements,
      we believe we would be in compliance at December 31, 2006.

RECENT
      ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In
      July
      2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Interpretation
      48, or FIN 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” an interpretation
      of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” FIN 48 clarifies
      whether or not to recognize assets or liabilities for tax positions taken that
      may be challenged by the taxing authority. The adoption of FIN 48 on January
      1,
      2007 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or
      results of operations.

In
      June
      2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force,
      or
      EITF, Issue No. 06-3, “How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and
      Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement
      (That is, Gross Versus Net Presentation)”, or EITF 06-3.  The EITF reached
      a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net


Table
            of Contents

basis
      is
      an accounting policy decision. Premium taxes and similar assessments are within
      the scope of EITF 06-3. We plan to adopt EITF 06-3 effective January 1, 2007
      and
      will report premium revenues net of premium taxes and similar assessments.
      The
      adoption of EITF 06-3 is expected to result in lower revenue and general and
      administrative expenses with no effect on our net earnings, statement of
      financial position or stockholders’ equity. The amount of premium taxes and
      similar assessments reported in 2006 was $42.5 million.

CRITICAL
      ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our
      significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our
      consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. Our accounting
      policies regarding medical claims liabilities and intangible assets are
      particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results
      of
      operations and require the application of significant judgment by our
      management. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.

Medical
      Claims Liabilities

Our
      medical claims liabilities include claims reported but not yet paid, or
      inventory, estimates for claims incurred but not reported, or IBNR, and
      estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims. We, together with
      our independent actuaries, estimate medical claims liabilities using actuarial
      methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial
      Standards of Practice. These actuarial methods consider factors such as
      historical data for payment patterns, cost trends, product mix, seasonality,
      utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors. These estimates
      are continually reviewed each period and adjustments based on actual claim
      submissions and additional facts and circumstances are reflected in the period
      known.

Our
      management uses its judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the
      calculation of the required estimates. In developing our estimate for IBNR,
      we
      apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period
      for
      which claims are being estimated. For more recent periods, incurred
      non-inpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month
      claims experience adjusted for known factors. Incurred hospital claims are
      estimated based on authorized days and historical per diem claim experience
      adjusted for known factors. For older periods, we utilize an estimated
      completion factor based on our historical experience to develop IBNR estimates.
      When we commence operations in a new state or region, we have limited
      information with which to estimate our medical claims liabilities. See “Risk
      Factors - Failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively
      affect our reported results.” The completion factor is an actuarial estimate of
      the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been
      adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate
      incurred costs. These approaches are consistently applied to each period
      presented.

The
      completion factor, claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors
      are the most significant factors affecting the IBNR estimate. The following
      table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential
      impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on
      December 31, 2006 data:

                estimated potential changes in medical claims liabilities caused
                by
                changes in cost trend factors for the most recent periods.

While
      we
      believe our estimates are appropriate, it is possible future events could
      require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates.
      For
      example, a 1% increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liabilities
      would have affected net earnings by $1.8 million for the year ended December
      31,
      2006. The estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing
      contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by
      our
      customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate.

Days
                in claims payable is a calculation of medical claims liabilities
                at the
                end of the period divided by average expense per calendar day for
                the
                fourth quarter of each year. Days in claims payable decreased in
                2005 due
                to the settlement of a lawsuit with Aurora, information systems
                improvements to reduce our claims processing cycle time and the effect
                of
                our behavioral health contract in Arizona.

Acquisitions
      in 2006 and 2004 include reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition
      of
      OptiCare and FirstGuard, respectively.

Medical
      claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service
      from
      the physician or other healthcare provider. As a result, these liabilities
      generally are described as having a “short-tail,” which causes less than 5% of
      our medical claims liabilities as of the end of any given year to be outstanding
      the following year. Management expects that substantially all the development
      of
      the estimate of medical claims liabilities as of December 31, 2006 will be
      known
      by the end of 2007.

Actuarial
      Standards of Practice generally require that medical claims liabilities
      estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions.
      Moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are
      expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at
      the
      time of estimate. In many situations, the claims amounts ultimately settled
      will
      be different than the estimate that satisfies the Actuarial Standards of
      Practice.

Changes
      in estimates of incurred claims for prior years were attributable to favorable
      development, including changes in medical utilization and cost trends. These
      changes in medical utilization and cost trends can be attributable to our
“margin protection” programs and changes in our member demographics. For all of
      our membership, we routinely implement new or modified policies that we refer
      to
      as our “margin protection” programs that assist with the control of medical
      utilization and cost trends such as emergency room policies. While we try to
      predict the savings from these programs, actual savings have proven to be better
      than anticipated, which has contributed to the favorable development of our
      medical claims liabilities.

Intangible
      Assets

We
      have
      made several acquisitions since 2004 that have resulted in our recording of
      intangible assets. These intangible assets primarily consist of customer
      relationships, purchased contract rights, provider contracts, trade names and
      goodwill. At December 31, 2006 we had $135.9 million of goodwill and $16.2
      million of other intangible assets. Purchased contract rights are amortized
      using the straight-line method over periods ranging from five to ten years.
      Provider contracts are amortized using the straight-line method over periods
      ranging from five to ten years. Customer relationships are amortized using
      the
      straight-line method over periods ranging from five to seven years. Trade names
      are amortized using the straight-line method over 20 years.

Our
      management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may
      affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance
      of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. If the events or
      circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or
      goodwill may be permanently impaired, the potential impairment will be measured
      based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset
      or
      goodwill and the fair value of such asset determined using the estimated future
      discounted cash flows generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the
      respective acquired entity. Our management must make assumptions and estimates,
      such as the discount factor, future utility and other internal and external
      factors, in determining the estimated fair values. While we believe these
      assumptions and estimates are appropriate, other assumptions and estimates
      could
      be applied and might produce significantly different results.


Table
            of Contents

Goodwill
      is reviewed every year during the fourth quarter for impairment. In addition,
      we
      will perform an impairment analysis of other intangible assets based on other
      factors. These factors would include significant changes in membership, state
      funding, medical contracts and provider networks and contracts. In August 2006,
      FirstGuard Health Plan Kansas, Inc., or FirstGuard Kansas, our wholly owned
      subsidiary, received notification from the Kansas Health policy Authority that
      its Medicaid contract scheduled to terminate December 31, 2006 would not be
      renewed. As a result of these events, we concluded it was necessary to conduct
      an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill of
      the
      FirstGuard reporting unit, which encompasses both the Kansas and Missouri
      FirstGuard health plans.

The
      fair
      value of our FirstGuard reporting unit was determined using discounted expected
      cash flows and estimated market value. The impairment analysis resulted in
      a
      total non-cash intangible asset impairment charge of $87.1 million, consisting
      of $81.1 million of goodwill and $6.0 million of other identifiable intangible
      assets, is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for the year
      ended December 31, 2006.

Quantitative
      and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

INVESTMENTS

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we had short-term investments of $66.9 million and long-term
      investments of $170.7 million, including restricted deposits of $25.3 million.
      The short-term investments consist of highly liquid securities with maturities
      between three and 12 months. The long-term investments consist of municipal,
      corporate and U.S. Agency bonds, life insurance contracts and U.S. Treasury
      investments and have maturities greater than one year. Restricted deposits
      consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or
      pledged to state agencies. Due to the nature of the states’ requirements, these
      investments are


Table
            of Contents

classified
      as long-term regardless of the contractual maturity date. Our investments are
      subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates
      increase. Assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1% increase in market interest
      rates at December 31, 2006, the fair value of our fixed income investments
      would
      decrease by approximately $2.3 million. Declines in interest rates over time
      will reduce our investment income.

INFLATION

Although
      the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and healthcare
      cost
      inflation has stabilized in recent years, the national healthcare cost inflation
      rate still exceeds the general inflation rate. We use various strategies to
      mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation. Specifically, our
      health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our margin
      protection program and contracts with independent providers of healthcare
      services. Through these contracted care providers, our health plans emphasize
      preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services.

While
      we
      currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will
      continue to be successful, competitive pressures, new healthcare and
      pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from healthcare providers and
      customers, applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to
      control the impact of healthcare cost increases.

Controls
      and Procedures

Evaluation
      of Disclosure Controls and Procedures -

Our
      management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
      Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
      procedures as of December 31, 2006. The term “disclosure controls and
      procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act,
      means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure
      that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that
      it
      files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
      and
      reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
      Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and
      procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
      a
      company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
      accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its
      principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow
      timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that
      any
      controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
      only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management
      necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship
      of
      possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure
      controls and procedures as of December 31, 2006, our Chief Executive Officer
      and
      Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls
      and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

- Our
      management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
      control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules
      13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of
      our
      management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
      officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
      over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal

Control
      - Integrated Framework

issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based
      on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

,
      our
      management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
      effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2006. Our
      management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
      financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
      independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which
      is included herein.

Changes
      in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

- No
      change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
      13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter
      ended December 31, 2006 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
      to
      materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report

The
        Board
        of Directors and Stockholders

Centene
        Corporation:

We
        have
        audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s
        Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

,

that
        Centene Corporation (the Company) maintained effective internal control over
        financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established
        in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued
        by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
        (COSO).

The
        Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
        over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
        control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
        on
        management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
        internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
        conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
        internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
        respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
        over
        financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating
        the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
        such
        other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
        that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
        company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
        to
        provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
        and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
        with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control
        over
        financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
        to
        the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
        reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
        provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
        to
        permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
        accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
        are
        being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
        of
        the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
        timely
        detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
        assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
        of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
        not
        prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
        effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
        become
        inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
        with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
        our
        opinion, management's assessment that Centene Corporation maintained effective
        internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly
        stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal
        Control—Integrated Framework

issued
        by
        COSO. Also, in our opinion, Centene Corporation maintained, in all material
        respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
        31,
        2006, based on the

criteria
        established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued
        by

COSO

.

We
        also
        have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
        Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Centene
        Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
        consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for
        the years then ended, and our report dated February 22, 2007

,

expressed
        an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

      of Independent Registered Public Accounting
      Firms

The
        Board
        of Directors and Stockholders

Centene
        Corporation:

We
        have
        audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Centene Corporation
        and
        subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
        statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years
        then ended.

In
        connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also
        have audited the accompanying financial statement schedule as of and for
        the
        years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. These consolidated financial statements
        and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
        management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
        financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
        audits.

We
        conducted our audits in accordance with the

standards

of
        the
        Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (

United
        States

).
        Those
        standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
        assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
        misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
        the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
        assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
        management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
        We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
        opinion.

In
        our
        opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
        fairly,
        in all material respects, the financial position of Centene Corporation and
        subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
        operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with
        U.S.

generally
        accepted

accounting
        principles

.

Also
        in
        our opinion, the related financial statement schedule as of and for the years
        ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, when considered in relation to the basic
        consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
        material respects, the information set forth therein.

As
        discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2006,
        the
        Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 (revised
        2004), “Share Based Payments.”

We
        also
        have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
        Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of internal control over
        financial reporting of Centene Corporation as of December 31, 2006, based
        on the

criteria
        established

in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework i

ssued
        by
        the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
        (COSO),

and our
        report dated February 22, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s
        assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial
        reporting.

Report
        of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
        the
        Board of Directors and Stockholders of Centene Corporation:

In
        our
        opinion, the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders'
        equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2004 present fairly,
        in
        all material respects, the results of operations and cash flows of Centene
        Corporation and its subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2004, in
        conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
        of
        America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule for
        the
        year ended December 31, 2004 presents fairly, in all material respects, the
        information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
        consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial
        statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
        responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
        financial statement schedule based on our audit. We conducted our audit of
        these
        statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
        Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
        perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
        statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
        on a
        test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
        statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
        made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
        We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

1.
      Organization and Operations

Centene
      Corporation, or Centene or the Company, is a multi-line healthcare enterprise
      operating primarily in two segments: Medicaid Managed Care and Specialty
      Services. Centene’s Medicaid Managed Care segment provides Medicaid and
      Medicaid-related health plan coverage to individuals through government
      subsidized programs, including Medicaid, the State Children’s Health Insurance
      Program, or SCHIP, and Supplemental Security Income, or SSI. The Company’s
      Specialty Services segment provides specialty services, including behavioral
      health, disease management, long-term care programs, managed vision, nurse
      triage, pharmacy benefits management and treatment compliance, to state
      programs, healthcare organizations, and other commercial organizations, as
      well
      as to our own subsidiaries on market-based terms.

2.
      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
      of Consolidation

The
      accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Centene
      Corporation and all majority owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany
      balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Estimates

The
      preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
      accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
      that
      affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
      contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
      the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
      Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash
      and Cash Equivalents

Investments
      with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash
      equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of commercial paper, money market funds,
      repurchase agreements and bank savings accounts.

Investments

Short-term
      investments include securities with maturities between three months and one
      year. Long-term investments include securities with maturities greater than
      one
      year.

Short-term
      and long-term investments are classified as available for sale and are carried
      at fair value based on quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses on
      investments available for sale are excluded from earnings and reported as a
      separate component of stockholders’ equity, net of income tax effects. Premiums
      and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security
      using the effective interest method. The Company monitors the difference between
      the cost and fair value of investments. Investments that experience a decline
      in
      value that is judged to be other than temporary are written down to fair value
      and a realized loss is recorded in investment and other income. To calculate
      realized gains and losses on the sale of investments, the Company uses the
      specific amortized cost of each investment sold. Realized gains and losses
      are
      recorded in investment and other income.

Restricted
      Deposits

Restricted
      deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be
      deposited or pledged to state agencies. These investments are classified as
      long-term, regardless of the contractual maturity date, due to the nature of
      the
      states’ requirements. The Company is required to annually adjust the amount of
      the deposit pledged to certain states.

Property,
      Software and Equipment

Property,
      software and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
      Capitalized software includes certain costs incurred in the development of
      internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services
      and payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development.
      Depreciation is calculated principally by the straight-line method over
      estimated useful lives ranging from 40 years for buildings, two to seven years
      for software and computer equipment and five to seven years for furniture and
      equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method
      over the shorter of the expected useful life or the remaining term of the lease
      ranging between one and ten years.


Table
            of Contents

Intangible
      Assets

Intangible
      assets represent assets acquired in purchase transactions and consist primarily
      of customer relationships, purchased contract rights, provider contracts, trade
      names and goodwill. Purchased contract rights are amortized using the
      straight-line method over periods ranging from five to ten years. Provider
      contracts are amortized using the straight-line method over periods ranging
      from
      five to ten years. Customer relationships are amortized using the straight-line
      method over periods ranging from five to seven years. Trade names are amortized
      using the straight line method over 20 years.

Goodwill
      is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment. In addition,
      the
      Company performs an impairment analysis of other intangible assets based on
      the
      occurrence of other factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to,
      significant changes in membership, state funding, medical contracts and provider
      networks and contracts. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value
      of intangible assets exceeds the implied fair value.

Medical
      Claims Liabilities

Medical
      services costs include claims paid, claims reported but not yet paid, or
      inventory, estimates for claims incurred but not yet received, or IBNR, and
      estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims.

The
      estimates of medical claims liabilities are developed using standard actuarial
      methods based upon historical data for payment patterns, cost trends, product
      mix, seasonality, utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors
      including product changes. These estimates are continually reviewed and
      adjustments, if necessary, are reflected in the period known. Management did
      not
      change actuarial methods during the years presented. Management believes the
      amount of medical claims payable is reasonable and adequate to cover the
      Company’s liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2006; however, actual
      claim payments may differ from established estimates.

Revenue
      Recognition

The
      Company’s Medicaid Managed Care segment generates revenues primarily from
      premiums received from the states in which it operates health plans. The company
      receives a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts.
      The company generally receives premium payments during the month it provides
      services and recognizes premium revenue during the period in which it is
      obligated to provide services to its members. Some states enact premium taxes
      or
      similar assessments, collectively premium taxes, and these taxes are recorded
      as
      General and Administrative expenses. Some contracts allow for additional premium
      related to certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries.
      Revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by
      the
      states, which may be adjusted by the states for updates to this data. These
      adjustments have been immaterial in relation to total revenue recorded and
      are
      reflected in the period known.

The
      Company’s Specialty Services segment generates revenues under contracts with
      state programs, healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations,
      as
      well as from our own subsidiaries on market-based terms.  Revenues are
      recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over
      the
      covered period of service.

Premium
      and services revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue.
      For
      performance-based contracts the company does not recognize revenue subject
      to
      refund until data is sufficient to measure performance. Premiums and service
      revenues due to the Company are recorded as premium and related receivables
      and
      are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and management’s
      judgment on the collectibility of these accounts. As the Company generally
      receives payments during the month in which services are provided, the allowance
      is typically not significant in comparison to total revenues and does not have
      a
      material impact on the presentation of the financial condition or results of
      operations. Activity in the allowance for uncollectible accounts for the years
      ended December 31 is summarized below:

Centene

      state
      Medicaid managed care programs. The contracts, which expire on various dates
      between June 30, 2007 and December 31, 2011 are expected to be renewed.
      Contracts with the states of Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Texas and Wisconsin
      each
      accounted for 15%, 15%, 10%, 17% and 16%, respectively, of the Company’s
      revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Reinsurance

Centene
      has purchased reinsurance from third parties to cover eligible healthcare
      services. The current reinsurance program covers 90% of inpatient healthcare
      expenses in excess of annual deductibles of $300 to $500 per member, up to
      an
      annual maximum of $2,000. Centene’s Medicaid Managed Care subsidiaries are
      responsible for inpatient charges in excess of an average daily per diem. In
      addition,

Bridgeway
      participates in a risk- sharing program as part of its contract with the State
      of Arizona for the reimbursement of certain contract service costs beyond a
      monetary threshold.

Reinsurance
      recoveries were $3,674, $4,014, and $3,730, in 2006, 2005, and 2004,
      respectively. Reinsurance expenses were approximately $4,842, $4,105, and $6,724
      in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Reinsurance recoveries, net of expenses,
      are included in medical costs.

Other
      Income (Expense)

Other
      income (expense) consists principally of investment income and interest expense.
      Investment income is derived from the Company’s cash, cash equivalents,
      restricted deposits and investments.

Interest
      expense relates to borrowings under our credit facilities, mortgage interest,
      interest on capital leases and credit facility fees.

Income
      Taxes

Deferred
      tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax consequences
      attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
      of
      existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
      assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
      to
      taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
      to
      be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
      of a
      change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
      enactment date of the tax rate change.

Valuation
      allowances are provided when it is considered more likely than not that deferred
      tax assets will not be realized. In determining if a deductible temporary
      difference or net operating loss can be realized, the Company considers future
      reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income,
      taxable income in prior carryback periods and tax planning
      strategies.

Stock
      Based Compensation

The
      Company adopted FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
      (revised 2004), “Share Based Payment,” or SFAS 123R, effective January 1, 2006,
      using the modified-prospective transition method. Under this method,
      compensation cost is recognized for awards granted and for awards modified,
      repurchased or cancelled in the period after adoption. Compensation cost is
      also
      recognized for the unvested portion of awards granted prior to adoption. Prior
      year financial statements are not restated  The fair value of the Company’s
      employee share options and similar instruments are estimated using the
      Black-Scholes option-pricing model. That cost is recognized over the period
      during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the
      award.  The Company’s results for the year ended December 31, 2006
      reflected the following changes as a result of adopting SFAS 123R:

                Ended

(0.18

)

Additionally,
      upon adoption of SFAS 123R, excess tax benefits related to stock compensation
      are presented as a cash inflow from financing activities. This change had the
      effect of decreasing cash flows from operating activities and increasing cash
      flows from financing activities by $3,043 for the year ended December 31, 2006.

For
      the
      years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company accounted for stock-based
      compensation plans under APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
      Employees.” Compensation cost related to stock options issued to employees was
      recorded only if the grant-date market price of the underlying stock exceeded
      the exercise price. The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings
      and earnings per share if a fair value-based method had been applied to all
      awards.

In
      October 2005, the Compensation Committee approved the immediate and full
      acceleration of vesting of 260,000 "out-of-the-money" stock options to certain
      employees. These employees did not include any of the Company’s executive
      officers or other employees at the Vice President level or above. Each stock
      option issued as a part of these grants has an exercise price greater than
      the
      closing price per share on the date of the Compensation Committee’s action. The
      purpose of the acceleration was to enable the Company to avoid recognizing
      compensation expense associated with these options in future periods in our
      consolidated statements of operations, in contemplation of the implementation
      of
      SFAS 123R. The pre-tax charge avoided totals approximately $3.0 million which
      would have been recognized over the years 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. This amount
      is reflected in the pro forma disclosures included above. The options that
      have
      been accelerated had an exercise price in excess of the market value of our
      common stock at the time of acceleration. Accordingly, the Compensation
      Committee determined that the expense savings outweighs the objective of
      incentive compensation and retention.

Additional
      information regarding the stock option plans is included in Note 13.

Reclassifications

Certain
      amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to
      conform to the 2006 presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on
      net
      earnings or stockholders’ equity as previously reported.

Recent
      Accounting Pronouncements

In
      July
      2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Interpretation
      48, or FIN 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” an interpretation
      of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” FIN 48 clarifies
      whether or not to recognize assets or liabilities for tax positions taken that
      may be challenged by the taxing authority. The adoption of FIN 48 on January
      1,
      2007 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s financial
      condition or results of operations.

In
      June
      2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force,
      or
      EITF, Issue No. 06-3, “How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and
      Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement
      (That is, Gross Versus Net Presentation)”, or EITF 06-3.  The EITF reached
      a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is
      an
      accounting policy decision. Premium taxes and similar assessments are within
      the
      scope of EITF 06-3. The Company plans to adopt EITF 06-3 effective January
      1,
      2007 and will report premium revenues net of premium taxes and similar
      assessments. The adoption of EITF 06-3 is expected to result in lower revenue
      and general and administrative expenses with no effect on the Company’s net
      earnings, statement of financial position or stockholders’ equity. The amount of
      premium taxes and similar assessments reported in 2006 was $42,453.

      FirstGuard Health Plans

In
      August
      2006, FirstGuard Health Plan Kansas, Inc., or FirstGuard Kansas, a wholly owned
      subsidiary, received notification from the Kansas Health Policy Authority that
      its Medicaid contract scheduled to terminate December 31, 2006 would not be
      renewed. The Company appealed this decision and initiated litigation in an
      attempt to renew this Medicaid contract. These actions were unsuccessful and
      the
      contract terminated effective December 31, 2006. In 2006, the Company also
      evaluated its strategic alternatives for its Missouri subsidiary, FirstGuard
      Health Plan, Inc., or FirstGuard Missouri, and decided to divest the business.
      The sale of the operating assets of FirstGuard Missouri was completed effective
      February 1, 2007.

As
      a
      result of the notification from the Kansas Health Policy Authority, the Company
      conducted an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assets and
      goodwill of the FirstGuard reporting unit, which encompasses both the FirstGuard
      Kansas and FirstGuard Missouri health plans. The fair value of the FirstGuard
      reporting unit was determined using discounted expected cash flows and estimated
      market value. The impairment analysis resulted in a goodwill impairment of
      $81,098 recorded as impairment loss


Table
            of Contents

in
        the
        consolidated statement of operations. The Company also recorded impairment
        charges for identifiable intangible assets of $5,993, and fixed assets of
        $1,177
        recorded as general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement
        of
        operations. The goodwill portion of the impairment is not deductible for
        tax
        purposes.

The
      Company incurred $6,202 of other FirstGuard exit costs in 2006 consisting
      primarily of lease termination fees and employee severance costs. At December
      31, 2006 the remaining accrual for these costs was $3,027. Our FirstGuard
      reporting unit had total revenues of $317,027, $273,662 and $20,247 for the
      years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. FirstGuard had
      138,900 members (unaudited) at December 31, 2006.

The
      Company monitors investments for other than temporary impairment. Certain
      investments have experienced a decline in market value due to changes in market
      interest rates. The Company recognized an other than temporary impairment loss
      of $31 in 2006 for investments in the FirstGuard Kansas portfolio which the
      Company expects to sell prior to recovery. Based on the credit quality of the
      Company’s other investments and ability to hold these investments to recovery
      (which may be maturity), no other impairment has been recorded for investments.

The
      tax
      effects of temporary differences which give rise to deferred tax assets and
      liabilities are presented below for the years ended December 31:

The
      Company’s deferred tax assets include federal and state net operating losses, or
      NOLs, the majority of which were acquired in business combinations. Accordingly,
      the total and annual deduction for those NOLs is limited by tax law. The federal
      NOLs expire between the years 2011 and 2025 and the state NOLs expire between
      the years 2007 and 2027. Valuation allowances are recorded for those NOLs the
      Company believes are more-likely-than-not to expire unused. During 2006 and
      2005, the Company recorded valuation allowance reductions of $2,910 and $5,340,
      respectively and recorded additional valuation allowances of $2,005 and $2,048,
      respectively. The 2006 and 2005 tax provision included $422 and $790 of the
      valuation allowance reductions. The remainder was recorded as a reduction of
      goodwill and other intangible assets or was due to a change in state filing
      positions.

In
      September 2006, the Company executed an amendment to the five-year Revolving
      Credit Agreement dated September 14, 2004 with various financial institutions.
      The amendment increases the total amount available under the credit agreement
      to
      $300,000 from $200,000, including a sub-facility for letters of credit in an
      aggregate amount up to $75,000. Borrowings under the agreement bear interest
      based upon LIBOR rates, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate. There is
      a
      commitment fee on the unused portion of the agreement that ranges from 0.15%
      to
      0.275% depending on the total debt-to-EBITDA ratio. The agreement contains
      non-financial and financial covenants, including requirements of minimum fixed
      charge coverage ratios, maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratios and minimum tangible
      net
      worth. The agreement will expire in September 2011. The outstanding borrowings
      at December 31, 2006 bore interest at LIBOR plus 1.25%, or 6.7%.

In
      May
      2006, the Company executed a three-year $25,000 Revolving Loan Agreement.
      Borrowings under the agreement bear interest based upon LIBOR rates plus 1.5%.
      Subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement, the proceeds of the
      Revolving Loan may only be used for the acquisition of certain properties
      contiguous to the Company’s corporate headquarters. The collateralized
      properties had a net book value of $9,435 at December 31, 2006. The outstanding
      borrowings at December 31, 2006 bore interest at 6.8%.

Mortgage
      notes payable consists of two mortgages collateralized by the Company’s
      headquarters property. The mortgages bear interest at the prevailing prime
      rate
      less .75% (7.5% at December 31, 2006). The respective properties had a net
      book
      value of $21,180 at December 31, 2006. The mortgages include a financial
      covenant requiring a minimum rolling twelve-month debt service coverage ratio.

12.
      Statutory Capital Requirements and Dividend Restrictions

Various
      state laws require Centene’s regulated subsidiaries to maintain minimum capital
      levels specified by each state and restrict the amount of dividends that may
      be
      paid without prior regulatory approval. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, Centene’s
      subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $248,900 and
      $183,500, respectively, compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory
      capital and surplus of $154,000 and $87,700, respectively.

13.
      Stock Incentive Plans

The
      Company’s stock incentive plans allow for the granting of restricted stock or
      restricted stock unit awards and options to purchase common stock. Both
      incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options can be awarded under
      the
      plans. No option will be exercisable for longer than ten years after the date
      of
      grant. The plans have 319,044 shares available for future awards. Compensation
      expense for stock options and restricted stock unit awards is recognized on
      a
      straight-line basis over the vesting period, generally three to five years
      for
      stock options and one to ten years for restricted stock or restricted stock
      unit
      awards. Certain awards provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change
      in
      control as defined in the plans.

For
      the
      years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the expected life of each award granted
      was calculated using the “simplified method” in accordance with Staff Accounting
      Bulletin No. 107. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company
      used a projected expected life for each award granted based on historical
      experience of employees’ exercise behavior. For the years ended December 31,
      2006 and 2005, expected volatility is primarily based on historical volatility
      levels along with the implied volatility of exchange traded options to purchase
      Centene common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2004, expected volatility
      is based on historical volatility levels. The risk-free interest rates are
      based
      on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero coupon
      issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life.

      States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri on January 17, 2007,
      which we refer to as the Consolidated Class Action Lawsuit. The Consolidated
      Class Action Lawsuit alleges, on behalf of purchasers of our common stock from
      April 25, 2006 through July 17, 2006, that we and certain of our officers and
      directors violated federal securities laws by issuing a series of materially
      false statements prior to the announcement of our fiscal 2006 second quarter
      results. According to the Consolidated Class Action Lawsuit, these allegedly
      materially false statements had the effect of artificially inflating the price
      of the Company's common stock, which subsequently dropped after the
      issuance of a press release announcing the Company's preliminary
      fiscal 2006 second quarter earnings and revised guidance.

The
      Company believes the case is without merit and has filed a motion to
      dismiss the Consolidated Class Action Lawsuit.

            of Contents

Additionally,
        in August 2006, a separate derivative action was filed on behalf of Centene
        Corporation against the Company and certain of its officers and directors
        in the
        United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. Plaintiff
        purports to bring suit derivatively on behalf of the Company against the
        Company’s directors for breach of fiduciary duties, gross mismanagement and
        waste of corporate assets by reason of the directors’ alleged failure to correct
        the misstatements alleged in the Consolidated Class Action Lawsuits discussed
        above. The derivative complaint largely repeats the allegations in the
        Consolidated Class Action Lawsuits. Based on discussions that have been held
        with plaintiff’s counsel, it is the Company's understanding that
        plaintiff does not intend to pursue this action until the Consolidated Class
        Action Lawsuits proceed past the dismissal stage. Although this matter is
        in its
        early stages and no precise prediction of its outcome can be made, the
        Company believes the case is without merit and plans to vigorously defend
        against this lawsuit.

In
        addition, the Company is routinely subjected to

legal proceedings in the
        normal course of business.

While
        the
        ultimate resolution of such matters is uncertain, the Company does not expect
        the results of any of these matters discussed above individually, or in the
        aggregate, to have a material effect on its financial position or results
        of
        operations.

      Earnings Per Share

The
      following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net earnings
      per
      share for the years ended December 31:

The
      calculation of diluted earnings per common share for 2006 excludes the effect
      of
      any outstanding stock awards which would be anti-dilutive to net earnings. 
The calculation of diluted earnings per common share for 2005 and 2004 excludes
      the impact of 328,250 and 0 shares, respectively, related to anti-dilutive
      stock
      options, restricted stock and restricted stock units.

      Medicaid Managed Care segment consists of Centene’s health plans including all

      of Centene’s specialty companies including behavioral health, disease
      management, managed vision, nurse triage, pharmacy benefits management and

In
      2006,
      the Company reassessed the calculations used to determine the appropriate
      proportion of certain costs allocated to each of our two segments.  This
      assessment included an evaluation of whether the costs should be allocated
      based on revenue, number of claims, or headcount measures and altered the
      proportion of certain general and administrative expenses.  For the year
      ended December 31, 2006, the altered percentages resulted in the allocation
      of an additional $13,551, to the Medicaid Managed Care segment than would have
      been allocated under the previous formulas.

The
      Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on earnings from
      operations. The accounting policies are the same as those described in the
      “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” included in Note 2.
