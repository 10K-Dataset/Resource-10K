Item 1.

Business

OVERVIEW

We are a multi-line managed care organization
that provides Medicaid and Medicaid-related programs to
organizations and individuals through government subsidized
programs, including Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).
In addition, we provide specialty services including behavioral
health, nurse triage and pharmacy compliance to our own and
other healthcare organizations. We have health plans in
Wisconsin, Texas, Indiana, New Jersey and Ohio and provide
specialty services in Texas, California, Arizona, Colorado,
Wisconsin and Indiana. We believe our local approach to managing
our subsidiaries, including provider and member services,
enables us to provide accessible, high quality,
culturally-sensitive healthcare services to our communities. Our
disease management, educational and other initiatives are
designed to help members best utilize the healthcare system to
ensure they receive appropriate, medically necessary services
and effective management of routine, severe and chronic health
problems. We combine our decentralized local approach for care
with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as
finance, information systems and claims processing.

We were organized in Wisconsin in 1993 and
reincorporated in Delaware in 2001. We initially were formed to
serve as a holding company for a Medicaid managed care line of
business that has been operating in Wisconsin since 1984. Our
corporate office is located at 7711 Carondelet Avenue,
Suite 800, St. Louis, Missouri 63105, and our
telephone number is (314) 725-4477.

We maintain a website with the address

www.centene.com.

We are not including the information
contained on our website as part of, or incorporating it by
reference into, this filing. We make available, free of charge
through our website our annual reports on Form 10-K,
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on
Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports, as soon as
reasonably practicable after we electronically file such
material with, or furnish such material to, the SEC.

INDUSTRY

Established in 1965, Medicaid is the largest
publicly funded program in the United States, providing health
insurance to low-income families and individuals with
disabilities. Authorized by Title IXX of the Social
Security Act, Medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly
by the federal and state governments and administered by the
states. Each state establishes its own eligibility standards,
benefit packages, payment rates and program administration
within federal standards. As a result, there are
56 Medicaid programs — one for each state, each
territory and the District of Columbia. The Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) estimates the total Medicaid market was
approximately $270 billion in 2003 and the federal Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimate the
market will grow to over $400 billion by fiscal year 2007.
Medicaid eligibility is based on a combination of income and
asset requirements subject to federal guidelines, often
determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty
level. The number of persons covered by Medicaid increased from
23 million in 1989 to 51 million in 2003.
Historically, children have represented the largest eligibility
group.

SSI covers low-income aged, blind and disabled
persons. SSI beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all
Medicaid recipients. In addition, SSI recipients typically
utilize more services because of their more critical health
issues.

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created SCHIP to
help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families
earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, yet not enough to afford
private health insurance. SCHIP is the single largest expansion
of health insurance coverage for children since the enactment of
Medicaid and some states are expanding their SCHIP coverage to
include adults.



Costs related to the largest eligibility group,
children, are primarily composed of pediatrics, OB/ GYN and
family care. These costs tend to be more predictable than other
healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult
population. Additionally, behavioral health issues represent a
growing component of total Medicaid expenditures.

While Medicaid programs have directed funds to
many individuals who could not afford or otherwise maintain
health insurance coverage, they did not initially address the
inefficient and costly manner in which the Medicaid population
tends to access healthcare. Medicaid recipients typically have
not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic
conditions, such as asthma and diabetes. Rather, they have
sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms, which tend to be
more expensive. As a result, many states have found that the
costs of providing Medicaid benefits have increased while the
medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory.

Since the early 1980s, increasing healthcare
costs, combined with significant growth in the number of
Medicaid recipients, have led many states to establish Medicaid
managed care initiatives. In recent years, a growing number of
states, including each of the five states in which we operate,
have mandated that their Medicaid recipients enroll in managed
care plans. Currently, 37 states have mandated managed care
for some or all of their Medicaid recipients and other states
are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach.

In addition, several states have initiated
specialized programs that focus on specific, chronic diseases.
Often, chronic diseases like diabetes and asthma can be treated
more successfully and efficiently when a comprehensive treatment
plan is properly executed. Such a plan includes not only timely
and appropriate medical care, but requires that the patient
maintain an appropriate diet and exercise regimen, take
medicines as prescribed, keep appointments with doctors, and
monitor their health status.

Historically, commercial managed care
organizations contracted with states to provide healthcare
benefits to Medicaid enrollees. Many of these organizations
encountered difficulties in adapting their commercial approaches
and infrastructures to address the Medicaid market in a
cost-effective manner. Some commercial plans have chosen to exit
all or a portion of their Medicaid markets. As a result, a
significant market opportunity exists for managed care
organizations with operations and programs focused on the
distinct socio-economic, cultural and healthcare needs of the
Medicaid, including SSI, and SCHIP populations. We believe our
approach and strategy enable us to be a growing participant in
this market.

OUR APPROACH

Our approach to our multi-line managed care
organization is based on the following key attributes:

•

Multi-Business Lines.

We have provided benefits to Medicaid
    recipients for over 20 years. In the last few years, we
    have begun to broaden our service offerings to address areas
    that we believe have been traditionally underserved by Medicaid
    managed care organizations. In 2003 we acquired Group Practice
    Affiliates, LLC (GPA), a behavioral health services company, and
    purchased assets of ScriptAssist, a medication compliance
    company. In 2002 we incorporated NurseWise, our 24-hour triage
    program. We believe these and other business lines will allow us
    to expand our services and diversify our sources of revenue.

•

Medicaid Expertise.

Over the last 20 years, we have
    developed a specialized Medicaid expertise that has helped us
    establish and maintain strong relationships with our constituent
    communities of members, providers and state governments. We have
    implemented programs developed to achieve savings for state
    governments and improve medical outcomes for members by reducing
    inappropriate emergency room use, inpatient days and high cost
    interventions, as well as by managing care of chronic illnesses.
    We do this primarily by providing nurse case managers who
    support our provider network in implementing disease management
    programs and by providing incentives for our provider network to
    provide preventive care on a regular basis. We recruit and train
    staff and providers who are attentive to the needs of our
    members and who are experienced in working with culturally
    diverse, low-income Medicaid populations. Our experience in
    working with



OUR STRATEGY

Our objective is to become the leading multi-line
Medicaid and Medicaid-related managed care organization. We
intend to achieve this objective by implementing the following
key components of our strategy:

•

Diversify Our Business Lines.

We seek to broaden our business lines
    into areas that complement our business to enable us to grow our
    revenue stream. In 2003 we acquired GPA, a behavioral health
    services company, and purchased assets of ScriptAssist, a
    medication compliance company. In addition to the services
    provided through these acquisitions and NurseWise, our 24-hour



MEDICAID MANAGED CARE

Health Plans

We have five health plan subsidiaries offering
healthcare services in Wisconsin, Texas, Indiana, New Jersey and
Ohio. We have never been denied a contract renewal from a state
in which we do business. The table below provides summary data
for the markets we currently serve.



States

Our ability to establish and maintain a
leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily
from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while
reducing and managing costs for, and our customer-focused
approach to working with, state governments. Among the benefits
we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are:

Member Programs and Services

We recognize the importance of member-focused
services in the delivery of quality managed care services. Our
locally based staff assist members in accessing care,
coordinating referrals to related health and social services and
addressing member concerns and questions. While covered
healthcare benefits vary from state to state, our health plans
generally provide the following services:

We also provide the following education and
outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing
quality, appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner:

•

CONNECTIONS

is
    designed to create a link between the member and the provider
    and help identify potential challenges or risk elements to a
    member’s health, such as abuse risks, nutritional
    challenges and health education shortcomings. CONNECTIONS
    representatives, some of whom are former Medicaid enrollees,
    also contact new members by phone or mail to discuss managed
    care, the Medicaid program and our services. Our CONNECTIONS
    representatives make home visits, conduct educational programs
    and represent our health plans at community events such as
    health fairs.

•

Start Smart For Your
    Baby

is a prenatal and infant health
    program designed to increase the percentage of pregnant women
    receiving early prenatal care, reduce the incidence of low birth
    weight babies, identify high risk pregnancies, increase
    participation in the federal Women, Infant and Children program,
    and increase well-child visits. The program includes risk
    assessments, education through face-to-face meetings and
    materials, behavior modification plans, assistance in selecting
    a provider for the infant and scheduling newborn follow-up
    visits.



•

EPSDT Case
    Management

is a preventive care
    program designed to educate our members on the benefits of Early
    and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment, or EPSDT,
    services. We have a systematic program of communicating,
    tracking, outreach, reporting and follow-through that promotes
    state EPSDT programs.

•

Disease Management
    Programs

are designed to help members
    understand their disease and treatment plan, and improve or
    maintain their quality of life. These programs address medical
    conditions that are common within the Medicaid population such
    as asthma, diabetes and prenatal care.

Providers

For each of our service areas, we establish a
provider network consisting of primary and specialty care
physicians, hospitals and ancillary providers. As of
January 31, 2004, our health plans had the following
numbers of physicians and hospitals:

The primary care physician is a critical
component in care delivery, management of costs and the
attraction and retention of new members. Primary care physicians
include family and general practitioners, pediatricians,
internal medicine physicians and OB/GYNs. Specialty care
physicians provide medical care to members generally upon
referral by the primary care physicians.

We work with physicians to help them operate
efficiently by providing financial and utilization information,
physician and patient educational programs and disease and
medical management programs. In addition, we adhere to a prompt
payment policy. Our programs are also designed to help the
physicians coordinate care outside of their offices.

We believe our collaborative approach with
physicians gives us a competitive advantage in entering new
markets. Our physicians serve on local committees that assist us
in implementing preventive care programs, managing costs and
improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members.
The following are among the services we provide to support
physicians:

•

Customized Utilization
    Reports

provide our contracted
    physicians with information that enables them to run their
    practices more efficiently and focuses them on specific patient
    needs. For example, quarterly fund detail reports update
    physicians on their status within their risk pools. Equivalency
    reports provide physicians with financial comparisons of
    capitated versus fee-for-service arrangements.

•

Case Management
    Support

helps the physician coordinate
    specialty care and ancillary services for patients with complex
    conditions and direct members to appropriate community resources
    to address both their health and socio-economic needs.

•

Web-based Claims and Eligibility
    Resources

have been implemented in
    selected markets to provide physicians with on-line access to
    perform claims and eligibility inquiries.

Our contracted physicians also benefit from
several of the services offered to our members, including the
CONNECTIONS, EPSDT case management and disease management
programs. For example, the CONNECTIONS staff facilitate
doctor/patient relationships by connecting members with
physicians, the EPSDT programs encourage routine checkups for
children with their physicians and the disease management
programs assist physicians in managing their patients with
chronic disease.

We provide access to healthcare services for our
members primarily through contracts with our providers. Our
contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and
hospitals usually are for one to two-year periods and renew
automatically for successive one-year terms, but generally are
subject to



termination by either party upon 90 to
120 days’ prior written notice. In the absence of a
contract, we typically pay providers at state Medicaid
reimbursement levels. We pay physicians under a capitated or
fee-for-service arrangement.

•

Under our capitated contracts, primary care
    physicians are paid a monthly capitation rate for each of our
    members assigned to his or her practice and are at risk for all
    costs related to primary and specialty physician and emergency
    room services. In return for this payment, these physicians
    provide all primary care and preventive services, including
    primary care office visits and EPSDT services. If these
    physicians also provide non-capitated services to their assigned
    members, they may bill and be paid under fee-for-service
    arrangements at Medicaid rates.

•

Under our fee-for-service contracts with
    physicians, particularly specialty care physicians, we pay the
    physicians a negotiated fee for covered services. This model is
    characterized as having no financial risk for the physician.

Some of our health plans utilize GPA to provide
behavioral health services. We also contract with ancillary
providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy,
mental health and chemical dependency care, home healthcare,
vision care, diagnostic laboratory tests, x-ray examinations,
ambulance services and durable medical equipment. Additionally,
we contract with dental vendors in markets where routine dental
care is a covered benefit. In our healthplans, where
prescription and limited over-the-counter drugs are a covered
benefit, we have a fee-for-service arrangement with a national
pharmacy vendor that provides a pharmacy network.

Quality Management

Our medical management programs focus on
improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact
on our members. We employ strategies, including disease
management and complex case management, that are fine-tuned for
implementation in our individual markets by a system of
physician committees chaired by local physician leaders. This
process promotes physician participation and support, both
critical factors in the success of any clinical quality
improvement program.

We have implemented specialized information
systems to support our medical quality management activities.
Information is drawn from our data warehouse, clinical databases
and AMISYS as sources to identify opportunities to improve care
and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to
achieve those improvements. Some examples of these intervention
programs include:

•

a prenatal case management program to help women
    with high-risk pregnancies deliver full-term, healthy infants;

•

a program to reduce the number of inappropriate
    emergency room visits; and

•

a disease management program to improve the
    ability of those with asthma and their families to control their
    disease and thereby reduce the need for emergency room visits
    and hospitalizations.

Additionally, we provide reporting on a regular
basis using our data warehouse. State and Health Employer Data
and Information Set, or HEDIS, reporting constitutes the core of
the information base that drives our clinical quality
performance efforts. This reporting is monitored by Plan Quality
Improvement Committees and our corporate medical management team.

In order to ensure the quality of our provider
networks, we verify the credentials and background of our
providers using standards that are supported by the National
Committee for Quality Assurance.

Management Information Systems

The ability to access data and translate it into
meaningful information is essential to operating across a
multi-state service area in a cost-effective manner. Our
centralized information systems located in St. Louis,
Missouri, support our core processing functions under a set of
integrated databases and are designed to be both replicable and
scalable to accommodate internal growth and growth from
acquisitions.



We have the ability to leverage the platform we
have developed for one state for configuration into new states
or health plan acquisitions.

This integrated approach helps to assure that
consistent sources of claim and member information are provided
across all of our health plans. Our AMISYS production system is
capable of supporting over one million members.

We have a disaster recovery and business
resumption plan developed and implemented in conjunction with a
third party. This plan allows us complete access to the business
resumption centers and hot-site facilities provided by the plan.

SPECIALTY SERVICES

In 2003 we entered the specialty services market.
Our specialty services are provided primarily through the
following interrelated businesses:

•

GPA

manages
    behavioral healthcare for members via a combination of owned
    clinics and a contracted network of providers. GPA works with
    providers to determine the best course of treatment for a given
    diagnosis and helps ensure members and their providers are aware
    of the full array of services available. GPA’s networks
    feature a range of services so that patients can be treated at
    an appropriate level of care. GPA also runs school-based
    programs in Arizona that focus on students with special
    education needs.

•

ScriptAssist

is a
    medication adherence program that uses psychology-based tools to
    predict which patients are likely to cease taking their
    medications, and then to motivate those at-risk patients to
    adhere to their doctors’ advice. Patients with chronic
    medical conditions frequently fail to take their medications
    properly, if at all. This generally results in increased
    hospital costs and poor outcomes for the patients. ScriptAssist
    uses registered nurses to educate patients about the reasons for
    the medications they were prescribed, to provide accurate
    information about side effects and risks of such medications,
    and to keep the doctors informed of the patients’ progress
    between visits.

•

NurseWise

provides a
    toll-free nurse triage line 24 hours per day, 7 days
    per week, 52 weeks per year. Our members call one number
    and reach customer service representatives and bilingual nursing
    staff who provide health education, triage advice and offer
    continuous access to health plan functions. Additionally, our
    representatives verify eligibility, confirm primary care
    provider assignments and provide benefit and network referral
    coordination for members and providers after business hours. Our
    staff can arrange for urgent pharmacy refills, transportation
    and qualified behavioral health professionals for crisis
    stabilization assessments. Call volume is based on membership
    levels and seasonal variation. In recent months, NurseWise has
    received from 12,000 to 19,000 inbound calls per month and has
    made over 3,000 outbound calls per month.

Currently, approximately 6% of our ambulatory
care is behavioral health related and will increase as our SSI
membership increases. Our entry into the behavioral health field
allows us to continue to offer solutions to the states in which
we have health plans as well as other states where behavioral
health for Medicaid recipients has been underserved.

CORPORATE COMPLIANCE

Our Corporate Ethics and Compliance Programs were
first established in 1998 and provide methods by which we
further enhance operations, safeguard against fraud and abuse,
improve access to quality care and help assure that our values
are reflected in everything we do.

The two primary standards by which corporate
compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are
the 1991 Federal Organizational Sentencing Guidelines and the
“Compliance Program Guidance” series issued by the
Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, of the Department of
Health and Human Services.



Our program contains each of the seven elements
suggested by the Sentencing Guidelines and the OIG guidance.
These key components are:

Our internal Corporate Compliance website,
accessible by all employees, contains our Business Ethics and
Conduct Policy; our Mission, Values and Philosophies and
Compliance Programs; a company-wide policy and procedure
database and our toll-free hotline to allow employees or other
persons to report suspected incidents of fraud, abuse or other
violations of our corporate compliance program.

COMPETITION

In the Medicaid business, our principal
competitors for state contracts, members and providers consist
of the following types of organizations:

•

Primary Care Case Management
    Programs

are programs established by
    the states through contracts with primary care providers. Under
    these programs, physicians provide primary care services to
    Medicaid recipients, as well as limited medical management
    oversight.

•

National and Regional Commercial Managed Care
    Organizations

have Medicaid or
    Medicare members in addition to members in private commercial
    plans.

•

Medicaid Managed Care
    Organizations

focus solely on
    providing healthcare services to Medicaid recipients. The vast
    majority of these operate in one city or state and are owned by
    providers, primarily hospitals. Their membership is small
    relative to the infrastructure that is required for them to do
    business. There are a few multi-state Medicaid-only
    organizations that tend to be larger in size and, therefore, are
    able to leverage their infrastructure over larger memberships.

We will continue to face varying levels of
competition as we expand in our existing service areas or enter
new markets as federal regulations require at least two
competitors in each service area. Healthcare reform proposals
may cause a number of commercial managed care organizations
already in our service areas to decide to enter or exit the
Medicaid market. The licensing requirements and bidding and
contracting procedures in some states, however, present barriers
to entry into the Medicaid managed healthcare industry.

We compete with other managed care organizations
for state contracts. In order to grant a contract, state
governments consider many factors. These factors include quality
of care, financial requirements, an ability to deliver services
and establish provider networks and infrastructure.

We also compete to enroll new members and retain
existing members. People who wish to enroll in a managed
healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a
plan based on the quality of care and services offered, ease of
access to services, a specific provider being part of the
network and the availability of supplemental benefits. In
certain markets, where recipients select a physician instead of
a health plan, we are able to grow our membership by adding new
physicians to our provider base.

We also compete with other managed care
organizations to enter into contracts with physicians, physician
groups and other providers. We believe the factors that
providers consider in deciding whether to



contract with us include existing and potential
member volume, reimbursement rates, medical management programs,
speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities.

Specialized programs that focus on specific
chronic diseases are often administered by companies that
developed comprehensive care guidelines and patient support
services appropriate to each specific disease or disorder. High
cost and high risk conditions offer the best return on
investment in these programs and a number of companies compete
for these contracts. Managed care organizations have long had
disease specific initiatives, but such programs are now offered
by pharmacy benefit managers, pharmaceutical makers and a number
of specialty companies.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION

All of our revenue is derived from operations
within the United States. Our managed care subsidiaries in
Wisconsin, Texas, Indiana and New Jersey have revenues from
their respective state governments that each exceeded 10% of
consolidated revenues in 2003. Our operations in Ohio began on
January 1, 2004. Other financial information about our
segments is found in Note 20 of our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

REGULATION

Our healthcare and specialty operations are
regulated at both state and federal levels. Government
regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services
is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. Regulatory agencies generally have discretion to
issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules.
Changes in applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically.

Managed Care Organizations

Our five health plan subsidiaries are licensed to
operate as health maintenance organizations in each of
Wisconsin, Texas, Indiana, New Jersey and Ohio. In each of the
jurisdictions in which we operate, we are regulated by the
relevant health, insurance and/or human services departments
that oversee the activities of managed care organizations
providing or arranging to provide services to Medicaid enrollees.

The process for obtaining authorization to
operate as a managed care organization is lengthy and involved
and requires demonstration to the regulators of the adequacy of
the health plan’s organizational structure, financial
resources, utilization review, quality assurance programs,
complaint procedures, provider network adequacy and procedures
for covering emergency medical conditions. Under both state
managed care organization statutes and state insurance laws, our
health plan subsidiaries must comply with minimum statutory
capital requirements and other financial requirements, such as
deposit and reserve requirements. Insurance regulations may also
require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed
care organizations’ businesses and the payment of
dividends, as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds.
Our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic reporting
requirements. In addition, each health plan must meet criteria
to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before
implementing operational changes, including the development of
new product offerings and, in some states, the expansion of
service areas.

The state of Texas recently adopted a number of
new regulations that may affect our business and results of
operations. Under these regulations:



Medicaid

In order to be a Medicaid managed care
organization in each of the states in which we operate, we must
operate under a contract with the state’s Medicaid agency.
States generally use either a formal proposal process, reviewing
a number of bidders, or award individual contracts to qualified
applicants that apply for entry to the program.

We have entered into a contract with the
Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services to provide
Medicaid services. The contract commenced January 1, 2002
and has been extended to April 30, 2004. We expect to renew
this contract for an additional term ending December 31,
2005. The contract can be terminated if a change in state or
federal laws, rules or regulations materially affects either
party’s rights or responsibilities under the contract. We
have held a contract with the State of Wisconsin for
20 years. We receive monthly payments under the contract
based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial
basis.

We have also entered into an agreement with
Network Health Plan of Wisconsin, Inc. pursuant to which Network
Health Plan subcontracts to us their Medicaid services under its
contract with the State of Wisconsin. The agreement commenced
January 1, 2001 and has a scheduled termination of
December 31, 2006. The agreement renews automatically for
successive five-year terms and can be terminated by either party
upon two-years notice prior to the end of the then current term.
The agreement may also be terminated if a change in state or
federal laws, rules or regulations materially affects either
party’s rights or responsibilities under the contract, or
if Network Health Plan’s contract with the State of
Wisconsin is terminated. We receive a monthly payment based on a
percentage of all premium and supplemental payments and other
compensation received by Network Health Plan from the State of
Wisconsin.

We presently are party to several contracts with
the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to provide
Medicaid and SCHIP managed care services in our Texas markets
through our Superior HealthPlan, Inc. subsidiary. Our Texas
Medicaid contracts commenced September 1, 2001 and have
scheduled termination dates of August 31, 2004. Each
Medicaid contract is renewable for an additional one-year
period. Our SCHIP contract began on October 1, 2002 and is
scheduled to end on August 31, 2004. The contracts
generally may be terminated upon any event of default or in the
event state or federal funding for Medicaid programs is no
longer available. We have held a contract with the State of
Texas since 1999. We receive monthly payments under each of our
Texas contracts based on specified capitation rates determined
on an actuarial basis.

We have entered into a contract with the Indiana
Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning and Office of the
Children’s Health Insurance Program to provide Indiana
Medicaid and Indiana Children’s Health Insurance Program
services. The contract commenced January 1, 2003 and has a
scheduled termination date of December 31, 2004. This
contract may be terminated by the State without cause upon sixty
days prior written notice. We have held a contract with the
State of Indiana since 1993. We are paid based on specified
capitation rates for our services.

As part of the acquisition of UHP, we obtained a
contract with the State of New Jersey Department of Human
Services to provide Medicaid and SCHIP services. The contract
commenced on July 1, 2002 and had an initial scheduled
termination date of June 30, 2003, but has been renewed
through June 30, 2004. The agreement is renewable annually
for successive twelve-month periods. The contract may be
terminated by the State for event of default or significant
change in circumstances. UHP has held a contract with the State
of New Jersey since 1994. We receive monthly payments based on
specified capitation rates for our services.

In conjunction with the asset purchase from FHP,
we entered into a contract with the Ohio Department of Job and
Family Services to provide Medicaid services. The contract
commenced January 1, 2004 and has a scheduled termination
date of June 30, 2004. The agreement is renewable annually
for successive twelve-month periods. The contract may be
terminated by the State for event of default. We are paid based
on specified capitation rates for our services.



Our contracts with the states and regulatory
provisions applicable to us generally set forth in great detail
the requirements for operating in the Medicaid sector, including
provisions relating to:

A health plan’s compliance with these
requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by
CMS. A health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive
quality assurance evaluations by a third party reviewing
organization and generally by the insurance department of the
jurisdiction that licenses the health plan. A health plan must
also submit many reports to various regulatory agencies,
including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements
and utilization reports.

HIPAA

In 1996, Congress enacted the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. The Act is
designed to improve the portability and continuity of health
insurance coverage and simplify the administration of health
insurance claims. One of the main requirements of HIPAA is the
implementation of standards for the processing of health
insurance claims and for the security and privacy of
individually identifiable health information.

In August 2000, the Department of Health and
Human Services, or HHS, issued new standards for submitting
electronic claims and other administrative healthcare
transactions. The new standards were designed to streamline the
processing of claims, reduce the volume of paperwork and provide
better service. The administrative and financial healthcare
transactions covered include:

Health plans other than certain smaller health
plans were required to comply with the new standards by October
2002, but the deadline was extended to October 2003 for health
plans that submitted a written compliance plan to CMS by October
2002. The regulation’s requirements apply to transactions
conducted using “electronic media.” Since
“electronic media” is defined broadly to include
“transmissions that are physically moved from one location
to another using magnetic tape, disk or compact disk
media,” many communications are considered electronically
transmitted. Under the regulations, health plans are required to
have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in
a standardized electronic format. The regulation sets forth
other rules that apply specifically to health plans as follows:

•

a plan may not delay processing of a standard
    transaction (that is, it must complete transactions using the
    new standards at least as quickly as it had prior to
    implementation of the new standards);



On December 28, 2000, HHS published final
regulations setting forth new standards for protecting the
privacy of individually identifiable health information in any
medium. These regulations were modified by additional
regulations published on August 14, 2002, in which HHS
addressed some of the implementation concerns on the part of the
healthcare industry that had been raised by the initial final
rule. The regulations are designed to protect medical records
and other personal health information maintained and used by
healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare
clearinghouses. Compliance with the privacy regulations was
required by April 2003, except for certain small health plans
which have until April 2004. We have implemented processes,
policies and procedures to comply with the HIPAA privacy
regulations. All employees received education and training
regarding the new privacy requirements. In addition, the
corporate privacy officer and health plan privacy officials
serve as resources to employees to address any questions or
concerns they may have. Among numerous other requirements, the
new standards:

The preemption provisions of HIPAA provide that
the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more
stringent than the related federal requirements. In addition,
the Secretary of HHS may grant exceptions allowing state laws to
prevail if one or more of a number of conditions are met,
including but not limited to the following:

In February 2003, HHS published final regulations
relating to the security of electronic individually identifiable
health information. These rules require healthcare providers,
health plans and healthcare clearinghouses to implement
administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the
privacy and confidentiality of such information when it is
electronically stored, maintained or transmitted through such



devices as user authentication mechanisms and
system activity audits. The compliance deadline for the security
regulations is April 21, 2005.

Patients’ Rights Legislation

The United States Senate and House of
Representatives passed different versions of patients’
rights legislation in June and August 2001, respectively. Both
versions included provisions that specifically apply protections
to participants in federal healthcare programs, including
Medicaid beneficiaries. Although no version of this type of
federal legislation has yet to become law, patients’ rights
proposals are currently pending in Congress. If enacted, this
type of legislation could expand our potential exposure to
lawsuits and increase our regulatory compliance costs. Depending
on the final form of any patients’ rights legislation, such
legislation could, among other things, expose us to liability
for economic and punitive damages for making determinations that
deny benefits or delay beneficiaries’ receipt of benefits
as a result of our medical necessity or other coverage
determinations. We cannot predict when or whether patients’
rights legislation will be enacted into law or, if enacted, what
final form such legislation might take.

Other Fraud and Abuse Laws

Investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud
and abuse became a top priority for law enforcement entities in
the last decade. The focus of these efforts has been directed at
participants in public government healthcare programs such as
Medicaid. The laws and regulations relating to Medicaid fraud
and abuse and the contractual requirements applicable to plans
participating in these programs are complex and changing and
will require substantial resources.

EMPLOYEES

As of January 31, 2004, we had approximately
950 employees. Our employees are not represented by a
union. We believe our relationships with our employees are good.

Item 2.

Properties

In 2003, we acquired the building in St. Louis,
Missouri which houses our corporate headquarters. We purchased
the building in order to ensure the continuity of our
operations. The building contains approximately
98,000 square feet of office space, of which we occupy
approximately 58,000 square feet. The remaining space is
either leased to third parties or available to support our
expansion.

We lease space in each of the areas where our
health plans and specialty companies operate. We are required by
various insurance and Medicaid regulatory authorities to have
offices in the service areas where we provide Medicaid benefits.
We believe our current facilities are adequate to meet our
operational needs for the foreseeable future.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

Aurora Health Care, Inc. (Aurora) provides
medical professional services to our Wisconsin health plan
subsidiary. In May 2003, Aurora filed a lawsuit in the Milwaukee
County Circuit Court claiming we had failed to adequately
reimburse Aurora for services rendered during the period from
1998 to 2003. The claim seeks damages totaling
$9.4 million. We dispute the claim, have filed answer and
discovery requests against Aurora, and plan to vigorously defend
against the matter.

We are routinely subject to legal proceedings in
the normal course of business. While the ultimate resolution of
such matters are uncertain, we do not expect the result of these
matters to have a material effect on our financial position or
results of operations.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the
related notes included elsewhere in this filing. The discussion
contains forward-looking statements that involve known and
unknown risks and uncertainties, including those set forth below
under “Factors That May Affect Future Results and The
Trading Price of Our Common Stock.”

OVERVIEW

We are a multi-line managed care organization
that provides Medicaid and Medicaid-related programs to
organizations and individuals through government subsidized
programs, including Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).
We have health plans in Wisconsin, Texas, Indiana, New Jersey
and Ohio. We also provide specialty services in Texas,
California, Arizona, Colorado, Wisconsin and Indiana. These
specialty services include behavioral health, nurse triage and
pharmacy compliance.

We have organized this Management’s
Discussion and Analysis to address the following:

RECENT ACQUISITIONS

Effective January 1, 2004, we commenced
operations in Ohio through the acquisition of the
Medicaid-related assets of Family Health Plan, Inc., a
subsidiary of Mercy Health Partners, for a purchase price of
$6.8 million. This transaction includes the right to serve
up to 24,000 of FHP’s Medicaid members in Toledo, Ohio, a
new market for us. While we did incur start-up cost in 2003, the
results of operations of this entity will be included in our
consolidated financial statements beginning January 1, 2004.

Effective August 1, 2003, we acquired the
Medicaid-related contract rights of HMO Blue Texas in the
San Antonio, Texas market. This transaction allows us to
serve approximately 17,000 additional members in the State.
Our purchase price was $1.0 million. We allocated the
entire purchase price to acquired contracts. The contracts are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of five
years, the expected period of benefit.

During 2003, we acquired a 100% ownership
interest in Group Practice Affiliates, LLC (63.7% in March 2003
and 36.3% in August 2003). GPA, a behavioral healthcare services
company, serves over 700,000 individuals in five states
through a combination of networks, groups and schools, including
a portion of our membership. This acquisition is consistent with
our strategy to provide diversified medical services to the
managed Medicaid population. We paid an aggregate purchase price
of $1.8 million for GPA, resulting in goodwill of
$3.9 million.

In March 2003, we purchased certain assets of
ScriptAssist, a medication compliance company. We are
administering the purchased contracts under the ScriptAssist
name. ScriptAssist uses various approaches and medical expertise
to promote adherence to prescription drugs. The asset
acquisition is consistent with our strategy to provide
diversified medical services to the managed Medicaid population.



The purchase price of $563,000 was allocated to
acquired contracts. We are amortizing the contracts on a
straight-line basis over five years, the expected period of
benefit.

On December 1, 2002, we acquired 80% of the
outstanding capital stock of University Health Plans, Inc. from
University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. In October
2003 we exercised our option to purchase the remaining 20%. UHP
is a managed health plan operating in 20 counties in New Jersey.
We paid an aggregate purchase price of $13.3 million for
our interest in UHP. The purchase price allocation resulted in
intangible assets of $3.8 million representing provider
contracts and purchased contract rights, which are being
amortized over 10 years, and goodwill of $7.9 million.

In June 2002, we entered into an agreement with
Texas Universities Health Plan Inc. to purchase the SCHIP
contracts in three Texas service areas, thereby adding
approximately 24,000 members to our Texas health plan. The cash
purchase price of $595,000 was recorded as purchased contract
rights, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over
five years, the expected period of benefit.

With our acquisition of GPA and our purchase of
ScriptAssist assets, we began operating in two segments:
Medicaid Managed Care and Specialty Services. The Medicaid
Managed Care segment consists of our health plans, including all
of the functions needed to operate them. The Specialty Services
segment consists of our specialty services, including our
behavioral health, nurse triage and pharmacy compliance
functions.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our significant accounting policies are more
fully described in Note 3 to our annual consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere herein. Two of our
accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal
of our financial position and results of operations and require
the application of significant judgment by our management. As a
result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.

Medical Claims Liabilities

Our medical costs include claims paid, claims
adjudicated but not yet paid, estimates for claims received but
not yet adjudicated, estimates for claims incurred but not
reported and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid
claims. We, together with our independent actuaries, estimate
medical claims liabilities using actuarial methods based upon
historical data for payment patterns, cost trends, product mix,
seasonality, utilization of healthcare services and other
relevant factors. These estimates are continually reviewed and
adjustments, if necessary, are reflected in the period known.

In applying this policy, our management uses its
judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the
determination of the required estimates. While we believe these
estimates are appropriate, it is possible future events could
require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to
these estimates. For example, a 1% increase or decrease in our
health benefits ratio would have affected net earnings by
$4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The
estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of
existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry,
information provided by our customers and information available
from other outside sources, as appropriate.



The change in medical claims liabilities is
summarized as follows (in thousands):

Acquisitions in 2003 and 2002 include reserves
acquired in connection with our acquisition of UHP. Acquisitions
in 2001 include reserves acquired in connection with our
acquisition of the remaining shares of Superior HealthPlan.

Changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior
years were attributable to favorable development in all of our
markets, including lower than anticipated utilization of medical
services.

Intangible Assets

We have made several acquisitions since 2001 that
have resulted in our recording of intangible assets. These
intangible assets primarily consist of purchased contract
rights, provider contracts and goodwill. Purchased contract
rights are amortized using the straight-line method over periods
ranging from 60 to 120 months. Provider contracts are
amortized using the straight-line method over 120 months.

Our management evaluates whether events or
circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful
life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill
and other identifiable intangible assets. Impairment of an
intangible asset is triggered when the estimated future
undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount of the
intangible asset and related goodwill. If the events or
circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the
intangible asset and goodwill may be permanently impaired, the
potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference
between the carrying amount of the intangible asset and goodwill
and the fair value of such asset determined using the estimated
future discounted cash flows generated from the use and ultimate
disposition of the respective acquired entity. Our management
must make assumptions and estimates, such as the discount
factor, in determining the estimated fair values. While we
believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate, other
assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce
significantly different results.

Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for
impairment. In addition, we will perform an impairment analysis
of intangible assets more frequently based on other factors.
These factors would include significant changes in membership,
state funding, medical contracts and provider networks and
contracts. We did not recognize any impairment losses during the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 or 2001.

REVENUE AND EXPENSE DISCUSSION AND KEY
METRICS

We are providing certain non-GAAP financial
measures in this discussion of revenues and expenses which
exclude the impact of a newly enacted premium tax which totaled
$1.4 million in 2003. We believe that these figures are
helpful in allowing the reader to more accurately assess the
ongoing nature of our



operations and measure our performance more
consistently. We use the presented non-GAAP financial measures
internally to focus management on period-to-period changes in
our business. Therefore, we believe that this information is
meaningful in addition to the information contained in the GAAP
presentation of financial information. The presentation of this
additional non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial
information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.

Revenues

We generate revenues in our Medicaid Managed Care
segment primarily from premiums we receive from the states in
which we operate to provide health benefits to our members. We
receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our
state contracts. We generally receive premiums during the month
we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the
period in which we are obligated to provide services to our
members.

Our Specialty Services companies generate
revenues from a variety of sources. Our behavioral health
company generates revenue via capitation payments from our
health plans and others. It also receives fees for the direct
provision of care and certain school programs in Arizona. Our
pharmacy compliance program receives fee income from the
manufacturers of pharmaceuticals. NurseWise receives fees from
health plans, physicians and other organizations for providing
continuous access to nurse advisors.

Premiums collected in advance are recorded as
unearned revenue. Premiums due to us are recorded as premium and
related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based
on historical trends and our management’s judgment on the
collectibility of these accounts. As we generally receive
premiums during the month in which services are provided, the
allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total
premium revenue and does not have a material impact on the
presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial
position or results of operations.

The primary drivers of our increasing revenue
have been membership growth in our Medicaid Managed Care segment
and our entry into the Specialty Services segment. We have
increased our membership through internal growth and
acquisitions. From December 31, 2001 to December 31,
2003, we increased our membership by 108%. The following table
sets forth our membership by state:

The following table sets forth our membership by
line of business:

In 2003, our membership increased by
17,000 members in Texas due to the purchase of contract
rights from HMO Blue Texas. Our membership increased in all our
markets from additions to our provider network, increases in
counties served and growth in the number of Medicaid
beneficiaries.



In 2002, our membership increased by
24,000 members in Texas due to the purchase of SCHIP
contract rights from Texas Universities Health Plan. In
addition, two smaller plans exited the Austin, Texas market. As
a result, our Texas plan increased its membership by
28,000 lives. This increase includes 12,000 lives that
we are managing for the state of Texas on an interim basis and
that will become part of a reprocurement process scheduled for
mid-2004. We entered the New Jersey market through our
acquisition of UHP. Membership increases in our Wisconsin and
Indiana markets resulted from additions to our provider network
and growth in the number of Medicaid beneficiaries.

Operating Expenses

Our operating expenses include medical costs,
cost of services, and general and administrative expenses.

Our medical costs include payments to physicians,
hospitals, and other providers for healthcare and specialty
product claims. Medical costs also include estimates of medical
expenses incurred but not yet reported, or IBNR. Monthly, we
estimate our IBNR based on a number of factors, including
inpatient hospital utilization data and prior claims experience.
As part of this review, we also consider the costs to process
medical claims and estimates of amounts to cover uncertainties
related to fluctuations in physician billing patterns,
membership, products and inpatient hospital trends. These
estimates are adjusted as more information becomes available. We
utilize the services of independent actuaries who are contracted
to review our estimates quarterly. While we believe that our
process for estimating IBNR is actuarially sound, we cannot
assure you that healthcare claim costs will not materially
differ from our estimates.

Our results of operations depend on our ability
to manage expenses related to health benefits and to accurately
predict costs incurred. Our health benefits ratio represents
medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues and reflects
the direct relationship between the premium received and the
medical services provided. The table below depicts our health
benefits ratios by member category and in total:

Our Medicaid and SCHIP ratio decreased in 2003
from 2002 due primarily to initiatives to reduce inappropriate
emergency department usage and to establish preferred drug lists
such as generics. The addition of the SSI members in New Jersey
in December 2002 has caused our total health benefits ratio to
increase slightly. The health benefits ratio for SSI is affected
by a low membership base and is subject to greater volatility as
a percentage of premiums (although relatively immaterial in
total dollars to total medical costs). We expect the health
benefits ratio for SSI to decrease as these members become fully
integrated into our medical management programs, as our
membership base grows within the State of New Jersey and as our
membership base grows in other markets.

Our cost of services expenses include all direct
costs to support the local functions responsible for generation
of our services revenues. These expenses primarily consist of
the salaries and wages of the physicians, clinicians, therapists
and teachers who provide the services and expenses related to
the clinics and supporting facilities and equipment used to
provide services.

Our general and administrative expenses primarily
reflect wages and benefits and other administrative costs
related to health plans, specialty companies and our centralized
functions that support all of our business units. The major
centralized functions are claims processing, information systems
and finance. In September 2003, concurrent with a rate increase
received in one state, we began to be charged premium taxes by
that state. Premium taxes are classified as general and
administrative expenses. Our general and administrative expense
ratio represents general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of total revenues and reflects the relationship
between revenues earned and the costs necessary to drive those



revenues. The following table sets forth the
general and administrative expense ratios by business segment
and in total:

*

excluding effect of premium tax

The improvement in the Medicaid Managed Care
general and administrative expenses ratio reflects growth in
membership and leveraging of our overall infrastructure. This
ratio decreased in 2003 from 2002 despite 1) the levying of
the premium tax from one of our states which resulted in
$1.4 million additional general and administrative expense,
2) increased spending on tax planning initiatives and
3) start-up costs, primarily in the fourth quarter, related
to our new health plan in Ohio. The Specialty Services ratio may
vary depending on the various contracts and nature of the
service provided and will have a higher general and
administrative expense ratio than the Medicaid Managed Care
segment.

Other Income (Expense)

Other income (expense) consists principally
of investment and other income and interest expense.

•

Investment income is derived from our cash, cash
    equivalents and investments. Information about our investments
    is included below under “Liquidity and Capital
    Resources.”

•

Interest expense reported in 2003 reflects
    mortgage interest on our corporate headquarters’ building
    and fees paid to a bank in conjunction with our credit facility.
    Interest expense reported in 2002 reflected fees paid to a bank
    in conjunction with our credit facility. Interest expense
    reported in 2001 primarily reflected interest paid on our
    subordinated notes, which we repaid in full in December 2001.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to
Year Ended December 31, 2002

Summarized comparative financial data for 2003
and 2002 are as follows ($ in millions):

Revenues

Premiums for the year ended December 31,
2003 increased 64.8% from the comparable period in 2002. This
increase was due to organic growth in our existing markets,
changes in our member mix by product category, the purchase of
the Texas contracts and the addition of our New Jersey
membership through our acquisition of UHP. In addition, we
received premium rate increases ranging from 1.0% to 7.5%, or
4.6% on a composite basis across our markets.

Services revenues increased due to an increase in
our non-risk SSI membership in our Texas market and the addition
of services revenues of GPA beginning March 1, 2003.

Operating Expenses

Medical costs increased 65.0% due to the growth
in our membership as discussed above. Our Medicaid and SCHIP
health benefits ratio decreased to 81.7% from 82.2% due in part
to our initiatives to reduce emergency department usage and to
establish preferred drug lists as previously discussed.

Cost of services increased due to the inclusion
of direct costs related to the services revenues of GPA
beginning March 1, 2003.

General and administrative expenses increased
76.3% primarily due to expenses for additional staff to support
our membership growth and expansion into the Specialty Services
segment. Additionally, general and administrative expenses
increased as a result of the institution of a premium tax, tax
planning costs incurred during the year and Ohio start-up costs
previously discussed.

Other Income

Other income (expense) in 2002 included a
one-time dividend of $5.1 million from a captive insurance
company in which we maintained an investment. Excluding this
one-time gain, other income increased from 2002 with higher
investment balances in 2003 partially offset by a lower interest
rate environment and interest expense on our corporate
headquarters’ mortgage.



Income Tax Expense

Our effective tax rate in 2003 was 37.6%,
compared to 38.0% in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to
increased levels of tax-exempt interest income and a lower
effective state tax rate.

Earnings Per Share and Shares
    Outstanding

Our earnings per share calculations reflect an
increase in the weighted average shares outstanding in 2003
primarily resulting from the follow-on offering of 3,450,000
shares sold in August 2003.

Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to
Year Ended December 31, 2001

Summarized comparative financial data for 2002
and 2001 are as follows ($ in millions):

Revenues

Premiums for the year ended December 31,
2002 increased 41.3% due to organic growth in our existing
markets, the purchase of the Texas SCHIP contracts and the
inclusion of one month of revenues of UHP. In addition, we
received premium rate increases ranging from 1.5% to 10.7%, or
5.1% on a composite basis across our markets.

Services revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2002 increased due to increases in our
non-risk SSI membership in our Texas market.

Operating Expenses

Medical costs for the year ended
December 31, 2002 increased 40.5% reflecting the growth in
our membership.

Cost of services increased $12,000 from the
comparable period in 2001. While the non-risk SSI membership
increased between periods, the cost of services remained flat as
we leveraged existing systems to support the increased
membership.

General and administrative expenses for the year
ended December 31, 2002 increased 33.1% reflecting a higher
level of wages and related expenses for additional staff to
support our membership growth.

Other Income

Other income for the year ended December 31,
2002 increased $6.0 million from 2001. A majority of the
increase was due to the receipt of a one-time dividend of
$5.1 million from a captive insurance company in which we
maintained an investment. In addition, investment income
increased due to a larger



amount of dollars invested, and interest expense
decreased year over year due to the repayment of our
subordinated debt in December 2001.

Income Tax Expense

For the year ended December 31, 2002 we
recorded income tax expense at an effective tax rate of 38.0%.
This compares to an effective tax rate of 41.5% for the year
ended December 31, 2001. Our effective tax rate decreased
year over year due to increased levels of tax-exempt interest
income and a lower effective state tax rate.

Earnings Per Share and Shares
    Outstanding

Our earnings per share calculations reflect an
increase in the weighted average shares outstanding in 2002
resulting from the follow-on offering of 705,743 shares sold in
June 2002 and 4,875,000 shares sold in our initial public
offering in December 2001.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

In August 2003, we closed our follow-on public
offering of 3,450,000 shares of common stock at
$25.00 per share. We received net proceeds totaling
$81.3 million from this offering. We intend to use our net
proceeds for working capital and other general corporate
purposes, which may include acquisitions of businesses, assets
and technologies that are complementary to our business. We may
use proceeds to acquire Medicaid and SCHIP businesses, specialty
services businesses and contract rights in order to increase our
membership and to expand our business into new service areas.

In June 2002, we closed our follow-on public
offering, whereby 7,919,258 shares were sold by selling
stockholders and 705,743 shares were sold by us at
$16.50 per share. We received net proceeds of
$10.3 million from this offering.

In December 2001, we closed our initial public
offering of 4,875,000 shares of common stock at
$9.33 per share. We received net proceeds of
$41.0 million. Prior to this offering, we financed our
operations and growth through private equity and debt financings
and internally generated funds.

Our operating activities provided cash of
$56.0 million in 2003, $39.7 million in 2002 and
$30.2 million in 2001. The increases in 2003 and 2002 were
due to continued profitability, increases in membership,
increases in medical claims liabilities and the timing of
premium receipts.

Our investing activities used cash of
$140.7 million in 2003 and $79.7 million in 2002 and
provided cash of $2.7 million in 2001. The largest
component of investing activities related to increases in our
investment portfolio. Our investment policies are designed to
provide liquidity, preserve capital and maximize total return on
invested assets within our investment guidelines. Net cash
provided by and used in investing activities will fluctuate from
year to year due to the timing of investment purchases, sales
and maturities. As of December 31, 2003, our investment
portfolio consisted primarily of fixed-income securities with an
average duration of 3.6 years. Cash is invested in
investment vehicles such as municipal bonds, commercial paper
and instruments of the U.S. Treasury. The states in which
we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our
regulated subsidiaries may invest their cash. The average
annualized portfolio yield was 3.7% for the year ended
December 31, 2003 and 6.9% for 2002 (exclusive of a
one-time dividend of $5.1 million from a captive insurance
company in which we maintained an investment). Our yield
decreased due to our investment in tax-advantaged securities
beginning in the fourth quarter of 2002, as well as a decrease
in the overall interest rate environment.

Our financing activities provided cash of
$89.4 million in 2003, $10.8 million in 2002 and
$37.0 million in 2001. Cash provided by financing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was
primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock
through our public offering completed in August 2003. During
2002, financing cash flows primarily consisted of the issuance
of common stock through our offering completed in June 2002.
During 2001, financing cash flows primarily consisted of the
issuance of common stock through our initial public offering net
of the repayment of subordinated notes with $4.0 million of
our proceeds.



We spent $6.6 million and $3.9 million
in 2003 and 2002, respectively, on capital assets consisting
primarily of new software, software and hardware upgrades, and
furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements related to
office and market expansions. In 2001, we purchased
$3.6 million of furniture, equipment and leasehold
improvements due to the addition of the Austin and
San Antonio markets and the expansion of the Wisconsin
market. We anticipate spending $10.5 million on additional
capital expenditures in 2004 related to office and market
expansions and system upgrades.

In July 2003, we purchased the building in which
our corporate headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri is located for
an aggregate purchase price of $12.6 million. We financed a
portion of the purchase price through an $8.0 million
non-recourse mortgage loan arrangement. The mortgage bears
interest at the prevailing prime rate less .25%. At
December 31, 2003, our mortgage bore interest at 3.75%.

At December 31, 2003, we had working
capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of
$(18.5) million as compared to $(8.8) million at
December 31, 2002. Our working capital is negative due to
our efforts to increase investment returns through purchases of
investments that have maturities of greater than one year and,
therefore, are classified as long-term. Our investment policies
are also designed to provide liquidity and preserve capital. We
manage our short-term and long-term investments to ensure that a
sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid
and can be sold to fund working capital as needed.

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
were $79.5 million at December 31, 2003 and
$69.2 million at December 31, 2002. Long-term
investments were $205.2 million at December 31, 2003
and $95.4 million at December 31, 2002, including
restricted deposits of $20.4 million and
$15.8 million, respectively. Cash and investments held by
our unregulated entities totaled $126.7 million and
$52.0 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Based on our operating plan, we expect that our
available cash, cash equivalents and investments, cash from our
operations and cash available under our credit facility will be
sufficient to finance our operations and capital expenditures
for at least 12 months from the date of this filing.

CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS

Our principal contractual obligations at
December 31, 2003 consisted of obligations under operating
leases and mortgage obligations for our corporate headquarters.
The non-cancelable lease and mortgage payments over the next
five years and beyond are as follows (in thousands):

We have a $25 million revolving line of
credit facility with LaSalle Bank N.A. (LaSalle) which expires
in May 2004. The facility has interest rates based on
LaSalle’s prime rate or LIBOR. The line is secured by the
common stock of our subsidiaries. The facility includes
financial covenants, including requirements of minimum EBITDA
and minimum tangible net worth. We are required to obtain
LaSalle’s consent to any proposed acquisition that would
result in a violation of any of the covenants contained in the
facility. As of December 31, 2003, we were in compliance
with all covenants and no funds were outstanding on the facility.

REGULATORY CAPITAL AND DIVIDEND
RESTRICTIONS

Our Medicaid Managed Care operations are
conducted through our subsidiaries. As managed care
organizations, these subsidiaries are subject to state
regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of
minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state,
and restrict the timing, payment and amount of dividends and
other distributions that may be paid to us. Generally, the
amount of



dividend distributions that may be paid by a
regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory
authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of
statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus.

Our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum
capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory
authorities in each of the states in which we operate. As of
December 31, 2003, our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory
capital and surplus of $64.7 million, compared with the
required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus
requirements of $30.9 million.

The National Association of Insurance
Commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum risk-based
capital requirements for insurance companies, managed care
organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare
coverage. As of December 31, 2003, our Wisconsin, Texas and
Ohio health plans were in compliance with risk-based capital
requirements. Indiana has adopted risk-based capital rules that
will take effect as of December 31, 2004. If adopted by New
Jersey, risk-based capital may increase the minimum capital
required for our health plan in New Jersey. We continue to
monitor the requirements in Indiana and New Jersey and do not
expect that they will have a material impact on our results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements
and their effect on our financial position and results of
operations can be found in Note 3 to our annual
consolidated financial statements under the caption Recent
Accounting Pronouncements included elsewhere herein.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This filing contains forward-looking statements
that relate to future events or our future financial
performance. We have attempted to identify these statements by
terminology including “believe,”
“anticipate,” “plan,” “expect,”
“estimate,” “intend,” “seek,”
“goal,” “may,” “will,”
“should,” “can,” “continue” or the
negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These
statements include statements about our market opportunity, our
growth strategy, competition, expected activities and future
acquisitions, investments and the adequacy of our available cash
resources. These statements may be found in the sections of this
filing entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and
“Business.” Readers are cautioned that matters subject
to forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks
and uncertainties, including economic, regulatory, competitive
and other factors that may cause our or our industry’s
actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements
to be materially different from any future results, levels of
activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by
these forward-looking statements. These statements are not
guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks,
uncertainties and assumptions.

Actual results may differ from projections or
estimates due to a variety of important factors. Our results of
operations and projections of future earnings depend in large
part on accurately predicting and effectively managing health
benefits and other operating expenses. A variety of factors,
including competition, changes in health care practices, changes
in federal or state laws and regulations or their
interpretations, inflation, provider contract changes, new
technologies, government-imposed surcharges, taxes or
assessments, reduction in provider payments by governmental
payers, major epidemics, disasters and numerous other factors
affecting the delivery and cost of healthcare, such as major
healthcare providers’ inability to maintain their
operations, may in the future affect our ability to control our
medical costs and other operating expenses. Governmental action
or business conditions could result in premium revenues not
increasing to offset any increase in medical costs and other
operating expenses. Once set, premiums are generally fixed for
one-year periods and, accordingly, unanticipated costs during
such periods cannot be recovered through higher premiums. The
expiration, cancellation or suspension of our Medicaid managed
care contracts by the state governments would also negatively
impact us. Due to these factors and risks, we cannot give
assurances with respect to our future premium levels or our
ability to control our future medical costs.



FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND THE
TRADING

PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK

You should carefully consider the risks described
below before making an investment decision. The trading price of
our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, in
which case you could lose all or part of your investment. You
should also refer to the other information in this filing,
including our consolidated financial statements and related
notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are those
that we currently believe may materially affect our company.
Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or
that we currently deem immaterial also may become important
factors that affect our company.

Risks Related to Being a Regulated
Entity

Reduction in Medicaid and SCHIP Funding
    Could Substantially Reduce Our Profitability.

Most of our revenues come from Medicaid and SCHIP
premiums. The base premium rate paid by each state differs,
depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper
payment limits, a member’s health status, age, gender,
county or region, benefit mix and member eligibility categories.
Future levels of Medicaid and SCHIP premium rates may be
affected by continued government efforts to contain medical
costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary
constraints. Changes to Medicaid and SCHIP programs could reduce
the number of persons enrolled or eligible, reduce the amount of
reimbursement or payment levels, or increase our administrative
or healthcare costs under those programs. States periodically
consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend
for Medicaid and SCHIP. We believe that reductions in Medicaid
and SCHIP payments could substantially reduce our profitability.
Further, our contracts with the states are subject to
cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the
event of unavailability of state funds.

If Our Medicaid and SCHIP Contracts are
    Terminated or are Not Renewed, Our Business Will
    Suffer.

We provide managed care programs and selected
services to individuals receiving benefits under federal
assistance programs, including Medicaid, SSI and SCHIP. We
provide those healthcare services under contracts with
regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate. The
contracts expire on various dates between April 30, 2004
and December 31, 2004. Our contracts may be terminated if
we fail to perform up to the standards set by state regulatory
agencies. In addition, the Indiana contract under which we
operate can be terminated by the state without cause. Our
contracts are generally intended to run for two years and may be
extended for one or two additional years if the state or its
contractor elects to do so. When our contracts expire, they may
be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers. There
is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended.
If any of our contracts are terminated, not renewed, or renewed
on less favorable terms, our business will suffer, and our
operating results may be materially affected.

Changes in Government Regulations Designed
    to Protect Providers and Members Rather than Our Stockholders
    Could Force Us to Change How We Operate and Could Harm Our
    Business.

Our business is extensively regulated by the
states in which we operate and by the federal government. The
applicable laws and regulations are subject to frequent change
and generally are intended to benefit and protect health plan
providers and members rather than stockholders. Changes in
existing laws and rules, the enactment of new laws and rules or
changing interpretations of these laws and rules could, among
other things:



For example, Congress has considered various
forms of patient protection legislation commonly known as the
Patients’ Bill of Rights and patient protection legislation
is currently pending in Congress. We cannot predict the impact
of this legislation, if adopted, on our business.

Regulations May Decrease the Profitability
    of Our Health Plans.

Our Texas plan is required to pay a rebate to the
state in the event profits exceed established levels. Similarly,
our New Jersey plan is required to pay a rebate to the state in
the event its health benefits ratio is less than 80%. These
regulatory requirements, changes in these requirements or the
adoption of similar requirements by our other regulators may
limit our ability to increase our overall profits as a
percentage of revenues. The states of Texas, Indiana and New
Jersey have implemented prompt-payment laws and are enforcing
penalty provisions for failure to pay claims in a timely manner.
Failure to meet these requirements can result in financial fines
and penalties. In addition, states may attempt to reduce their
contract premium rates if regulators perceive our health
benefits ratio as too low. Any of these regulatory actions could
harm our operating results.

Also, on January 18, 2002, CMS published a
final rule that removed a provision contained in the federal
Medicaid reimbursement regulations permitting states to
reimburse non-state government-owned or operated hospitals for
inpatient and outpatient hospital services at amounts up to 150%
of a reasonable estimate of the amount that would be paid for
the services furnished by these hospitals under Medicaid payment
principles. The upper payment limit was reduced to 100% of
Medicare payments for comparable services. This development in
federal regulation decreased the profitability of our health
plans.

Failure to Comply With Government
    Regulations Could Subject Us to Civil and Criminal
    Penalties.

Federal and state governments have enacted fraud
and abuse laws and other laws to protect patients’ privacy
and access to healthcare. Violation of these and other laws or
regulations governing our operations or the operations of our
providers could result in the imposition of civil or criminal
penalties, the cancellation of our contracts to provide
services, the suspension or revocation of our licenses or our
exclusion from participating in the Medicaid, SSI and SCHIP
programs. If we were to become subject to these penalties or
exclusions as the result of our actions or omissions, or our
inability to monitor the compliance of our providers, it would
negatively impact our ability to operate our business. For
example, failure to pay our providers promptly could result in
the imposition of fines and other penalties. In some states, we
may be subject to regulation by more than one governmental
authority, which may impose overlapping or inconsistent
regulations.

The Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, broadened the scope of
fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies. HIPAA
created civil penalties for, among other things, billing for
medically unnecessary goods or services. HIPAA established new
enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse. Further, HIPAA
imposes civil and, in some instances, criminal penalties for
failure to comply with specific standards relating to the
privacy, security and electronic transmission of most
individually identifiable health information. It is possible
that Congress may enact additional legislation in the future to
increase penalties and to create a private right of action under
HIPAA, which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for
violations of the privacy rules.

Compliance With New Government Regulations
    May Require Us to Make Significant Expenditures.

On August 17, 2000, the United States
Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, issued a new
regulation under HIPAA requiring the use of uniform electronic
data transmission standards for



healthcare claims and payment transactions
submitted or received electronically. We were originally
required to comply with this regulation by October 16,
2003. On July 24, 2003, CMS issued guidance allowing
covered entities to implement contingency plans and accept
legacy transaction formats if they were not able to meet the
October 16th, 2003 compliance date. The objective of the
guidance was to “ensure the smooth flow of payments”
within the health care industry. Many of the states that we
operate in implemented contingency plans, which resulted in
staggered compliance dates for the organization from
October 16, 2003 to April 16, 2004.

In December 2000, HHS issued a new regulation
mandating heightened privacy and confidentiality protections
under HIPAA that became effective on April 14, 2001 and for
which compliance was required by April 14, 2003. We have
begun to integrate GPA into our privacy program. GPA’s
privacy policies and procedures are being updated to align with
our policies and procedures and all GPA employees are receiving
job specific education and training on our privacy practices.
Full integration of our privacy program at GPA is expected by
the second quarter of 2004.

On February 20, 2003 HHS published the final
HIPAA health data security regulations. The security regulations
became effective on April 21, 2003. Compliance with the
security regulations is required by April 21, 2005. These
regulations will require covered entities to implement
administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect
electronic health information maintained or transmitted by the
organization.

The issuance of future judicial or regulatory
guidance regarding the interpretation of regulations, the
states’ ability to promulgate stricter rules, and
continuing uncertainty regarding many aspects of the
regulations’ implementation may make compliance with the
relatively new regulatory landscape difficult. For example, our
existing programs and systems may not enable us to comply in all
respects with the new security regulations. In order to comply
with the regulatory requirements, we will be required to employ
additional or different programs and systems, the costs of which
were $310,000 in 2003 and are not expected to exceed $500,000 in
2004. Further, compliance with these regulations would require
changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct
our business, which may lead to additional costs that we have
not yet identified. We do not know whether, or the extent to
which, we will be able to recover from the states our costs of
complying with these new regulations. The new regulations and
the related compliance costs could have a material adverse
effect on our business.

Changes in Healthcare Law May Reduce Our
    Profitability.

Numerous proposals relating to changes in
healthcare law have been introduced, some of which have been
passed by Congress and the states in which we operate or may
operate in the future. Changes in applicable laws and
regulations are continually being considered, and
interpretations of existing laws and rules may also change from
time to time. We are unable to predict what regulatory changes
may occur or what effect any particular change may have on our
business. For example, these changes could reduce the number of
persons enrolled or eligible for Medicaid and reduce the
reimbursement or payment levels for medical services. More
generally, we are unable to predict whether new laws or
proposals will favor or hinder the growth of managed healthcare.
Legislation or regulations that require us to change our current
manner of operation, provide additional benefits or change our
contract arrangements may seriously harm our operations and
financial results.

Changes in Federal Funding Mechanisms May
    Reduce Our Profitability.

In February 2003, the Bush Administration
proposed a major long-term change in the way Medicaid and SCHIP
are funded. The proposal, if adopted, would allow states to
elect to receive combined Medicaid-SCHIP “allotments”
for acute and long-term health care for low-income, uninsured
persons. Participating states would be given flexibility in
designing their own health insurance programs, subject to
federally-mandated minimum coverage requirements. It is
uncertain whether this proposal will be enacted, or if so, how
it may change from the initial proposal. Accordingly, it is
unknown whether or how many states might elect to participate or
how their participation may affect the net amount of funding
available for Medicaid and SCHIP programs. If such a proposal is
adopted and decreases the number of persons



enrolled in Medicaid or SCHIP in the states in
which we operate or reduces the volume of healthcare services
provided, our growth, operations and financial performance could
be adversely affected.

If We Are Unable to Participate in SCHIP
    Programs, Our Growth Rate May be Limited.

SCHIP is a federal initiative designed to provide
coverage for low-income children not otherwise covered by
Medicaid or other insurance programs. The programs vary
significantly from state to state. Participation in SCHIP
programs is an important part of our growth strategy. If states
do not allow us to participate or if we fail to win bids to
participate, our growth strategy may be materially and adversely
affected.

If State Regulators Do Not Approve Payments
    of Dividends and Distributions by Our Subsidiaries to Us, We May
    Not Have Sufficient Funds to Implement Our Business
    Strategy.

We principally operate through our health plan
subsidiaries. If funds normally available to us become limited
in the future, we may need to rely on dividends and
distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations.
These subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the
amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us
without prior approval of, or notification to, state regulators.
If these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries’ request
to pay dividends to us, the funds available to our company as a
whole would be limited, which could harm our ability to
implement our business strategy.

Risks Related to Our Business

Receipt of Inadequate Premiums Would
    Negatively Affect Our Revenues and Profitability.

Nearly all of our revenues are generated by
premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member. These
premiums are fixed by contract, and we are obligated during the
contract periods to provide healthcare services as established
by the state governments. We use a large portion of our revenues
to pay the costs of healthcare services delivered to our
customers. If premiums do not increase when expenses related to
medical services rise, our earnings will be affected negatively.
In addition, our actual medical services costs may exceed our
estimates, which would cause our health benefits ratio, or our
expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium
revenues, to increase and our profits to decline. In addition,
it is possible for a state to increase the rates payable to the
hospitals without granting a corresponding increase in premiums
to us. If this were to occur in one or more of the states in
which we operate, our profitability would be harmed.

Failure to Effectively Manage Our Medical
    Costs or Related Administrative Costs Would Reduce Our
    Profitability.

Our profitability depends, to a significant
degree, on our ability to predict and effectively manage
expenses related to health benefits. We have less control over
the costs related to medical services than we do over our
general and administrative expenses. Historically, our health
benefits ratio has fluctuated. For example, our health benefits
ratio was 82.4% for the year ended December 31, 2003, 82.3%
for 2002, 82.8% for 2001 and 84.3% for 2000, but was 88.9% for
1999 and 88.4% for 1998. Because of the narrow margins of our
health plan business, relatively small changes in our health
benefits ratio can create significant changes in our financial
results. Changes in healthcare regulations and practices, the
level of use of healthcare services, hospital costs,
pharmaceutical costs, major epidemics, new medical technologies
and other external factors, including general economic
conditions such as inflation levels, are beyond our control and
could reduce our ability to predict and effectively control the
costs of providing health benefits. We may not be able to manage
costs effectively in the future. If our costs related to health
benefits increase, our profits could be reduced or we may not
remain profitable.

Failure to Accurately Predict Our Medical
    Expenses Could Negatively Affect Our Reported
    Results.

Our medical expenses include estimates of IBNR
medical expenses. We estimate our IBNR medical expenses monthly
based on a number of factors. Adjustments, if necessary, are
made to medical expenses



in the period during which the actual claim costs
are ultimately determined or when criteria used to estimate IBNR
change. We cannot be sure that our IBNR estimates are adequate
or that adjustments to those estimates will not harm our results
of operations. From time to time in the past, our actual results
have varied from our estimates, particularly in times of
significant changes in the number of our members. Our failure to
estimate IBNR accurately may also affect our ability to take
timely corrective actions, further harming our results.

Difficulties in Executing Our Acquisition
    Strategy Could Adversely Affect Our Business.

Historically, the acquisition of Medicaid
businesses, contract rights and related assets of other health
plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets has
accounted for a significant amount of our growth. For example,
our acquisition of 80% of the equity of UHP on December 1,
2002, accounted for 30.3% of the increase in our membership for
the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to 2001. Many of
the other potential purchasers of Medicaid assets have greater
financial resources than we have. In addition, many of the
sellers are interested either in (a) selling, along with
their Medicaid assets, other assets in which we do not have an
interest or (b) selling their companies, including their
liabilities, as opposed to the assets of their ongoing
businesses.

We generally are required to obtain regulatory
approval from one or more state agencies when making
acquisitions. In the case of an acquisition of a business
located in a state in which we do not currently operate, we
would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in
that state. In addition, even if we already operate in a state
in which we acquire a new business, we would be required to
obtain additional regulatory approval if the acquisition would
result in our operating in an area of the state in which we did
not operate previously and we could be required to renegotiate
provider contracts of the acquired business. We cannot assure
you that we would be able to comply with these regulatory
requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner, or at all.
In deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition, state
regulators may consider a number of factors outside our control,
including giving preference to competing offers made by locally
owned entities or by not-for-profit entities. Furthermore, our
credit facility may prohibit some acquisitions without the
consent of our bank lender.

In addition to the difficulties we may face in
identifying and consummating acquisitions, we will also be
required to integrate and consolidate any acquired business or
assets with our existing operations. This may include the
integration of:

Accordingly, we may be unable to identify,
consummate and integrate future acquisitions successfully or
operate acquired businesses profitably. We also may be unable to
obtain sufficient additional capital resources for future
acquisitions. If we are unable to effectively execute our
acquisition strategy, our future growth will suffer and our
results of operations could be harmed.

If Competing Managed Care Programs are
    Unwilling to Purchase Specialty Services From Us, We May Not be
    Able to Successfully Implement Our Strategy of Diversifying Our
    Business Lines.

We are seeking to diversify our business lines
into areas that complement our Medicaid business in order to
grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on Medicaid
risk reimbursement. In 2003, for example, we acquired GPA, a
behavioral health services company, and purchased contract and
name rights of ScriptAssist, a medication compliance company. In
order to diversify our business, we must succeed in selling the
services of GPA, ScriptAssist and any other specialty
subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans, but to programs
operated by third-parties. Some of these third-party programs
may compete with us in some markets, and they therefore may be
unwilling to purchase specialty services from



us. In any event, the offering of these services
will require marketing activities that differ significantly from
the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our
Medicaid programs. Our inability to market specialty services to
other programs may impair our ability to execute our business
strategy.

Failure to Achieve Timely Profitability in
    Any Business Would Negatively Affect Our Results of
    Operations.

Start-up costs associated with a new business can
be substantial. For example, in order to obtain a certificate of
authority in most jurisdictions, we must first establish a
provider network, have systems in place and demonstrate our
ability to obtain a state contract and process claims. If we
were unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary license, winning
the bid to provide service or attracting members in numbers
sufficient to cover our costs, any new business of ours would
fail. We also could be obligated by the state to continue to
provide services for some period of time without sufficient
revenue to cover our ongoing costs or recover start-up costs.
The expenses associated with starting up a new business could
have a significant impact on our results of operations if we are
unable to achieve profitable operations in a timely fashion.

We Derive a Majority of Our Premium
    Revenues From Operations in Five States, and Our Operating
    Results Would be Materially Affected by a Decrease in Premium
    Revenues or Profitability in Any One of Those
    States.

Operations in Wisconsin, Texas, Indiana,
New Jersey and Ohio account for a majority of our premium
revenues. If we were unable to continue to operate in each of
those states or if our current operations in any portion of one
of those states were significantly curtailed, our revenues would
decrease materially. Our reliance on operations in a limited
number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to
change suddenly and unexpectedly, depending on legislative
actions, economic conditions and similar factors in those
states. Our inability to continue to operate in any of the
states in which we operate would harm our business.

Competition May Limit Our Ability to
    Increase Penetration of the Markets That We Serve.

We compete for members principally on the basis
of size and quality of provider network, benefits provided and
quality of service. We compete with numerous types of
competitors, including other health plans and traditional state
Medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided.
Subject to limited exceptions by federally approved state
applications, the federal government requires that there be
choices for Medicaid recipients among managed care programs.
Voluntary programs and mandated competition may limit our
ability to increase our market share.

Some of the health plans with which we compete
have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader
scope of products than we do. In addition, significant merger
and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care
industry, as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us,
such as the hospital, physician, pharmaceutical, medical device
and health information systems businesses. To the extent that
competition intensifies in any market that we serve, our ability
to retain or increase members and providers, or maintain or
increase our revenue growth, pricing flexibility and control
over medical cost trends may be adversely affected.

In addition, in order to increase our membership
in the markets we currently serve, we believe that we must
continue to develop and implement community-specific products,
alliances with key providers and localized outreach and
educational programs. If we are unable to develop and implement
these initiatives, or if our competitors are more successful
than we are in doing so, we may not be able to further penetrate
our existing markets.

If We are Unable to Maintain Satisfactory
    Relationships With Our Provider Networks, Our Profitability Will
    be Harmed.

Our profitability depends, in large part, upon
our ability to contract favorably with hospitals, physicians and
other healthcare providers. Our provider arrangements with our
primary care physicians,



specialists and hospitals generally may be
cancelled by either party without cause upon 90 to
120 days’ prior written notice. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts
or enter into new contracts enabling us to service our members
profitably.

From time to time providers assert or threaten to
assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due
to alleged actions or inactions by us. Even if these allegations
represent attempts to avoid or renegotiate contractual terms
that have become economically disadvantageous to the providers,
it is possible that in the future a provider may pursue such a
claim successfully. In addition, we are aware that other managed
care organizations have been subject to class action suits by
physicians with respect to claim payment procedures, and we may
be subject to similar claims. Regardless of whether any claims
brought against us are successful or have merit, they will still
be time-consuming and costly and could distract our
management’s attention. As a result, we may incur
significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business
effectively.

We will be required to establish acceptable
provider networks prior to entering new markets. We may be
unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on
a timely basis or under favorable terms.

If we are unable to retain our current provider
contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on
favorable terms, our profitability will be harmed.

We May be Unable to Attract and Retain Key
    Personnel.

We are highly dependent on our ability to attract
and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our
business. If we lose one or more members of our senior
management team, including our chief executive officer, Michael
F. Neidorff, who has been instrumental in developing our
business strategy and forging our business relationships, our
business and operating results could be harmed. We do not have
an employment agreement with Mr. Neidorff, and we cannot
assure you that we will be able to retain his services. Our
ability to replace any departed members of our senior management
or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended
period of time because of the limited number of individuals in
the Medicaid managed care and specialty services industry with
the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and
successfully expand a business such as ours. Competition to hire
from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire,
train, retain or motivate these personnel.

Negative Publicity Regarding the Managed
    Care Industry May Harm Our Business and Operating
    Results.

Recently, the managed care industry has received
negative publicity. This publicity has led to increased
legislation, regulation, review of industry practices and
private litigation in the commercial sector. These factors may
adversely affect our ability to market our services, require us
to change our services, and increase the regulatory burdens
under which we operate. Any of these factors may increase the
costs of doing business and adversely affect our operating
results.

Claims Relating to Medical Malpractice
    Could Cause Us to Incur Significant Expenses.

Our providers and employees involved in medical
care decisions may be subject to medical malpractice claims. In
addition, some states, including Texas, have adopted legislation
that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for
negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage
determinations. Claims of this nature, if successful, could
result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers
that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance
coverage. Therefore, successful malpractice or tort claims
asserted against us, our providers or our employees could
adversely affect our financial condition and profitability. Even
if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without
merit, they would still be time-consuming and costly and could
distract our management’s attention. As a result, we may
incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our
business effectively.



Loss of Providers Due to Increased
    Insurance Costs Could Adversely Affect Our
    Business.

Our providers routinely purchase insurance to
help protect themselves against medical malpractice claims. In
recent years, the costs of maintaining commercially reasonable
levels of such insurance have increased dramatically, and these
costs are expected to increase to even greater levels in the
future. As a result of the level of these costs, providers may
decide to leave the practice of medicine or to limit their
practice to certain areas, which may not address the needs of
Medicaid participants. We rely on retaining a sufficient number
of providers in order to maintain a certain level of service. If
a significant number of our providers exit our provider networks
or the practice of medicine generally, we may be unable to
replace them in a timely manner, if at all, and our business
could be adversely affected.

Growth in the Number of Medicaid-Eligible
    Persons During Economic Downturns Could Cause Our Operating
    Results and Stock Prices to Suffer if State and Federal Budgets
    Decrease or Do Not Increase.

Less favorable economic conditions may cause our
membership to increase as more people become eligible to receive
Medicaid benefits. During such economic downturns, however,
state and federal budgets could decrease, causing states to
attempt to cut healthcare programs, benefits and rates. We
cannot predict the impact of changes in the United States
economic environment or other economic or political events,
including acts of terrorism or related military action, on
federal or state funding of healthcare programs or on the size
of the population eligible for the programs we operate. If
federal funding decreases or remains unchanged while our
membership increases, our results of operations will suffer.

Growth in the Number of Medicaid-Eligible
    Persons May be Countercyclical, Which Could Cause Our Operating
    Results to Suffer When General Economic Conditions are
    Improving.

Historically, the number of persons eligible to
receive Medicaid benefits has increased more rapidly during
periods of rising unemployment, corresponding to less favorable
general economic conditions. Conversely, this number may grow
more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve.
Therefore, improvements in general economic conditions may cause
our membership levels to decrease, thereby causing our operating
results to suffer, which could lead to decreases in our stock
price during periods in which stock prices in general are
increasing.

We Intend to Expand Our Medicaid Managed
    Care Business Primarily into Markets Where Medicaid Recipients
    are Required to Enroll in Managed Care Plans.

We expect to continue to focus our business in
states in which Medicaid enrollment in managed care is
mandatory. Currently, approximately two-thirds of the states
require health plan enrollment for Medicaid eligible
participants in all or a portion of their counties. The programs
are voluntary in other states. Because we concentrate on markets
with mandatory enrollment, we expect the geographic expansion of
our Medicaid Managed Care segment to be limited to those states.

If We are Unable to Integrate and Manage
    Our Information Systems Effectively, Our Operations Could be
    Disrupted.

Our operations depend significantly on effective
information systems. The information gathered and processed by
our information systems assists us in, among other things,
monitoring utilization and other cost factors, processing
provider claims, and providing data to our regulators. Our
providers also depend upon our information systems for
membership verifications, claims status and other information.

Our information systems and applications require
continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement to meet our
operational needs. Moreover, our acquisition activity requires
frequent transitions to or from, and the integration of, various
information systems. We regularly upgrade and expand our
information systems capabilities. If we experience difficulties
with the transition to or from information systems or are unable
to properly maintain or expand our information systems, we could
suffer, among other things, from operational disruptions, loss
of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members,
regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses. In
addition, our ability to integrate and manage our



information systems may be impaired as the result
of events outside our control, including acts of nature, such as
earthquakes or fires, or acts of terrorists.

We May Not be Able to Obtain or Maintain
    Adequate Insurance.

We maintain liability insurance, subject to
limits and deductibles, for claims that could result from
providing or failing to provide managed care and related
services. These claims could be substantial. We believe that our
present insurance coverage and reserves are adequate to cover
currently estimated exposures. We cannot assure you that we will
be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at
acceptable costs or that we will not incur significant
liabilities in excess of policy limits.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk

INVESTMENTS

As of December 31, 2003, we had short-term
investments of $15.2 million and long-term investments of
$205.2 million, including restricted deposits of
$20.4 million. The short-term investments consist of highly
liquid securities with maturities between three and
12 months. The long-term investments consist of municipal
bonds and U.S. Treasury investments and have original
maturities greater than one year. Restricted deposits consist of
investments required by various state statutes to be deposited
or pledged to state agencies. These investments are classified
as long-term regardless of the contractual maturity date due to
the nature of the states’ requirements. These investments
are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if
market rates increase. We have the ability to hold these
short-term investments to maturity which would mitigate the risk
of a significant increase in market rates. Assuming a
hypothetical and immediate 1% increase in market interest
rates at December 31, 2003, the fair value of our fixed
income investments would decrease by approximately
$5.8 million. Declines in interest rates over time will
reduce our investment income.

INFLATION

Although the general rate of inflation has
remained relatively stable and healthcare cost inflation has
stabilized in recent years, the national healthcare cost
inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate. We use
various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of
healthcare cost inflation. Specifically, our health plans try to
control medical and hospital costs through contracts with
independent providers of healthcare services. Through these
contracted care providers, our health plans emphasize preventive
healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital
services.

While we currently believe our strategies to
mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be
successful, competitive pressures, new healthcare and
pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from healthcare
providers and customers, applicable regulations or other factors
may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost
increases.

COMPLIANCE COSTS

Federal and state regulations governing standards
for electronic transactions, data security and confidentiality
of patient information have been issued recently. Due to the
uncertainty surrounding the regulatory requirements, we cannot
be sure that the systems and programs that we have implemented
will comply adequately with the regulations that are ultimately
adopted. Implementation of additional systems and programs will
be required, the cost of which we estimate not to exceed
$500,000 in 2004. Further, compliance with these regulations
would require changes to many of the procedures we currently use
to conduct our business, which may lead to additional costs that
we have not yet identified. We do not know whether, or the
extent to which, we will be able to recover our costs of
complying with these new regulations from the states.

Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) as of December 31, 2003. Based on this evaluation, our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded
that, as of December 31, 2003, our disclosure controls and
procedures were (1) designed to ensure that material
information relating to us, including our consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the period in which this report was being
prepared, and (2) effective, in that they provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.

No change in our internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended
December 31, 2003 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors and

Stockholders of Centene Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
earnings, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Centene Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) at
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
two years in the period ended December 31, 2003 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, which require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. The financial
statements of the Company for the year ended December 31,
2001, prior to the revisions discussed in Notes 1 and 3,
were audited by other independent accountants who have ceased
operations. Those independent accountants expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements in their
report dated February 1, 2002.

As discussed above, the financial statements of
the Company for the year ended December 31, 2001 were
audited by other independent accountants who have ceased
operations. As described in Notes 1 and 3, these financial
statements have been restated to reflect the three-for-two stock
split that was declared by the Company’s Board of Directors
on May 27, 2003 and have been revised to include the
transitional disclosures required by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, which was adopted by the Company as of January 1,
2002. We audited the adjustments described in Note 1 that
were applied to restate the 2001 financial statements and the
transitional disclosures described in Note 3. In our
opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly
applied and the transitional disclosures for 2001 in Note 3
are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review,
or apply any procedures to the 2001 financial statements of the
Company other than with respect to such adjustments and
disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or
any other form of assurance on the 2001 financial statements
taken as a whole.

The following report is a copy of the report

Corporation’s board of directors on May 27, 2003 and
have been revised to include the transitional disclosures
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which was
adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2002. This copy of
the Arthur Andersen report does not cover the adjustments to
restate the Financial Statements which is further discussed in
Note 1, or the transitional disclosures which are presented
in Note 3. The adjustments and transitional disclosures
were reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC
ACCOUNTANTS

To Centene Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Centene Corporation (a Delaware corporation)
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Centene Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States.

Organization and Operations

Centene Corporation (Centene or the Company)
provides multi-line managed care programs and related services
to individuals receiving benefits under government subsidized
programs including Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI),
and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).
Centene’s Medicaid Managed Care segment operates under its
own state licenses in Wisconsin, Texas, Indiana and New Jersey,
and contracts with other managed care organizations to provide
risk and nonrisk management services. As of January 1,
2004, the Company commenced operations under its own state
license in Ohio. Centene’s Specialty Services segment
contracts with other healthcare organizations, as well as
Centene owned companies, to provide specialty services including
behavioral health, nurse triage and pharmacy compliance.

In May 2003, the Company declared a three-for-two
stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend,
payable July 11, 2003 to shareholders of record on
June 20, 2003. All share, per share and stockholders’
equity amounts have been restated to reflect this stock split.

2.

Public Stock Offerings

In August 2003, the Company closed a follow-on
public offering of 3,450,000 shares of common stock at
$25.00 per share. Centene received net proceeds of $81,313
from this offering.

In June 2002, the Company closed a follow-on
public offering whereby 7,919,258 shares were sold by
selling stockholders and 705,743 shares were sold by the
Company at $16.50 per share. Centene received net proceeds
of $10,318 from this offering.

In December 2001, the Company completed an
initial public offering (IPO) of 4,875,000 shares of its
common stock at $9.33 per share. The net proceeds to the
Company were $41,042. In conjunction with the IPO, all
outstanding shares of preferred stock were converted into shares
of common stock in accordance with their terms.

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Centene Corporation and all
majority owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated.

Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Investments with original maturities of three
months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. Cash
equivalents consist of commercial paper, money market funds and
bank savings accounts.



CENTENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Investments

Short-term investments include securities with
maturities between three months and one year. Long-term
investments include securities with maturities greater than one
year.

Short-term and long-term investments are
classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value
based on quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses on
investments available for sale are excluded from earnings and
reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity,
net of income tax effects. Premiums and discounts are amortized
or accreted over the life of the related security using the
effective interest method. The Company monitors the difference
between the cost and fair value of investments. Investments that
experience a decline in value that is judged to be other than
temporary are written down to fair value and a realized loss is
recorded in investment and other income. To calculate realized
gains and losses on the sale of investments, the Company uses
the specific amortized cost of each investment sold. Realized
gains and losses are recorded in investment and other income.

Restricted Deposits

Restricted deposits consist of investments
required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to
state agencies. These investments are classified as long-term,
regardless of the contractual maturity date, due to the nature
of the states’ requirements. The Company is required to
annually adjust the amount of the deposit pledged to certain
states. These adjustments are funded from cash and investment
balances and are expected to total $629 in 2004.

Property, Software and
    Equipment

Property, software and equipment is stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated
principally by the straight-line method over estimated useful
lives ranging from 40 years for buildings, three years for
software and computer equipment and five to seven years for
furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated
using the straight-line method over the shorter of the expected
useful life or the remaining term of the lease ranging between
two and ten years.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets represent assets acquired in
purchase transactions and consist of purchased contract rights,
provider contracts and goodwill. Purchased contract rights are
amortized using the straight-line method over periods ranging
from 60 to 120 months. Provider contracts are amortized
using the straight-line method over 120 months.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company
ceased to amortize goodwill in accordance with
SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.” Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for
impairment. In addition, the Company will perform an impairment
analysis of intangible assets more frequently based on other
factors. Such factors would include, but are not limited to,
significant changes in membership, state funding, medical
contracts and provider networks and contracts. An impairment
loss is recognized if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the
implied fair value. The Company did not recognize any impairment
losses for the periods presented.



CENTENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The effect of this adjustment on net earnings, as
well as basic and diluted earnings per share, for the year ended
December 31, 2001 follows:

Medical Claims Liabilities

Medical services costs include claims paid,
claims adjudicated but not yet paid, estimates for claims
received but not yet adjudicated, estimates for claims incurred
but not yet received and estimates for the costs necessary to
process unpaid claims.

The estimates of medical claims liabilities are
developed using standard actuarial methods based upon historical
data for payment patterns, cost trends, product mix,
seasonality, utilization of healthcare services and other
relevant factors including product changes. These estimates are
continually reviewed and adjustments, if necessary, are
reflected in the period known. Management did not change
actuarial methods during the years presented. Management
believes the amount of medical claims payable is reasonable and
adequate to cover the Company’s liability for unpaid claims
as of December 31, 2003; however, actual claim payments may
differ from established estimates.

Premium Revenue and Related
    Receivables

The majority of the Company’s Medicaid
Managed Care premium revenue is received monthly based on fixed
rates per member as determined by the state contracts. Some
contracts allow for additional premium related to certain
supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries. The
revenue is recognized as earned over the covered period of
services. Premiums collected in advance are recorded as unearned
revenue.

The Specialty Services segment generates revenue
from capitation payments to our behavioral health company from
our health plans and others. It also receives fees for the
direct provision of care and school programs in Arizona. The
Company’s medication compliance program receives fee income
from the manufacturers of pharmaceuticals. The Company’s
nurse line product receives fees from health plans, physicians
and other organizations for providing continuous access to nurse
advisors.

Revenues due to the Company are recorded as
premium and related receivables and recorded net of an allowance
for uncollectible accounts based on historical trends and
management’s judgement on the collectibility of these
accounts.

Significant Customers

Centene receives the majority of its revenues
under contracts or subcontracts with state Medicaid managed care
programs. The contracts, which expire on various dates between
April 30, 2004 and December 31, 2004 are expected to
be renewed. Contracts with the states of Wisconsin, Texas,
Indiana and New Jersey each accounted for over 10% of the
Company’s revenues for the year ended December 31,
2003.



CENTENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Reinsurance

Centene’s Medicaid Managed Care subsidiaries
have purchased reinsurance from third parties to cover eligible
healthcare services. The current reinsurance agreements
generally cover 90% of inpatient healthcare expenses in excess
of annual deductibles of $75 to $150 per member, up to a
lifetime maximum of $2,000. The subsidiaries are responsible for
inpatient charges in excess of an average daily per diem.

Reinsurance recoveries were $5,345, $1,542 and
$3,958 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Reinsurance
expenses were approximately $6,185, $3,981 and $10,252 in 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. Reinsurance recoveries, net of
expenses, are included in medical costs.

Other Income (Expense)

Other income (expense) consists principally
of investment income and interest expense. Investment income is
derived from the Company’s cash, cash equivalents,
restricted deposits and investments. For the year ended
December 31, 2002, investment income included a $5,100
one-time dividend from a captive insurance company in which the
Company maintained an investment.

Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded
for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
the enactment date of the tax rate change.

Stock Based Compensation

The Company accounts for stock based compensation
plans in accordance with the intrinsic value based method of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 as permitted by
SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148. Compensation
cost related to stock options issued to employees is calculated
on the date of grant only if the current market price of the
underlying stock exceeds the exercise price. Compensation
expense is then recognized on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period, generally five years. The Company recognized
$188, $270 and $6 during the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, for stock based compensation
expense. Had compensation cost for the plans been determined
based on the fair value method at the grant dates as specified
in SFAS No. 123, the Company’s net earnings would
have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts:

Additional information regarding the stock option
plans is included in Note 14.

Reclassifications

Certain 2002 and 2001 amounts in the consolidated
financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
2003 presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on net
earnings or stockholders’ equity as previously reported.

Recent Accounting
    Pronouncements

In July 2001, Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,” was issued which requires that goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be
amortized, but instead tested at least annually for impairment.
The Company has adopted SFAS No. 142 effective
January 1, 2002 and goodwill amortization was discontinued.
Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. In
addition, the Company will perform an impairment analysis of
intangible assets more frequently based on other factors. Such
factors would include, but are not limited to, significant
changes in membership, state funding, medical contracts and
provider networks and contracts. The Company did not recognize
any impairment losses for the periods presented.

In June 2002, SFAS No. 146, “Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,” was
issued. It requires that a liability for a cost associated with
an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is
incurred. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal
activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The
adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 146 did not have a
material impact on the Company’s results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.

In December 2002, SFAS No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosure,” was issued. This Statement
provides alternative methods of transition for an entity that
voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this
statement requires prominent disclosures in both annual and
interim financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. SFAS No. 148 is effective for
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 and for interim
periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The adoption of
the provisions of SFAS No. 148 did not have a material
impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial
position or cash flows.

In November 2002, FASB Interpretation
No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others an interpretation of SFAS No. 5, 57,
and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34,”
was issued. This interpretation clarifies the requirements of
SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,”
relating to a guarantor’s accounting for, and disclosure
of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. The adoption of
FASB Interpretation No. 45 did not have a significant
impact on the net income or equity of the Company.

In January 2003, FASB Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
interpretation of ARB 51,” was issued. The primary
objectives of this interpretation, as amended, are to provide
guidance on the identification and consolidation of variable
interest entities, or VIE’s, which are entities for which
control is achieved through means other than through voting
rights. The Company has completed an analysis of this
Interpretation and has determined that it does not have
any VIEs.

Acquisitions

Family Health Plan, Inc.

Effective January 1, 2004, the Company
commenced operations in Ohio through the acquisition from Family
Health Plan, Inc. of certain Medicaid-related assets for a
purchase price of approximately $6,800. The cost to acquire the
Medicaid-related assets will be allocated to the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed according to estimated fair values.

HMO Blue Texas

Effective August 1, 2003, the Company
acquired certain Medicaid-related contract rights of HMO Blue
Texas in the San Antonio, Texas market for $1,045. The
purchase price was allocated to acquired contracts, which are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of five
years, the expected period of benefit.

Group Practice Affiliates

During 2003, the Company acquired a 100%
ownership interest in Group Practice Affiliates, LLC, a
behavioral healthcare services company (63.7% in March 2003 and
36.3% in August 2003). The consolidated financial statements
include the results of operations of GPA since March 1,
2003. The Company paid $1,800 for its purchase of GPA. The cost
to acquire the ownership interest has been allocated to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed according to estimated
fair values and is subject to adjustment when additional
information concerning asset and liability valuations are
finalized. The preliminary allocation has resulted in goodwill
of approximately $3,895. The goodwill is not amortized and is
not deductible for tax purposes. Pro forma disclosures related
to the acquisition have been excluded as immaterial.

ScriptAssist

In March 2003, the Company purchased contract and
name rights of ScriptAssist, LLC (ScriptAssist), a medication
compliance company. The purchase price of $563 was allocated to
acquired contracts, which are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over a period of five years, the expected period of
benefit. The investor group who held membership interests in
ScriptAssist included one of the Company’s executive
officers.

University Health Plans, Inc.

On December 1, 2002, the Company purchased
80% of the outstanding capital stock of University Health Plans,
Inc. (UHP) in New Jersey. In October 2003, the Company
exercised its option to purchase the remaining 20% of the
outstanding capital stock. Centene paid a total purchase price
of $13,258. The results of operations for UHP are included in
the consolidated financial statements since December 1,
2002.

The acquisition of UHP resulted in identified
intangible assets of $3,800, representing purchased contract
rights and provider network. The intangibles are being amortized
over a ten-year period. Goodwill of $7,940 is not amortized and
is not deductible for tax purposes. Changes during 2003 to the
preliminary purchase price allocation primarily consisted of the
purchase of the remaining 20% of the outstanding stock and the
recognition of intangible assets and related deferred tax
liabilities.



CENTENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The following unaudited pro forma information
presents the results of operations of Centene and subsidiaries
as if the UHP acquisition described above had occurred as of
January 1, 2001. These pro forma results may not
necessarily reflect the actual results of operations that would
have been achieved, nor are they necessarily indicative of
future results of operations.

Texas Universities Health
    Plan

In June 2002, the Company purchased SCHIP
contracts in three Texas service areas. The cash purchase price
of $595 was recorded as purchased contract rights, which are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over five years, the
expected period of benefit.

Bankers Reserve

In March 2002, the Company acquired Bankers
Reserve Life Insurance Company of Wisconsin for a cash purchase
price of $3,527. The Company allocated the purchase price to net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their fair
value. Centene allocated $479 to identifiable intangible assets,
representing the value assigned to acquired licenses, which are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of ten
years. The Company accounted for this acquisition under the
purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the consolidated
results of operations include the results of the acquired
Bankers Reserve business from the date of acquisition. Pro forma
disclosures related to the acquisition have been excluded as
immaterial.

As part of the acquisition, the Company acquired
$5,200 of Separate Account assets and $5,200 of Separate Account
liabilities. The acquired Separate Account assets and
liabilities represent fixed rate annuity contracts with various
maturity dates. Concurrent with the acquisition of Bankers
Reserve, the Company entered into a 100% coinsurance reinsurance
agreement with an unaffiliated party to reinsure the guaranteed
cash value, annuity benefit, surrender benefit and death
benefits associated with these contracts. The reinsurance
premiums paid for this coverage equal the net administrative fee
earned and received by the Company on the annuity contracts.
Accordingly, there is no income statement impact to the Company
as a result of acquiring the Separate Account assets and
liabilities. The Separate Account balances, which are being
liquidated and paid to insureds as annuities mature, do not have
a minimum guarantee benefit beyond the cash surrender value of
the policy. At December 31, 2003 Separate Account balances
of $3,866 are included in Other assets and Other liabilities in
the consolidated balance sheets.

Humana, Inc.

In February 2001, the Company acquired certain
contract rights in Wisconsin and Texas for a cash purchase price
of $1,250. The purchase price was allocated to purchased
contract rights which are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over five years, the period expected to be benefited.

Retirement Plan

Centene has a defined contribution plan which
covers substantially all employees who work at least
1,000 hours in a twelve consecutive month period and are at
least twenty-one years of age. Under the plan, eligible
employees may contribute a percentage of their base salary,
subject to certain limitations. Centene may elect to match a
portion of the employee’s contribution. Company
contributions to the plan were $581, $312 and $306 during the

17.

Contingencies

Aurora Health Care, Inc., or Aurora, provides
medical professional services to the Company’s Wisconsin
health plan subsidiary. In May 2003, Aurora filed a lawsuit in
the Milwaukee County Circuit Court claiming the Company had
failed to adequately reimburse Aurora for services rendered
during the period from 1998 to 2003. The claim seeks damages
totaling $9,400. The Company disputes the claim, has filed
answer and discovery requests against Aurora, and plans to
vigorously defend against the matter.

The Company is routinely subject to legal
proceedings in the normal course of business. While the ultimate
resolution of such matters are uncertain, the Company does not
expect the results of these matters to have a material effect on
its financial position or results of operations.

18.

Risks and Uncertainties

The Company’s profitability depends in large
part on accurately predicting and effectively managing medical
services costs. The Company continually reviews its premium and
benefit structure to reflect its underlying claims experience
and revised actuarial data; however, several factors could
adversely affect the medical services costs. Certain of these
factors, which include changes in healthcare practices,
inflation, new technologies, major epidemics, natural disasters
and malpractice litigation, are beyond any health plan’s
control and could adversely affect the Company’s ability to
accurately predict and effectively control healthcare costs.
Costs in excess of those anticipated could have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.

Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit and interest rate risks
consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments in
marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company
invests its excess cash in interest bearing deposits with major
banks, commercial paper, government and agency securities and
money market funds. Investments in marketable securities



CENTENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

are managed within guidelines established by the
Company’s board of directors. The Company carries these
investments at fair value.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to
accounts receivable are limited due to significant customers
paying as services are rendered. Significant customers include
the federal government and the states in which Centene operates.
The Company has a risk of incurring loss if its allowance for
doubtful accounts is not adequate.

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company has reinsurance agreements
with insurance companies. The Company monitors the insurance
companies’ financial ratings to determine compliance with
standards set by state law. The Company has a credit risk
associated with these reinsurance agreements to the extent the
reinsurers are unable to pay valid reinsurance claims of the
Company.

Earnings Per Share

The following table sets forth the calculation of
basic and diluted net earnings per share for the years ended
December 31:

The calculation of diluted earnings per common
share in 2003 excludes the impact of 658,910 shares related to
stock options which are antidilutive.

Segment Information

With the acquisition of GPA and the purchase of
ScriptAssist assets on March 1, 2003, Centene began
operating in two segments: Medicaid Managed Care and Specialty
Services. The Medicaid Managed Care segment consists of
Centene’s health plans including all of the functions
needed to operate them. The Specialty Services segment consists
of Centene’s specialty companies including behavioral
