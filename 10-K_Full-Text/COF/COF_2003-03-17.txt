Overview

Capital One Financial Corporation (the “Corporation”) is a holding company,
incorporated in Delaware on July 21, 1994, whose subsidiaries market a variety
of consumer financial products and services. The Corporation’s principal subsidiary,
Capital One Bank (the “Bank”), a limited-purpose Virginia state chartered
credit card bank, offers credit card products. The Bank originally conducted
its operations as a division of Signet Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Signet Banking Corporation (“Signet”).


Capital One, F.S.B. (the “Savings
Bank”), a federally chartered savings bank, offers consumer lending and deposit
products, and Capital One Auto Finance, Inc. (“COAF”) offers automobile and
other motor vehicle financing products. Capital One Services, Inc., another
subsidiary of the Corporation, provides various operating, administrative and
other services to the Corporation and its subsidiaries. Unless indicated
otherwise, the terms “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our” refer to the Corporation
and its consolidated subsidiaries.

We began operations as part of Signet Bank in 1953, the same year as the
formation of what is now MasterCard International, and we are one of the oldest
continually operating bank card issuers in the United States. The Bank
separated from Signet on November 24, 1994 and became a subsidiary of the
Corporation. As of December 31, 2002, we had 47.4 million accounts and $59.7
billion in managed consumer loans outstanding. We are among the six largest
issuers of Visa® and MasterCard® credit cards in the United States based on
managed credit card loans outstanding as of December 31, 2002. Important factors underlying
the growth of our managed credit card loans and accounts include credit card industry dynamics
and our business strategies around building, analyzing and applying results derived from large
quantities of data to reduce credit risk, mass customize products for consumers and improve operational
efficiency. We generally have labeled these strategies our “Information - based Strategy” or
“IBS.”

In June 1996, we established the Savings Bank to expand our product offerings
and our relationship with our cardholders. The Savings Bank currently takes
deposits and offers a variety of credit card and installment loan products.
Through the Savings Bank, we expect to offer multiple financial products and
services to existing cardholders and other households applying IBS and existing
information technology systems.

We offer credit card products outside of the United States through Capital One
Bank (Europe) plc, an indirect subsidiary of the Bank organized and located in
the United Kingdom (the “UK Bank”); a branch of the Bank in Canada; a branch
of the UK Bank in France; and through our involvement in a joint venture with a
South African financial institution. We may also, from time to time, consider
establishing our business in additional foreign jurisdictions as opportunities
arise.

We offer automobile and other motor vehicle
financing products through COAF
and its subsidiary, PeopleFirst, Inc. These financing products are
offered for the purchase of either new or used vehicles or the refinancing of
existing motor vehicle loans. We also offer other secured and unsecured
consumer lending products through our subsidiaries both in the United States
and elsewhere.

We use IBS to differentiate among customers based on credit risk, usage and
other characteristics and to match customer characteristics with appropriate
product offerings. IBS involves building sophisticated


Signet Bank and Signet Banking Corporation were acquired by First Union
National Bank and First Union Corporation, respectively, as of November 30,
1997. On September 1, 2001, First Union Corporation merged with Wachovia
Corporation and formed a new Wachovia Corporation.


models, information systems, well-trained personnel and a flexible culture to
identify, develop and market credit card or other products and services that
address the demands of changing consumer and competitive markets. By actively
testing a wide variety of product and service features, marketing channels and
other aspects of offerings, we design customized solicitations that are
targeted at various credit customer segments, thereby enhancing response levels
and maximizing returns on investment within given underwriting parameters.

We build on information derived from our initial sources with continued
integrated testing and model development to improve the quality, performance
and profitability of our solicitation and account management initiatives. We
apply IBS to all areas of our business, including solicitations, account
management, credit line management, pricing strategies, usage stimulation,
collections, recoveries, and account and balance retention as well as internal
matters such as recruiting and associate performance management.

Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol COF
and our Upper DECs® securities are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under
the symbol COFPRC. Our principal executive office is located at 1680 Capital One
Drive, McLean, Virginia 22102 (telephone number (703) 720-1000).

Business Description

Our primary business is consumer lending, with a focus on credit card lending
but including other consumer lending activities, such as unsecured installment
lending and automobile financing.

We offer a wide variety of credit card products throughout the United States
and internationally. We customize our products to appeal to
different consumer preferences and needs by combining different product
features, including annual percentage rates, fees and credit limits, rewards
programs and other special features. We routinely test new products to develop
packages that appeal to different and changing consumer preferences. Our
customized products include both products offered to a wide range of consumer
credit risk profiles, as well as products aimed at special consumer interests.
Our pricing strategies are risk-based; lower risk customers may likely be
offered products with more favorable pricing and we expect these products to
yield lower delinquencies and credit losses. On products offered to many higher
risk customers, however, we may experience higher delinquencies and losses, and
we price these products accordingly.

We also apply IBS to our automobile finance business. Through COAF, we
purchase retail installment contracts, secured by automobiles, through dealer
networks throughout the United States. Additionally, we utilize direct
marketing to offer automobile financing directly to consumers. Our direct
marketed products include financing for the purchase of new and used vehicles,
as well as refinancing of existing automobile loans. On October 9, 2001, we
acquired PeopleFirst, Inc., the nation’s largest online provider of direct
motor vehicle loans. Similar to our credit card strategy, we customize product
features, such as interest rate, loan amount, and loan terms, enabling us to
lend to customers with a wide range of credit profiles.

We also offer other consumer loan products, such as installment loan products.
On May 21, 2001, we acquired AmeriFee Corporation, which provides financing
solutions for consumers seeking elective medical and dental procedures.

Outside of the United States, we are currently operating primarily in the
United Kingdom and Canada, with additional operations in South Africa and
France. We have experienced continuing growth in the


number of accounts and loan balances in our international lending business,
with most of our growth coming from our business in the United Kingdom. Our UK
Bank has authority to accept deposits and provide credit cards and installment
loans.

We also engage in limited non-lending activities. We take deposits from
customers, which are originated through direct and indirect channels. We may
also offer products to our customers, including credit insurance, through
third-party providers.

Geographic Diversity

Loan portfolio concentration within a specific geographic region may be
regarded differently based upon the current and expected credit characteristics
and performance of the portfolio. Our consumer loan portfolio is geographically
diverse. See Note T to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72 of the
Company’s Annual Report to its stockholders for the year ended December 31,
2002 (the “Annual Report”), which is incorporated herein by reference.

Operations

U.S. Lending Segment

This segment consists of $47.3 billion of managed U.S. credit card and
installment loan receivables, marketed to customers across the full credit
spectrum.

The competitive environment in superprime credit cards is currently
intense. The lowering of interest rates by the Federal Reserve has allowed
many issuers to enter the market with sub-10% fixed annual percentage rate credit cards.
As a result
of the falling interest rates, industry mail volume to superprime customers increased
substantially in mid 2002, increasing competitive pressure on our new customer
solicitations. Our response has been to scale back our target customer base,
focusing marketing on more responsive consumers. This narrowing of our
marketing coupled with our concurrent brand campaign and other factors has had
the effect of maintaining our response rates at a level where we believe we can
continue to generate profitable returns.

The characteristics of products marketed to subprime customers include
annual membership fees, higher annual percentage rates and lower credit lines.
Additionally, higher risk borrowers
tend to be more likely to pay late or exceed their credit limit, which
generally results in additional fees assessed to their accounts.

Auto Finance Segment

This segment consists of $7.0 billion of U.S. auto loan receivables, marketed
to customers generally across the credit spectrum, via both direct
and indirect marketing channels. More than half of our 2002 auto loan growth comes via direct channels such as the
Internet and direct mail, and the remainder of our growth came via the indirect auto dealer channel. It is our goal
to become a full spectrum auto finance lender, much like we have achieved in
the U.S. credit card industry. In addition to the competitive advantages of
being a full credit spectrum lender, the scale sensitive nature of the auto
finance business generates additional economic leverage for full spectrum


competitors. The returns to achieving asset scale are not matched by a commensurate
funding advantage in our automobile lending business. As a result, in 2002, we sold a total of
$1.5 billion of
auto loans to third parties. We are continuing to service these assets for a
fee.

We anticipate continued auto finance lending activities growth and we also plan
to continue to sell and securitize our auto loans through both whole loan and
forward flow contracts. Occasionally, we expect to sell certain of these assets at a premium, servicing
released, no recourse, and with an additional performance payment in the future
depending on asset performance over time.

We have the right to repossess vehicles financed by a Capital One loan if the
obligor ceases making payments. Following any such repossession,
we generally market the repossessed car via wholesale auctions.

International Segment

This segment consists of $5.3 billion of managed credit card receivables,
principally originated and operated in the U.K., with additional operations and
activities in Canada, South Africa and France. We may also explore
and test new markets from time to time
as opportunities arise.

The U.K. market is our largest international market in terms of
accounts and outstandings, and our U.K. operations became profitable for the
first time in 2002. As of December 31, 2002, the U.K. Bank had 2.8 million
accounts and $3.9 billion in credit card, revolving loan and installment loan
assets.
The UK Bank has been operating independently in France since 2000.

Marketing

Our Core Strategy: IBS

Our core strategy has been, and is expected to continue to be, to apply our
proprietary IBS to the businesses in which we
choose to compete, principally focused on consumer lending products. We
continue to use IBS to seek to identify new product and new market
opportunities, and to make investment decisions that are informed by our
intensive testing and analysis, and deemed to be profitable for the enterprise
to pursue.


We believe we garner additional competitive advantage
by competing across the full credit spectrum in our industries and geographical
areas. Some of the benefits of competing across the full
credit spectrum are economies of scale and scope in marketing and servicing,
cross-fertilization of risk modeling and risk management insights derived by
testing and analyzing risk strategies for customers of different credit
quality, and the flexibility to divert marketing spending away from
products experiencing heavy competition and towards those products with
moderate competitive intensity in order to maximize returns over time.

Our lending products and other products are subject to intense competitive
pressures which management anticipates will continue to increase as our markets
mature, which could affect the economics of decisions that we have made or will
make in the future in ways which we did not anticipate, test, nor analyze.

We generate accounts primarily through direct mail and telemarketing
solicitations, although we also solicit accounts through other channels such as
the Internet, newspaper, magazine, partnership arrangements, radio and
television advertising and location and event marketing. Many of our
solicitations are targeted at potential customers that have been prescreened
for creditworthiness; however, many of our products are sold through marketing
channels that do not allow for prescreening, and in some locations, such as in
Canada or the U.K., prescreening information is less available or regulations
prohibit us from prescreening customers based on full credit information. We generate auto
loans through direct mail and telemarketing, and also obtain a substantial
amount of business from dealerships. We employ a national sales force to
manage dealer relationships across the country. With the acquisition of
PeopleFirst, the Internet has also become a critical channel for our auto
financing business.

We track and periodically review the results of our various solicitation
campaigns. In developing our targeting strategies, we respect the privacy of
our customers (and potential customers) by using customer information only in
accordance with our privacy policies and applicable laws. In addition, we have
also pursued a brand marketing, or “brand awareness”, campaign with the primary
intent of differentiating ourselves from other credit card issuers based on the
value proposition we offer our


customers. This strategy has helped us to build and maintain a valuable
customer franchise and support our IBS and mass customization strategies.

Risk Management

During the second quarter of 2002, Capital One conducted an assessment of its risk
management practices. The assessment identified strong risk management
activities as well as areas in which risk management could be strengthened.
The assessment resulted in the creation of an Enterprise Risk
Management (“ERM”)
function led by a Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”). The CRO has
responsibility for managing our enterprise risk management
program.

This program will consolidate and strengthen our risk management in several
categories outlined in more detail in
Risk Factors below, including credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, market risk,
legal risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, and reputational risk. As
described below, credit risk is addressed by the Credit
Risk Management (“CRM”) function led by the Chief Credit Officer. The ERM
program integrates analysis of credit risk with analysis of other risks to
produce an enterprise wide assessment of risk.

Our ERM program is a risk management approach
integrated with our strategy, processes, people, technology and knowledge on an enterprise wide
basis. The ERM program operates within a
set of guiding principles based on governance, risk processes and culture to address and manage
overall company risk.


These principles provide a framework in which we can apply a high degree of analytical rigor to our
decision making while preserving the flexibility to respond quickly to changing
market and economic conditions.

Credit Risk Management

Credit risk is one of our most important risk categories. Consequently, as part
of our risk management process, we have established stronger central control of
credit policy and programs while maintaining the ability of our operating units
to respond flexibly to changing market and competitive conditions. In 2002 we
appointed a dedicated Chief Credit Officer, expanded our central Credit Risk
Management staff, and strengthened our Credit Policy Committee. The credit
committee and staff group oversee that our credit decisions are made on a
conservative basis, that each of our units applies best practices in measuring and
managing credit risk, and that all relevant factors, including credit outlook,
profitability, and the competitive, economic, and regulatory environment are
considered in making credit decisions.

These principles are the foundation of our credit decision making approach. They
govern our selection of customers, and our approach to pricing, credit line
management, customer management, collections and recoveries. They provide a
framework in which we can apply a high degree of analytical rigor to our
decision making while preserving the flexibility to respond quickly to changing
market and economic conditions.

Our credit risk profile is managed to maintain better than average credit
quality, strong risk-adjusted returns and increased diversification. This is
accomplished by increasing growth in the prime and superprime segments of the
card business while reducing growth in underserved segments, by customizing
credit lines and product terms to each consumer segment to ensure appropriate
returns, by diversification into consumer lending products such as automobile
financing and unsecured installment lending, and by international expansion. The
centralized Credit Risk Management group monitors overall composition and
quality of the credit portfolio. We take into consideration potential
future economic conditions when monitoring and assessing our credit portfolio to
understand our credit risk profile under various stressful conditions.

Our guiding principles, strengthened central governance and
Board-directed risk tolerances, are designed to ensure that senior executives are well-informed
of credit trends and can make appropriate credit and business decisions. We encourage day-to-day market responsiveness and flexibility by
empowering our business line managers to develop credit strategies and programs
aligned with the objective of long-term business profitability. The credit
program development process considers the evolving needs of the target market,
the competitive environment and the economic outlook. It is highly analytical
and uses our extensive database of past test results. Senior Credit
Officers, who are appointed by the Credit Policy Committee, oversee credit
program development. Large new programs or program changes are reviewed by the
Credit Policy Committee or its subcommittee.

New Account Credit Operations

We rely heavily on the use of sophisticated, proprietary scoring models in most
of our new account credit operations. These models consider many variables,
including credit scores developed by nationally recognized scoring firms. We
validate, monitor and maintain these models in accordance with detailed policies
and procedures. The use of these models assists consistency and efficiency in our credit operations.

Credit evaluation begins when we select prospects for our marketing programs.
This process is called prescreening. In general, our prescreening process draws
on information from credit reporting agencies, and sometimes other data sources,
to identify consumers who are likely to be apply for and be approved for a
credit card or loan product. The criteria that drive prospect identification are
customized for each major credit program that we undertake. From time to time we
change these criteria in response to changing market conditions and new
insights. In some countries outside of the United States, it is not legally
permissible to use data from credit reporting agencies for prescreening and in
some countries there are no reliable credit reporting agencies. In these
instances, we follow a similar process using other data sources. In some
instances, we do not directly solicit prospects. This is most common in the
dealer channel and the internet channel of our auto finance business, but
happens in other businesses also. In these cases, prospects either seek us
directly or are referred by a third-party.

Credit evaluation continues during the application process. During this process,
we draw on refreshed information from credit reporting agencies, information
provided on applications, and the results of several verification procedures to
determine whether to approve or deny each application and to establish the
appropriate credit line or loan amount. In the dealer channel of our auto
finance business we also consider the characteristics of the vehicle that is
being financed. The criteria that drive application underwriting are customized
for each credit program and depend on the price, credit line and other terms
offered to the customer when we solicited them. From time to time, we change
these criteria in response to changing market conditions and new insights. Most
of the time, this decision process is entirely automated. However, we review a
small proportion of applications manually if they are rejected by our automated
scoring system, if the credit program calls for manual review, if an applicant
calls to inquire about a rejection, or for other reasons. In these instances,
our credit analysts have the ability to make credit decisions based on our
underwriting standards and their credit authority, and to override decisions
made by the system upon the receipt of additional information, often from an
applicant. In parts of our auto finance business, we rely more heavily on manual
underwriting. In these instances, credit analysts review a large proportion of
our applications. All of our credit analysts are carefully trained and are
closely monitored for compliance with our underwriting standards.


Account Management

We monitor the performance of all of our credit programs. When we identify issues, we take corrective
actions. These can include repricing, credit line decreases, more agressive collection and recovery, and
other actions. In addition, we modify our existing credit programs to reflect new learning and insights. In
the auto business, we monitor performance at each dealer in addition to monitoring our overall credit
programs. This helps us validate that these relationships are generating quality business.

We have found that active account management strategies are necessary in order
to maintain growth and support the needs of our growing customer base in
response to the changing economic environment and cardholder risk, usage and
payment patterns. We periodically evaluate all accounts in our portfolio to
determine their suitability for inclusion in various account management
programs related to adjusting credit lines, pricing, stimulating usage and retention.

For eligible accounts, such periodic review may result in more favorable
pricing, higher credit lines, product upgrades or other enhancements in order
to increase account usage or the overall profitability of an account.
Conversely, for delinquent or other accounts with significant credit risk,
periodic review may result in an account being reassigned to a higher risk
category and hence not being eligible for credit line increases or, in certain
circumstances, having pricing adjusted upward or the credit line reduced.

Our account management processes use specialized scoring models based on
information from recent credit bureau reports and customer history with us.
These scores, and other criteria, determine eligibility for our credit line
increase programs, balance transfer programs and promotional pricing programs.
They also form the basis for our retention strategies and our liquidity and
credit risk mitigation strategies.

For our retention strategies, we have developed integrated systems which
evaluate account profitability and risk, test various strategies for cost and
effectiveness in retaining cardholders and assist service representatives in
negotiating potential pricing alternatives. Some of our card products,
including those offering introductory interest rates, have a repricing feature
after an initial period. We have developed methodologies for retaining these
accounts and the balances in these accounts after the expiration of the
introductory period.

Collection Procedures

We also customize our collections strategies to determine the
appropriate timing of collection activity based on our prediction of
delinquencies and charge-offs. We generally consider a credit card account delinquent if
we have not received a minimum payment by the accountholder’s payment due date.
We currently refer delinquent accounts for contact by phone or letter between
five and 60 days


after contractual delinquency.
We design our policies and procedures to encourage accountholders to pay
delinquent amounts; for example, once a delinquent account has re-established a
payment pattern with three consecutive minimum monthly payments, it can be
re-aged as current. In the United States, federal guidelines restrict how frequently an
account can be re-aged, renewed or extended. Our re-aging policies for our
businesses outside the United States may differ. We reserve the right to suspend charging
privileges at any time after an account attains delinquent status. We may also,
at our discretion, enter into alternative arrangements with delinquent
accountholders to extend or otherwise change payment schedules.

We charge-off as uncollectible a credit card account (net of collateral, if
any) if the minimum payment is not received during the first cycle after the
150 day delinquent cycle. In connection with a secured credit card account,
except as set forth below, we apply funds deposited as collateral to payment on
the account shortly before (or, in some cases at the time) the account is
charged off as uncollectible. With respect to bankrupt credit card customers in
the United States, we charge-off the account within 30 days after we receive the
bankruptcy petition. With respect to secured credit card accounts, we apply
funds deposited as collateral in satisfaction of the account only after the
bankruptcy automatic stay is lifted. With respect to customer accounts in the
UK, we charge-off accounts for individuals who are subject to bankruptcy and
Individual Voluntary Arrangements (“IVA”) with Creditors, which we do within 30
days of receiving notification of the bankruptcy or IVA and confirmation that
the customer is failing to fulfill on the IVA. We charge-off accounts of
deceased credit card customers within 60 days of receiving proper notice if no
estate exists against which a proof of claim can be filed, no other party
remits payments, and no other responsible party is available. Credit card
transactions suspected of being fraudulent are charged off to non-interest
expense after a 90-day investigation period. We may change our credit
evaluation, servicing and charge-off policies and collection practices over
time in accordance with our business judgment, applicable law and guidelines
established by applicable regulatory authorities.

We deploy customized collections strategies for our auto finance business.
Collections activity for auto finance customers can begin as early as three
days delinquent, depending on the customer’s risk level. We utilize a
combination of techniques, including dialer calls, manual calls, and letter
campaigns. The timing and frequency of such activities is customized, based
on the credit risk of each customer. At times, we will utilize extensions as
a collection tool. Such extensions are granted in accordance with strict
policy guidelines. When an account is deemed to be uncollectable, we will
pursue repossession of the vehicle. The timing of repossession activity
depends upon the risk of the customer, and generally occurs from 45 to 110 days past
due.

Auto finance accounts are generally charged off at the earlier of the time of
repossession, or at the end of the month in which the account reaches 120 days
past due. Other accounts may be charged off earlier, such as the case of a
totaled vehicle, where insurance proceeds do not cover the entire account
balance. We charge-off the estimated loss from accounts on the charge-off
date with additional amounts potentially charged off or credited at a later
date following our sale of the collateral and recovery of the proceeds from
such sale. With respect to bankrupt automobile customers,
in most cases, we charge-off accounts on repossession following lift of the
automatic stay of the secured automobile or in the case when the account is 180
days past due for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcies, or upon earlier repossession.


Technology/Systems

A key part of our strategic focus is the development of flexible, high-volume
computer and operational systems capable of handling increasing volumes and changes in
marketing and account management strategies. Management believes that the
continued development and integration of these systems is important to our
efforts to reduce our operating costs and maintain a competitive advantage.

We have developed proprietary integrated information systems which allow our
employees to manage the large volumes of data collected as part of the IBS
process and to use such data in our account solicitations, application
processing, account management and retention strategies. Among other things, we
use this information to predict consumer behavior and then match prospects to
lending products with various terms and fees. These systems also allow our
customer service representatives to access account specific information when
responding to customer inquiries.

Funding and Liquidity

A key component of our business strategy is maintaining access to diversified
funding sources. Our primary methods of long-term funding include loan
securitizations, issuing certificates of deposit, and senior notes and other
borrowings.

A major funding source for us is the securitization of consumer
loans. Securitization involves the transfer to a trust or other
special purpose entity of loans receivable generated by a designated pool of
accounts. The trust or special purpose entity may issue either certificates
representing undivided ownership interests in, or notes collateralized by, the
loans receivable. In addition to securitizations, deposits are a large
source of funding and liquidity for us. Through direct marketing
efforts, we offer retail certificates of deposits (“CDs”) and
money market deposit accounts. Relationships with national broker networks
complement direct marketing efforts for raising retail and institutional CDs.
We also have access to funding through term and overnight Federal
funds, bank notes, secured borrowings, a $1.2 billion credit facility and
a $300 million credit facility in the U.K.

We maintain a liquidity portfolio comprised of cash, cash
equivalents, and investments that are readily convertible to cash. At
December 31, 2002, the liquidity portfolio totaled $5.3 billion. For a
discussion of our funding programs and liquidity, see pages 26-29 and 34-36 of
the Annual Report under the respective headings “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Managed Consumer Loan
Portfolio” and “Funding,” which are incorporated herein by reference.

Competition

We market our card products to specific consumer populations. The
terms of each card product are actively managed to achieve a balance between
risk and expected performance, while obtaining the expected return. For
example, card product terms typically include the ability to reprice individual
accounts upwards or downwards based on the consumer’s performance. In addition,
since 1998, we have aggressively marketed low non-introductory rate
cards to consumers with the best established credit profiles to take advantage
of the favorable risk return characteristics of this consumer type. Industry
competitors have continuously solicited our customers with similar


interest rate strategies. Management believes the competition has put, and will
continue to put, additional pressure on our pricing strategies.

As a marketer of credit card and other financial products, we face intense
competition in all aspects of our business from numerous bank and non-bank
providers of financial services. Many of these companies are substantially
larger and have more resources than we do. We compete with international,
national, regional and local issuers of Visa® and MasterCard® credit cards. In
addition, American Express®, Discover Card®, Diner’s Club® and, to a certain
extent, smart cards and debit cards, represent additional competition to the
general purpose credit card. In general, customers are attracted to credit card
issuers largely on the basis of price, credit limit and other product features
and customer loyalty is often limited. In automobile finance, we face competition from banks and
non-bank lenders, who provide financing for dealer-originated loans.
Additionally, we face competition from a small, but growing number of online
automobile finance providers. We also face competition from lenders in
our installment loan and other lending activities. We
believe that IBS allows us to more effectively compete in both our current and
new markets. There can be no assurance, however, that our ability to market
products and services successfully or to obtain adequate yield on our loans
will not be impacted by the nature of the competition that now exists or may
later develop.

In addition, we face competition in seeking funding from banks, savings banks,
money market funds and a wide variety of other entities that take deposits
and/or sell debt securities, some of which are publicly traded. Many of these
companies are substantially larger, have more capital and other resources and
have better financial ratings than we do. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that competition from these other borrowers will not increase our
cost of funds.

Intellectual Property

As part of our overall and ongoing strategy to protect and enhance our
intellectual property, we rely on a variety of protections, including
copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and certain restrictions on
disclosure. We actively pursue patent protection in the United States and
internationally to protect certain important aspects of our business. We also
undertake other measures to control access to and distribution of our other
proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a
third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use certain intellectual property
without authorization. Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation or
infringement of our intellectual property. In addition, our competitors also
file patent applications for business methods that are used in our industry.
The ability of our competitors to successfully apply for such patents may
adversely affect our ability to compete. Conversely, our ability to obtain such
patents may increase our competitive advantage. There can be no assurance that
we will be successful in such efforts, or that the ability of our competitors
to obtain such patents may not adversely impact our financial results.

Employees

As of December 31, 2002, we employed 18,757 employees whom we refer to as
“associates.” A central part of
our philosophy is to attract and maintain a highly capable staff. We view
current associate relations to be satisfactory. None of our
associates are
covered under a collective bargaining agreement.


Supervision and Regulation

General

The Bank is a banking corporation chartered under Virginia law and a member of
the Federal Reserve System, the deposits of which are insured by the Bank
Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”). In
addition to regulatory requirements imposed as a result of the Bank’s
international operations (discussed below), the Bank is subject to
comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the Bureau of Financial
Institutions of the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the “Bureau of
Financial Institutions”), the Federal Reserve Board (the “Federal Reserve”),
the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and the FDIC. The Bank is not a “bank”
under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), because it
(i) engages only in credit card operations, (ii) does not accept demand
deposits or deposits that the depositor may withdraw by check or similar means
for payment to third parties or others, (iii) does not accept any savings or
time deposits of less than $100,000, other than as permitted as collateral for
extensions of credit, (iv) maintains only one office that accepts deposits and
(v) does not engage in the business of making commercial loans. Due to the
Bank’s status as a limited purpose credit card bank, our non-credit card
operations must be conducted in our other operating subsidiaries, except as
relates to our UK operations.

The Savings Bank is a federal savings bank chartered by the Office of Thrift
Supervision (the “OTS”) and is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System.
Its deposits are insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund of the FDIC.
The Savings Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic
examination by the OTS and the FDIC.

The Corporation is not a bank holding company under the BHCA as a result of its
ownership of the Bank because the Bank is not a “bank” as defined under the
BHCA. If the Bank failed to meet the credit card bank exemption criteria
described above, its status as an insured depository institution would make the
Corporation subject to the provisions of the BHCA, including certain
restrictions as to the types of business activities in which a bank holding
company and its affiliates may engage. Becoming a bank holding company under
the BHCA would affect the Corporation’s ability to engage in certain
non-banking businesses. In addition, for purposes of the BHCA, if the Bank
failed to qualify for the credit card bank exemption, any entity that acquired
direct or indirect control of the Bank and also engaged in activities not
permitted for bank holding companies could be required either to discontinue
the impermissible activities or to divest itself of control of the Bank.

As a result of the Corporation’s ownership of the Savings Bank, the Corporation
is a unitary savings and loan holding company subject to regulation by the OTS
and the provisions of the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act. As a unitary
savings and loan holding company, the Corporation generally is not restricted
under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which it may
engage so long as the Savings Bank continues to meet the qualified thrift
lender test (the “QTL Test”). If the Corporation ceased to be a unitary savings
and loan holding company as a result of its acquisition of an additional
savings institution, as a result of the failure of the Savings Bank to meet the
QTL Test, or as a result of a change in control of the Savings Bank, the types
of activities that the Corporation and its non-savings association subsidiaries
would be able to engage in would generally be limited to those eligible for
bank holding companies.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (the “GLB
Act”) does not impact the permissible range of our activities; it does,
however, impose some limitations on the future activities of unitary thrift
holding companies. Existing unitary thrift holding companies such as the
Corporation are “grandfathered” with full powers to continue and expand their
current activities.


Grandfathered unitary thrift holding companies, however, may not be acquired by
nonfinancial companies and maintain their grandfathered powers. In addition, if
a grandfathered unitary thrift holding company is acquired by a financial
company without such grandfathered rights, it may lose its ability to engage in
certain non-banking activities otherwise ineligible for bank holding companies
or financial holding companies.

The Corporation is also registered as a financial institution holding company
under Virginia law and as such is subject to periodic examination by Virginia’s
Bureau of Financial Institutions. Our automobile financing activities include
COAF and PeopleFirst and fall under the scrutiny of the state agencies having
supervisory authority under applicable sales finance laws or consumer finance
laws in most states. We also face regulation in the international
jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.

Informal Memorandum of Understanding

As described in our report on Form 10-Q, dated August 13, 2002, we have entered
into an informal memorandum of understanding with the bank regulatory
authorities with respect to certain issues, including our capital, allowance
for loan losses, finance charge and fee reserve and policies, procedures,
systems and controls. A memorandum of understanding is characterized by
regulatory authorities as an informal action, that is not published or publicly
available. We have implemented levels of capital, reserves and allowances that
we believe satisfy the memorandum of understanding.

In addition, as required under the memorandum of understanding, we have
continued to take actions, among others, to enhance our enterprise risk
management framework and legal entity business plans. As part of the ongoing
supervision of the Bank and the Savings Bank, we will periodically report to,
and consult with, the regulators on all the matters addressed under the
informal memorandum of understanding. While we have delivered on the principal
requirements of the memorandum of understanding, we expect
our regulators to monitor our ongoing execution of the memorandum of
understanding for some period of time. We are also subject to ongoing general and targeted
regulatory exams. Hence, we are unable to predict the exact timing
for conclusion or termination of the informal memorandum of understanding.

Dividends and Transfers of Funds

Dividends to the Corporation from its direct and indirect subsidiaries
represent a major source of funds for the Corporation to pay dividends on its
stock, make payments on its debt securities and meet its other obligations.
There are various federal and Virginia law limitations on the extent to which
the Bank and the Savings Bank can finance or otherwise supply funds to the
Corporation through dividends, loans or otherwise. These limitations include
minimum regulatory capital requirements, Federal Reserve, OTS and Virginia law
requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus,
Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W governing
transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates and
general federal and Virginia regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound
practices. In general, federal banking laws prohibit an insured depository
institution, such as the Bank and the Savings Bank, from making dividend
distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available earnings or
would cause the institution to fail to meet applicable capital adequacy
standards. In addition, the Savings Bank is required to give the OTS at least
30 days’ advance notice of any proposed dividend. Under OTS regulations, other
limitations apply to the Savings Bank’s ability to pay dividends, the magnitude
of which depends upon the extent to which the Savings Bank meets its regulatory
capital requirements. In addition, under Virginia law, the Bureau of Financial
Institutions may limit the payment of dividends by the Bank if the Bureau of
Financial


Institutions determines that such a limitation would be in the public interest
and necessary for the Bank’s safety and soundness.

Capital Adequacy

The Bank and the Savings Bank are currently subject to capital adequacy
guidelines adopted by the Federal Reserve and the OTS, respectively. For a
further discussion of the capital adequacy guidelines, see page 39 of the
Annual Report under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Adequacy” and Note O to
Consolidated Financial Statements on page 67, which are incorporated herein by
reference.

In January 2001, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued for public
comment a proposal to revise significantly the current international capital
adequacy accord, the purpose of which is to ensure that banking organizations
maintain prudent levels of capital, make regulatory capital standards more
reflective of banking risks, and provide incentives for organizations to
enhance their risk management capabilities. If ultimately adopted, this
proposal may require some banks to increase their current capital levels.

In November 2001, the four federal banking
agencies, or the “Agencies,” adopted
an amendment to the regulatory capital standards regarding the treatment of
certain recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes (i.e., guarantees on
third-party assets), residual interests in asset securitizations, and other
securitized transactions that expose institutions primarily to liquidity and
credit risk. Effective January 1, 2002, this rule amended the Agencies’
regulatory capital standards to create greater differentiation in the capital
treatment of residual interests.

In May 2002, the Agencies clarified the scope of the rule adopted in November
2001 in an advisory letter stating that securitization interests commonly known
as accrued interest receivables, or AIRs, should be considered “recourse
exposures” and “residual interests.” Effective December 31, 2002, this
interpretation of the rule adopted in November 2001 required banking
organizations such as the Bank and the Savings Bank to hold regulatory capital against the full
risk-weighted amount of their AIRs, subject to certain limitations. The Bank and
the Savings Bank have met this capital requirement and remain well capitalized
after applying the provisions of the AIR advisory at December 31, 2002.

FDICIA

Among other things, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act
of 1991 (“FDICIA”) requires federal bank regulatory authorities to take “prompt
corrective action” (“PCA”) in respect of insured depository institutions that
do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital ratio
levels: well-capitalized, adequately-capitalized, undercapitalized,
significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. As of December
31, 2002, each of the Bank and the Savings Bank met the requirements for a
“well-capitalized” institution. The “well-capitalized” classification is
determined solely for the purposes of applying FDICIA’s PCA provisions, as
discussed below, and should not be viewed as describing the condition or future
prospects of a depository institution, including the Bank and the Savings Bank.

Under FDICIA’s PCA system, an insured depository institution in the
“undercapitalized category” must submit a capital restoration plan guaranteed
by its parent company. The liability of the parent company under any such
guarantee is limited to the lesser of 5.00% of the insured depository
institution’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized, or the amount
needed to comply with the plan. An insured depository institution in the
undercapitalized category also is subject to limitations in numerous areas


including, but not limited to, asset growth, acquisitions, branching, new
business lines, acceptance of brokered deposits and borrowings from the Federal
Reserve. Progressively more burdensome restrictions are applied to insured
depository institutions in the undercapitalized category that fail to submit or
implement a capital plan and to insured depository institutions that are in the
significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized categories. In
addition, an insured depository institution’s primary federal banking agency is
authorized to downgrade the institution’s capital category to the next lower
category upon a determination that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound
condition or is engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice. An unsafe or unsound
practice can include receipt by the institution of a less than satisfactory
rating on its most recent examination with respect to its capital, asset
quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk.

“Critically undercapitalized” insured depository institutions (which are
defined to include institutions that still have a positive net worth) may not,
beginning 60 days after becoming critically undercapitalized, make any payment
of principal or interest on their subordinated debt (subject to certain limited
exceptions). Thus, in the event an institution became critically
undercapitalized, it would generally be prohibited from making payments on its
subordinated debt securities. In addition, critically undercapitalized
institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator.

FDICIA also requires the FDIC to implement a system of risk-based premiums for
deposit insurance pursuant to which the premiums paid by a depository
institution will be based on the probability that the FDIC will incur a loss in
respect of such institution. The FDIC has since adopted a system that imposes
insurance premiums based upon a matrix that takes into account an institution’s
capital level and supervisory rating.

The Bank and the Savings Bank may accept brokered deposits as part of their
funding. Under FDICIA, only “well-capitalized” and “adequately-capitalized”
institutions may accept brokered deposits. Adequately-capitalized institutions,
however, must first obtain a waiver from the FDIC before accepting brokered
deposits, and such deposits may not pay rates that significantly exceed the
rates paid on deposits of similar maturity from the institution’s normal market
area or the national rate on deposits of comparable maturity, as determined by
the FDIC, for deposits from outside the institution’s normal market area.

Liability for Commonly-Controlled Institutions

Under the “cross-guarantee” provision of the Financial Institutions Reform,
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (“FIRREA”), insured depository
institutions such as the Bank and the Savings Bank may be liable to the FDIC in
respect of any loss or reasonably anticipated loss incurred by the FDIC
resulting from the default of, or FDIC assistance to, any commonly controlled
insured depository institution. The Bank and the Savings Bank are commonly
controlled within the meaning of the FIRREA cross-guarantee provision.

Investment Limitation and Qualified Thrift Lender Test

Federally-chartered savings banks such as the Savings Bank are subject to
certain investment limitations. For example, federal savings banks are not
permitted to make consumer loans (i.e., certain open-end or closed-end loans
for personal, family or household purposes, excluding credit card loans) in
excess of 35% of the savings bank’s assets. Federal savings banks are also
required to meet the QTL Test, which generally requires a savings bank to
maintain at least 65% “portfolio assets” (total assets less (i) specified
liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, (ii) intangibles, including goodwill
and (iii) property used to conduct business) in certain “qualified thrift
investments” (residential mortgages and


related investments, including certain mortgage backed and mortgage related
investments, small business related securities, certain state and federal
housing investments, education loans and credit card loans) on a monthly basis
in nine out of every 12 months. Failure to qualify under the QTL Test could
subject the Savings Bank to substantial restrictions on its activities,
including the activity restrictions that apply generally to bank holding
companies and their affiliates and potential loss of grandfathered rights under
the GLB Act. As of December 31, 2002, 85.59% of the Savings Bank’s portfolio
assets were held in qualified thrift investments, and the Savings Bank was in
compliance with the QTL Test.

Subprime Lending Guidelines

On January 31, 2001, the federal banking agencies, including the Federal
Reserve and the OTS, issued “Expanded Guidance for Subprime Lending Programs”
(the “Guidelines”). The Guidelines, while not constituting a formal regulation,
provide guidance to the federal bank examiners regarding the adequacy of
capital and loan loss reserves held by insured depository institutions engaged
in subprime lending. The Guidelines adopt a broad definition of “subprime”
loans which likely covers more than one-third of all consumers in the United
States. Because our business strategy is to provide credit card products and
other consumer loans to a wide range of consumers, a portion of our loan assets
may be viewed by the examiners as “subprime.” Thus, under the Guidelines, bank
examiners could require the Bank or the Savings Bank to hold additional capital
(up to one and one-half to three times the minimally required level of capital,
as set forth in the Guidelines), or additional loan loss reserves, against such
assets. As described above, at December 31, 2002 the Bank and the Savings Bank
each met the requirements for a “well-capitalized” institution. Federal
examiners, however, have wide discretion as to how to apply the Guidelines and
there can be no assurances that the Bank or the Savings Bank may not be
required to hold additional regulatory capital against such assets.

For purposes of the Subprime Guidelines, we treat as “subprime”
all loans in the Bank’s and the Savings Bank’s targeted subprime programs to
customers either with a Fair, Isaac and Company (“FICO”) score of 660 or below
or with no FICO score. The Bank and the Savings Bank hold on average 200%
of the total risk-based capital charge that would otherwise apply to such
assets. This results in higher levels of regulatory capital at the Bank and
the Savings Bank.

The Company expects to operate each of the Bank and the Savings
Bank with at least 12% total risk-based capital, after giving effect to all
applicable regulatory guidance with respect to capital (including the AIR
advisory). The Company also expects to maintain a consolidated tangible capital
to tangible managed assets ratio of at least 6%. As of December 31, 2002, the
Company’s tangible capital to tangible managed assets ratio was 7.2%

.

On January 8, 2003, the FFIEC released Account Management and Loss Allowance
Guidance (the “Guidance”). The Guidance applies to all credit lending of
regulated financial institutions and generally requires that banks properly
manage several elements of their credit-card lending programs, including line
assignments, over-limit practices, minimum payment and negative amortization,
workout and settlement programs, and the accounting methodology used for
various assets and income items related to credit card loans.

We believe that our credit card account management and loss allowance practices
are prudent and appropriate and, therefore, consistent with the Guidance. We
also believe the Guidance will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition or results of operations. We caution, however, that
similar to the Guidelines, the Guidance provides wide discretion to bank
regulatory agencies in the application of the Guidance to any particular
institution and its account management and loss allowance


practices. Accordingly, under the Guidance, bank examiners could require
changes in our account management or loss allowance practices in the future.

Regulation of Lending Activities

The activities of the Bank and the Savings Bank as consumer lenders also are
subject to regulation under various federal laws, including the
Truth-in-Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit
Reporting Act (the “FCRA”), the Community Reinvestment Act and the Soldiers’
and Sailors’ Civil Relief Act, as well as under various state laws. Depending
on the underlying issue and applicable law, regulators are often authorized to
impose penalties for violations of these statutes and, in certain cases, to
order the Bank and the Savings Bank to compensate injured borrowers. Borrowers
may also have a private right of action to bring actions for certain
violations. Federal bankruptcy and state debtor relief and collection laws also
affect the ability of the Bank and the Savings Bank to collect outstanding
balances owed by borrowers. These laws plus state sales finance laws also affect the
ability of our automobile financing business to collect outstanding balances.

Privacy and Fair Credit Reporting

The GLB Act requires a financial institution to disclose its privacy policy to
customers and consumers, and requires that such customers and consumers be
given a choice (through an opt-out notice) to forbid the sharing of non-public
personal information about them with non-affiliated third persons. We have a
written privacy notice posted on our Web site that is delivered to each of our
customers when the customer relationships begin, and annually thereafter, in
compliance with the GLB Act. Under that privacy notice, we protect the security
of information about our customers, educate our employees about the importance
of protecting customer privacy, and allow our customers to remove their names
from the solicitation lists we use and may share with others. Our financial
subsidiaries require business partners with whom they share such information to
abide by the redisclosure and reuse provisions of the GLB Act. Our financial
subsidiaries have developed and implemented programs to fulfill the expressed
requests of customers and consumers to opt out of information sharing subject
to the GLB Act. If the federal or state regulators of the financial
subsidiaries establish further guidelines for addressing customer privacy
issues, we may need to amend our privacy policies and adapt our internal
procedures. In addition to adopting federal requirements regarding privacy,
the GLB Act also permits individual states to enact stricter laws relating to
the use of customer information. Vermont and North Dakota have done so by
regulation or referendum, and many states, notably California, are expected to
consider such proposals which may impose additional requirements or
restrictions on us.

Like other lending institutions, we utilize credit bureau data in our
underwriting activities. Use of such data is regulated under the FCRA on a
uniform, nationwide basis. Portions of the federal FCRA related to credit
reporting, prescreening, sharing of information between affiliates, and the use
of credit data may become subject to additional state legislation if Congress
does not extend its explicit preemption over such matters by December 31, 2003
on a uniform, nationwide basis. If Congress fails to extend this preemption,
future state legislation may make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain
credit bureau data, and may impact the quality or quantity of available data.

Investment in the Corporation, the Bank and the Savings Bank

Certain acquisitions of capital stock may be subject to regulatory approval or
notice under federal or Virginia law. Investors are responsible for ensuring
that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of capital stock of
the Corporation in excess of the amount which can be acquired without
regulatory approval.


The Bank and the Savings Bank are each “insured depository institutions” within
the meaning of the Change in Bank Control Act. Consequently, federal law and
regulations prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of the
Corporation without, in most cases, prior written approval of the Federal Reserve
or the OTS, as applicable. Control is conclusively presumed if, among other
things, a person or company acquires more than 25% of any class of voting stock
of the Corporation. A rebuttable presumption of control arises if a person or
company acquires more than 10% of any class of voting stock and is subject to
any of a number of specified “control factors” as set forth in the applicable
regulations.

Although the Bank is not a “bank” within the meaning of Virginia’s reciprocal
interstate banking legislation (Chapter 15 of Title 6.1 of the Code of
Virginia), it is a “bank” within the meaning of Chapter 13 of Title 6.1 of the
Code of Virginia governing the acquisition of interests in Virginia financial
institutions (the “Financial Institution Holding Company Act”). The Financial
Institution Holding Company Act prohibits any person or entity from acquiring,
or making any public offer to acquire, control of a Virginia financial
institution or its holding company without making application to, and receiving
prior approval from, the Bureau of Financial Institutions.

Interstate Taxation

Several states have passed legislation which attempts to tax the income from
interstate financial activities, including credit cards, derived from accounts
held by local state residents. Based on the volume of our business in these
states and the nature of the legislation passed to date, we currently believe
that this development will not materially affect our financial condition. The
states may also consider legislation to tax income derived from transactions
conducted through the Internet. We currently solicit accounts and take account
information via the Internet. It is unclear at this time, however, whether and
in what form any such legislation will be adopted, or if adopted, what its
impact on us would be.

Legislation

Legislation has been introduced requiring additional disclosures for credit
cards and other types of consumer lending. Such legislation could place
additional restrictions on the practices of credit card issuers and consumer
lenders generally. In addition to the FCRA provisions discussed above,
proposals have been made to change existing federal bankruptcy laws, to expand
the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial institutions, and to
reform the federal deposit insurance system. It is unclear at this time whether
and in what form any legislation will be adopted or, if adopted, what its
impact on the Bank, the Savings Bank, COAF or the Corporation would be. Congress or
individual states may in the future consider other legislation that would
materially affect the banking or consumer lending industries.

On July 30, 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) was
passed into law. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act applies to all companies that are
required to file periodic reports with the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and contains a number of
significant changes relating to the responsibilities of directors and officers
and reporting and governance obligations of SEC reporting companies. Certain
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act were effective immediately without action
by the SEC; however, many provisions became effective over the following months
and required the SEC to issue implementing rules. Following the passage of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we have taken steps which we believe place us in
substantial compliance with its effective provisions, and we continue to
monitor SEC rulemaking to determine if additional changes are needed to comply
with provisions that will become effective over the following months. During
the course of our compliance efforts, we have identified no
significant changes
which


must be made to our organizational and control structures or existing processes
as a result of this legislation and the currently effective rules issued by the
SEC thereunder.

International Regulation

The Bank also faces regulation in foreign jurisdictions where it currently, and
may in the future, operate. Those regulations may be similar to or
substantially different from the regulatory requirements the Bank faces in the
United States. In the United Kingdom, the Bank operates through the UK Bank,
which was established in 2000. The UK Bank is regulated by the Financial
Services Authority, or the FSA, and licensed by the Office of Fair Trading, or
the OFT. The UK Bank is an “authorized deposit taker” and thus is able to take
consumer deposits in the UK. The UK Bank has also been granted a full license
by the OFT to issue consumer credit under the UK’s Consumer Credit Act — 1974.
The FSA requires the UK Bank to maintain certain regulatory capital ratios at all times.
The UK Bank obtains capital through earnings or through additional capital infusion from the
Bank, subject to approval under Regulation K of the rules administered by the Federal Reserve.
If the UK Bank is unable to generate sufficient capital in favorable terms, it may choose to
restrict its growth to maintain its required capital levels.
In addition, the UK Bank is limited by the UK Companies Act — 1985 in its
distribution of dividends to the Bank in that such dividends may only be paid
out of the UK Bank’s “distributable profits.”

In Canada, the Bank operates principally through a branch of the Bank, or the
Canadian Branch, which, like the Bank, is engaged solely in the issuance of
credit cards. Capital One’s installment loan business in Canada is conducted
through a separately incorporated finance company subsidiary of the Corporation.
The Canadian Branch is considered a federally regulated financial institution
under the Canadian Bank Act, and is authorized and supervised by the Canadian
Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions.

In France, the Bank operates through a branch of the UK Bank that was
established under the European Union’s passport authority. This branch issues
credit cards and installment loans.

This section highlights specific risks that could affect our business and us.
Although we have tried to discuss key factors, please be aware that other risks
may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time and
we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect
our financial performance.

We May Experience Limited Availability of Financing and Variation in Our Funding Costs

In general, the amount, type and cost of our funding, including financing from
other financial institutions, the capital markets and deposits, can positively
or negatively affect our financial results. A number of factors could make such
financing more difficult, more expensive or unavailable including, but not
limited to, changes within our organization, changes in the activities of our
business partners, disruptions in the capital markets, counter-party
availability, changes affecting our investments, our corporate and regulatory
structure, interest rate fluctuations and accounting and regulatory changes and
relations.

The securitization of consumer loans, which involves the legal sale of
beneficial interests in consumer loan balances, is one of our major sources of
funding. As of December 31, 2002, we had $36.7 billion, or approximately 61%,
of our total loans subject to securitization transactions. Our future ability
to use securitization as a funding source depends on the difficulty and expense
associated with such funding. Until now, we have used securitization funding
because the terms were economically acceptable. Our continued reliance on this
funding source will be affected by many factors. Economic, reputational, legal,
regulatory, accounting and tax changes can make securitization funding more
difficult, more expensive or unavailable on any terms both domestically and
internationally, where the securitization of consumer loans may be on terms
more or less favorable than in the United States. For example, securitizations
that meet the criteria for sale treatment under generally accepted accounting
principles may not always be an attractive source of funding for us, and we may
have to seek other more expensive funding sources in the future. In such event,
our earnings could be reduced and our ability to fund our asset growth may be
severely restricted. Economic trends have recently resulted in securitization
terms becoming less favorable market-wide. This risk of loan financing has been
heightened for us, in particular, due to market perceptions of our lower
unsecured debt rating compared to other credit card issuers, our informal
memorandum of understanding with our federal banking regulators, and the
proportion of certain accounts in our loan portfolio viewed by some as subprime, as further described
below. In addition, the occurrence of certain events may cause previously
completed securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled, which
would accelerate the need for funding. This early amortization would also have
a significant effect on the ability of the Bank and the Savings Bank to meet
the capital adequacy requirements as affected off-balance sheet loans would
have to be recorded on the balance sheet and so would be subject to regulatory
capital requirements.

In general, the amount, type and cost of our financing, including financing
from other financial institutions, the capital markets and deposits, can affect
our financial results. A number of factors could make such financing more
difficult, more expensive or unavailable including, but not limited to, financial results and losses, changes
within our organization, changes in the activities of our business partners,
changes affecting our investments, our corporate and regulatory structure,
interest rate fluctuations, general economic conditions and accounting and regulatory changes.

In particular, ratings agencies play an important role in determining, by means
of the ratings they assign to issuers and their debt, the availability and cost
of funding. As private entities, ratings agencies have broad discretion in the
assignment of ratings. For example, our company currently receives ratings from
several ratings agencies. Because we depend on the capital markets for funding
and capital, a strong


rating (particularly an investment grade rating) is important. A rating below
investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost
of market-based funding, both secured and unsecured. A debt rating of
Baa3 or higher by Moody's, or BBB- or higher at Standard &
Poor’s and Fitch, is considered investment grade.  Currently, all three
rating agencies rate the unsecured senior debt of the Bank investment
grade.  Two of the three rate the unsecured senior debt of the
Corporation investment grade, with Standard & Poor’s assigning a
rating of BB+, or just below investment grade.

Capital One

Financial Corporation

Capital One Bank

Moody’s

Baa3

Baa2

Standard & Poor’s

BB+

BBB-

Fitch

BBB

If these ratings were to be lowered, we could experience reduced availability
and increased cost of funding from the capital markets. This result could make
it difficult for us to grow at or to a level we currently anticipate. The
immediate impact of a ratings downgrade on other sources of funding, however,
would be limited, as deposit funding and pricing are not generally determined
by corporate debt ratings. Our ability to
use deposits as a source of funding is generally regulated by federal
law and regulations. The Savings Bank is authorized to engage in a
full range of deposit-taking activities. Likewise, our various credit facilities do not
contain covenants triggered by a ratings downgrade, although the pricing of any
borrowings under these facilities is linked to these ratings.

We compete for funding with other banks, savings banks and similar
companies. Some of these institutions are publicly traded. Many of these
institutions are substantially larger, have more capital and other resources
and have better debt ratings than we do. Competition from these other
borrowers may increase our cost of funds. Events that disrupt capital markets
and other factors beyond our control could also make our funding sources more
expensive or unavailable. Our informal understanding with regulators
may make us more sensitive to these types of events.

Because we offer to our customers credit lines, the full amount of which is
most often not used, we have exposure to these unfunded lines of credit. These
credit lines could be used to a greater extent than our historical experience
would predict. If actual use of these lines were to materially exceed predicted
line usage, we would need to raise more funding than anticipated in our current
funding plans. It could be difficult to raise such funds, either at all, or at
favorable rates.

We Face Intense Competition and Increased Strategic Risk in all of our Markets

We face intense competition from many other providers of credit cards and other
consumer financial products and services. In particular, in our credit card
activities, we compete with international, national, regional and local bank
card issuers, with other general purpose credit or charge card issuers, and to
a certain extent, issuers of smart cards and debit cards and providers of other
types of financial services (such as home equity lines and other products). We
face similarly competitive markets in our automobile financing and installment
loan activities as well as in our international markets. In addition, the
GLB Act, which permits
greater affiliations between banks, securities firms and insurance companies,
may increase competition in the financial services industry, including in the
credit card business. Increased competition has resulted in, and may continue
to cause, a decrease in credit card response rates and reduced productivity of
marketing dollars invested in certain lines of business. Other credit card
companies may compete with us for customers by offering lower interest rates
and fees and/or higher credit limits. Because customers generally choose credit
card


issuers based on price (primarily interest rates and fees), credit limit and
other product features, customer loyalty is limited. We may lose entire
accounts, or may lose account balances, to competing card issuers. Our
automobile financing and installment products also face intense competition on
the basis of price. Customer attrition from any or all of our products, together with any
lowering of interest rates or fees that we might implement to retain customers,
could reduce our revenues and therefore our earnings.

We face intense pricing competition in a wide array of credit card products and
services, such as our low fixed-rate cards, introductory interest rate cards,
secured cards and other customized cards. Thus, the cost to acquire new
accounts will continue to vary among product lines and may reasonably be
expected to rise as we move beyond the domestic card market and become
increasingly focused on prime and superprime lending. We expect that
competition will continue to grow more intense with respect to most of our
products, including our products offered internationally.

We Face Increased Regulatory Scrutiny and Reputational Risk

During the third quarter of 2002, we entered into an informal memorandum of
understanding with bank regulatory authorities regarding certain financial
considerations and calculations as well as certain changes and improvements to
our policies, procedures, systems and controls. Under this memorandum of
understanding, we informally report to and consult with the regulatory
authorities on these matters and other business considerations on a regular
basis. While we have made significant progress in meeting our obligations
under the memorandum of understanding, and have completed many of our targeted
improvements, we cannot predict when we will achieve our goals for all items
under the informal memorandum of understanding from the banking authorities.
Remaining subject to the memorandum of understanding for a prolonged period could
result in, among other things, decreased funding opportunities
and less favorable economic terms, as well as a continued strain on financial
and operational resources, decreased employee morale and internal and external
business regulation.

Fluctuations in Our Accounts and Loan Balances Can Create Volatility

The number of accounts and aggregate total of loan balances of our domestic
credit card portfolio (including the rate at which they grow) will be affected
by a number of factors, including how we allocate our marketing investment
among different products and the rate at which customers transfer their
accounts and loan balances to us or away from us to competing card issuers.
Such accounts and loan balances are also affected by general economic
conditions, which may increase or decrease the amount of spending by our
customers and affect their ability to repay their loans, our desire to maintain
a moderate growth rate and other factors beyond our control.

Because our strategy takes advantage of market opportunities by
differentiating among customers and targeting growth opportunities, we cannot
forecast how much we will spend for marketing, how we will spend such funds, or
on which products. Accordingly, our account and loan balance growth is affected
by which products our IBS identifies as targeted growth opportunities and our
continual reassessment of those targets, general economic conditions, our
desire for a moderate growth rate, and many other factors. Our results,
therefore, will vary as marketing investments, accounts and loan balances
fluctuate.

It is Difficult to Sustain and Manage Growth

Our growth strategy is threefold. First, we seek to continue to grow our
domestic credit card business. Second, we desire to grow our lending business,
including credit cards, internationally, in the United


Kingdom, Canada and beyond. Third, we hope to identify, pursue and expand new
business opportunities, such as automobile financing, installment lending and
other types of consumer lending activities. Our management believes that,
through IBS, we can achieve these objectives. However, there are several types
of factors that can affect our ability to do so, including:

•

Operational Risk

. Our ability to grow successfully is
also dependent on our ability to build or acquire the
necessary operational and organizational infrastructure,
manage expenses as we expand, and recruit experienced
management and operations personnel with the experience to
run an increasingly complex business. In addition, we
operate in a highly regulated industry, and our ability to
grow our business, both in credit card issuances and by
expanding into international and new lending
opportunities, may be adversely affected by the legal and
regulatory environment we face, which may change at any
time and which is outside of our control.

•

International Operational Risk

. Our expansion
internationally is affected by additional factors,
including limited access to information, differences in
cultural attitudes toward credit, changing regulatory and
legislative environments, political developments, exchange
rates and differences from the historical experience of
portfolio performance in the United States and other
countries.

•

Credit Risk.

As a consumer lender,
factors affecting our growth (including our ability to
obtain funding and our ability to generate account balance
growth), are also affected by the delinquency and
charge-off levels of our accounts. Our delinquency and
charge-off levels are also affected by the general state
of the United States and world economies, and may likely
be adversely impacted by a recessionary economy. See “—We
May Experience Increased Delinquencies and Credit Losses”
below, and “Operations — Risk Management” above.


•

Liquidity Funding Risk

. Our ability to grow may be constrained by
our ability to generate funding sufficient to both create
the liquidity necessary to extend loans to our customers
and to provide us with the capital necessary to meet the
requirements of our regulators, the rating agencies and
our own prudent management principles. Our ability to
generate this funding, especially capital funding which
can come from only limited sources, is limited by a number
of factors, such as the regulatory environment and our
corporate structure. In addition, our ability to raise
funds is strongly affected by the general state of the
United States and world economies, and has become
increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors.
See “—We May Experience Limited Availability of Financing
and Variation in Our Funding Costs” above.

•

Legal and Compliance Risk

.
Due to our significant reliance on the documentation supporting our funding
transactions and the individual lending arrangements with our customers, as
well as our unique corporate structure, we face a risk of loss due to faulty legal contracts,
legal entity structure and changes in laws and
interpretations. We also are subject to an array of
banking and consumer lending laws and regulations that
apply to almost every element of our business. Failure to
comply with these laws and regulations could result in
financial, structural and operational penalties, including
receivership. See “Supervision
and Regulation” above.

•

Strategic Risk.

Our ability to grow is driven by the
success of our fundamental business plan. This risk has
many components, including:


•

Customer and Account Growth.

As a
business driven by customer finance, our
growth is highly dependent on our ability
to retain existing customers and attract
new ones, grow existing and new account
balances, develop new market segments and
have sufficient funding available for
marketing activities that generate these
customers and account balances. Our
ability to grow and retain customers is
also dependent on customer satisfaction,
which may be adversely affected by factors
outside of our control, such as postal
service and other marketing and customer
service channel disruptions and costs.

•

Product and Marketing Development

.
Difficulties or delays in the development,
production, testing and marketing of new
products or services, which may be caused
by a number of factors including, among
other things, operational constraints,
regulatory and other capital requirements
and legal difficulties, will affect the
success of such products or services and
can cause losses associated with the costs
to develop unsuccessful products and
services, as well as decreased capital
availability. In addition, customers may
not accept the new products and services
offered.

•

Reputational Risk

. Our ability to originate and
maintain accounts is highly dependent upon consumer
perceptions of our financial health and business
practices. To this end, we have aggressively pursued a
campaign to enhance our brand image and awareness in
recent years. Adverse developments, however, in our brand
campaign or in any of the areas described above could damage
our reputation in both the customer and funding markets,
leading to difficulties in generating and maintaining
accounts as well as in financing them.

We May Experience Increased Delinquencies and Credit Losses

Like other credit card lenders and providers of consumer financing, we face the
risk that we will not be able to collect on our accounts because accountholders
and other borrowers will not repay their credit card and other unsecured loans.
Consumers who miss payments on their credit card and other unsecured loans
often fail to repay them, and consumers who file for protection under the
bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their credit card and other unsecured
loans. Therefore, the rate of missed payments, or “delinquencies,” on our
portfolio of loans, and the rate at which consumers may be expected to file for
bankruptcy, can be used to predict the future rate at which we will charge-off
our consumer loans. A high charge-off rate would hurt our overall financial
performance and the performance of our securitizations and increase our cost of
funds.

Widespread increases in past-due payments and nonpayment generally occur
whenever the country or a region experiences an economic downturn, such as a
recession. In
addition, if we make fewer loans than we have in the past, the proportion of
new loans in our portfolio will decrease and the delinquency rate and
charge-off rate may increase. Credit card accounts also tend to exhibit a rising trend of
delinquency and credit loss rates as they “season,” or age. As a result of
seasoning of our portfolio and other factors, we have experienced an
increase in our managed net charge-off rate from 4.96% in the third quarter of
2002 to 6.21% in the fourth quarter of 2002. Delinquencies and credit losses
may also occur for other reasons. For example, changes in general or regulatory
accounting principles can lead to changes in our delinquency to increases or decreases in our delinquencies
or charge-off rates that are unrelated to actual portfolio performance.
We have recently engaged in efforts to limit our
growth of assets, particularly our assets generated by our higher risk customers. This rebalancing
has created a “seam” between our
historical patterns and our future goals, during which we expect delinquency
rates and credit losses to increase compared to our overall portfolio.


This would reduce our earnings unless offset by other changes. We
also, as provided for by the applicable accounting rules, hold allowances for
expected losses from delinquencies and charge-offs in our existing portfolio. There can be no assurance, however,
that such allowances will be sufficient to account for actual losses.

In addition, we market our products to a broad range of consumers, including
those who have less experience with credit, and who therefore tend to
experience higher delinquency and charge-off rates. Our goal is to use IBS to
set the credit limits and price products for customers relative to the risk of
anticipated associated losses, but we cannot be certain that we have set high
enough fees and rates for certain accounts to offset the higher delinquency and
loss rates we may experience from such accounts. Our credit losses, therefore,
can continue to increase.

We Face Risk From Economic Downturns and Social Factors

Delinquencies and credit losses in the consumer finance industry generally
increase during economic downturns or recessions. Likewise, consumer demand may
decline during an economic downturn or recession. Accordingly, an economic
downturn (either local or national), such as the one we are currently
experiencing, can hurt our financial performance as accountholders default on
their loans or, in the case of card accounts, carry lower balances. Our
customer base and IBS models have resulted in our substantial participation in
the subprime/underserved market. These accountholders generally have
higher rates of charge-offs and delinquencies than do non-subprime
accountholders. Additionally, as we increasingly market our cards
internationally, an economic downturn or recession outside the United States
also could hurt our financial performance. A variety of social factors also may
cause changes in credit card and other consumer finance use, payment patterns
and the rate of defaults by accountholders and borrowers. These social factors
include changes in consumer confidence levels, the public’s perception of the
use of credit cards and other consumer debt and changing attitudes about
incurring debt and the stigma of personal bankruptcy. Our goal is to manage
these risks through our underwriting criteria and product design, but these
tools may not be enough to protect our growth and profitability during a
sustained period of economic downturn or recession or a material shift in
social attitudes.

We Face Market Risk of Interest Rate and Exchange Rate Fluctuations

Like other financial institutions, we borrow money from institutions and
depositors which we then lend to customers. We earn interest on the consumer
loans we make, and pay interest on the deposits and borrowings we use to fund
those loans. Changes in these two interest rates affect the value of our assets
and liabilities. If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases
more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest income,
and therefore our earnings, could fall. Our earnings could also be hurt if the
rates on our consumer loans fall more quickly than those on our borrowings.

The financial instruments and techniques we use to manage the risk of interest
rate and exchange rate fluctuations, such as asset/liability matching and
interest rate and exchange rate swaps and hedges and some forward exchange
contracts, may not always work successfully. Our goal is generally to maintain
an interest rate neutral or “matched” position, where interest rates and
exchange rates on loans and borrowings or foreign currencies go up or down by
the same amount and at the same time so that interest rate and exchange rate
changes for loans or borrowings or foreign currencies will not affect our
earnings. We cannot, however, always achieve this position at a reasonable
cost. Furthermore, if these techniques become unavailable or impractical, our
earnings could be subject to volatility and decreases as interest rates and exchange
rates change.


We also manage these risks partly by changing the interest rates we charge on
our credit card accounts. The success of repricing accounts to match an
increase or decrease in our borrowing rates depends on the overall product mix
of such accounts, the actual amount of accounts repriced, the rate at which we
are originating new accounts and our ability to retain accounts (and the
related loan balances) after repricing. For example, if we increase the
interest rate we charge on our credit card accounts and the accountholders
close their accounts as a result, we may not be able to match our increased
borrowing costs as quickly if at all. Our fixed rate products, in particular, may see attrition in a rising
interest rate environment that concurrently raises our costs of borrowing.

Changes in Regulation and Legislation Can Increase Compliance Risk and Affect Our Results

Federal and state laws and rules, as well as rules to which we are subject in
foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business, significantly limit the
types of activities in which we engage. For example, federal and state consumer
protection laws and rules limit the manner in which we may offer and extend
credit. From time to time, the U.S. Congress and the states consider
changing these laws and may enact new laws or amend existing laws to regulate
further the consumer lending industry. Such new laws or rules could limit the
amount of interest or fees we can charge, restrict our ability to collect on
account balances, or materially affect us or the banking or credit card
industries in some other manner. Additional federal and state consumer
protection legislation also could seek to expand the privacy protections
afforded to customers of financial institutions and restrict our ability to
share or receive customer information.

The laws governing bankruptcy and debtor relief, in the U.S. or in foreign
jurisdictions in which we conduct business, also could change, making it more
expensive or more difficult for us to collect from our customers. Congress has
recently considered legislation that would change the existing federal
bankruptcy laws. One intended purpose of this legislation is to increase the
collectibility of unsecured debt; however, it is not clear whether or in what
form Congress may adopt this legislation and we cannot predict how this
legislation may affect us.

In addition, banking regulators possess broad discretion to issue or revise
regulations, or to issue guidance, which may significantly impact us. In 2001,
regulators restricted the ability of two of our competitors to provide further
credit to higher risk customers due principally to supervisory concerns over
rising charge-off rates and capital adequacy. In 2002, we entered into an informal
memorandum of understanding with our banking regulators. We maintain an active dialogue
with our banking agency regulators following this memorandum of understanding and believe that our capital levels and risk
management practices are appropriate for our business. We cannot, however,
predict whether and how any new guidelines issued or other regulatory actions
taken by the agencies will be applied to the Bank or the Savings Bank or the
resulting effect on the Corporation, the Bank or the Savings Bank.

In addition, existing laws and rules, in the U.S., at the state level, and in
the foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct operations, are complex. If we
fail to comply with them we might not be able to collect our loans in full, or
we might be required to pay damages or penalties to our customers. For these
reasons, new or changes in existing laws or rules could hurt our profits.

Fluctuations in Our Expenses and Other Costs May Hurt Our Financial Results

Our expenses and other costs, such as human resources and marketing expenses,
directly affect our earnings results. Many factors can influence the amount of
our expenses, as well as how quickly they grow. For example, increases in
postal rates currently contemplated by postal regulators could raise our costs
for postal service, which is a significant component of our expenses for
marketing and for servicing our 47.4 million accounts as of December 31, 2002.
As our business develops, changes or


expands, additional expenses can arise from asset purchases, structural
reorganization or a reevaluation of business strategies. Other factors that can
affect the amount of our expenses include legal and administrative cases and
proceedings, which can be expensive to pursue or defend. In addition, changes
in accounting policies can significantly affect how we calculate expenses and
earnings.

Within the 90 days prior to the date of this report, the Corporation carried
out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the
Corporation’s management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
the Corporation’s disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures
pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 13a-15. These controls and
procedures for financial


reporting are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Based upon
that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective
in alerting them in a timely manner to material information relating to the Corporation
(including consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the
Corporation’s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Corporation has established a Disclosure Committee consisting of members of
senior management to assist in this evaluation.
