General Development of Business

State Street Corporation is a financial holding company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. State Street, through its subsidiaries, provides a full range of products and services for
sophisticated global investors.

State Street was organized in 1970 and conducts its business principally through its subsidiary, State Street Bank and Trust Company (“State Street Bank” or the “Bank”), which traces its beginnings
to the founding of the Union Bank in 1792. The charter under which State Street Bank now operates was authorized by a special act of the Massachusetts Legislature in 1891, and its present name was adopted in 1960.

With $6.2 trillion of assets under custody
  and $763 billion of assets under management at year-end 2002, State Street is
  a leading specialist in meeting the needs of sophisticated global investors.
  Clients include mutual funds and other collective investment funds, corporate
  and public pension funds, investment managers, and others. For information as
  to the financial results of non-U.S. activities, refer to Note 23 that appears
  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial
  Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Services are provided from 26 offices in the
  United States, and from offices in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Cayman Islands,
  Chile, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Netherlands
  Antilles, New Zealand, People’s Republic of China, Singapore, South Korea,
  Switzerland, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. State Street’s
  executive offices are located at 225 Franklin Street, Boston, Massachusetts.

Lines of Business

State Street reports two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management. In 2002, revenue from Investment Servicing comprised 86% of State Street’s total revenue, excluding the gain on the sale
of State Street’s corporate trust business. Revenue from Investment Management comprised the remaining 14%. For additional information on State Street’s lines of business, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the caption “Lines of Business.”

Competition

State Street operates in a highly competitive environment in all areas of its business worldwide. State Street faces competition from other financial services institutions, deposit-taking institutions, investment
management firms, private trustees, insurance companies, mutual funds, broker/dealers, investment banking firms, law firms, benefits consultants, leasing companies, and business service and software companies. As State Street expands globally, it
encounters additional sources of competition.

State Street Corporation

| 1

State Street believes there are certain key competitive considerations in these markets. These considerations include, for investment servicing: quality of service, economies of scale, technological expertise, quality
and scope of sales and marketing, and price; and for investment management: expertise, experience, the availability of related service offerings, and price.

State Street’s competitive success depends upon its ability to develop and market new and innovative services; to adopt or develop new technologies; to bring new services to market in a timely fashion at
competitive prices; and to continue and expand its relationships with existing clients and attract new clients.

Employees

At December 31, 2002, State Street had 19,501 employees, of whom 18,952 were full-time.

Completion of the Sale of the Corporate Trust Business

On December 31, 2002, State Street completed the sale of its corporate trust business to U.S. Bank, N.A., the lead bank of U.S. Bancorp. The gain on the sale, net of exit and other associated costs, totaled $495
million, equal to $296 million, or $.90 per diluted share after tax, and was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002. The premium received at closing on the sale was $650 million. An additional $75 million was placed in escrow pending the successful
transition of the business over the next 18 months. Exit and other associated costs were $155 million. The after-tax proceeds from this transaction provided partial funding for the acquisition by State Street of substantial parts of the global
securities services business of Deutsche Bank AG in January 2003.

Acquisition of Substantial Parts of the Global Securities Services Business of Deutsche Bank AG

On January 31, 2003, State Street completed the primary closing of its acquisition of a substantial part of the global securities services business (“GSS”) of Deutsche Bank AG. Under the terms of the definitive agreements,
first announced on November 5, 2002, State Street’s initial payment to Deutsche Bank for all business units to be acquired was approximately $1.1 billion. A separate closing will be held in the near future for business units in Italy and
Austria, upon receipt of applicable regulatory approvals. In the period ending on the one-year anniversary of the closing, State Street will make additional payments of up to an estimated €360 million, based upon performance of the acquired business. The restructuring costs associated with the acquisition are expected to be $90–$110 million on a pre-tax basis, approximately half of which will be recorded in the
first quarter of 2003 and the balance recorded over the next three quarters. GSS had approximately $2.2 trillion of assets under custody.

Approximately half of the initial payment was
  financed using existing resources, including the net proceeds from the sale
  of the corporate trust business mentioned above. State Street financed $595
  million of the purchase price by issuance of equity, equity-related and capital
  securities to the public under an existing shelf registration statement. In
  January 2003, State Street issued $345 million, or 7.2 million shares of common
  stock, $345 million, or 1.7 million units of SPACES(

SM

),
  and $345 million of floating-rate, medium-term capital securities due 2008.
  SPACES are collateralized, forward purchase contract units for additional shares
  of common stock of State Street. Each SPACES has a stated amount of $200 and
  consists of PACES

(SM)

,
  a fixed-share purchase contract and treasury securities, and COVERS

(SM

),
  a variable-share repurchase contract. The SPACES investors will receive total
  annual payments of 6.75% on the units, payable quarterly, consisting of an annual
  2.75% coupon on the PACES and an annual 4.00% contract payment on the COVERS.
  State Street did not receive the proceeds from the SPACES at closing, but will
  receive proceeds of $345 million and issue common stock upon the settlement
  of the fixed share purchase contracts underlying the SPACES units on November
  15, 2005. The floating rate capital securities were issued at LIBOR plus 50
  basis points, and are subject to mandatory redemption on December 15, 2005,
  provided certain regulatory requirements are met, and otherwise are due on February
  15, 2008. After the close of the financing transactions in January 2003, $469
  million of State Street’s shelf registration was available for further
  issuance.

Regulation and Supervision

G e n e r a l .

State
  Street is registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
  (the “Federal Reserve Board”) as a bank holding company pursuant to
  the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “Act”). The
  Act, with certain exceptions, limits the activities in which State Street and
  its non-bank subsidiaries may engage, including non-bank companies for which
  State Street owns or controls more than 5% of a class of voting shares, to those
  that the Federal Reserve Board considers to be closely related to banking or
  managing or controlling banks. The Federal Reserve Board may order a bank holding
  company to terminate any activity or its ownership or control of a non-bank
  subsidiary if the Federal Reserve Board finds that such activity or ownership
  or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or
  stability of a subsidiary bank and is inconsistent with sound banking principles
  or statutory purposes. In the opinion of management, all of State Street’s
  present subsidiaries are within the statutory standard or are otherwise permissible.
  The Act also requires a bank holding company to obtain prior approval of the
  Federal Reserve Board before it may acquire substantially all the assets of
  any bank or ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any
  bank.

State Street has also elected to become a financial
  holding company (“FHC”), which reduces to some extent the restrictions
  on activities of certain bank holding companies that qualify, such as State
  Street. FHC status allows banks to associate with, or have management interlocks
  with, business organizations engaged in securities activities. In order to qualify,
  each bank holding company’s depository subsidiaries must be well capitalized
  and well managed, and it must be meeting its Community Reinvestment Act obligations.
  Once qualified as an FHC, a bank holding company must continue to meet the applicable
  capital and management standards. Failure to maintain such standards may ultimately
  permit the Federal Reserve Board to take certain enforcement actions against
  such company.

Financial holding companies are permitted to engage in those activities that are determined by the Federal Reserve Board, working with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be financial in nature, incidental to an activity
that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity and that does not pose a safety and soundness risk. Activities defined to be financial in nature, include, but are not limited to, the following: providing financial or investment
advice; underwriting; dealing in or making markets in securities; merchant banking, subject to significant limitations; and any activities previously found by the Federal Reserve Board to be closely related to banking.

C a p i t a l  A d e q u a c y .

Bank
  holding companies, such as State Street, are subject to Federal Reserve Board
  minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratio guidelines. At December 31, 2002,
  State Street’s consolidated Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios
  were 17.1% and 18.0%, respectively. For further information as to the Corporation’s
  capital position and capital adequacy, refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s
  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
  under the caption “Liquidity and Capital,” and to Note 12 in the Notes
  to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial
  Statements and Supplementary Data.”

State Street Bank is subject to similar risk-based
  capital and leverage ratio guidelines. State Street Bank exceeded the applicable
  minimum capital requirements as of December 31, 2002. Failure to meet capital
  requirements could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement actions, including
  the termination of deposit insurance by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
  (the “FDIC”), and to certain restrictions on its business that are
  described further in this section.

In January 2001, the Basel Committee on Banking
  Supervision issued a second consultative paper, “Proposal for a New Basel
  Capital Accord” or the “New Accord”. The New Accord, which will
  apply to all banks as well as to holding companies that are parents of banking
  groups, is expected to be finalized by year-end 2003. Implementation of the
  new framework, to the extent it is adopted and promulgated by the Federal Reserve
  Board, is expected to begin at year-end 2006. The Corporation is monitoring
  the status and progress of the New Accord.

S u b s i d i a r i e s .

The
  Federal Reserve System is the primary federal banking agency responsible for
  regulating State Street and its subsidiaries, including State Street Bank, for
  both U.S. and international operations. State Street is also subject to the
  Massachusetts bank holding company statute. The Massachusetts statute requires

State Street Corporation

| 3

prior approval by the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation for the acquisition by State Street of more than 5% of the voting shares of any additional bank and for other forms of bank acquisitions.

State Street’s banking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and examination by various regulatory authorities. State Street Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC and is subject to
applicable federal and state banking laws and to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, as well as by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, and the regulatory authorities of those countries in which a branch
of State Street Bank is located. Other subsidiary trust companies are subject to supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, other offices of the Federal Reserve System or by the appropriate state banking regulatory
authorities of the states in which they are located. State Street’s non-U.S. banking subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which they are located. State Street’s U.S. broker-dealer
subsidiary is subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, a self-regulatory organization. The capital of each of these banking subsidiaries is in excess of the
minimum legal capital requirements as set by those authorities.

State Street and its non-bank subsidiaries are affiliates of State Street Bank under the federal banking laws, which impose certain restrictions on transfers of funds in the form of loans, extensions of credit,
investments or asset purchases from State Street Bank to State Street and its non-bank subsidiaries. Transfers of this kind to State Street and its non-bank subsidiaries by State Street Bank are limited to 10% of State Street Bank’s capital and
surplus with respect to each affiliate and to 20% in the aggregate, and are subject to certain collateral requirements. A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any
extension of credit or lease or sale of property or furnishing of services. Federal law also provides that certain transactions with affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or
at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions involving other non-qualified companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards,
that in good faith would be offered to, or would apply to, non-affiliated companies. The Federal Reserve Board has jurisdiction to regulate the terms of certain debt issues of bank holding companies.

State Street’s international banking operations are subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation K and related federal laws. Most of State Street’s international operations are conducted through
State Street Bank’s Edge corporation subsidiary or through international branches of State Street Bank. An Edge corporation is a member bank subsidiary organized under the authority of the Federal Reserve Board that, in general, conducts only
international activity. With the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, State Street Bank may invest more than 10 percent but not more than 20 percent of its capital and surplus in its Edge corporation subsidiary. State Street Bank has previously
utilized this authority, and, in connection with the recent Deutsche Bank transaction (see “Acquisition of Substantial Parts of the Global Securities Services Business of Deutsche Bank AG”), received approval to raise its investment in its
Edge corporation to the maximum amount permitted by law. Notwithstanding the 20 percent Edge corporation limit, State Street may continue to make new investments abroad directly (through the parent company or through direct, non-bank, subsidiaries
of the parent company) or through international bank branch expansion, which investments are not subject to a similar limitation. As State Street Bank’s capital and surplus grows, State Street Bank could also make incremental investments in the
Edge corporation subsidiary without exceeding the 20 percent limitation. Historically, State Street, in general, has found it more optimal from an operational and financial standpoint to expand abroad by increasing its investment in State Street
Bank’s Edge corporation subsidiary. State Street cannot predict with certainty the impact on the pace of its future international expansion in light of having reached the Edge corporation subsidiary investment limitation, but believes that, in
light of available alternatives, such limitation will not affect materially its ability to expand internationally in a manner that is acceptable from an operational and financial standpoint.

S u p p o r t  o f  S u b s i
  d i a r y  B a n k s .

Under
  Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is required to act as a
  source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks. Under this
  policy, State Street is expected to commit resources to its subsidiary banks
  in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy. In the event of
  a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding
  company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary
  bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority payment.

Dividends

As a bank holding company, State Street is a legal entity separate and distinct from State Street Bank and its non-bank subsidiaries. The right of State Street to participate as a stockholder in any distribution of
assets of State Street Bank upon its liquidation or reorganization or otherwise is subject to the prior claims by creditors of State Street Bank, including obligations for federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements and
deposit liabilities. Payment of dividends by State Street Bank is subject to provisions of the Massachusetts banking law, which provide that dividends may be paid out of net profits provided (i) capital stock and surplus remain unimpaired, (ii)
dividend and retirement fund requirements of any preferred stock have been met, (iii) surplus equals or exceeds capital stock, and (iv) losses and bad debts, as defined, in excess of reserves specifically established for such losses and bad debts,
have been deducted from net profits. Under the Federal Reserve Act, the approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System would be required if dividends declared by the Bank in any year would exceed the total of its net profits for
that year combined with retained net profits for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. Under applicable federal and state law restrictions, at December 31, 2002, State Street Bank had $1.8 billion of retained earnings
available for distribution to State Street in the form of dividends. Future dividend payments of the Bank and non-bank subsidiaries cannot be determined at this time.

Economic Conditions and Government Policies

Economic policies of the government and its agencies influence the operating environment of State Street. Monetary policy conducted by the Federal Reserve Board directly affects the level of interest rates and overall
credit conditions of the economy. Policy is applied by the Federal Reserve Board through open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in reserve requirements for depository institutions, and changes in the discount rate and
availability of borrowing from the Federal Reserve. Government regulations of banks and bank holding companies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors of the banks, rather than of the stockholders of the institutions.

Factors Affecting Future Results

From time to time, information provided by State Street, statements made by its employees, or information included in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including this Form 10-K), may contain
statements that are considered “forward looking statements” within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws, including statements about the Corporation’s confidence and strategies and its expectations about revenue and market
growth, acquisitions and divestitures, new technologies, services and opportunities, and earnings. These statements may be identified by such forward looking terminology as “expect,” “look,” “believe,”
“anticipate,” “may,” “will,” or similar statements or variations of such terms. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Factors
that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors appearing in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the caption “Financial Goals
and Factors That May Affect Them,” factors further described in conjunction with the forward-looking information, and factors elsewhere mentioned in this Form 10-K. Each of these factors, and others, are also discussed from time to time in the
Corporation’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K speak only as of the time the statements were given, and the Corporation
does not undertake to revise those forward-looking statements to reflect events after the date of this report.

The maturities of debt investment securities at December 31, 2002, and the weighted average taxable-equivalent yields were as follows:

(1)

Yields calculated for interest revenue
      on non-taxable investment securities includes the effect of taxable-equivalent
      adjustments, a method of presentation in which interest income on tax-exempt
      securities is adjusted to present the earnings performance on a basis equivalent
      to interest earned on fully taxable securities with a corresponding charge
      to income tax expense. The adjustment is computed using a federal income
      tax rate of 35%, adjusted for applicable state income taxes, net of the
      related federal tax benefit. The taxable equivalent adjustment included
      in interest revenue to calculate the yields above was $31 million for the
      year ended December 31, 2002.

Loan Portfolio

U.S. and non-U.S. loans at December 31, and
  average loans outstanding for the years ended December 31, were as follows:

At December 31, 2002, loans comprised 5% of State Street’s assets. State Street’s loan policies limit the size of individual loan exposures to reduce risk through diversification. Loans are evaluated on an
individual basis to determine the appropriateness of renewing each loan. State Street does not have a general rollover policy. Unearned

revenue included in leases was $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion for non-U.S. leases, and $140 million and $160 million for U.S. leases, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Loan maturities for selected loan categories at December 31, 2002, were as follows:

The following table shows the classification of loans due after one year according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates at December 31, 2002:

N o n - a c c r u a l  L o a n s .

It is State Street’s policy to
  place loans on a non-accrual basis when they become 60 days past due as to either
  principal or interest, or when, in the opinion of management, full collection
  of principal or interest is unlikely. Loans eligible for non-accrual, but considered
  both well secured and in the process of collection, are treated as exceptions
  and may be exempted from non-accrual status. When the loan is placed on non-accrual
  status, the accrual of interest is discontinued and previously recorded but
  unpaid interest is reversed and charged against net interest revenue.

At year-end, there were no non-accrual loans in 2002, less than $1 million in 2001, $4 million in 2000, $9 million in 1999 and $12 million in 1998. There were no non-accrual loans to non-U.S. clients at December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, $5 million at year-end 1999, and none at year-end 1998.

There was less than $1 million of interest revenue related to non-accrual U.S. loans, which would have been otherwise recorded for the year ended December 31, 2002. There was less than $1 million of interest revenue
recorded in 2002 before placing loans on non-accrual.

P a s t  D u e  L o a n s .

Past due loans are loans on which principal or interest payments are over 90 days delinquent, but where interest continues to be accrued. There
were no past due loans as of year ended December 31, 2002 and there were less than $1 million as of each year ended December 31, 2001 through 1998. There were no past due loans included in loans to non-U.S. clients at the year-end 2002, less than $1
million at year-end 2001, none at year-end 2000, and less than $1 million at year-end 1999 and 1998.

Allowance for Loan Losses and Credit Quality

The changes in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended December 31, were as follows:

(1)

In December 2002, State Street
      completed the sale of a non-strategic business, which included the transfer
      of $1 million of the allowance for loan loss. On October 1, 1999, State
      Street completed the sale of its commercial banking business, which included
      the transfer of $36 million of the allowance for loan loss.

State Street establishes an allowance
        for loan losses to absorb probable credit losses. Management’s review
        of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is ongoing throughout
        the year and is based on many factors, including previous loss experience,
        current economic conditions and adverse situations that may affect the
        borrowers’ ability to repay, timing of future payments, estimated
        value of the underlying collateral and the performance of individual credits
        in relation to contract terms, and other relevant factors.

While the allowance is established to
        absorb probable losses inherent in the total loan portfolio, management
        allocates the allowance for loan losses to specific loans, selected portfolio
        segments and certain off-balance sheet exposures and commitments. State
        Street uses an internal rating system to assess loss exposure potential
        of loans based on current economic or client financial indicators. Loans
        adversely classified using State Street’s internal rating system
        in excess of $1 million are reviewed individually to evaluate risk of
        loss and assigned a specific allocation of the allowance. The allocations
        are based on an assessment of potential risk of loss and include evaluations
        of the borrowers’ financial strength, discounted cash flows, collateral,
        appraisals and guarantees. The allocations to portfolio segments and off-balance
        sheet exposures are based on management’s evaluation of relevant
        factors, including the current level of problem loans and current economic
        trends. These allocations are also based on subjective estimates and management’s
        judgment, and are subject to change from quarter to quarter. In addition,
        a portion of the allowance remains unallocated as a general reserve for
        the entire loan portfolio, and takes into account factors such as portfolio
        concentrations, current economic conditions and other risk factors.

At December 31, 2002, the allowance for
        loan losses was $61 million, or 1.46% of total loans. This compares with
        an allowance of $58 million, or 1.09% of total loans a year ago. In 2002,
        in the opinion of management, the measures of credit quality continued
        to be satisfactory.

State
        Street Corporation

The provision for loan losses is a charge to
  earnings for the current period that is required to maintain the total allowance
  at a level considered adequate in relation to the level of risk in the loan
  portfolio. The provision for loan losses was $4 million, $10 million and $9

State Street owns five buildings located in
  Quincy, Massachusetts, a city south of Boston. Four of the buildings, containing
  a total of approximately 1,365,000 square feet, function as State Street Bank’s
  principal operations facilities. The fifth building, with 186,000 square feet,
  is leased to Boston Financial Data Services, Inc., a 50%-owned affiliate. Additionally,
  State Street owns a 92,000 square-foot building in Westborough, Massachusetts,
  which is used as a data center, and is currently constructing a 130,000 square-foot
  data center in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, which is scheduled for completion
  in 2003.

State Street has leased 1,000,000 square feet
  of a building under construction in Boston, Massachusetts for an initial term
  of 20 years. The building is anticipated to be available for occupancy in June
  2003, at which time annual lease payments of approximately $60 million will

Business Summary

State Street is focused on providing sophisticated
  investors with a complete, integrated range of products and services anywhere
  in the world. State Street continually evaluates its business mix, and has sharpened
  its focus by divesting those businesses considered to be non-strategic and acquiring
  businesses to support this focus. In the past five years, State Street has divested
  its commercial banking, its trade banking and its corporate trust businesses,
  while acquiring several investment management and investment servicing businesses,
  most recently, International Fund Services, a provider of services for alternative
  investment portfolios such as hedge funds, in 2002, and a substantial portion
  of Deutsche Bank’s Global Securities Servicing business in 2003. While
  shaping its future, State Street delivered a twenty-five year record of growth
  in operating earnings per share.

State Street’s employees are focused on
  client service and enhancing the total client relationship with State Street.
  As a result, State Street has a high rate of recurring and cross-selling revenues.
  While most of State Street’s client services result in management or servicing
  fees, clients use a variety of other services that are recorded in foreign exchange,
  processing, or net interest revenue. Management remains focused on increasing
  total revenue.

While most of State Street’s revenue derives
  from its substantial market share in U.S. pension plans and mutual fund servicing,
  it continues to invest in developing businesses. These include servicing collective
  funds in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, offering outsourcing of
  middle- and back-office services and wealth management services, developing
  services for alternative investments, providing analysis and data analytics
  to enhance foreign exchange and equity execution, and offering enhanced-index
  investment management strategies.

State Street’s solid performance in 2002,
  despite a third consecutive year of declining values in equity markets worldwide
  and a somewhat flat interest rate environment, was due to winning business from
  new and existing clients, expanding its product offering, and closely managing
  its expenses.

State
  Street Corporation

Financial Summary

State Street’s earnings per share were
  $3.10 in 2002, up $1.20 from $1.90 in 2001. The results for 2002 include a gain
  on the sale of State Street’s corporate trust business of $495 million,
  equal to $296 million after tax, or $.90 of diluted earnings per share. The
  results for 2001 included the write-off of State Street’s total investment
  in Bridge Information Systems, Inc. (Bridge) of $50 million, equal to $33 million
  after tax, or $.10 of diluted earnings per share, and by the effect of goodwill
  amortization expense of $38 million, equal to $26 million after tax, or $.08
  of diluted earnings per share. Adjusting 2002 results to exclude the gain on
  the sale of the corporate trust business, resulting earnings per share would
  be $2.20. Adjusting 2001 results to exclude the write-off of Bridge and goodwill
  amortization expense, resulting earnings per share would be $2.08 for 2001.

Net income was $1.0 billion, up $387 million
  from net income of $628 million in 2001. Of this increase, $355 million is attributable
  to non-operating items, including the net after-tax gain on the sale of State
  Street’s corporate trust business in 2002, and the after-tax write-off
  of Bridge and after-tax goodwill amortization expense in 2001. Adjusting these
  results to reflect ongoing operations without such items, current year net
  income was up $32 million over 2001.

The Corporation’s total revenue was $4.4
  billion, an increase of $569 million from total revenue of $3.8 billion in 2001.
  Of this increase, $545 million is attributable to non-operating items, including
  the gain on the sale of the corporate trust business in 2002, and the write-off
  of Bridge in 2001. Adjusting these results to reflect ongoing operations without
  such items, 2002 total revenue increased $24 million from 2001.

The increase in total revenue of $24 million
  from ongoing operations was driven by growth in servicing and management fees,
  brokerage fees and gains on the sales of available-for-sale securities, largely
  offset by declines in foreign exchange trading fee revenue and net interest
  revenue.

Servicing fees for 2002 of $1.7 billion were
  up $68 million from 2001. New business from existing and new clients, including
  business gained through an acquisition in July 2002, drove growth in servicing
  fees, more than offsetting constraints imposed by the decline in comparable
  average equity market valuations and lower securities lending revenue. Assets
  under custody were $6.2 trillion, down $32 billion from a year ago, reflecting
  declines in equity market valuations, largely offset by the installation of
  new business.

State Street Corporation

| 19

Management fees of $526 million in 2002 were
  up $10 million from the prior year, reflecting continued sales success over
  the last twelve months, significantly offset by lower equity market valuations.
  Assets under management were $763 billion, down from $775 billion a year ago.

Foreign exchange trading revenue was $300 million,
  compared to $368 million a year ago, with the decrease reflecting a lower number
  of customer trades and lower currency volatility in the currencies in which
  State Street trades. Net interest revenue was $979 million, a decline of $46
  million from 2001. Lower yields on assets, reflecting the continuing decline
  in interest rates, offset growth in the balance sheet and lower liability costs.

Brokerage fee revenue was $124 million in 2002,
  compared to $89 million a year ago, driven primarily by significantly higher
  equity trading volumes. Securities gains were $76 million, compared to $43 million
  a year ago reflecting opportunities created by continued declines in market
  yields on fixed-income securities.

State Street’s earnings performance in
  2002 was partly the result of success in reducing expenses. Operating expenses
  were $2.8 billion in 2002, down $56 million from 2001. Of this decrease, $38
  million is attributable to goodwill amortization expense recorded in 2001, but
  no longer expensed in 2002 in accordance with generally accepted accounting
  principles. Adjusting for this accounting change, 2002 total expenses decreased
  $18 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to efforts by State Street
  to closely manage expenses, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions.

State Street’s primary financial goal
  is to achieve sustainable, real growth in earnings per share. State Street measures
  this goal on an operating basis that excludes significant, non-operating items.
  On an operating basis, over the last five years, diluted operating earnings
  per share increased at a 14% nominal compound annual growth rate.

State Street has two supporting financial goals,
  one for total revenue on an operating basis and one for return on stockholders’
  equity on an operating basis. State Street’s total revenue goal is 12.5%
  real compound annual growth from 2000 through 2010. State Street expects to
  meet its goal over the stated period. Operating return on stockholders’
  equity for 2002 was 17.1%. State Street’s goal is 18% per year.

Revenue

State Street is one of the world’s leading
  specialists in servicing mutual funds, collective funds and pension plans. The
  Corporation provides investment management and industry-leading technology and
  information services to support financial strategies and transactions for sophisticated
  global investors. State Street has integrated its products and services to meet
  client needs throughout every phase of the investment cycle. This integration
  positions State Street to grow with its clients by providing additional products
  and services globally as client requirements expand. State Street’s focus
  on total client relationships results in high client retention, cross-selling
  opportunities and recurring revenue.

In addition to revenue directly related to
  client transaction activity, State Street benefits from its ability to earn
  additional revenue from the transaction flows of clients. This occurs through
  the management of cash positions, including deposit balances and other short-term
  investment activities, using State Street’s balance sheet capacity. Significant
  foreign currency transaction volumes generate foreign exchange trading revenue
  as well.

Fee Revenue

Total fee revenue was $2.9 billion in 2002,
  compared to $2.8 billion in 2001, an increase of $81 million. Of this increase,
  $50 million is attributable to the write-off of State Street’s total investment
  in Bridge recorded in 2001. The remaining increase of $31 million is primarily
  attributable to growth in servicing and brokerage fees, partially offset by
  a decline in foreign exchange trading revenue.

Servicing and management fees are the largest
  components of fee revenue. Combined, they comprise 79% of State Street’s
  total fee revenue. Collectively, servicing and management fees increased 4%
  over 2001, compared to a 6% increase for 2001 over 2000. Servicing and management
  fees are a function of several factors, including

20 |

State
  Street Corporation

the mix and volume of assets under custody
  and assets under management, securities positions held, and volume of portfolio
  transactions, as well as types of products and services used by clients. Servicing
  and management fees are affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed income
  valuations. In general, servicing fees are affected by changes in daily average
  valuations of assets under custody, and management fees are affected by changes
  in month-end valuations of assets under management. Management fee revenue is
  significantly more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue.
  State Street estimates, based on a recent study, that a 10% increase or decrease
  in worldwide equity values would cause a corresponding change in State Street’s
  total revenue of approximately 2%. If fixed income security values were to increase
  or decrease by 10%, State Street would anticipate a corresponding change of
  approximately 1% in its total revenue.

The following table provides selected equity
  market indices, which demonstrate worldwide equity market valuation changes
  in 2002:

[The index names mentioned in this report
  are service marks of their respective owners.]

Securities lending revenue is reflected in
  both servicing fees and management fees. Securities lending revenue in 2002
  decreased approximately 15% from 2001, compared to an increase of approximately
  40% from 2000 to 2001. Securities lending revenue is principally a function
  of the volume of securities lent and interest rate spreads. While loan volumes
  increased in 2002, interest rate spreads decreased significantly. Interest rate
  spreads narrowed in 2002 compared to wider spreads resulting from the unusual
  occurrence of eleven reductions in the U.S. federal funds target rate in 2001.

Strong new business drove growth in both servicing
  fees and management fees, offsetting the impact of lower worldwide equity market
  valuations and lower securities lending revenue.

S e r v i c i n g   F e e s

Servicing fees for 2002 of $1.7 billion were
  up $68 million from 2001, primarily due to new business from existing and new
  clients, and State Street’s acquisition of International Fund Services,
  a leading servicer of alternative investments, including hedge funds, in July
  2002. Growth in servicing fees was constrained by lower securities lending revenue
  compared to the very strong results of 2001, when declining interest rates drove
  revenue strength, and lower equity market valuations in 2002 compared to 2001.
  Assets under custody were $6.2 trillion, down $32 billion from a year ago.

State Street provides solutions to meet the
  needs of managers of mutual funds, collective funds, pension and retirement
  plans and other institutional investors worldwide through offices and a global
  custodian network that spans more than 100 geographic markets.

Servicing
  fees include fee revenue from U.S. mutual funds, collective funds worldwide,
  non-U.S. retirement plans and other non-U.S. investment pools. Products and
  services include custody, accounting, daily pricing and administration; trusteeship
  and recordkeeping; investment manager operations outsourcing; and securities
  lending. In 2002, revenue growth from servicing U.S. mutual funds and collective
  funds was primarily due to new business from new and existing clients, achieved
  despite unfavorable equity market valuations and cash outflows from stock mutual
  funds in 2002. Growth in servicing revenue outside the U.S. was primarily attributable
  to the acquisition of International Fund Services in July 2002.

State Street is the largest mutual fund custodian
  and accounting agent in the United States. State Street provides custody services
  for 47% of registered U.S. mutual funds and distinguishes itself from other
  mutual fund service providers because clients make extensive use of a number
  of related services, including accounting, daily pricing and fund administration.
  The Corporation provides fund accounting and valuation services for more than
  four times the funds serviced by the next largest accounting service provider.
  State Street calculates approximately 30% of the U.S. mutual fund prices that
  appear daily in

The Wall Street Journal.

A long-term revenue driver is the number of
  mutual funds the Corporation services. In 2002, the total number of funds State
  Street serviced increased by 443, or 9%, to 5,123. There were 969 new funds
  serviced, 613 from existing clients and 356 from new clients, partially offset
  by 526 funds no longer serviced, primarily due to fund liquidations and consolidations.

State Street’s services for investment
  managers include operations outsourcing. Through these services, State Street
  provides global asset managers with a comprehensive suite of services, from
  trade order management through settlement, for their middle and back offices.
  Services include securities trade order processing, custodian communications
  for settlements, accounting systems, and networks and information technology
  development.

State Street provides
  master trust, master custody, securities lending, and performance, risk and
  compliance analytics to corporate and public pension funds, other institutional
  retirement funds, insurance companies, foundations, endowments and corporate
  and public treasurers. These clients make extensive use of many other products
  and services, including securities lending, investment management, and foreign
  exchange and equity trade execution. In 2002, revenue growth from new business
  from new and existing clients was not enough to offset the decline in securities
  lending revenue.

At 29% market share, State Street has a leading
  position in the market for servicing U.S. tax-exempt assets for corporate and
  public pension funds. Additionally, State Street provides trust and valuation
  services for over 3,600 daily-priced, unitized defined contribution accounts,
  making State Street a leader in this market.

At year-end 2002, total
  assets under custody were $6.2 trillion, down $32 billion from 2001. The value
  of assets under custody is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets
  served. Changes to the value of assets under custody do not result in proportional
  changes in revenue. State Street uses relationship pricing for clients who take
  advantage of multiple services. Many services are priced on factors other

In 2002, management fees were $526 million,
  up $10 million, or 2%, from 2001. Strong new business wins drove growth in management
  fees, offsetting the impact of lower equity market valuations and lower securities
  lending revenue. While certain management fees are directly determined by the
  value of assets under management and the investment strategy employed, management
  fees reflect other factors as well, including State Street’s relationship
  pricing for clients who use multiple services and performance-related fees.

State Street provides an extensive range of
  investment management strategies, securities lending, specialized investment
  management advisory services and other financial services for corporations,
  public funds, high-net-worth individuals and other sophisticated investors.
  These services are offered through State Street Global Advisors® (SSgA®).
  SSgA is the sixth largest investment manager in the world, based upon assets
  under management, and the largest manager of assets for tax-exempt organizations,
  primarily pension plans, in the United States.

SSgA offers a broad array of investment strategies,
  including passive, enhanced and active management using quantitative and fundamental
  methods for both U.S. and global equities and fixed income securities. Fees
  are based on the investment strategy, the amount of the investment and the client’s
  total relationship with State Street.

Management fees earned outside the U.S. increased

  18%, to $300 million. Foreign exchange trading revenue is influenced by the
  volume of foreign exchange transactions and currency volatility. Though total
  volumes were up in 2002, currency volatility, as measured by State Street’s
  index of 43 currencies, was significantly lower than one year ago. State Street
  has increased its foreign exchange trading client base with State Street Global
  Link,® a sophisticated research and execution delivery network for investment
  managers. Global Link continues to attract new clients worldwide with information
  and advisory services, electronic trade execution, and trade confirmation and
  reporting capabilities.

Development of a comprehensive range of foreign
  exchange services to meet the needs of institutional investors helped State
  Street earn the number two ranking for “Best Overall FX Provider”
  in the most recently conducted worldwide survey of global foreign exchange providers

Brokerage fees were $124 million in 2002, a
  record year, up from $89 million in 2001. Growth was driven by significantly
  higher equity trading volumes by investment managers, including commission recapture
  and transition management services. The number of transitions managed increased
  13% in 2002 from 2001, and the volume of trading activity increased 26%.

Processing fees and other revenue includes
  fees from software licensing and maintenance, credit services, investment banking,
  structured products, trade banking, profits and losses from joint ventures,
  gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets, other trading
  profits and losses, and amortization of investments in tax-advantaged financings.

Processing fees and other revenue of $184 million
  was up $36 million from 2001. Excluding the write-off of Bridge of $50 million
  recorded in 2001, processing fees and other revenue was down $14 million year
  over year.

Net Interest Revenue

In serving sophisticated global investors,
  State Street provides short-term funds management, deposit services and repurchase
  agreements for cash positions associated with clients’ investment activities.

N E T  I N T E R E S T  R E V E N U E

Net interest revenue was $979 million in 2002,
  compared to $1.0 billion in 2001, a decrease of $46 million, or 5%. Lower prevailing
  yields on assets, as maturing assets were reinvested at the lower market rates
  during 2002, more than offset growth in the balance sheet and lower liability
  costs. Net interest revenue in 2001 benefited significantly from the favorable
  U.S. interest rate environment that resulted from the unusual occurrence of
  eleven reductions in the U.S. federal funds target rate and a favorable global
  interest rate environment. The excess of rates earned over rates paid decreased
  slightly from 1.27% in 2001 to 1.26% in 2002, on a taxable equivalent basis.
  Taxable equivalent basis is a method of calculation in which interest income
  on tax-exempt securities is adjusted to present the earnings performance on
  a basis equivalent to interest earned on fully-taxable securities. The adjustment
  is computed using a federal income tax rate of 35%, adjusted for applicable
  state income taxes, net of the related federal tax benefit.

The average balance sheet for 2002 increased
  $7.8 billion over 2001 to $79.1 billion, primarily from increased client investment
  activity, as well as balance sheet positions to take advantage of short-term
  market opportunities. State Street’s clients, in conjunction with their
  worldwide investment activities, increased the level of their U. S. time deposits
  and securities sold under repurchase agreements in 2002, driving the growth
  in the balance sheet.

Gains on Sales of Available-For-Sale Investment
  Securities

Securities gains were $76 million in 2002,
  up from $43 million in 2001. State Street took advantage of opportunities created
  by continued declines in market yields on fixed-income securities. Market yields
  on the two-year U.S. Treasury note dropped from 3.03% at year-end 2001 to 1.60%
  at year-end 2002. As of December 31, 2002, State Street had $26.5 billion of
  available-for-sale securities with $171 million in unrealized appreciation.

Operating  Expenses

Operating expenses were $2.8 billion, a decrease
  of $56 million from 2001. Of this decrease, $38 million is attributable to goodwill
  amortization expense recorded in 2001 that was not recorded in 2002 in accordance
  with a new pronouncement from the Financial Accounting Standards Board, effective
  January 1, 2002. Lower other expenses, reflecting reduced professional services
  and advertising expenses, contributed to the decline in total expenses. State
  Street maintained rigorous expense management throughout 2002.

Salaries and employee benefits expense increased
  $7 million in 2002. Slightly higher salary and pension expenses were largely
  offset by reduced contract services and lower incentive compensation expense.

Information systems and communications expense
  was $373 million in 2002, up 2% from the prior year. The low level of growth
  reflects management’s prioritization of projects and success in reducing
  costs.

Transaction processing services expense was
  $246 million, down $1 million from 2001. These expenses are volume related and
  include external contract services, subcustodian fees, equity trading services
  and fees related to securities settlement. Lower mutual fund shareholder activities
  resulting from both the decline in asset values and lower transaction volumes
  were largely offset by higher expenses associated with the growth in equity
  trading transactions.

Occupancy expense was $246 million, up $17
  million from 2001. State Street continued to grow globally, with new facilities
  in Europe and Canada in 2002.

Other expenses were $306 million, down $87
  million. Of this decrease, $38 million is attributable to goodwill that is no
  longer amortized. The decrease in other expenses included reduced professional
  services and advertising and sales promotion in 2002.

Income  Taxes

Income tax expense was $540 million in 2002,
  up $238 million compared to $302 million in 2001. In 2002, $199 million of tax
  expense is attributable to tax on the gain on the sale of the corporate trust
  business. In 2001, tax expense was reduced by $17 million for the write-off
  of Bridge. Excluding these non-operating items, income tax expense was $341
  million in 2002, compared to $319 million in 2001. In 2002, the effective tax
  rate was 32.1%, excluding the gain on the sale of corporate trust business,
  down slightly from 32.6% in 2001, which excludes the write-off of Bridge.

Acquisitions  and  Divestiture

In executing its strategic plan, from time
  to time State Street may enter into business acquisitions and strategic alliances,
  and may divest non-strategic operations. Acquisitions and strategic alliances
  enhance established capabilities by adding new products, services or technologies,
  expanding geographic reach, or selectively expanding market share. State Street
  continuously reviews and assesses various business opportunities related to
  this strategy.

On December 31, 2002, State Street completed
  the sale of its corporate trust business to U.S. Bank, N.A., the lead bank of
  U.S. Bancorp. The premium received on the sale was $725 million, $75 million
  of which was placed in escrow pending the successful transition of the business.
  Escrow payments, if made, will be paid on the 12-month and 18-month anniversaries
  of the closing. Exit costs associated with the sale totaled approximately

State
  Street Corporation

$118 million, and other associated costs were $37
  million. The after-tax gain, net of exit and other associated costs, totaled
  approximately $296 million, or $0.90 in diluted earnings per share.

In July 2002, State Street completed the purchase
  of International Fund Services (IFS), a leading provider of fund accounting
  and administration as well as securities trade support and operational services
  for hedge funds. As one of the largest providers of hedge funds services, IFS
  services over 100 large asset management firms and private equity fund managers,
  representing more than 350 funds globally. IFS is headquartered in New York
  City, with operations centers in New York City and Dublin, Ireland with approximately
  500 employees.

In October 2001, State Street completed the
  cash purchase of the passive equity business of Gartmore Investment Management
  plc (“Gartmore”) in the United Kingdom. Gartmore’s passive equity
  business had $25 billion of assets under management as of the date of purchase.
  Under the terms of the agreement, SSgA hired the Gartmore team that manages,
  services and administers the passive equity business.

In June 2001, State Street purchased DST Portfolio
  Systems, Inc. (“DPS”) for 1,483,000 shares of State Street common
  stock and cash in a transaction accounted for as a purchase. Included in the
  purchase was the Portfolio Accounting System of DPS, an integrated system that
  automates mutual fund accounting and investment management recordkeeping processes,
  such as securities pricing and dividend calculations, income and expense accruals,
  securities inventories, accounting for daily shareholder activity and calculation
  of daily net asset values.

In February 2001, State Street purchased Bel
  Air Securities LLC and a majority interest in Bel Air Investment Advisors LLC
  (“Bel Air”) for 1,007,000 shares (2,015,000 shares post split) of
  State Street common stock and cash in a transaction accounted for as a purchase.
  Bel Air is a Los Angeles-based investment management firm with assets under
  management of $4 billion at the date of purchase, focused on providing wealth
  management services to ultra-high-net worth individuals.

On January 31, 2003, State Street completed
  the primary closing of its acquisition of a substantial part of the global securities
  services business (“GSS”) of Deutsche Bank AG. Under the terms of
  the definitive agreements, first announced on November 5, 2002, State Street’s
  initial payment to Deutsche Bank for all business units to be acquired was approximately
  $1.1 billion. A separate closing will be held in the near future for business
  units in Italy and Austria, upon receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.
  In the period ending on the one-year anniversary of the closing, State Street
  will make additional payments of up to an estimated €360 million, based
  upon performance of the acquired business. The restructuring costs associated
  with the acquisition are expected to be $90–$110 million on a pre-tax basis,
  approximately half of which will be recorded in the first quarter of 2003 and
  the balance recorded over the next three quarters. GSS had approximately $2.2
  trillion of assets under custody.

Comparison  of  2001  versus

State Street’s earnings per share were
  $1.90 in 2001, an increase of 5% over 2000 earnings per share of $1.81. Total
  revenue was $3.8 billion, an increase of 7% from 2000. Net income was $628 million,
  up 6% from 2000 net income of $595 million. Return on stockholder’s equity
  was 17.3%. Results for 2001 include the write-off of State Street’s total
  investment in Bridge Information Systems, Inc. (“Bridge”) of $50 million,
  equal to $33 million after tax, or $.10 per diluted share. The write-off of
  Bridge reduced the return on stockholders’ equity from 18.2% to 17.3%.

The Corporation’s total revenue was $3.8
  billion, an increase of $250 million, or 7%, over 2000. On April 1, 2000, State
  Street contributed its retirement investment and benefits outsourcing services
  to a 50/50 joint venture, CitiStreet, accounted for using the equity method,
  thereby reducing revenue and expenses of State Street subsequent to CitiStreet’s
  formation. Adjusted to exclude the revenue and expenses of services contributed
  to CitiStreet from the first quarter of 2000 (“adjusted for the formation
  of CitiStreet”) and excluding the write-off of Bridge of $50 million in
  2001, the growth in total operating revenue increased 10%. In 2001, servicing
  fees and net interest revenue drove revenue growth.

In 2001, servicing fees were $1.6 billion,
  up 14% from 2000. Growth in servicing fees primarily reflects several large
  client wins installed starting in the latter half of 2000 and continuing throughout
  2001, and a significant increase in securities lending fees. Strength in securities
  lending revenue was primarily driven by wider interest rate spreads in a favorable
  2001 U.S. interest rate environment as a result of the unusual occurrence of
  eleven reductions in the U.S. federal funds target rate during 2001. Declines
  in equity market values worldwide offset some of the growth in servicing fees.

In 2001, management fees were $516 million,
  down $68 million, or 12%, from 2000. Adjusted for the formation of CitiStreet,
  these fees decreased $24 million, or 5%, from 2000 to 2001. In the investment
  management business, fees are generally asset-based, and the decline in equity
  markets significantly reduced management fees on a year-over-year basis. Revenue
  growth from acquisitions, securities lending and new business partially offset
  the unfavorable impact of declines in market values.

In 2001, foreign exchange trading revenue decreased
  5%, to $368 million. In 2001, trading volumes were strong, both in the number
  and total U.S.-dollar value of transactions. The impact of volume growth was
  more than offset by decreased volatility in 2001, as measured by State Street’s
  index of 43 currencies.

Brokerage fees were $89 million, down $6 million
  from the prior year, driven by lower client trading activities and lower portfolio
  transition and rebalancing management.

Processing fees and other revenue of $148 million
  were down $29 million from 2000. Excluding the write-off of Bridge, processing
  fees and other were up $21 million. Additional revenue resulted from the acquisition
  of a portfolio accounting service acquired in June 2001.

Net interest revenue was $1.0 billion in 2001,
  compared to $894 million in 2000, an increase of $131 million, or 15%. Growth
  in State Street’s balance sheet, driven by clients’ investment activities,
  was a significant factor in the growth in net interest revenue. Net interest
  revenue benefited significantly from the favorable U.S. interest rate environment
  that resulted from the unusual occurrence of eleven reductions in the U.S. federal
  funds target rate during 2001, and a favorable global interest rate environment.
  The excess of rates earned over rates paid increased from .99% to 1.27%. The
  growth in net interest revenue due to the growth in balance sheet size, up $8.4
  billion over 2000, and the favorable interest rate environment was partially
  offset by lower client demand deposit volumes, reflecting the reduction in client
  transactions during the year.

Securities gains were $43 million in 2001,
  up from $2 million in 2000, reflecting State Street’s total return strategy.

State
  Street Corporation

Reducing the rate of expense growth was a key
  factor in State Street’s 2001 earnings performance. State Street continued
  to invest for the future by carefully pacing spending on strategic initiatives
  and technology projects that were critical to long-term growth. Operating expenses
  were $2.9 billion, an increase of $226 million, or 8% over 2000. Adjusted for
  the formation of CitiStreet, operating expenses grew 10%, significantly lower
  than the comparable 20% expense growth in 2000 over 1999. The year-over-year
  growth in expenses reflects higher salaries and employee benefits expense, partially
  offset by lower incentive-based compensation, and higher information systems
  and communications expense.

Salaries and employee benefits expense increased
  $139 million in 2001, or $163 million when adjusted for the formation of CitiStreet.
  The adjusted increase reflects more than 2,100 additional staff to support the
  large client wins and new business from existing clients and acquisitions. This
  expense increase was partially offset by lower incentive-based compensation.

Information systems and communications expense
  was $365 million in 2001, up 20% from the prior year. Adjusted for the formation
  of CitiStreet, information systems and communications expense increased 22%.
  This growth reflects both continuing investment in software and hardware, as
  well as the technology costs associated with increased staffing levels.

Expenses related to transaction processing
  services were $247 million, down $21 million, or 8%. These expenses are volume
  related and include external contract services, subcustodian fees, brokerage
  services and fees related to securities settlement. Lower mutual fund shareholder
  activities, and lower subcustodian fees resulting from both the decline in asset
  values and lower transaction volumes, drove the decline.

Occupancy expense was $229 million, up 15%.
  The increase is due to expenses necessary to support State Street’s global
  growth, and expenses incurred for leasehold improvements and other operational
  costs.

Other expenses were $393 million, up $20 million
  from 2000. These expenses include professional services and advertising and
  sales promotion. The increase over prior year is due to a $21 million increase
  in the amortization of goodwill, primarily from acquisitions in 2001. State
  Street’s cost containment efforts, which reduced discretionary spending,
  partially offset the increase in other expenses.

Income tax expense was $302 million in 2001,
  down from $311 million in 2000. Tax expense for 2001 included a benefit of $17
  million for the write-off of State Street’s investment in Bridge. In 2001,
  the effective tax rate, excluding the write-off of Bridge, was 32.6% compared
  to 34.3% in 2000.

Lines  of  Business

State Street reports two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management. Given the nature of State Street’s services and management organization, the results of operations for these lines of
business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies.

Revenue and expenses are directly charged or allocated to the lines of business through algorithm-based management information systems. State Street prices its products and services on total client relationships and
other factors; therefore, revenue may not necessarily reflect market pricing on products within the business lines in the same way as it would for independent business entities. Assets and liabilities are allocated according to rules that support
management’s strategic and tactical goals. Capital is allocated based on risk-weighted assets employed and management’s judgment. The capital allocations may not be representative of the capital that might be required if these lines of
business were independent business entities.

State Street measures its line of business results on an operating basis. As such, the table below includes an “Other” category for the gain in 2002 for the sale of the corporate trust business of $495
million, the write-off in 2001 of State Street’s total investment in Bridge of $50 million and goodwill amortization expense in 2001 and 2000. See Note 13 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The following is a summary of the results for lines of business for the years ended December 31:

Investment  Servicing

Investment Servicing includes custody, accounting, daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; trusteeship and recordkeeping; foreign exchange; securities lending; deposit and short-term
investment facilities; lease financing; investment manager operations outsourcing; and performance, risk and compliance analytics to support institutional investors. State Street provides shareholder services, which includes mutual fund and
collective fund shareholder accounting, through 50%-owned affiliates, Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. and the International Financial Data Services group of companies.

Total revenue in 2002 increased to $3.3 billion, up $25 million, or less than 1% from 2001. Servicing fees, brokerage fees and gains on the sales of available-for-sale securities drove revenue growth, largely offset by
declines in foreign exchange trading revenue and net interest revenue. Growth in servicing fees primarily reflects new business from existing and new clients, including clients gained from an acquisition in July 2002. Growth in servicing fees was
constrained by lower securities lending revenue and lower equity market valuations in 2002 compared to 2001. Growth in brokerage fees reflected higher equity trading volumes by investment managers, including commission recapture and transition
management services. Higher gains on the sales of available-for-sale securities reflected opportunities created by continued declines in market yields on fixed income securities. Foreign exchange trading revenue was down $68 million from 2001,
reflecting decreased currency volatility and customer trades. Net interest revenue after provision for loan losses declined $20 million from 2001 due to lower yields on reinvested assets, offset somewhat by balance sheet growth and lower liability
costs. Net interest revenue in 2001 benefited significantly from the unusual occurrence of eleven reductions in the U.S. federal funds target rate and a favorable global interest rate environment.

Servicing fees, foreign exchange trading revenue and brokerage fees for the Investment Servicing line of business are identical to the respective total consolidated results. Please refer to the “Servicing
Fees,” “Foreign Exchange Trading” and “Brokerage Fees” captions in the “Fee Revenue” section of this Financial Review for a more in-depth discussion. Processing fees and other revenue for Investment Servicing are
nearly identical to the consolidated information provided under the caption “Processing Fees and Other” in the “Fee Revenue” section of this Financial Review. Processing fees and other revenue includes fees from software
licensing and maintenance, credit services, investment banking, structured products, trade banking, profits and losses from joint ventures, gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets, other trading profits and losses, and
amortization of investments in tax-advantaged financings.

Net interest revenue for Investment Servicing is nearly identical to the consolidated net interest revenue discussed under the “Net Interest Revenue” caption in the “Revenue” section of this
Financial Review. A small amount of net interest revenue is recorded in the Investment Management line of business.

Operating expenses were $2.3 billion, a decrease of $13 million from 2001. Increases in salaries and pension costs were more than offset by lower contract services, incentive-based compensation and State Street’s
cost containment efforts.

Investment  Management

Investment Management offers a broad array of services for managing financial assets, including investment management and investment research for both institutions and individual investors worldwide. These services
include active and passive U.S. and non-U.S. equity and fixed income strategies, and other related services, such as securities lending.

Total revenue in 2002 was $598 million, down $1 million from $599 million in 2001.

State Street Corporation

| 31

In 2002, management fees were $526 million, up $10 million, or 2%, from 2001. Management fees for the Investment Management line of business are identical to the respective total consolidated results. Please refer to
the “Management Fees” caption in the “Fee Revenue” section of this Financial Review for a more in-depth discussion. Processing and other fee revenue includes profits and losses from joint ventures and other revenue.

Operating
expenses in 2002 were $511 million, down $5 million from 2001. Lower expenses reflect State Street’s cost containment efforts.

Financial  Goals  and  Factors  That
   May  Affect  Them

State Street’s primary financial goal is sustainable real growth in earnings per share. The Corporation has two supporting goals, one for total revenue growth and one for return on common stockholders’ equity
(ROE). The long-term revenue goal is a 12.5% real (inflation-adjusted) compound annual growth rate of revenue for 2000 through 2010. At present, this equates to approximately a 15% nominal compound annual growth rate. The annual ROE goal is
18%.

State Street considers these to be financial goals, not projections or forward-looking statements. However, the discussion in this Financial Review, and in other portions of the Annual Report, may contain statements
that are considered “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws. These statements may be identified by such forward-looking terminology as “expect,” “look,” “believe,”
“anticipate,” “may,” “will,” or similar statements or variations of such terms. The Corporation’s financial goals and such forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties, including the issues
and factors listed below and factors further described in conjunction with the forward-looking information, which could cause actual results to differ materially. The following issues and factors should be carefully considered. The forward-looking
statements contained in the Annual Report speak only as of the time the statements were given. The Corporation does not undertake to revise those forward-looking statements to reflect events after the date of this report.

C r o s s - b o r d e r  i n v e s
  t i n g .

Increased cross-border
  investing by clients worldwide benefits State Street’s revenue. Future
  revenue may increase or decrease depending upon the extent of increases or decreases
  in cross-border investments made by clients. Economic and political uncertainties
  resulting from terrorist attacks, subsequent military actions or other events
  could result in decreased cross-border investment activities.

S a v i n g s  r a t e  o f 
  i n d i v i d u a l s .

State
  Street generally benefits when individuals invest their savings in mutual funds
  and other collective funds or in defined contribution plans. Changes in savings
  rates or investment styles may affect revenue. If there is a decline in the
  savings rates of individuals, or if there is a change in investment preferences
  that leads to fewer investments in mutual funds, other collective funds, and
  defined contribution plans, State Street’s revenue may be adversely affected.

A s s e t  v a l u e s   i n  w
  o r l d w i d e  f i n a n c i a l  m a r k e t s .

As
  asset values in worldwide financial markets increase or decrease, State Street’s
  opportunities to invest and service financial assets may change. Since a portion
  of the Corporation’s fees are based on the value of assets under custody
  and management, fluctuations in the valuation of worldwide securities markets
  will affect revenue. State Street estimates, based on a study conducted in 2000,
  that a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would cause a corresponding
  change in State Street’s total revenue of approximately 2%. If fixed income
  security values worldwide were to increase or decrease by 10%, State Street
  would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately 1% in its total revenue.

Changes
  in markets served, including the growth rate of collective funds worldwide,
  outsourcing decisions, mergers, acquisitions and consolidations among clients
  and competitors and the pace of debt issuance, can affect revenue. In general,
  State Street benefits from increases in the volume of financial market transactions
  serviced.

State Street provides services worldwide. Global and regional economic factors and changes or potential changes in laws and regulations affecting the Corporation’s business — including volatile currencies,
the pace of inflation, changes in monetary policy, changes in domestic and international banking supervisory regulations including capital requirements, and social and political instability — could affect results of operations. For example, the
significant slowing of economic growth globally is affecting worldwide equity values and business growth. The terrorist attacks that took place in the United States on September 11, 2001, and subsequent military and terrorist activities, have caused
economic and political uncertainties. These activities, the national and global efforts to combat terrorism, and other potential military activities and outbreaks of hostilities have affected and may further adversely affect economic growth, and may
have other adverse effects on many companies, including State Street, in ways that are not predictable.

In a similar manner, financial reporting irregularities involving large and well-known companies may have other adverse effects on State Street in ways which are not predictable. In addition, State Street cannot
predict the final form of, or the effects of, the regulatory accord on international banking institutions to be reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.

Legislation may cause changes in the competitive environment in which State Street operates, which could include, among other things, broadening the scope of activities of significant competitors, facilitating
consolidation of competitors into stronger entities, or attracting large and well-capitalized new competitors into State Street’s traditional businesses. Such factors and changes and the ability of the Corporation to address and adapt to the
regulatory and competitive challenges may affect future results of operations.

A c c o u n t i n g  p o l i c i e
  s .

Changes in accounting principles
  generally accepted in the United States applicable to State Street could have
  a material impact on the Corporation’s reported results of operations.
  While such changes may not have an economic impact on the business of State
  Street, these changes could affect the attainment of the current measures of
  the Corporation’s financial goals.

I n t e r e s t  r a t e s .

The
  levels of market interest rates, the shape of the yield curve and the direction
  of interest rate changes relative to the currency mix of the Corporation’s
  interest-bearing assets and liabilities affect net interest revenue and securities
  lending revenue, which is recorded in both servicing and management fees. In
  the short term, State Street’s net interest revenue and securities lending
  revenue benefit from falling interest rates and are negatively affected by rising
  rates because interest-bearing liabilities reprice sooner than interest-earning
  assets. Sustained lower interest rates and a flat yield curve may have a constraining
  effect on the net interest revenue and securities lending revenue growth.

Any
  occurrence that may limit the Corporation’s access to the funds markets,
  such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, depositors or counterparties
  participating in the funds markets in general or with State Street in particular,
  or a downgrade of State Street’s debt rating, may adversely affect State
  Street’s ability to raise capital and, in turn, its liquidity.

C a p i t a l .

Under
  regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, State Street and State Street Bank must
  meet guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and
  certain off-balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators
  about components, risk weightings and other factors. Failure to meet minimum
  capital requirements could have a direct material effect on State Street’s
  financial condition; failure to maintain the status of “well capitalized”
  under the regulatory framework could affect State Street’s status as a
  financial holding company and eligibility for a streamlined review process for
  acquisition proposals. In addition, failure to maintain the status of “well
  capitalized” could affect the confidence of State Street’s clients
  in the Corporation and could adversely affect its business.

Also, under Federal Reserve Board regulations
  and related federal laws, there are limits on investment of the capital and
  surplus of State Street Bank in subsidiaries that, in general, conduct only
  international activities. State Street Bank is near the limit on such permitted
  use of capital and surplus. This limit may affect the pace of future international
  expansion by State Street Bank through these subsidiaries, although there are
  available alternatives for international expansion by State Street and State
  Street Bank. This limit may not have a similar impact on those competitors of

The degree of
  volatility in foreign exchange rates can affect the amount of foreign exchange
  trading revenue. In general, State Street benefits from currency volatility.
  Accordingly, foreign exchange revenue is likely to decrease during times of
  decreased currency volatility.

State Street expects
  its business to benefit from worldwide pension reform that creates additional
  pools of assets that use custody and related services, and investment management
  services. The pace of pension reform and resulting programs, including public
  and private pension schemes, may affect the pace of revenue growth. If the pace
  of pension reform and resulting programs, including public and private pension
  schemes, slows down or if pension reform does not occur, then revenue growth
  may be adversely affected.

  terrorist or military actions and resulting political and social turmoil, could
  arise that would cause unforeseen damage to State Street’s physical facilities
  or could cause delays or disruptions to operational functions, including information
  processing and financial market settlement functions. Additionally, State Street’s
  clients, vendors and counterparties could suffer from such events. Should these
  events affect State Street, or the clients, vendors or counterparties with which
  it conducts business, State Street’s results of operations could be adversely
  affected.

Technological
  change often creates opportunities for product differentiation and reduced costs,
  as well as the possibility of increased expenses. Developments in the securities
  processing industry, including shortened settlement cycles and straight-through-processing,
  will result in changes to existing procedures. Alternative delivery systems
  have emerged, including the widespread use of the Internet. State Street’s
  financial performance depends in part on its ability to develop and market new
  and innovative services, and to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate
  State Street’s products or provide cost efficiencies.

The risks inherent in this process include rapid technological change in the industry, the Corporation’s ability to access technical and other information from clients, and the significant and ongoing investments
required to bring new services to market in a timely fashion at competitive prices. A further risk is the introduction by competitors of services that could replace or provide lower-cost alternatives to State Street services.

State Street uses trademark, trade secret, copyright and other proprietary rights procedures to protect its technology, and has applied for a limited number of patents in connection with certain software programs.
Despite these efforts, State Street cannot be certain that the steps taken by it to prevent unauthorized use of proprietary rights are sufficient to prevent misappropriation of technology, particularly outside the United States where laws or law
enforcement practices may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. In addition, no assurance can be given that the courts will adequately enforce contractual agreements that State Street has entered into to protect its
proprietary technology. If any of its proprietary information were misappropriated by or otherwise disclosed to its competitors, State Street’s competitive position could be adversely affected. In the event a third party asserts a claim of
infringement of its proprietary rights, obtained through patents or otherwise, against the Corporation, State Street may be required to spend significant resources to defend against such claims, develop a non-infringing program or process, or obtain
a license to the infringed process.

Acquisitions
  of complementary businesses and technologies and development of strategic alliances
  and divestitures of portions of its business are an active part of State Street’s
  overall business strategy. The Corporation has completed several acquisitions,
  alliances and divestitures in recent years. However, there can be no assurance
  that services, technologies, key personnel or businesses of acquired companies
  will be effectively assimilated into State Street’s business or service
  offerings or that alliances will be successful. In addition, State Street may
  not be able to successfully complete any divestiture on satisfactory terms,
  if at all, and divestitures may result in a reduction of total revenue and net
  income.

Financial Condition

Balance  Sheet

State Street provides deposit and other balance sheet services to its institutional investor clients. In executing their worldwide cash management activities, State Street’s clients use short-term investments and
deposit accounts that comprise the majority of State Street’s liabilities. These client investment activities affect the Corporation’s approach to managing interest rate sensitivity, liquidity and credit risk.

Liabilities

The growth in State Street’s balance sheet is primarily driven by growth in liabilities from clients’ activities, as well as balance sheet positions to take advantage of short-term market opportunities. State
Street uses its balance sheet capacity to support clients’ transactions and short-term investment strategies. State Street’s objectives and clients’ needs determine the volume, mix and currencies of the liabilities.

Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $7.8 billion, or 14%, in 2002, primarily from client investment activities. The most significant growth in liabilities occurred in U.S. interest-bearing deposits. Clients
are managing cash positions more aggressively due to weak financial markets and are shifting to short-term interest-bearing investments. U.S. interest-bearing deposits rose $4.6 billion, or 93%.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $788 million, or 11%. Clients use noninterest-bearing deposit accounts for transaction settlements and as compensation to State Street for services.

Assets

State Street’s assets consist primarily
  of short-term money market assets and investment securities, which are generally
  more liquid than other types of assets. Investment securities, principally classified
  as available-for-sale, include U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities,
  highly-rated municipal securities, asset-backed securities, money market mutual
  funds and non-U.S. government bonds. Money market assets include securities
  purchased under resale agreements, securities borrowed, federal funds sold and
  interest-bearing deposits with banks that are short-term, multicurrency instruments
  invested with major multinational banks.

36 |

State
  Street Corporation

Average interest-earning assets increased $7.6 billion, or 12%, in 2002. Total investment securities increased $3.8 billion, or 22%, from 2001, primarily due to investments in U.S. Treasuries and U.S. federal agencies.
Securities purchased under resale agreements grew $1.3 billion, or 7%, from 2001, primarily from the reinvestment of additional funds from client repurchase activities. Interest-bearing deposits with banks increased 18% from 2001, to $24.3 billion.
Average loans decreased $976 million, to $5.1 billion, due to lower average client overdraft balances.

Fair  Value  of  Financial
   Instruments

The short duration of State Street’s assets and liabilities results in the fair value of its financial instruments equating to or closely approximating their balance sheet value. See Note 22 in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Further quantitative information on State Street’s assets and liabilities is furnished in Notes 3 through 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Liquidity  and  Capital

Liquidity

The primary objective of State Street’s liquidity management is to ensure that the Corporation has sufficient funds to meet its commitments and business needs, including accommodating the transaction and cash
management requirements of its clients. Liquidity is provided by State Street’s access to global debt markets, its ability to gather additional deposits from its clients, maturing short-term assets, sales of securities and repayment of
clients’ loans. Client deposits and other funds provide multicurrency, geographically diverse sources of liquidity.

State Street maintains a large portfolio of liquid assets. When liquidity is measured by the ratio of liquid assets to total assets, State Street ranks among the highest 10% of U.S. bank holding and financial holding
companies. At December 31, 2002, the Corporation’s liquid assets were 88% of total assets.

State Street Bank can issue bank notes with an aggregate limit of $750 million and with original maturities ranging from 14 days to five years. At December 31, 2002, no notes payable were outstanding and all $750
million was available for issuance. State Street Corporation can issue commercial paper with an aggregate limit of $1.0 billion and with original maturities of up to 270 days from the date of issue. At December 31, 2002, State Street had $998
million of commercial paper outstanding. State Street maintains a universal shelf registration statement that allows for the offering and sale of unsecured debt securities, capital securities, common stock, depositary shares and preferred stock, and
warrants to purchase such securities, including any shares into which the preferred stock and depositary shares may be convertible, or any combination thereof. In August 2002, State Street filed a registration statement on Form S-3 to increase the
available amount of securities to be issued from $700 million to $1.5 billion. At December 31, 2002, $1.5 billion of the shelf registration was available for issuance. In January 2003, State Street issued securities from this shelf registration as
described below. See Notes 8 and 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

On January 31, 2003, State Street completed the primary closing of its acquisition of a substantial part of the global securities services business of Deutsche Bank AG. Under the terms of the definitive agreements,
first announced on November 5, 2002, State Street’s initial payment to Deutsche Bank for all business units to be acquired was approximately $1.1 billion. Approximately half of the initial payment was financed using existing resources,
including the net proceeds from the sale of the corporate trust business. State Street financed $595 million of the purchase price by issuance of equity, equity-related and capital securities to the public under an existing shelf registration
statement. See Note 25 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

State Street endeavors to maintain high ratings on its debt, as measured by independent credit rating agencies. High ratings on debt minimize borrowing costs and enhance State Street’s liquidity by ensuring the
largest possible market for the Corporation’s debt. State Street’s senior debt is rated AA– by Standard & Poor’s, Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and AA by Fitch, Inc. State Street Bank’s long-term deposits are rated AA
by Standard & Poor’s, Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service and AA+ by Fitch, Inc.

The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows provides additional liquidity information.

Capital

State Street’s objective in managing its capital is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for its business needs, including funding corporate growth and supporting
clients’ cash management needs.

As a state chartered bank and member of the Federal Reserve System, State Street Bank and Trust Company, State Street’s principal subsidiary, is primarily regulated by the Federal Reserve Board, which has
established guidelines for minimum capital ratios. State Street has developed internal capital adequacy policies to ensure that State Street Bank meets or exceeds the level required for the “well capitalized” category, the highest of the
Federal Reserve Board’s five capital categories. State Street Bank must meet the regulatory designation of “well capitalized” in order for State Street to maintain its status as a financial holding company. State Street’s capital
management emphasizes risk exposure rather than simple asset levels; at 16.4%, State Street Bank’s Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio significantly exceeds the regulatory minimum of 4% and is among the highest for U.S. banks, according to
published industry statistics. State Street’s Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 17.1% is likewise among the highest for U.S. bank holding companies. See Note 12 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information.

State Street’s Board of Directors has authorized the purchase of State Street common stock for use in employee benefit programs and for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2002, 8.3 million shares remain
available for purchase within the program. State Street employs a third-party broker-dealer to acquire shares for the Corporation’s stock purchase program on the open market. Additionally, State Street purchases shares of State Street common
stock not included as part of the stock purchase program for certain deferred compensation plans. The trusts which hold these shares employ a third-party broker-dealer to acquire the shares on the open market. In total, the Corporation bought 1.6 million shares in 2002. See Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information.

State
  Street Corporation

State Street has increased its quarterly dividend twice each year since 1978. Over the last fifteen years, dividends per share have grown at a 16% compound annual growth rate.

There were 5,454 stockholders of record of common
  stock as of December 31, 2002.

Risk  Management

In providing services for institutional investors globally, State Street must manage and control certain inherent risks. These include counterparty risk, credit risk, fiduciary risk, operations and settlement risk, and
market risk. Risk management is an integral part of State Street’s business activities and is centrally organized with close ties to the business units. This structure allows for corporate risk management across the business areas while
individual line areas remain responsible for risk management in their units. While State Street believes its risk management process is effective in managing the risks of its business, no system can eliminate all risks. If there is a material
failure in the risks managed by State Street, such as a material counterparty failure or a material default of a debtor, State Street’s results of operations could be adversely affected.

State Street maintains a system of internal controls that are designed to minimize risk. Management believes these internal controls are adequate to minimize such risk. This internal control environment is evaluated on
an annual basis through a SAS 70 review of most of the business units and through a report on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as required by the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991.

Risk management emphasizes establishing specific authorization levels and limits. Exposure levels are reviewed and modified as required by changing conditions. Analysis of business-risk concentration includes specific
industry concentrations of credit risk, country limits and individual counterparty limits. In managing country risk, State Street considers a variety of issues, including those related to credit quality, asset concentration, liquidity and settlement
risk.

Credit risk results from the possibility that a loss may occur if a counterparty becomes unable to meet the terms of a contract. State Street has policies and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of credit
risk. These include a comprehensive credit review and approval process that involves the assignment of risk ratings to all loans and off-balance sheet credit exposures. Rigorous processes for credit approval cover traditional credit facilities,
foreign exchange, placements, credit-enhancement services, securities lending and securities-clearing facilities.

Fiduciary risk is the risk of financial loss as a consequence of breaching a fiduciary duty to a client. Business units are responsible for operating within the rules and regulations applicable to their activities,
including any corporate guidelines. The Corporate Fiduciary Review Committee and the Compliance Committee work with the business units to oversee adherence to corporate standards.

State Street is a large servicer and manager of financial assets on a global scale; therefore, oversight of operational and settlement risk is an integral part of the management process throughout the Corporation.
State Street focuses on payment-system risk management, overdraft monitoring and control, and global securities clearing and settlement. In addition to specific authorization levels and limits, operational risk is mitigated by automation,
standardized operating procedures, segregation of duties and controls, timely confirmation and reconciliation procedures, and insurance.

Market  Risk:  Foreign  Exchange
   and  Interest  Rate  Sensitivity

State Street engages in trading and investment
  activities to serve clients’ investment and trading needs, which contribute
  to overall corporate earnings and enhances liquidity. In the conduct of these
  activities, the Corporation is subject to, and assumes, market risk. Market
  risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in market prices,
  such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The level of risk State Street
  assumes is a function of the Corporation’s overall objectives and liquidity
  needs, client requirements, and market volatility.

State Street manages its overall market risk
  through a comprehensive risk management framework. This structure includes a
  market risk management group that reports independently to senior management.
  Market risk from foreign exchange and trading activities is controlled through
  established limits on aggregate and net open positions, sensitivity to changes
  in interest rates, and concentrations. These limits are supplemented by stop-loss
  thresholds. The Corporation uses a variety of risk management tools and techniques,
  including value at risk, to measure, monitor and control market risk. All limits
  and measurement techniques are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular
  basis by business managers, the market risk management group and senior management.

State Street uses foreign exchange contracts and a variety of financial derivative instruments to support clients’ needs, conduct trading activities, and manage its interest rate and currency risk. These
activities are designed to create trading revenue or hedge net interest revenue. In addition, the Corporation provides services related to derivative instruments in its role as both a manager and servicer of financial assets.

State Street’s clients use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities. With the growth of cross-border investing, clients have an increasing need for
foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investment and to manage the currency risk in international investment portfolios. As an active participant in the foreign exchange markets, State Street provides foreign
exchange forward contracts and over-the-counter options in support of these client needs.

Trading  Activities:  Foreign  Exchange
   and  Interest  Rate  Sensitivity

As part of its trading activities, the Corporation
  assumes positions in both the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by
  buying and selling cash instruments and using financial derivatives, including
  foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options,
  and interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2002, the notional amounts of these
  derivative instruments was $248.4 billion, of which $227.8 billion were foreign
  exchange forward contracts. Long and short foreign exchange forward positions
  are closely matched to minimize currency and interest rate risk. All foreign
  exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates.

The Corporation uses a variety of risk measurement
  and estimation techniques, including value at risk. Value at risk is an estimate
  of potential loss for a given period of time within a stated statistical confidence
  interval. State Street uses a risk management system, Askari RiskBook,™
  to estimate value at risk daily for all material trading positions. The Corporation
  has adopted standards for estimating value at risk, and maintains capital for
  market risk, in accordance with the Federal Reserve’s Capital Adequacy
  Guidelines for market risk. Value at risk is estimated for a 99% one-tail confidence
  interval and an assumed one-day holding period using a historical observation
  period of greater than one year. A 99% one-tail confidence interval implies
  that daily trading losses should not exceed the estimated value at risk more
  than 1% of the time, or approximately three days out of the year. The methodology
  uses a simulation approach based on observed changes in interest rates and foreign
  exchange rates and takes into account the resulting diversification benefits
  provided from the mix of the Corporation’s trading positions.

Like all quantitative risk measures, value at risk is subject to certain limitations and assumptions inherent to the methodology. State Street’s methodology gives equal weight to all market rate observations
regardless of how recently the market rates were observed. The estimate is calculated using static portfolios consisting of positions held at the end of the trading day. Implicit in the estimate is the assumption that no intraday action is taken
by

40 |

State
  Street Corporation

management during adverse market movements. As a result, the methodology does not represent risk associated with intraday changes in positions or intraday price volatility.

The following table presents State Street’s market risk for its trading activities as measured by its value at risk methodology:

V A L U E  A T  R I S K  F O
  R  T H E  Y E A R  E N D E D  D E C E M B E R  3 1
  ,

State Street compares actual daily profit and losses from trading activities to estimated one-day value at risk. During 2002 and 2001, State Street did not experience any trading losses in excess of its end-of-day
value at risk estimate.

Non-Trading  Activities:  Currency  Risk

State Street had $15.2 billion of non-U.S.
  dollar-denominated non-trading assets as of December 31, 2002, which were funded
  by non-U.S. dollar-denominated deposits. State Street’s non-U.S. dollar-denominated
  non-trading assets included 53 currencies. Approximately 97% of these assets
  were in eight major currencies. Since non-trading assets are generally invested
  in the same currency in which the initial deposits are received, the risk associated
  with changes to currency exchange rates is minimal. To the extent that deposits
  are not reinvested in the same currency, the resulting net currency positions
  are managed as part of trading risk as discussed above.

In general, the maturities of these non-trading
  assets and liabilities are short term. To the extent duration mismatches exist,
  they are managed as part of State Street’s consolidated asset/liability
  management activities, and the related market risk is included in the following
  non-trading interest rate sensitivity disclosure.

Non-Trading  Activities:  Interest  Rate
   Sensitivity

The objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to provide sustainable net interest revenue under various economic environments and to protect asset values from adverse effects of changes in interest rates.
State Street manages the structure of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities by adjusting the mix, yields and maturity or repricing characteristics based on market conditions. Since interest-bearing sources of funds are
predominantly short term, State Street maintains a generally short-term structure for its interest-earning assets, including money market assets, investments and loans. Interest rate swaps are used minimally as part of overall asset and liability
management to augment State Street’s management of interest rate exposure. State Street uses three tools for measuring interest rate risk: simulation, duration and gap analysis.

Key assumptions in the simulation, duration and gap models include the timing of cash flows, maturity and repricing of financial instruments, changes in market conditions, capital planning, and deposit sensitivity.
These assumptions are inherently uncertain and as a result, the models cannot precisely calculate net interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue and economic value. Actual results may differ
from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among other factors.

State Street Corporation

Simulation models facilitate the evaluation
  of the potential range of net interest revenue under a “most likely”
  scenario, alternative interest rate scenarios and rate shock tests. Based upon
  results of the simulation model as of December 31, 2002, there would be a decrease
  in net interest revenue of $102 million over the following 12 months for an
  immediate 100-basis-point increase in all global interest rates. If interest
  rates immediately decreased by 100 basis points, the model shows an increase
  in net interest revenue of less than $72 million.

Duration measures the change in the economic
  value of assets and liabilities for given changes in interest rates. Based upon
  the results of the duration model as of December 31, 2002, there would be a
  decrease in the economic value of assets, net of liabilities, of $297 million,
  or .37% of assets, as a result of an immediate increase in all global interest
  rates of 100 basis points. In the event of an immediate decrease of 100 basis
  points to interest rates, the model shows an increase of $321 million, or .40%
  of assets, to the economic value of assets, net of liabilities.

The third measure of interest rate risk, gap analysis, is the difference in asset and liability repricing on a cumulative basis within a specified time period. As of year-end 2002, interest-bearing liabilities reprice
faster than interest-earning assets over the next 12 months, as has been typical for State Street. If all other variables remained constant, in the short term, falling interest rates would lead to net interest revenue that is higher than it would
otherwise have been. Rising rates would lead to lower net interest revenue. Other important determinants of net interest revenue are balance sheet size and mix, interest rate spreads, the slope of the yield curve, and rate levels.

Off-Balance  Sheet  Activities

Assets under custody and assets under management are held in a fiduciary or custodial capacity for State Street’s clients and are not recorded on the Corporation’s balance sheet in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Similarly, collateral funds resulting from State Street’s securities lending services are held by State Street as agent; therefore, under accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States, these assets are not assets of the Corporation.

State Street sells and distributes securities
  for two types of variable interest entities (“VIEs”), formerly reported as special
  purpose entities, that are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements
  of the Corporation.

One type, which State Street has administered
  since 1992, issues asset-backed commercial paper (“ABCP”) that is rated P-1 by
  Moody’s Investors Service and/or A-1 or better by Standard & Poor’s.
  State Street and unrelated dealers sell and distribute the commercial paper
  issued by the VIEs. The commercial paper represents debt issued by the VIEs.
  State Street holds no equity ownership interest in these VIEs, which are structured
  as bankruptcy-remote corporations. The assets of these VIEs include investment securities
  and purchased receivables that back the commercial paper. Such assets are transferred to the
  VIEs by unrelated third parties. State Street
  provides liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the forms of liquidity
  asset purchase agreements, lines of credit, and standby letters of credit to
  the VIEs. At December 31, 2002, State Street’s commitments under liquidity
  asset purchase agreements and lines of credit to these VIEs were $10.0 billion,
  and standby letters of credit were $590 million, none of which were utilized.
  Amounts committed, but unused, under the liquidity asset purchase agreements,
  lines of credit, and standby letters of credit that State Street provides to
  these VIEs are included in the disclosures in Note 21 in the Notes to the Consolidated
  Financial Statements. Asset performance deterioration may cause the asset risk
  to shift from the ABCP investors to State Street as the liquidity provider for
  the asset as the VIE may need to repay maturing commercial paper by drawing
  the liquidity facilities. Fee revenue for administration, liquidity facilities
  and credit enhancements was $41 million in 2002. At December 31, 2002, these
  ABCP programs had total commercial paper outstanding of $10.3 billion in a combined
  U.S, European and Australian ABCP market estimated at $793 billion. See Note 1 in the
  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recent accounting
  pronouncements that could affect the off-balance sheet status of these VIE's.

42 |

State
  Street Corporation

For a second type of VIE, structured as a qualified special purpose entity in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, State Street distributes and sells equity interests in
tax-exempt investment-grade assets that are primarily sold to mutual fund clients. For these VIEs, State Street transfers the assets from its investment portfolio at fair market value. Such transfers are treated as sales. The VIEs finance the
acquisition of these assets from State Street by selling equity interests to third-party investors. State Street owns a minority residual interest in these VIEs of less than 3%, or $38 million. As of December 31, 2002, these trusts have a weighted average life of approximately 3.5 years. In a separate agreement, State Street provides
liquidity asset purchase agreements to these entities. These liquidity asset purchase agreements obligate State Street to buy the equity interests in the underlying portfolio at par value, which approximates market value, in the event that the
re-marketing agent is unable to place the equity interests of the VIE with investors. The liquidity asset purchase agreements are subject to early termination by State Street in the event of payment default, bankruptcy of issuer or credit
enhancement provider, taxability, or downgrade of an asset below investment grade. Fee revenue for administrative services, liquidity asset purchase agreements and residual interest earnings totaled $42 million in 2002, before tax benefit. In
connection with State Street’s balance sheet management activities, the Corporation incurred $42 million of interest expense on interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges against the minority residual interest of the VIEs. As
of December 31, 2002, these VIEs had total assets of $1.2 billion in a tax-exempt market estimated at $70 billion. State Street’s liquidity asset purchase agreements to these VIEs were $1.3 billion at December 31, 2002, none of which were
utilized, and are included in the disclosures in Note 21 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The risks associated with providing administration, liquidity, and/or credit enhancements to both types of VIEs are reviewed in State Street’s corporate risk management process in a manner that is consistent with
applicable policies and guidelines. State Street believes that it has sufficient liquidity and has provided adequate operating and credit reserves to cover any risks associated with these activities.

New  Accounting  Developments

Information related to new accounting pronouncements appears in Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods, resulting in changes
to reported results.

State Street’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The majority of these accounting policies do not require management to make difficult,
subjective or complex judgments or estimates or the variability of the estimates is not material. However, the following policies could be deemed critical. State Street’s management has discussed these critical accounting estimates with the
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Lease  Financing

State Street has a leveraged lease financing portfolio, including lease-in-lease-out structures, consisting of U.S. and cross-border financings for transportation equipment, including trains, aircraft and ships. State
Street has provided lease financing services since 1981, and at December 31, 2002, the portfolio aggregated $2.1 billion, and is reflected in Note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This portfolio is recorded net of
non-recourse debt, and revenue is recognized as interest revenue. Interest revenue from the lease portfolio was $104 million in 2002. Considering the long-term, cross-border nature of many of these leases and the number of assumptions, including
residual values, cash flows and income tax regulations and rates, there is risk associated with this revenue should any of these assumptions change in future periods.

State Street Corporation

Contingencies  and  Other  Reserves

State Street has established reserves for risk of losses, including loan losses and tax contingencies. The allowance for loan losses represents State Street’s estimate of the probable losses that have occurred as
of the date of the financial statements, as further described in Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the normal course of business, State Street is subject to challenges from U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges may result in adjustments of the timing or amount of
taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. Management believes State Street has appropriately accrued for tax exposures including lease-in-lease-out structures and real estate investment trust (REIT) dividends
received deductions. If State Street prevails in a matter for which an accrual has been established or is required to pay an amount exceeding its reserves, the financial impact will be reflected in the period in which the matter is resolved.

In addition, State Street must manage and control certain inherent risks in the normal course of its business. These include counterparty risk, credit risk, fiduciary risk, operations and settlement risk, and market
risk. See the Risk Management section of this Financial Review and Note 20 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Revenue  Recognition

Revenue from investment servicing, management, foreign exchange trading, brokerage and processing are recognized when earned based on contractual terms and are accrued based on estimates, or are recognized as
transactions occur or services are provided. Revenue on interest-earning assets is recognized based on the effective yield of the financial instrument.

Revenue recognition for servicing and management fees involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including components that are calculated based on estimated asset valuations and transaction volumes. While these
estimates and assumptions could be considered complex, State Street has long-standing controls and processes in place to ensure the accuracy of revenue accruals. Historically, revenue recognized using these processes has fairly matched revenue
billed and collected. Furthermore, State Street’s fee revenue recognition is promptly validated by timely invoicing and cash collection from clients and counterparties. During 2002, State Street recognized servicing and management fee revenue
totaling $2.2 billion. Of this amount, $402 million was in the billing and/or collection process at December 31, 2002.

Pension  Accounting

State Street and certain of its subsidiaries
  participate in a non-contributory defined benefit plan. In addition to the primary
  plan, State Street has non-qualified supplemental plans that provide certain
  officers with defined pension benefits in excess of allowable qualified plan
  limits. Non-U.S. employees participate in local plans.

The reported liability associated with these plans is
  dependent on many factors such as the discount rate, expected return on plan
  assets and a series of actuarial assumptions. Management determines these estimates
  based upon currently available market and industry data, historical performance
  of the plan and its assets, and consultation with the Corporation’s actuaries.
  Management believes the estimates and assumptions used to determine the reported benefit
  obligation and pension expense are reasonable and are reflective of the terms
  of the plans in the current economic environment based upon information from
  the best available resources.

The projected benefit obligation for the primary
  and non-U.S. defined benefit plans was $487 million, and the plan assets were $379 million as of December
  31, 2002. Pension expense in future years is affected by the variance of the
  assumed rate of return from the actual return on plan assets. This variance
  is amortized over future years. A 1% change in the actual return on plan assets
  or the discount rate would affect State Street's earnings by less than $.01 per share.

Letter to Our Stockholders

The year 2002 was an unusually
  challenging time for investors — with difficult conditions in nearly every
  investment category around the world. Global political tensions weakened economies
  and financial markets, and a regular stream of news about corporate governance
  scandals seriously undermined investor confidence. Equity values, as measured
  by the S&P 500, fell to their lowest level in at least five years. Cross-border
  investing slowed down significantly, despite a brief pick-up in the second quarter.
  And interest rates were significantly lower than in the previous year.

2002 Financial Results

Against these strong headwinds,
  I’m happy to say that State Street was able to achieve positive financial
  results — exceeding our primary goal of sustainable real growth in earnings
  per share.

Operating earnings per
  share, driven by new business from existing and new clients, increased 6% in
  2002. And we were successful in managing our operating costs, decreasing expenses
  by 1%.

We continue to differentiate
  ourselves by stating a goal for revenue growth. Our goal is to achieve 12.5%
  real compound annual growth from 2000 through 2010, although we do not expect
  to achieve that rate every year in the ten-year period.

Our supporting goal for
  return on stockholders’ equity is to achieve 18% annually. In 2002, due
  to slower revenue growth, we delivered operating ROE of 17.1%.

Cash dividends
  declared in 2002 increased 19% from 2001.

2002 Business Highlights

State Street’s strong
  financial results for the year are the outcome of two achievements: we increased
  our revenue by winning new business — with especially strong
  growth outside the United States — and we continued to keep tight control
  of our expenses.

On the expense side, we
  were aggressive in eliminating spending for things that didn’t add enough
  value to our business proposition. We took a strategic approach to leveraging
  efficiencies in corporate purchasing and our day-to-day operations. We reduced
  staff in administrative and professional services areas. Overall, we reduced
  expenses 1% from 2001, after adjusting for goodwill.

In addition to keeping
  our focus with regard to profitability — while providing consistently excellent
  service to our clients — we took a number of steps aimed at positioning
  State Street for future growth.

The most noteworthy of
  these steps was our decision to purchase most of Deutsche Bank AG’s global
  securities services business. This business, which will be substantially integrated
  by 2004, brings enormous benefits to State Street. It cements our standing as
  the global leader in investment servicing — positioning us at the center
  of Europe’s high-growth investment services
  market and giving us new clients, employees and offices in the Asia-Pacific
  region. It brings us expanded Depotbank capabilities in Europe and the WM Company’s
  performance measurement tools. And — not inconsequentially in this environment
  — it provides us with substantial economies of scale and scope.

Although our agreement
  with Deutsche Bank was the biggest news event for us in 2002, it was only one
  of many investments we made in State Street’s future. Another important
  investment was the acquisition of International Fund Services (IFS), a leading
  global provider of services for alternative investment portfolios such as hedge
  funds. This acquisition broadened State Street’s capabilities in serving
  the expanding requirements of sophisticated global investors.

We also began to develop
  services specifically geared to the needs of asset managers who serve private
  clients and managed accounts. These investment management firms are operating
  in a highly competitive marketplace — and therefore are looking for ways
  to differentiate themselves with new products and services. By outsourcing

administrative
  functions to State Street, these asset managers are freed up to focus on their
  core competencies, confident that the services State Street provides to them
  will be both innovative and reliable.

Our ongoing process of
  fine-tuning our focus also involves making selective changes to our business
  mix. We completed the sale of our corporate trust business in 2002.

Outlook for 2003

I think it’s safe
  to predict that 2003 will be another tough year for our clients and for State
  Street.  We are well positioned not only to weather this current storm but also to emerge from it even stronger.
  That’s because we have built our business around the idea of “focus”.
  We focus on serving the needs of a single group of clients: sophisticated global
  investors. Within this market segment, we focus on ensuring that we’re
  the best provider and that we’re flexible enough to take maximum advantage
  of developments that present our clients — and State Street — with
  opportunities for growth.

One long-term trend that
  continues to offer enormous potential for us is a mounting sense of urgency
  about retirement security, driven by increasing life expectancy in most parts
  of the world. As governments and employers develop new ways to help workers
  invest for their retirements, they are creating new, large pools of assets that
  must be managed and serviced. State Street is a world leader in managing and
  servicing retirement funds.

We are also in an excellent position to benefit
  from changing patterns in the way people save and invest. In this difficult
  environment, investors have become more risk averse — a trend that plays
  to the strengths of our investment management arm, State Street Global Advisors.
  We offer a broad range of risk-controlled investment management options, including
  enhanced indexing, which offers higher returns than passive investment schemes
  with only slightly more risk.

A third trend that benefits
  State Street is convergence in the financial services industry. The large, global
  companies that are emerging from mergers and acquisitions are looking for a
  trusted partner who can offer what they need, in any part of the world. Their
  needs coincide perfectly with our strengths: our rich experience in developing
  and implementing comprehensive solutions for our clients across the globe . . .
  and our ability, using technology, to provide services that are truly scalable.

I believe that we will
  continue to win a disproportionate share of new business in 2003 — primarily
  because we’re very clear about our corporate purpose: to make our clients
  successful. If our clients succeed, we will succeed too. Nothing is more important
  to us than continuing to earn the trust of our clients each and every day.

Strategic Priorities

Our attention is firmly
  fixed on a goal we established a long time ago: sustainable growth. “Sustainability”
  is a key idea here — and, for a company that is more than 210 years old,
  it has real meaning. We understand that true success comes not from a single
  stroke of brilliance but from the accumulated results of many sound, strategic
  decisions that are executed extremely well by talented professionals. Within
  this philosophical framework, we have five strategic priorities.

One of these priorities
  is to continue to provide our clients with the best investment solutions, and
  the best service, it is possible to give. We’re limited in this endeavor
  only by the current boundaries of technology — and we’re extending
  those limits every day.

A second priority is to continue to grow as a global
  company. The acquisition of Deutsche Bank’s global securities services
  business dramatically expands our global presence. But this acquisition only
  accelerates growth that has been under way for more than a decade. Global growth
  opportunities for us include the development of new products, as well as physical
  expansion into new countries and markets. In the United Kingdom and Europe,
  we will focus on continuing to broaden the range of integrated solutions we
  offer our clients. In Asia, we will

46 |

State
  Street Corporation

continue to specialize in serving the needs of governments and government agencies — something State Street does better than anyone else.

A third priority is to
  continue to improve our profit margins — an especially important objective
  in this challenging environment. We’re concentrating on both sides of the
  equation: increasing our revenue and controlling our expenses. Our growing client
  base gives us advantages in this area, both in terms of opportunities to sell
  more services and in opportunities to leverage economies of scale.

A fourth priority is to
  foster continued innovation in serving the emerging needs of global investors
  by adapting traditional business models to changing conditions. While a great
  deal of our growth will continue to come from providing technology, transaction
  and information services for large investors, we see a new source of growth
  in providing a broader suite of services to the front office. We plan to launch
  new equity execution capabilities early in 2003. We will also continue to expand
  our investment management product line to include new strategies in the quantitative
  active category.

A final priority is to
  offer our employees ample opportunities for personal and professional growth.
  As our employees learn new skills, gain new experiences and perspectives and
  become more satisfied in their work, they’ll be motivated to achieve great
  things for State Street — which, in turn, will create even better opportunities
  for them. This virtuous cycle has always been part of the State Street culture,
  and we have proven time and again that it works.

Executing on our strategic
  priorities will be a complex and challenging task. To maintain and deepen our
  leadership position, we must be successful in both finding the best opportunities
  to grow and in continuously shifting our resources to align them with these
  opportunities. We are more confident than ever that our core strategy —
  focusing on being the partner sophisticated global investors trust most to help
  them succeed — is a sound approach to long-term growth.

I want to thank my State
  Street colleagues around the world for your hard work and outstanding results
  in 2002. I also want to thank our stockholders for your continued support.

Continuing to Grow

In a challenging
  market environment, what is State Street’s strategy for continued growth?

We have a very clear strategy
  for achieving long-term growth. It’s built around the concept of focus.
  We’re focused exclusively on sophisticated global investors. We believe
  this client segment offers superior opportunities for growth. It’s also
  one we are uniquely equipped to serve. We’re focused on providing everything
  sophisticated global investors need to invest successfully. Our aim is to offer
  integrated solutions that cover the entire investment cycle, from research and
  analytics to multi-asset class trade execution to fund accounting and administration.
  Our development efforts target products that offer our clients the strongest
  growth potential in today’s market environment. We’re also focused
  on strengthening our presence in high-growth geographic regions, such as Europe.

Why focus exclusively
  on servicing sophisticated global investors?

This client segment is
  extraordinarily attractive in terms of its size and rapid growth. Sophisticated
  global investors have a broad array of complex and specialized servicing requirements.
  Our clients’ needs include investment servicing, such as custody, fund
  accounting, transfer agency services and settlement … investment management
  strategies and advisory services, including portfolio construction, research,
  and analytics … and a range of trading services, from multi-asset class
  trade execution to securities lending. A key differentiator for us is our ability
  to integrate or customize solutions to fit each client’s specific requirements.

An important source of
  growth for State Street is an increasing preference on the part of sophisticated
  global investors to outsource their servicing requirements to an outside expert,
  rather than trying to handle it themselves. Global capital markets are becoming
  more complex with changes in investment regulations, advances in technology,
  and the development of global standards. This transition is creating a shift
  away from relatively fragmented local and regional financial markets toward
  a more consolidated, globally integrated market. The servicing implications
  of this change are tremendous. Never have sophisticated investors had more of
  a need for a trusted partner with global capabilities.

From State Street’s
  perspective, how is the financial services marketplace changing?

We see three broad trends
  that will have a significant effect on our business. The first is a growing
  sense of urgency about retirement security. Longer life expectancies and the
  aging of the post-World War II generation will put tremendous pressure on retirement
  systems worldwide. Many developed nations are considering tax-advantaged ways
  to strengthen their existing pension systems and encourage retirement savings.
  These reforms will create growing pools of assets that need to be managed and
  serviced.

The second trend involves changes in savings and investment preferences.
  The prolonged decline in equity markets has forced investment managers to look
  at new ways to increase their revenues while controlling risk. This trend has
  resulted in many product innovations — including exchange
  traded funds and wrap accounts — that respond to investors’ increased
  sensitivity to costs. Demand has also increased for risk-controlled strategies,
  including enhanced indexing, and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds.
  Our expertise in risk-controlled strategies and servicing for alternative investment
  products offers us an outstanding opportunity to support our clients as they
  expand their offerings in these areas.

The third trend is convergence
  in financial services. In recent years, many companies have merged with or acquired
  other companies whose skills and reach complement their own. These consolidations
  usually result in investment servicing operations in multiple countries, creating
  a level of complexity that is very difficult to administer. Many choose to outsource
  all or part of their servicing to a trusted provider like State Street. Our
  full range of integrated solutions and our extensive global experience give
  us an advantage in competing for their business.

State
  Street Corporation

Where are the best opportunities
  for State Street’s future growth?

We grow our business in
  two ways: by winning new clients and by selling more services to our existing
  clients. In 2002, we won a great deal of new business, including relationships
  with Nuveen Investments, a U.S.-based asset manager, and UNICO Asset Management
  SA, a Luxembourg-based asset management company. We expect this momentum with
  regard to new business to continue. However, we believe enriching our relationships
  with existing clients by expanding the range of products and services we offer
  them is an even greater opportunity. Even when the market declines, we can grow
  by constantly innovating — looking for new ways to bring our clients the
  products and services they need.

Several areas hold particular
  promise. Trading services, particularly equity execution, offer strong growth
  potential. State Street’s position as the leader in global investor servicing
  gives us unparalleled scale and volume, as well as rich resources in research
  and analytics. We deliver a full range of pre-trade services, as well as multi-asset
  class trade executions and post-trade functions. These services can be integrated
  for our clients on our state-of-the-art trading platform, Global Link. Our capabilities
  allow us to assist global asset managers in all phases of the investment decision-making
  process.

Forming strategic outsourcing
  partnerships with asset managers is another area that continues to offer opportunities
  for growth. We have the depth and breadth to provide asset managers with virtually
  any service they need. And we can customize our offerings to focus on servicing
  a single area in-depth … a bundled series of functions … or the whole
  gamut of services that are necessary to run the investment operations side of
  our clients’ business. Our wide-reaching experience means we can run operations
  functions more efficiently and, most often, more cost-effectively than the asset
  managers could themselves.

In 2002, J. & W. Seligman
  & Co., a New-York-based investment manager, selected us as their outsourcing
  operations partner. We had formerly provided Seligman with fund accounting,
  fund administration, and custody services. Now we also handle trade support
  and settlement, portfolio record keeping, custodian communications for settlements,
  and systems network and applications support. Through this type of arrangement,
  partners like Seligman gain access
  to State Street’s enterprise technologies, fully integrated solutions,
  and servicing efficiencies. In addition, they benefit from greater cost control
  and the ability to focus on their core competency of money management.

We are also strategically
  expanding the scope of our integrated suite of services by focusing on growing
  markets. In 2002, we expanded our range of services for investment managers
  who serve the high-net-worth market. This market totals about $26 billion in
  assets, with strong growth projected for the coming years. State Street’s
  full range of services, from managed account servicing to account aggregation,
  allows wealth managers to expand their service offerings to high-net-worth clients,
  while also freeing them to focus on relationship development and money management.
  With our recent acquisition of International Fund Services, we also introduced
  a full line of services for alternative investments such as hedge funds. Hedge
  funds currently have about $600 billion in assets under management with double-digit
  growth projected for the coming years. In these challenging times, we believe
  our risk-controlled investment strategies, particularly enhanced indexing, also
  offer outstanding opportunities for growth.

How will the acquisition
  of Deutsche bank’s global securities services fit in with State Street’s
  strategy?

The acquisition of a substantial
  part of Deutche Bank’s Global Securities Services business supports our
  strategy to expand State Street’s scope and scale as the premier partner
  serving the needs of sophisticated global investors, particularly in the growing
  European market. No other company will be able to match the range and quality
  of services we can offer globally. In Europe, where collective investments and
  pensions are growing at faster rates than in the United States, State Street
  is now a big, local player, with more than double the amount of assets we service.
  We believe the acquisition also offers a unique opportunity to generate long-term
  value for our clients, stockholders, and employees.

State Street Corporation

State Street has acquired
  most of Deutsche Bank’s global securities services business, including
  the bank’s global custody, fund administration services, Depotbank services,
  securities lending, performance measurement and benefit payment businesses worldwide,
  as well as domestic custody and securities clearing in the United States and
  the United Kingdom. Our ten-year contract to provide additional services to
  Deutsche Asset Management, the largest asset manager in continental Europe,
  also provides a significant revenue stream for State Street. These are all businesses
  we know well, which gives us confidence that the integration will proceed smoothly,
  yielding potentially significant benefits in terms of cost savings, economies
  of scale, expanded product capabilities, and cross selling opportunities.

What differentiates
  State Street from its competitors?

State Street has a competitive
  advantage in servicing the specialized needs of large, sophisticated global
  investors. None of our competitors has the ability to integrate products and
  services the way we do or the experience in doing it globally. No one else can
  match our scope and scale. Our size and industry commitment mean we can maintain
  the necessary investment in people, technology, and operations to grow and compete.

Our goal, however, is not
  to be the biggest financial services provider, but the best. We believe our
  success depends largely on our deep commitment and long-standing relationships
  with our clients. Our client focus helps us operate as a trusted partner, seamlessly
  integrating people and systems while also developing new products and strategies
  to help our clients build their businesses. Our modular offerings allow us to
  tailor outsourcing solutions to each client’s unique requirements. Our
  clients tell us that because we focus exclusively on serving their specialized
  needs we understand their business requirements and challenges better than any
  of our competitors. We believe State Street is uniquely positioned with the
  breadth of services, global experience, technology, and vision to help our clients
  succeed in all market conditions.

General Electric

In 1988, GE began to
  manage money for other companies, in addition to managing the assets of its
  own pension plan. GE wanted assistance with its back-office investment management
  operations. State Street responded with a technology integration plan and a
  complete analysis of GE’s investment support operation. Today, State Street
  values over 400 portfolios for GE each day, provides daily performance measurement
  and analysis, reconciles with more than 20 custodians and provides GE with a
  single master book of records.

AP2 — Sweden’s
  Second National Pension Fund

The Second Swedish National
  Pension Fund (AP2) is one of four buffer funds created as part of the May 2000
  reorganization of Sweden’s national pension system.

Its aim is to ensure
  that pension assets are invested to generate a maximum long-term return at a
  minimum risk.

In June of 2002 — building on its existing relationship with State Street Global Advisors —
  AP2 appointed State Street to provide custody and fund accounting, in addition
  to investment management services.

State Street was chosen because of our global
  scale and expertise, and our ability to provide AP2 with a bundled suite of
  customized investment services. Because State Street is the world’s leading
  provider of fund accounting services, we have the experience and technology
  to service the sophisticated needs of multi-national pension funds.

State Street Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of condition of State Street Corporation as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of State Street Corporation at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

State Street Corporation (“State Street” or the “Corporation”) is a financial holding company that provides custody, accounting, daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody;
investment management; trusteeship and recordkeeping; foreign exchange; securities lending; cash management; trading; and information services to clients worldwide. State Street reports two lines of business. Investment Servicing includes custody,
accounting, daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; trustee and recordkeeping; foreign exchange and trading services; securities lending; deposit and short-term investment facilities; lease financing; investment manager
operations outsourcing; and performance, risk and compliance analytics to support institutional investors. Investment Management offers a broad array of services for managing financial assets, including investment management and investment research
for both institutions and individual investors worldwide. These services include active and passive U.S. and non-U.S. equity and fixed income strategies, and other related services, such as securities lending.

The accounting and reporting policies of State Street and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Significant policies are summarized below.

B a s i s  o f  P r e s e n t
  a t i o n

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of State Street and its subsidiaries, including its principal subsidiary, State Street Bank and Trust Company (“State Street Bank”).

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. The results of operations of businesses purchased are included from the date of acquisition. Investments in affiliates in
which the Corporation has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method.

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current method of presentation.

For the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, State Street has defined cash equivalents as those amounts included in the Consolidated Statement of Condition caption, “Cash and due from banks.” Interest paid
in 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $1.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. Taxes paid in 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $134 million, $84 million and $132 million, respectively.

R e v e n u e  R e c o g n i t i o
  n

Revenue from investment servicing, management, foreign exchange trading, brokerage and processing are recognized when earned based on contractual terms and are accrued based on estimates, or are recognized as
transactions occur or services are provided. Revenue on interest-earning assets is recognized based on the effective yield of the financial instrument.

R e s a l e  a n d  R e p u r
  c h a s e  A g r e e m e n t s ;  S e c u r i t i e s  B o r
  r o w e d

State Street purchases U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities (“U.S. government securities”) under agreements to resell the securities. These purchases are recorded as securities purchased under resale
agreements, an asset in the Consolidated Statement of Condition. These purchases have been reduced by offsetting balances with the same counterparty where a master netting agreement exists. State Street can use these securities as collateral for
repurchase agreements. State Street’s policy is to take possession or control of the security underlying the resale agreement, allowing borrowers the right of collateral substitution and/or

short-notice termination. The securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary from the borrower. State Street enters into sales of U.S. government securities under repurchase
agreements, which are treated as financings, and the obligations to repurchase such securities sold are reflected as a liability in the Consolidated Statement of Condition. The dollar amount of U.S. government securities underlying the repurchase
agreements remains in investment securities.

Securities borrowed are recorded at the amount of cash collateral deposited with the lender. State Street monitors its market exposure daily with respect to securities borrowed transactions. As necessary, State Street
requests that excess securities be returned or that additional securities be provided as needed.

S e c u r i t i e s

Debt securities are held in both the investment and trading account portfolios. Debt and marketable equity securities that are classified as available for sale are reported at fair value, and the after-tax net
unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity. Securities classified as held to maturity are stated at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts. Gains or losses on sales of available-for-sale securities are computed based on identified costs. Trading account assets are held in anticipation of short-term market movements and for resale to clients. Trading account assets are carried
at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in processing fees and other revenue.

L o a n s  a n d  L e a s e  F
  i n a n c i n g

Loans are placed on a non-accrual basis when they become 60 days past due as to either principal or interest, or when, in the opinion of management, full collection of principal or interest is unlikely. When the loan
is placed on non-accrual, the accrual of interest is discontinued and previously recorded but unpaid interest is reversed and charged against net interest revenue.

Leveraged leases are carried net of non-recourse debt. Revenue on leveraged leases is recognized on a basis calculated to achieve a constant rate of return on the outstanding investment in the leases, net of related
deferred tax liabilities, in the years in which the net investment is positive. Gains and losses on residual values of leased equipment sold are included in processing fees and other revenue.

A l l o w a n c e  f o r  L o
  a n  L o s s e s

The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management. Factors considered in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance include previous loss experience, current economic conditions
and adverse situations that may affect the borrowers’ ability to repay, timing of future payments, estimated value of the underlying collateral and the performance of individual credits in relation to contract terms, and other relevant factors.
The provision for loan losses charged to earnings is based upon management’s judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level adequate to absorb probable losses.

P r e m i s e s  a n d  E q u
  i p m e n t

Buildings, leasehold improvements, computers, software and other equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization charged to operating expenses are computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset or the remaining term of the lease.

State Street’s policy is to capitalize costs relating to internal-use software development projects that provide significant functionality enhancements. State Street considers projects for capitalization that are
expected to yield long-term operational benefits, such as applications that result in operational efficiencies and/or incremental revenue streams. Software customization costs relating to specific client enhancements are expensed as incurred.

The assets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations are translated at month-end exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates. Gains or losses from the translation of the net
assets of non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches, net of related taxes, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

State Street adopted Statement of Financial
  Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
  Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended, on January 1, 2001. In
  accordance with SFAS No. 133, State Street records derivative instruments at
  fair value in the Consolidated Statement of Condition. The change in fair value
  of the Corporation’s derivative instruments is recorded currently in earnings,
  except for certain interest rate swap agreements that are accounted for as cash
  flow or fair value hedges. The Corporation has determined that the interest
  rate swaps accounted for as cash flow constitute a fully effective hedge, and
  as such, changes in fair value of these agreements, net of tax, are reported
  in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For interest rate swaps designated
  as fair value hedges, the change in fair value of the derivative instrument,
  as well as the hedged item, are reported in earnings in the current period in
  processing fees and other revenue.

Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 133, State Street
  used three methods to account for derivative financial instruments: the accrual
  method, deferral method and fair value method.

Interest rate swaps that were entered into
  as part of interest rate management were accounted for using the accrual method.
  Interest receivable or payable payments under the terms of the interest rate
  swap were accrued over the period to which the payment related. The interest
  payments accrued and any fees paid at inception were recorded as an adjustment
  to the interest revenue or interest expense of the underlying asset or liability.

Other interest rate contracts that were used
  for balance sheet management were accounted for under the deferral method. The
  basis of the contract was capitalized and any gain or loss was deferred and
  amortized over the life of the hedged asset or liability as an adjustment to
  the interest revenue or interest expense.

The gross amount of unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange and interest rate contracts were reported separately at fair value on the balance sheet as other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in the
Consolidated Statement of Condition, except where such gains and losses arose from contracts covered by qualifying master netting agreements. Changes in fair value of these contracts were recorded in earnings.

I n c o m e  T a x e s

The Corporation uses an asset and liability approach to account for income taxes. The objective is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and to recognize deferred tax assets and
liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the amounts reported in the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The measurement of tax assets and liabilities is based on enacted tax laws and applicable tax
rates.

E a r n i n g s  P e r  S h a
  r e

Basic earnings per share excludes all dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share
includes all dilution from convertible debt, stock options and stock awards. Diluted earnings per share includes the assumption that all convertible debt has been converted as of the beginning of each period.

S t o c k  S p l i t

Earnings per share, dividends per share and average shares outstanding have been restated for periods prior to the stock split distributed on May 30, 2001, to stockholders of record on April 30, 2001. The par value of
additional shares was capitalized by a transfer from retained earnings to common stock.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” Disclosures related to
this interpretation are effective for 2002 annual reports, and the accounting requirements are effective January 1, 2003, and require all guarantees and indemnifications within its scope to be recorded at fair value as liabilities, and the maximum
possible loss to the Corporation under these guarantees and indemnifications to be disclosed. State Street has indemnifications made to securities lending clients, certain investment guarantee products, credit enhancements and liquidity facilities,
and parent company guarantees of subsidiary’s obligations that fall within the scope of this Interpretation. Each of these guarantees, except the parent company guarantees, are collateralized to some extent, which reduces loss exposure to the
Corporation. The liabilities associated with these products upon adoption are not expected to be material to the Corporation.

On December 31, 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure.” SFAS No. 148 requires certain disclosures related to stock-based compensation
plans of the Corporation. At December 31, 2002, State Street had three stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described in Note 10. The Corporation has applied the recognition and measurement provisions of APB 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for those plans. No stock-based employee compensation expense is reflected in net income in 2002, 2001 or 2000, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying
common stock on the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2003, the Corporation adopted, prospectively, the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to all new awards granted to employees
after January 1, 2003. Awards under the Corporation’s plans vest over periods ranging from two to five years. Therefore, the expense related to stock-based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for 2003 will be less
than that which would have been recognized if the fair value method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of SFAS 123. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the fair value
method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period.

On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.” State Street sells and distributes securities for one type of variable interest entity
(“VIE”) that is currently not included in the consolidated financial statements of State Street. Assuming no changes to the current structure of these VIEs, State Street will be required to consolidate them in its Consolidated Statement of
Condition under this new accounting guidance. These VIEs, which State Street administers, issue asset-backed commercial paper (“ABCP”) that is rated P-1 by Moody’s Investors Service and/or A-1 or better by Standard & Poor’s. State Street
provided these VIEs with administrative support, as well as with liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the

State Street Corporation

| 59

forms of liquidity asset purchase agreements
  and lines of credit totaling $10.0 billion and standby letters of credit totaling
  $590 million at December 31, 2002. This ABCP program had
  total commercial paper outstanding of $10.3 billion at December 31, 2002. An asset-specific credit
  enhancement, in the form of over-collateralization or otherwise, from non-State
  Street transferors, is subordinate to the Corporation’s liquidity and credit
  enhancement exposure. Potential losses from these VIEs are not expected to materially
  affect the results of operations of the Corporation; however, consolidation
  of these VIEs would cause the Corporation and State Street Bank to reduce the
  size of their balance sheets to maintain their regulatory Tier 1 leverage ratio
  requirements.

Note 2

Divestiture, Acquisitions and Joint Venture

On December 31, 2002, State Street completed the sale of its corporate trust business to U.S. Bank, N.A., the lead bank of U.S. Bancorp. The corporate trust business consisted of $689 billion in bonds under
trusteeship, $187 billion in assets under custody and $2.3 billion in client deposits. The bonds under trusteeship transferred to U.S. Bancorp on December 31, 2002. The assets under custody and deposits are expected to transfer in early 2003.

The premium received on the sale was $725 million, $75 million of which was placed in escrow pending the successful transition of the business. Escrow payments, if made, will be paid on the 12-month and 18-month
anniversaries of the closing. Exit costs associated with the sale totaled approximately $118 million and consisted of the write-off of goodwill and intangibles of $87 million, provisions for excess space of $13 million, transaction costs of $11
million and employee retention and other costs of $7 million. Other associated costs of the transaction totaled approximately $37 million, and included incentive compensation for general corporate use of $25 million, the write-off of fixed assets,
termination of contracts and other costs. The after-tax gain, net of exit and other associated costs, totaled approximately $296 million, or $0.90 in diluted earnings per share, and was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002.

In July 2002, State Street completed the cash purchase of International Fund Services (“IFS”), a leading provider of fund accounting and administration as well as securities trade support and operational
services for hedge funds, for $80 million. As one of the largest providers of hedge funds services, IFS services over 100 large asset management firms and private equity fund managers, representing more than 350 funds globally. IFS is headquartered
in New York City, and has operations centers in New York City and Dublin, Ireland with approximately 500 employees. In connection with this transaction, an additional payment may be paid based upon certain future performance measures.

In October 2001, State Street completed the cash purchase of the passive equity business of Gartmore Investment Management plc (“Gartmore”) in the United Kingdom. Gartmore’s passive equity business had
$25 billion of assets under management as of the date of purchase. Under the terms of the agreement, SSgA hired the Gartmore team that manages, services and administers the passive equity business.

In June 2001, State Street purchased DST Portfolio
  Systems, Inc. (“DPS”) for 1,483,000 shares of State Street common
  stock and cash in a transaction accounted for as a purchase. Included in the
  purchase was the Portfolio Accounting System of DPS, an integrated system that
  automates mutual fund accounting and investment management recordkeeping processes,
  such as securities pricing and dividend calculations, income and expense accruals,
  securities inventories, accounting for daily shareholder activity and calculation
  of daily net asset values.

In February 2001, State Street purchased Bel
  Air Securities LLC and a majority interest in Bel Air Investment Advisors LLC
  (“Bel Air”) for 1,007,000 shares (2,015,000 shares post split) of
  State Street common stock and cash in a transaction accounted for as a purchase.
  Bel Air is a Los Angeles-based investment management firm with assets under
  management of $4 billion at the date of purchase, focused on providing wealth
  management services to ultra-high-net worth individuals.

In April 2000, State Street and Citigroup completed the formation of CitiStreet LLC, a 50/50 joint venture designed to service employee benefit programs, accounted for using the equity method. State Street’s
contribution to the

joint venture consisted of its retirement investment and total benefits outsourcing services, including the transfer of assets with a book value of approximately $50 million.

The pro forma results of operations adjusted to include the acquisitions of IFS, Gartmore, DPS and Bel Air for prior periods are not presented, as the pro forma results would not have been materially different from the
reported results.

At December 31, 2002, State Street had $7.5 billion of time deposits outstanding. Substantially all time deposits are in amounts of $100,000 or more. Deposits with remaining maturities of more than one year at December
31, 2002, were $30 million.

Short-term borrowings include federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and other short-term borrowings, including commercial paper. Collectively, short-term borrowings had weighted-average
interest rates of 1.53% and 3.63% for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

State Street can issue commercial paper with an aggregate limit of $1.0 billion and with original maturities of up to 270 days from the date of issue. State Street Bank can issue bank notes with an aggregate limit of

Note 9

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt consisted of the following at
  December 31:

In August 2002, State Street filed a universal
  shelf registration statement for the offering and sale of up to $1.5 billion
  of unsecured debt securities, capital securities, common stock, depositary shares
  and preferred stock, and warrants to purchase such securities, including any
  shares into which the preferred stock or depositary shares may be convertible,
  or any combination thereof. At December 31, 2002, the entire amount of the shelf
  registration was available for issuance. Subsequent to December 31, 2002, State
  Street issued floating rate, medium-term capital securities, shares of common
  stock and forward purchase contracts for common stock (SPACES

SM

). See Note 25 Subsequent
  Events for further detail.

State Street has established three statutory
  business trusts, which collectively issued $650 million of cumulative semi-annual
  income and quarterly income preferred securities (“capital securities”).
  These securities qualify as Tier 1 capital under federal regulatory guidelines.
  The proceeds of these issuances, along with proceeds of related issuances of
  common securities of the trusts, were invested in junior subordinated debentures
  (“debentures”) of State Street. The debentures are the sole assets
  of the trusts. State Street owns all of the common securities of the trusts.

Payments to be made by the trusts on the capital
  securities are dependent on payments that State Street has committed to make,
  particularly the payments to be made by State Street on the debentures. Compliance
  by State Street would have the effect of providing a full, irrevocable and unconditional
  guarantee of the trusts’ obligations under the capital securities.

Distributions on the capital securities are
  included in interest expense and are payable from interest payments received
  on the debentures and are due semi-annually for Capital Securities A and B and
  quarterly for Capital Trust I, subject to deferral for up to five years under
  certain conditions. The capital securities are subject to mandatory redemption
  in whole at the stated maturity upon repayment of the debentures, with an option
  to redeem the debentures at any time by State Street upon the occurrence of
  certain tax events or changes to tax treatment, investment company regulation
  or capital treatment changes; or at any time after March 15, 2007 for the Capital
  Securities B, after December 30, 2006, for the Capital Securities A and after
  May 15, 2008, for the Capital Trust I securities.

For Capital Securities A and B, redemptions
  are based on declining redemption prices according to the terms of the trust
  agreements. All redemptions are subject to federal regulatory approval.

State
  Street Corporation

In connection with the sale of the floating
  rate capital securities issued by State Street Capital Trust I, State Street
  issued $150 million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest
  debentures to State Street Capital Trust I due in May 2028. Subsequent to that
  issuance, two interest rate swaps were entered into in order to, in effect,
  modify the interest expense from a floating rate to a fixed rate of 6.58%.

The 7.65% subordinated notes due in 2010 qualify
	   as Tier 2 capital under federal regulatory guidelines.

During 2002, State Street
  entered into various interest rate swap contracts to modify the interest expense
  on Capital Securities A and B and the 7.65% subordinated notes from a fixed
  rate to a floating rate. The swaps are accounted for as a fair value hedge,
  and at December 31, 2002, increased the reported value of long-term debt outstanding
  by $29 million, $17 million and $9 million for Capital Securities A and B and
  the 7.65% subordinated notes, respectively.

The 5.95% notes are unsecured obligations of
  State Street due September 15, 2003.

The 9.50% mortgage note was fully collateralized
  by property at December 31, 2002. The scheduled principal payments for the next
  five years are $2 million for each year 2003 through 2006 and $3 million for
  2007.

The 7.75% debentures are convertible to common
  stock at a price of $1.4375 per share, subject to adjustment for certain events.
  The debentures are redeemable at par, at State Street’s option. During
  2002 and 2001, debentures were converted into 243,000 and 286,000 shares of
  common stock, respectively. At December 31, 2002, 159,000 shares of common stock
  had been reserved for issuance upon conversion.

Note 10

Stockholders’ Equity

On December 21, 2000, State Street’s Board
  of Directors approved a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend,
  subject to the approval of an increase in the authorized number of shares by
  stockholders. At the Annual Meeting in April 2001, a proposal to increase the
  authorized number of shares of common stock from 250 million to 500 million
  was approved. The stock dividend was distributed on May 30, 2001, to stockholders
  of record as of April 30, 2001. With the exception of State Street stock held
  by an external trustee, treasury stock did not receive the stock dividend.

State Street’s Board of Directors has
  authorized the purchase of State Street common stock for use in employee benefit
  programs and for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2002, cumulative
  actual shares purchased under the authorized stock purchase program were 20,565,000.
  These shares were reflected as treasury stock in the Consolidated Statement
  of Condition at the time of purchase. Reflecting comparable post-split activity,
  the total number of shares authorized for purchase within this program is 43
  million shares, and the cumulative shares acquired as of December 31, 2002,
  is 34.7 million. At December 31, 2002, 8.3 million shares remained available
  for purchase within the program.

Additionally, shares may be acquired for other
  deferred compensation plans, held by an external trustee, that are not part
  of the stock purchase program. As of December 31, 2002, cumulative shares purchased
  and held in trust were 422,000. These shares are reflected as treasury stock
  in the Consolidated Statement of Condition.

During 2002, 2001 and 2000, total common stock
  purchased by State Street and recorded as treasury stock was 1,636,000 shares,
  5,260,000 shares and 820,000 shares, respectively, at an average historical
  cost per share of $46, $48 and $103, respectively.

State Street Corporation

| 67

State Street has a 1997 Equity Incentive Plan
  (“the 1997 Plan”) with 46,800,000 shares of common stock approved
  for issuance for stock and stock-based awards, including stock options, restricted
  stock, deferred stock and performance awards. Other award types are available
  under the plan, but are not currently utilized. All stock awards and stock options
  are awarded at the fair market value of State Street common stock at the date
  of grant.  At December 31, 2002, 13,913,000 shares were
  available for future awards under the 1997 Plan. State Street has stock options
  outstanding from previous plans under which no further grants can be made.

Stock options can expire no longer than ten
  years from the date of grant, and the exercise price of non-qualified and incentive
  stock options may not be less than the fair value of such shares at the date
  of grant. Information on stock option activity is provided in the Stock Options
  table.

State Street has a restricted stock program
  under the 1997 Plan whereby stock certificates are issued at the time of grant, and recipients have
  dividend and voting rights. In general, these grants vest over three years.
  Awards, net of cancellations, were 334,000, 292,000 and 598,000 for the years
  ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. At December 31, 2002,
  a total of 1,101,000 restricted shares have been awarded but have not vested under this program.

State Street currently has deferred stock
  award programs under the 1997 Plan whereby no stock is issued at the time of grant. These grants
  vest over various time periods. Awards, net of cancellations, were 244,000,
  528,000 and 385,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
  At December 31, 2002, 1,124,000 awards were outstanding under these programs.

Performance awards granted under the 1997 Plan are earned over a performance
  period based on achievement of goals. Payment for performance awards is made
  in cash equal to the fair market value of State Street’s common stock after
  the conclusion of each performance period. There are currently 746,000 award
  units outstanding for the two-year performance period ending December 31, 2002.
  A total of 854,000 were granted and paid out for the two-year performance period
  ended December 31, 2000.

In addition to the deferred stock award programs
  above, State Street maintains one other deferred stock plan outside the 1997
  Plan. Awards covering a total of 1,200,000 shares were originally granted in
  1996. At December 31, 2002, awards covering a total of 986,000 were outstanding.

In June 2001, State Street’s Board of
  Directors approved a savings-related stock purchase plan for employees resident
  in the United Kingdom that is not part of the 1997 Plan. A total of 170,000 shares of common stock were approved
  for issuance under this plan. These awards vest in three to five years. Awards,
  net of cancellations, were 24,000 and 124,000 for the years ended December 31,
  2002 and 2001, respectively. At December 31, 2002, 148,000 awards were outstanding
  under this program. Shares will be issued from treasury stock in 2004 through
  2007 in accordance with plan provisions.

Compensation related to restricted stock awards,
  deferred stock awards and performance awards was $36 million, $42 million and
  $64 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

A Black-Scholes option-pricing model was used
  for purposes of estimating the fair value of State Street’s employee stock
  options at the grant date under SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
  Compensation.” The following were the weighted average assumptions for
  the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively: risk-free interest
  rates of 3.14%, 3.99% and 5.75%; dividend yields of 1.45%, 1.08% and .73%; and
  volatility factors of the expected market price of State Street common stock
  of .30, .30 and .30. The estimated weighted average life of the stock options
  granted was 5.2 years for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 4.1 years for
  the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. For pro-forma expense information
  calculated under SFAS 123, see Note 1.

At December 31, the components of accumulated
  other comprehensive income (loss), net of related taxes, were as follows:

For the year ended December 31, 2002, State
  Street realized gains of $58 million, $54 million of which were included in
  other comprehensive income as net unrealized gains at December 31, 2001, net
  of deferred taxes of $22 million.

Note 11

Shareholders’ Rights Plan

In 1988, State Street declared a dividend of
  one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock.
  In 1998, the Rights Agreement was amended and restated. Accordingly, a right
  may be exercised, under certain conditions, to purchase one eight-hundredths
  share of a series of participating preferred stock at an exercise price of $132.50,
  subject to adjustment. The rights become exercisable if a party acquires or
  obtains the right to acquire 10% or more of State Street’s common stock
  or after commencement or public announcement of an offer for 10% or more of
  State Street’s common stock. When exercisable, under certain conditions,
  each right entitles the holder thereof to purchase shares of common stock, of
  either State Street or of the acquirer, having a market value of two times the
  then-current exercise price of that right.

The rights expire in September 2008, and may
  be redeemed at a price of $.00125 per right, subject to adjustment, at any time
  prior to expiration or the acquisition of 10% of State Street’s common
  stock. Under certain circumstances, the rights may be redeemed after they become
  exercisable and may be subject to automatic redemption.

Regulatory Matters

R e g u l a t o r y C a p i t a l

State Street is subject to various regulatory
  capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet
  minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary
  actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect
  on State Street’s financial condition. Under capital adequacy guidelines,
  State Street must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative
  measures of State Street’s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items
  as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. State Street’s capital
  amounts and classification are subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators
  about components, risk weightings and other factors.

Quantitative measures established by regulation
  to ensure capital adequacy require State Street and State Street Bank to maintain
  minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios as set forth in the table that
  follows. The risk-based capital ratios are Tier 1 capital and total capital
  to total adjusted risk-weighted assets and market-risk equivalents, and the
  Tier 1 leverage ratio is Tier 1 capital to quarterly average adjusted assets.

As of December 31, 2002, State Street Bank
  was categorized as “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework
  for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as “well capitalized,”
  State Street Bank must exceed the “well capitalized” guideline ratios,
  as set forth in the table, and meet certain other requirements. State Street
  Bank exceeds all “well capitalized” requirements as of December 31,
  2002.

The regulatory capital amounts and ratios were
  the following at December 31:

(1)

State Street must meet the regulatory designation
      of “well capitalized” in order to maintain its status as a financial
      holding company. In addition, Regulation Y defines “well capitalized”
      for a bank holding company such as State Street for the purpose of determining
      eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals.
      For such purposes, “well capitalized” requires State Street to
      maintain a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% and a minimum total
      risk-based capital ratio of 10%.

During 2002, the subsidiary banks of State
  Street were required by the Federal Reserve Bank to maintain average reserve
  balances of $86 million. Federal and state banking regulations place certain
  restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to State Street. At December
  31, 2002, State Street Bank had $1.8 billion of retained earnings available
  for distribution to State Street in the form of dividends.

The Federal Reserve Act requires that extensions
  of credit by State Street Bank to certain affiliates, including State Street,
  be secured by specific collateral, that the extension of credit to any one affiliate
  be limited to 10% of capital and surplus (as defined), and that extensions of
  credit to all such affiliates be limited to 20% of capital and surplus.

At December 31, 2002, consolidated retained
  earnings included $92 million representing undistributed earnings of affiliates
  that are accounted for using the equity method.

Lines of Business

State Street reports two lines of business:
  Investment Servicing and Investment Management. Given the nature of State Street’s
  services and management organization, the results of operations for these lines
  of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies.

Revenue and expenses are directly charged or
  allocated to the lines of business through algorithm-based management information
  systems. State Street prices its products and services on total client relationships
  and other factors; therefore, revenue may not necessarily reflect market pricing
  on products within the business lines in the same way as it would for independent
  business entities. Assets and liabilities are allocated according to rules that
  support management’s strategic and tactical goals. Capital is allocated
  based on risk-weighted assets employed and management’s judgment. The capital
  allocations may not be representative of the capital that might be required
  if these lines of business were independent business entities.

Investment Servicing includes custody, accounting,
  daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; trustee and
  recordkeeping; foreign exchange; securities lending; deposit and short-term
  investment facilities; lease financing; investment manager operations outsourcing;
  and performance, risk and compliance analytics to support institutional investors.
  State Street provides shareholder services, which includes mutual fund and collective
  fund shareholder accounting, through 50%-owned affiliates, Boston Financial
  Data Services, Inc. and the International Financial Data Services group of companies.

Investment Management offers a broad array
  of services for managing financial assets, including investment management,
  investment research and trading services for both institutions and individual
  investors worldwide. These services include active and passive U.S. and non-U.S.
  equity and fixed income strategies, and other related services, such as securities
  lending.

State Street measures its line of business
  results on an operating basis because such non-GAAP financial information-assists management by providing
  them with financial information in a format that provides comparable financial trends of ongoing
  business activities. As such, the table below includes an “Other”
  category for the gain in 2002 for the sale of the corporate trust business of
  $495 million, the write-off in 2001 of State Street’s total investment
  in Bridge of $50 million and goodwill amortization expense in 2001 and 2000.

Processing Fees and Other Revenue

Processing fees and other revenue includes
  fees from software licensing and maintenance, loans, investment banking, structured
  products, trade banking, profits or losses from joint ventures, gains and losses
  on sales of leased equipment and other assets, other trading profits and losses,
  amortization of investments in tax-advantaged financings, and residual interest
  from a variable interest entity.

In March 2001, State Street recorded the write-off
  of $50 million for its total investment in Bridge Information Systems, Inc.
  (“Bridge”), upon the filing by Bridge of a Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization
  under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The write-off is reflected
  in processing fees and other revenue in 2001 and decreased after-tax net income
  by $33 million, equal to $.10 per basic and diluted share.

Employee Benefit Plans

State Street Bank and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries
  participate in a non-contributory defined benefit plan. In addition to the primary
  plan, State Street has non-qualified supplemental plans that provide certain
  officers with defined pension benefits in excess of allowable qualified plan
  limits. Non-U.S. employees participate in local plans.

State Street Bank and certain U.S. subsidiaries
  participate in a post-retirement plan that provides health care and insurance
  benefits for retired employees.

Information combined for the primary defined
  benefit plan and non-U.S. defined benefit plans, and information for the post-retirement
  plan as of December 31 is as follows:

The assumed health care cost trend rate used
  in measuring the post-retirement plan benefit obligation was 10% for 2003, gradually
  decreasing to 5% in 2013, and remaining level thereafter.

State Street has unfunded, non-qualified supplemental
  employee retirement plans (SERPs) that provide certain officers with defined
  pension benefits in excess of limits imposed by U.S. federal tax law.

State Street Corporation

| 75

Information combined for the SERPs as of and
  for the years ended December 31, is as follows:

For those plans that have accumulated benefit
  obligations in excess of plan assets as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the aggregate
  benefit obligations are $139 million and $64 million, respectively, the plan
  assets are $46 million and $1 million, respectively, and the accumulated benefit
  obligations are $109 million and $44 million, respectively.

If the health care cost trend rates were increased
  by 1%, the post-retirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2002, would
  have increased 8%, and the aggregate expense for service and interest costs
  for 2002 would have increased by 10%. Conversely, if the health care cost trend
  rates were decreased by 1%, the post-retirement benefit obligation as of December
  31, 2002, would have decreased 7%, and the aggregate expense for service and
  interest costs for 2002 would have decreased by 8%.

The following table sets forth the actuarially
  determined expenses (benefits) for State Street’s primary and non-U.S.
  defined benefit plans, SERPs and post-retirement plan for the years ended December
  31:

Employees of State Street and certain subsidiaries
  are eligible to contribute a portion of their pre-tax salary to a 401(k) savings
  plan and an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). State Street’s matching
  portion of these contributions is made in cash, and the related expense for
  the years ended December 31, was $17 million for 2002, $21 million for 2001
  and $16 million for 2000. Further, employees in certain non-U.S. offices participate
  in other local plans. Expenses for these plans were $19 million, $17 million
  and $10 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The ESOP is a non-leveraged plan. Compensation
  cost is equal to the contribution called for by the plan formula and is equal
  to the cash contributed for the purchase of shares on the open market or the
  fair value of the shares contributed from treasury stock. Dividends on shares
  held by the ESOP are charged to retained earnings and are treated as outstanding
  for purposes of calculating earnings per share.

  cash management; trading; and information services to clients worldwide. Assets
  under custody and assets under management are held by State Street in a fiduciary
  or custodial capacity and are not included in the Consolidated Statement of
  Condition because such items are not assets of State Street. Management conducts
  regular reviews of its responsibilities for these services and considers the
  results in preparing its financial statements. In the opinion of management,
  there are no contingent liabilities at December 31, 2002 that would have a material
  adverse effect on State Street’s financial position or results of operations.

State Street is subject to pending and threatened
  legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. In the opinion of
  management, after discussion with counsel, these actions can be successfully
  defended or resolved without a material adverse effect on State Street’s
  financial position or results of operations.

Off-balance Sheet Financial Instruments,
  Including Derivatives

D e r i v a t i v e  F i n a n c i
  a l  I n s t r u m e n t s

State Street uses derivatives to support clients’
  needs, conduct trading activities, and manage its interest rate and currency
  risk. The Corporation assumes positions in both the foreign exchange and interest
  rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using financial derivatives,
  including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest
  rate options, and interest rate swaps.

An off-balance sheet derivative instrument
  is a financial instrument or other contract which has one or more underlying
  and one or more notional amounts, no initial net investment, or a smaller initial
  net investment than would be expected for similar types of contracts, and which
  requires or permits net settlement. Derivative instruments include forwards,
  futures, swaps, options and other instruments with similar characteristics.
  The use of these instruments generates fee or interest revenue.

Interest rate contracts involve an agreement
  with a counterparty to exchange cash flows based on the movement of an underlying
  interest rate index. An interest rate swap agreement involves the exchange of
  a series of interest payments, either at a fixed or variable rate, based upon
  the notional amount without the exchange of the underlying principal amount.
  An interest rate option contract provides the purchaser, for a premium, the
  right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying financial instrument
  at a set price at or during a specified period. An interest rate futures contract
  is a commitment to buy or sell, at a future date, a financial instrument at
  a contracted price; it may be settled in cash or through the delivery of the
  contracted instrument.

Foreign exchange contracts involve an agreement
  to exchange one currency for another currency at an agreed-upon rate and settlement
  date. Foreign exchange contracts consist of swap agreements and forward and
  spot contracts.

The following table summarizes the contractual
  or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments held or issued for trading
  and balance sheet management at December 31:

State Street Corporation

| 81

In connection with its interest rate risk management
  strategies, State Street has executed interest rate swap agreements with a notional
  value of $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively,
  designated as fair value hedges to hedge the changes in the fair value of certain
  securities. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, State Street recognized
  net pre-tax losses of approximately $5 million and $2 million, respectively,
  which represented the ineffective portion of the hedge reported in processing
  fees and other revenue.

State Street has designated interest rate swaps
  with a notional value of $150 million as cash flow hedges to its floating rate
  debt. These interest rate swaps constitute a fully effective hedge. In addition,
  State Street entered into interest rate swaps with a notional value of $500
  million effective February 20, 2002, a notional value of $50 million effective
  June 11, 2002, and a notional value of $50 million effective July 9, 2002, designated
  as fair value hedges to hedge certain of its fixed rate debt issuances. The
  fair value hedge swaps increased the value of long-term debt presented in the
  Statement of Condition by $55 million. For the year ended December 31, 2002,
  the Corporation’s overall weighted average interest rate for long-term
  debt was 7.12% on a contractual basis and 5.68% including the effects of derivative
  contracts.

F a i r   V a l u e   o
  f   D e r i v a t i v e   F i n a n c i a l   I
  n s t r u m e n t s

State Street’s risk exposure from interest
  rate and foreign exchange contracts results from the possibility that one party
  may default on its contractual obligation or from movements in exchange or interest
  rates. Credit risk is limited to the positive market value of the derivative
  financial instrument, which is significantly less than the notional value. The
  notional value provides the basis for determining the exchange of contractual
  cash flows. The exposure to credit loss can be estimated by calculating the
  cost, on a present-value basis, to replace at current market rates all profitable
  contracts at year-end. The estimated aggregate replacement cost of derivative
  financial instruments in a net positive position was $3.6 billion at December
  31, 2002, and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2001.

The foreign exchange contracts have been reduced
  by offsetting balances with the same counterparty where a master netting agreement
  exists.

The following table represents the fair value
  as of December 31, and average fair value for the years ended December 31, of
  financial derivative instruments held or issued for trading purposes:

Net foreign exchange trading revenue related
  to foreign exchange contracts was $300 million; $368 million and $387 million
  for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. For other
  financial instrument contracts, there were losses of $38 million in 2002, $22
  million in 2001 and $29 million in 2000. Future cash requirements, if any, related
  to foreign currency contracts are represented by the gross amount of currencies
  to be exchanged under each contract unless State Street and the counterparty
  have agreed to pay or receive the net contractual settlement amount on the settlement
  date. Future cash requirements on other financial instruments are limited to
  the net amounts payable under the agreements.

Credit-related financial instruments include
  indemnified securities on loan, commitments to extend credit or purchase assets,
  standby letters of credit, and letters of credit. The maximum credit risk associated
  with credit-related financial instruments is measured by the contractual amounts
  of these instruments.

The following is a summary of the contractual
  amount of credit-related, off-balance sheet financial instruments at December
  31:

On behalf of its clients, State Street lends
  their securities to creditworthy brokers and other institutions. In certain
  circumstances, State Street may indemnify its clients for the fair market value
  of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities.
  Collateral funds resulting from State Street’s securities lending services
  are held by State Street as agent; therefore, under accounting principles generally
  accepted in the United States, these assets are not assets of the Corporation.
  State Street requires the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal
  to or in excess of 102% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed.
  The borrowed securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral
  is necessary. State Street held, as collateral, cash and U.S. government securities
  totaling $134.6 billion and $117.2 billion for indemnified securities on loan
  at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Loan commitments (unfunded loans and unused
  lines of credit), asset purchase agreements, standby letters of credit and letters
  of credit are issued to accommodate the financing needs of State Street’s
  clients and to provide credit enhancements to variable interest entities. Loan
  commitments are agreements by State Street to lend monies at a future date.
  Asset purchase agreements are commitments to purchase receivables or securities,
  subject to conditions established in the agreements.

These loan, asset purchase and letter of credit
  commitments are subject to the same credit policies and reviews as loans. The
  amount and nature of collateral are obtained based upon management’s assessment
  of the credit risk. Approximately 87% of the loan commitments and asset purchase
  agreements expire within one year from the date of issue. Since many of the
  commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn, the total commitment
  amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

State Street provides liquidity and credit
  enhancements facilities in the forms of liquidity asset purchase agreements,
  lines of credit, and standby letters of credit to two types of variable interest
  entities (“VIEs”). One type, which State Street administers, issues
  asset-backed commercial paper (“ABCP”). At December 31, 2002 and 2001,
  State Street’s commitments under liquidity asset purchase agreements and
  lines of credit to these VIEs were $10.0 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively,
  and standby letters of credit were $590 million and $616 million, respectively,
  none of which were utilized. Amounts committed, but unused, under the liquidity
  asset purchase agreements, lines of credit and standby letters of credit that
  State Street provides to these VIEs are included in the table above. Asset performance
  deterioration may cause the asset risk to shift from the ABCP investors to State
  Street as the liquidity provider for the asset as the VIE may need to repay
  maturing commercial paper by drawing the liquidity facilities.

For a second type of VIE, structured as a qualified
  special purpose entity in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
  in the United States, State Street distributes and sells equity interests in
  tax-exempt investment-grade assets that are primarily sold to mutual fund clients.
  State Street provides liquidity asset purchase agreements to these entities.
  These liquidity asset purchase agreements obligate State Street to buy

84 |

State
  Street Corporation

the equity interests in the underlying portfolio
  at par, which approximates market value, in the event that the re-marketing
  agent is unable to place the equity interests of the VIE with investors. The
  liquidity asset purchase agreements are subject to early termination by State
  Street in the event of payment default, bankruptcy of issuer or credit enhancement
  provider, taxability, or downgrade of an asset below investment grade. State
  Street’s liquidity asset purchase agreements to these VIEs were $1.3 billion
  and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, none of which
  were utilized, and are included in the preceding table.

Note 22

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

State Street uses the following methods to
  estimate the fair value of financial instruments.

For financial instruments that have quoted
  market prices, those quotes are used to determine fair value. Financial instruments
  that have no defined maturity, have a remaining maturity of 180 days or less,
  or reprice frequently to a market rate are assumed to have a fair value that
  approximates reported book value, after taking into consideration any applicable
  credit risk. If no market quotes are available, financial instruments are valued
  by discounting the expected cash flow(s) using an estimated current market interest
  rate for the financial instrument. For off-balance sheet derivative instruments,
  fair value is estimated as the amount at which an asset or liability could be
  bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, other than
  in a forced or liquidation sale.

The short maturity of State Street’s assets
  and liabilities results in a significant number of financial instruments whose
  fair value equals or closely approximates reported balance sheet value. Such
  financial instruments are reported in the following balance sheet captions:
  cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks, securities purchased
  under resale agreements and securities borrowed, federal funds sold, deposits,
  securities sold under repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased and other
  short-term borrowings. The fair value of trading account assets equals the carrying
  value. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the net fair value of interest rate
  contracts used for balance sheet management was a liability of $76 million and
  a liability of $35 million, respectively. There is no reported cost for loan
  commitments since terms are at prevailing market rates.

The reported value and fair value for other
  balance sheet captions at December 31 are as follows:

Note 23

Non-U.S. Activities

Non-U.S. activities, as defined by the Securities
  and Exchange Commission, are considered to be those revenue-producing assets
  and transactions that arise from clients domiciled outside the United States.

Due to the nature of State Street’s business,
  it is not possible to segregate precisely U.S. and non-U.S. activities. Subjective
  judgments have been used to arrive at the operating results for non-U.S. activities,
  including the application of tax transfer pricing and asset-liability management
  policies. Interest expense allocations are based on the average cost of short-term
  borrowed funds. State Street does not allocate costs related to resources common
  to non-U.S. and U.S. activities. Certain previously reported amounts have been
  restated to conform to the current method of presentation.

The following table summarizes non-U.S. operating
  results for the years ended December 31, and assets as of December 31, based
  on the domicile location of clients:

On January 31, 2003, State Street completed
  the primary closing of its acquisition of a substantial part of the global securities
  services business (“GSS”) of Deutsche Bank AG. Under the terms of
  the definitive agreements, first announced on November 5, 2002, State Street’s
  initial payment to Deutsche Bank for all business units to be acquired was approximately
  $1.1 billion. A separate closing will be held in the near future for business
  units in Italy and Austria, upon receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.
  In the period ending on the one-year anniversary of the closing, State Street
  will make additional payments of up to an estimated €360 million, based upon
  performance of the acquired business. The restructuring costs associated with
  the acquisition are expected to be $90–$110 million on a pre-tax basis,
  approximately half of which will be recorded in the first quarter of 2003 and
  the balance recorded over the next three quarters. GSS had approximately $2.2
  trillion of assets under custody.

Approximately half of the initial payment was
  financed using existing resources including the net proceeds from the sale of
  the corporate trust business mentioned in Note 2. State Street financed $595
  million of the purchase price by issuance of equity, equity-related and capital
  securities to the public under an existing shelf registration statement. In
  January 2003, State Street issued $345 million, or 7.2 million shares of common
  stock, $345 million, or 1.7 million units of SPACES

(SM)

,
  and $345 million of floating-rate, medium-term capital securities due 2008.
  SPACES are collateralized, forward purchase contract units for additional shares
  of common stock of State Street. Each SPACES has a stated amount of $200 and
  consists of PACES

(SM

),
  a fixed-share purchase contract and treasury securities, and COVERS(

SM)

,
  a variable-share repurchase contract. The SPACES investors will receive total
  annual payments of 6.75% on the units, payable quarterly, consisting of an annual
  2.75% coupon on the PACES and an annual 4.00% contract payment on the COVERS.
  State Street did not receive the proceeds from the SPACES at closing, but will
  receive proceeds of $345 million and issue common stock upon the settlement
  of the fixed share purchase contracts underlying the SPACES units on November
  15, 2005. The floating rate capital securities were issued at LIBOR plus 50
  basis points, and are subject to mandatory redemption on December 15, 2005,
  provided certain regulatory requirements are met, and otherwise are due on February
  15, 2008. After the close of the financing transactions in January 2003, $469
  million of State Street’s shelf registration was available for further
  issuance.

  to Regulation 14A on or before April 30, 2003, under the caption “Beneficial
  Ownership of Shares.” Such information is incorporated herein by reference.

The following table discloses the number of
  outstanding options, warrants and rights granted by the Corporation to participants
  in equity compensation plans, as well as the number of securities remaining
  available for future issuance under these plans. The table provides this information
  separately for equity compensation plans that have and have not been approved
  by security holders.

Two compensation plans under which equity securities
  of the Registrant are authorized for issuance have been adopted without the
  approval of stockholders.

In 1996, the Board of Directors adopted the
  State Street Global Advisors Equity Compensation Plan, pursuant to which senior
  officers of SSgA were eligible to be selected for participation in the plan,
  and to receive at that time awards providing for the deferred delivery of shares
  of common stock. The awards vest as to 20% of the total award of each participant
  after five years, and as to an additional 20% in each year thereafter. Special
  vesting rules apply in the case of death, disability or retirement. Shares are
  deliverable under the plan on December 31, 2005 or upon earlier death, disability
  or retirement. Upon termination of a participant’s employment, unvested
  portions are forfeited. Award participants are subject to a non-competition
  and non-solicitation of business covenant during a period of 18 months following
  termination of employment. The awards are non-transferable. Awards providing
  for the deferred delivery of an aggregate of 986,000 shares of common stock
  were outstanding as of December 31, 2002.

In 2001, the Board of Directors adopted the
  State Street Corporation Savings-Related Stock Plan (“SAYE Plan”),
  for employees in the United Kingdom. Under the SAYE Plan, employee-participants
  could commit to save a specified amount from after-tax pay for a fixed period
  (either three or five years). Savings are deducted automatically. At the end
  of the period chosen, a tax-free bonus is added by the Registrant to the savings
  amount (the level of the bonus depends on the length of the fixed period of
  savings), and participants have the option to receive the savings and bonus
  amount in cash, or to use the amount to purchase common stock from the Registrant
  at an exercise price equal to the market price of the stock as of the date of
  joining the SAYE Plan less a discount fixed by the Registrant at the date of
  joining. For participants joining the SAYE Plan in 2001, the discount was 15%.
  There was no discount for participants joining in 2002. Options granted under
  the SAYE Plan are non-transferable. If a participant withdraws from participation
  before the end of the fixed period, the options to purchase stock are forfeited.
  If a participant terminates during the period due to retirement, disability,
  redundancy or sale of the employer from the Registrant’s group, the options
  may be exercised within six months of the occurrence, or one year if by reason
  of death. Under the SAYE Plan, an aggregate of 170,000 shares of
