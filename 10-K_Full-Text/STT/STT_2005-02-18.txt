SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA




  REPORTED RESULTS AND NON-GAAP MEASURES


  REPORTED RESULTS AND NON-GAAP MEASURES


COMPARISON
  OF 2004 OPERATING RESULTS TO 2003 OPERATING RESULTS


RECONCILIATION
  OF REPORTED RESULTS TO NON-GAAP MEASURES







ASSETS UNDER
  CUSTODY At year-end 2004, total assets under custody were $9.50 trillion.
  This compares with $9.37 trillion a year earlier. The value of assets under
  custody is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served.
  Changes in the value of assets under custody do not necessarily result in
  proportional changes in revenue. State Street uses relationship pricing for
  clients that take advantage of multiple services. Many services are priced on
  factors other than asset values, including the mix of assets under custody,
  securities positions held, portfolio transactions, and types of products and
  services used. Assets under custody at December 31 comprised the following:

Market value
  changes, as measured by indices at year-end, had a significant impact on the
  value of assets under custody, offset by the expected loss of certain GSS
  client assets during the year. At December 31, 2004, the S&P 500® index
  was up 9% from year-end 2003, the NASDAQ® index was up 9%, the MSCI® EAFE
  index was up 18%, and the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond

SM

index
  was up 4%. [The index names mentioned in this report are service marks of
  their respective owners.]



Following is
  a rollforward of assets under management for the two years ended December 31,
  2004:

Net interest
  revenue was $859 million in 2004, compared to $810 million in 2003, an
  increase of $49 million. Revenue growth was due to an increase in the average
  balance sheet driven by a higher level of customer deposits, including the
  conversion of GSS clients deposits to State Street’s balance sheet. Somewhat
  offsetting these benefits, State Street experienced narrower interest rate
  spreads. Generally, State Street’s liabilities reprice more quickly than its
  assets. In a period of rapid rate increases, interest rate spreads are
  constrained as the cost of funds rises more rapidly than the return on invested
  assets.

In addition,
  State Street recorded a cumulative charge of $19 million in 2004 that
  resulted from a change in effective state tax-rate assumptions used for
  recognition of income from leveraged lease transactions. The impact of this
  charge on net income was minimal as the charge was almost entirely offset by
  a related tax benefit of $18 million.

RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED RESULTS TO
NON-GAAP MEASURES





Note:
  Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
  current year method of presentation.

Investment
  Servicing provides services for U.S. mutual funds, collective funds
  worldwide, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies,
  foundations, endowments, and other investment pools. Products include
  custody, accounting, daily pricing and administration; master trust and
  master custody; recordkeeping; foreign exchange; securities lending; deposit
  and short-term








Non-U.S. noninterest-bearing deposits at
 December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $71 million, $53 million and $37
 million, respectively.

Scheduled maturities of U.S. time deposits
 of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2004 were as follows:


INVESTMENT SECURITIES

Investment securities consisted of the
 following as of December 31:

During the second half of 2004, State
 Street increased its holdings of mortgage-backed securities.

State Street had $96 million in net pre-tax
 unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities at December 31,
 2004, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in equity as a loss
 of $56 million, after tax. During 2003, a $27 million charge was recorded in
 processing fees and other revenue to reduce the amortized cost basis of
 certain investment securities for which the decline in fair value was
 determined to be other-than-temporary. Refer to Note 3 in the Notes to the
 Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial
 Statements and Supplementary Data” for detail regarding available-for-sale
 investment securities, including the determination of when unrealized losses
 are considered other-than-temporary.


The
  maturities of debt investment securities as of December 31, 2004, were as follows:

(1)

Yields
  calculated for interest revenue on non-taxable investment securities includes
  the effect of taxable-equivalent adjustments, a method of presentation in
  which interest income on tax-exempt securities is adjusted to present the
  earnings performance on a basis equivalent to interest earned on fully
  taxable securities, with a corresponding charge to income tax expense. The
  adjustment is computed using a federal income tax rate of 35%, adjusted for
  applicable state income taxes, net of the related federal tax benefit. The
  taxable equivalent adjustment included in interest revenue to calculate the
  yields above was $45 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.


At December
  31, 2004, 5% of State Street’s assets comprised loans and lease financing.
  Unearned revenue included in leases was $1.13 billion and $1.18 billion for
  non-U.S. leases, and $114 million and $123 million for U.S. leases, as of
  December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Loan
  maturities for selected loan categories as of December 31, 2004, were as
  follows:

The
  following table shows the classification of loans due after one year
  according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of December 31,
  2004:


Regulatory
  capital ratios were as follows as of December 31:

At December
  31, 2004, the Corporation’s and the Bank’s Tier 1 and total risk-based
  capital ratios were down from year-end 2003, resulting from the growth in
  retained earnings being out-paced by growth in total risk-weighted assets,
  primarily reflecting a change in the mix of investment securities and higher
  volumes of indemnified securities lending transactions.

To manage
  fluctuations in the Tier 1 and total risk-based capital of State Street and
  State Street Bank resulting from foreign currency translation, the
  Corporation has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a
  portion of its net foreign investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries. The notional
  value of these contracts was €300 million, or approximately $407 million, at
  December 31, 2004.


On June 26,
  2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released the final version
  of its capital adequacy framework (“Basel II”). Basel II’s framework includes
  minimum capital requirements, including capital for operational risk. U.S.
  banking regulatory agencies must now apply international risk-based capital
  guidance to rules to be implemented in the U.S. The U.S. regulatory agencies
  are expected to release proposed new rules for comment by mid-2005, with the
  final version anticipated by mid-2006. The new rules as applied in the U.S.
  are expected to become effective by January 1, 2007, subject to transitional
  implementation arrangements, and will become fully operational by January 1,
  2008. Mandatory compliance will be required for large, internationally-active
  U.S. institutions, such as State Street. In preparation for compliance, the
  Corporation has developed a comprehensive implementation program to monitor the
  status and progress of Basel II, and is in the process of implementing the
  requirements and assessing the potential impact of Basel II on the
  Corporation. At this time, the Corporation cannot predict the final form of
  the rules in the U.S., nor their impact on the Corporation’s risk-based
  capital.

NOTE 14 NET INTEREST REVENUE

Net interest
  revenue consisted of the following for the years ended December 31:


State Street
  incurred $296 million of restructuring costs for the year ended December 31,
  2003, as a result of the program, as follows:

No expenses
  related to the VSP were incurred in either 2004 or 2002. Following is a
  rollforward of the restructuring accrual for the years ended December 31,
  2004 and 2003:

The
  restructuring costs were recorded at the time the accounting events and
  measurement date occurred. Severance costs included salaries and related
  benefits to be paid out over a defined period of up to two years. Pension
  costs will be paid out primarily in equal annual installments over a
  five-year period. Stock compensation expense was attributable to the
  modification of various stock options and restricted and deferred stock
  awards for individuals who accepted the VSP (see the Stock-Based Compensation
  disclosures in Note 1). Other restructuring costs include outplacement
  services associated with the termination of employees and professional and
  actuarial fees incurred.

In 2002,
  State Street incurred $20 million of expenses related to cost control efforts
  through the elimination of positions, all of which was paid during the year ended
  December 31, 2002.



The expected
  benefit payments for the next ten years are as follows:

The
  accumulated benefit obligation for all U.S. defined benefit pension plans of
  the Corporation was $522 million and $490 million at December 31, 2004, and
  2003, respectively.

To develop
  the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, State Street
  considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for
  each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the pension
  portfolio. This analysis resulted in the selection of 8.00% as the long-term
  rate of return on assets assumption.


For the
  tax-qualified U.S. defined benefit pension plan, the asset allocation as of
  December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the target allocation for 2005, by asset
  category, were as follows:

The
  preceding strategic target asset allocation guidelines were last amended in
  May 1999. Consistent with that allocation, the Plan should generate a real
  return above inflation and superior to that of a benchmark index consisting
  of a combination of appropriate capital markets indices weighted in the same
  proportions as the Plan’s strategic target asset allocation. Equities included
  domestic and international publicly-traded common, preferred and convertible
  securities. Fixed income securities included domestic and international
  corporate and government debt securities, as well as asset-backed securities
  and private debt. The other category included real estate, alternative investments and
  cash and cash equivalents. Derivative instruments are an acceptable
  alternative to investing in these types of securities, but may not be used to
  leverage the Plan’s portfolio.

Expected
  employer contributions to the tax-qualified U.S. defined benefit pension plans,
  non-qualified supplemental employee retirement plans (“SERPs”) and
  post-retirement plan for the year ending December 31, 2005 are $29 million,
  $10 million and $5 million, respectively.


State Street
  has unfunded SERPs that provide certain officers with defined pension
  benefits in excess of limits imposed by U.S. federal tax law. Information
  combined for the SERPs as of and for the years ended December 31, was as
  follows:


The
  following table sets forth the actuarially determined expense (income) for
  State Street’s U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans, SERPs and
  post-retirement plan for the years ended December 31:

In
  connection with the VSP (see Note 16), State Street recorded approximately
  $80 million during the year ended December 31, 2003 for enhanced pension
  benefits.

Employees of
  State Street and certain subsidiaries are eligible to contribute a portion of
  their pre-tax salary to a 401(k) savings plan and an Employee Stock Ownership
  Plan (ESOP). State Street’s matching portion of these contributions is made
  in cash, and the related expense was $16 million for 2004, $22 million for
  2003 and $17 million for 2002. Further, employees in certain non-U.S.


NOTE 19
  INCOME TAXES

Income tax
  expense consisted of the following for the years ended December 31:

Current and
  deferred income taxes for 2003 and 2002 have been reclassified to reflect tax
  returns as actually filed. The income tax expense related to net realized
  securities gains was $10 million, $9 million and $31 million for 2004, 2003
  and 2002, respectively. Pre-tax income attributable to operations located
  outside the United States was $476 million, $262 million and $147 million in
  2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.


The
  valuation allowance has been determined pursuant to the provisions of SFAS
  No. 109, and is adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount
  that will more likely than not be realized. At December 31, 2004, State
  Street had minimum tax credit carryforwards of $44 million, U.S. foreign tax
  credit carryforwards of $16 million, general business credit carryforwards of
  $8 million and non-U.S. federal tax loss carryforwards of $3 million. The
  minimum tax credit amount carries forward indefinitely. General business
  credit carryforwards, U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards and non-U.S.
  federal tax loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2024, 2009 and 2005,
  respectively.

  EARNINGS PER SHARE

The
  following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per
  share for the years ended December 31:

  hedges to manage interest-rate risk. The notional values of these interest
  rate contracts and the related assets or liabilities being hedged at December
  31, were as follows:

None



Two compensation plans
  under which equity securities of the Registrant are authorized for issuance
  have been adopted without the approval of stockholders.

In 1996, the Board of
  Directors adopted the State Street Global Advisors Equity Compensation Plan,
  pursuant to which senior officers of SSgA are eligible to be selected for
  participation in the plan, and to receive awards providing for the deferred
  delivery of shares of common stock. Awards outstanding at December 31, 2004,
  covered 244,000 shares to be issued, of which 80% had vested, with the
  remaining 20% vesting during the year ending December 31, 2005. In general,
  delivery of shares under vested awards commenced December 31, 2004. Upon
  termination of a participant’s employment unvested portions are forfeited.
  Special vesting and deliverability rules apply in the case of death,
  disability, and retirement or as determined by the Executive Compensation
  Committee of the Board in the case of severance or voluntary separation. As a
  result of the voluntary separation program in 2003, 230,000 shares were
  issued to participants who left the Corporation. Award participants are
  subject to a non-competition and non-solicitation of business covenant during
  a period of 18 months following termination of employment. The awards are
  non-transferable by the recipient. Shares underlying forfeited awards are
  available for future awards under the plan; at December 31, 2004, 4,000
  shares remained available under the plan for future awards.
