ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS
     State Street Boston Corporation  ("State Street") is a bank holding company
organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

     State Street was  organized  in 1970 and conducts its business  principally
through its  subsidiary,  State  Street Bank and Trust  Company  ("State  Street
Bank"),  which traces its  beginnings to the founding of the Union Bank in 1792.
The charter  under which State  Street Bank now  operates  was  authorized  by a
special act of the  Massachusetts  Legislature in 1891, and its present name was
adopted in 1960.

     State Street is the fourth largest provider of trust services in the United
States as ranked on the basis of 1993 fiduciary  compensation.  State Street had
more than $1.6  trillion of assets  under  custody,  $210 billion of bonds under
trusteeship,  and $160  billion of assets  under  management  at year- end 1994.
Ranked on the basis of balance  sheet assets as of June 1994,  State Street Bank
is the 23rd largest  commercial bank in the United States.  State Street's total
assets were $21.7 billion at December 31, 1994, of which $16.0 billion,  or 74%,
were  investment  securities  and money market assets and $3.2 billion,  or 15%,
were loans.

     Services are provided  from offices in the United  States,  as well as from

administration  and  information  services.  Shareholder  accounting is provided
through a 50%-owned affiliate.

     Servicing  $664  billion of  pension  and other  assets for North  American
customers,  State Street is ranked as the largest servicer of tax-exempt  assets
for  corporations  and public funds in the United States and the largest  global

asset-backed securities,  corporate securities,  leveraged leases, and municipal
securities are provided to investment banks,  corporations,  municipalities  and
government  agencies from five offices in the United States. At year ended 1994,
bonds under trusteeship totaled $210 billion.

SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION
     The  following  tables  contain  State  Street's  consolidated  statistical
information   relating  to,  and  should  be  read  in  conjunction   with,  the

     The  maturities  of  investment  securities  at  December  31, 1994 and the
weighted average yields (fully taxable equivalent basis) were as follows:



LOAN PORTFOLIO
     Domestic and foreign loans at December 31 and average loans outstanding for
the years ended December 31, were as follows:


     Loans are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the appropriateness
of renewing  each loan.  State Street does not have a general  rollover  policy.
Unearned revenue included in loans was $4,112,000 and $4,423,000 at December 31,
1994 and 1993, respectively.

NON-ACCRUAL LOANS
     It is State Street's policy to place loans on a non-accrual basis when they
become 60 days  past due as to  either  principal  or  interest,  or when in the
opinion of  management,  full  collection  of principal or interest is unlikely.
When the loan is placed on non-accrual,  the accrual of interest is discontinued
and  previously  recorded but unpaid  interest is reversed  and charged  against
current  earnings.  Past due  loans  are loans on which  principal  or  interest
payments  are  over 90 days  delinquent,  but  where  interest  continues  to be
accrued.


NON-ACCRUAL LOANS (CONTINUED)
     The following schedule  discloses  information  concerning  non-accrual and
past due loans:


     The  interest  revenue for 1994 which would have been  recorded  related to
these  non-accrual  loans is $2,245,000 for domestic loans. The interest revenue
that was recorded on these non-accrual loans was $834,000,  all of which relates
to domestic loans.

     A loan  totaling  $2,703,000  was  restructured  in 1994,  is performing in
accordance with its new terms and is accruing at a market rate.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES
     The changes in the allowance  for loan losses for the years ended  December
31, were as follows:



ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES (CONTINUED)
     State Street  establishes  an allowance for loan losses to absorb  probable
credit  losses.  Management's  review of the adequacy of the  allowance for loan
losses is ongoing throughout the year and is based, among other factors,  on the
evaluation  of the  level of risk in the  portfolio,  the  volume  of  adversely
classified  loans,  previous  loss  experience,  current  trends,  and  expected
economic conditions and its effect on borrowers.

     While the allowance is established to absorb  probable  losses  inherent in
the total loan portfolio,  management allocates the allowance for loan losses to
specific  loans,  selected  portfolio  segments  and certain  off-balance  sheet
exposures and  commitments.  Adversely  classified loans in excess of $1 million
are  individually  reviewed  to  evaluate  risk of loss and  assigned a specific
allocation  of the  allowance.  The  allocations  are based on an  assessment of
potential  risk of loss and  include  evaluations  of the  borrowers'  financial
strength, cash flows, collateral,  appraisals and guarantees. The allocations to
portfolio  segments and  off-balance  sheet  exposures are based on management's
evaluation of relevant factors, including the current level of problem loans and
current  economic  trends.  These  allocations  are  also  based  on  subjective
estimates   and   management   judgment,   and  are   subject  to  change   from
quarter-to-quarter.  In addition, a portion of the allowance remains unallocated
as a general reserve for the entire loan portfolio.

     The  provision  for loan  losses is a charge to  earnings  for the  current
period which is required to maintain the total  allowance at a level  considered
adequate in relation to the level of risk in the loan  portfolio.  The provision
for loan losses was $11.6 million for 1994,  which  compares to $11.3 million in
1993.

     At December 31, 1994, the allowance for loan losses was $58.2  million,  or
1.80% of loans. This compares to an allowance of $54.3 million or 2.03% of loans
a year ago. This decline reflects  improvement in measures of credit quality and
improvement  in the outlook for general  economic  conditions  and its effect on
borrowers.  The decline in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loan
volume is also  attributable  to the growth in loan exposures to financial asset
services  customers and securities brokers in conjunction with their trading and
settlement  activity.  These loan  exposures are generally  short-term,  usually
overnight, and are structured to have relatively low credit exposure.

CREDIT QUALITY
     At  December  31,  1994,  loans  comprised  15% of State  Street's  assets,
compared to over 55% for other  banking  companies  of  comparable  size.  State
Street's loan policies  limit the size of  individual  loan  exposures to reduce
risk through diversification.

     In 1994, net charge-offs  declined from $16.3 million to $7.7 million.  Net
charge-offs  as a  percentage  of average  loans were .23%  compared to .63% for
1993.

     At December 31, 1994,  total  non-performing  assets were $27.4 million,  a
$10.5  million  decrease from year-end  1993.  For 1994 and 1993,  respectively,
non-performing  assets  include $23.0  million and $26.8 million of  non-accrual
loans and $4.4 million and $11.1  million of other real estate  owned.  In 1994,
loans  placed  on  non-accrual  status  were more  than  offset by  charge-offs,
payments,  and the return to accrual  status of several  loans.  The  decline in
other real estate owned resulted from property sales.

     In 1994,  measures of credit quality  improved,  as discussed above, as did
the  general  economic  outlook.  The economy in the  Northeast  began to expand
modestly  after  several  years of  decline.  We expect  these  levels of credit
quality to continue in in 1995. It is anticipated that charge-off's in 1995 will
approximate the 1994 level and will be primarily in the commercial and financial
category.

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS
     Countries with which State Street has cross-border  outstandings (primarily
deposits and letters of credit to banks and other financial  institutions) of at

were foreign  deposits of  $44,816,000,  $28,519,000 and $41,492,000 at December
31, 1994, 1993 and 1992.


SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS
     The following table reflects the amounts  outstanding and weighted  average

the years ended:


COMPETITION
     State Street operates in a highly  competitive  environment in all areas of
its  business  on a world wide  basis,  including  servicing  financial  assets,
investment  management  and  commercial  lending.  In addition to facing  strong
competition  from other deposit taking  institutions,  State Street faces strong
competition  from  investment  management  firms,  private  trustees,  insurance
companies,  mutual funds,  broker/dealers,  investment banking firms, law firms,
benefit  consultants,  and business service  companies.  As State Street expands
globally, additional sources of competition are encountered.

EMPLOYEES
     At December 31, 1994,  State  Street had 11,127  employees,  of whom 10,766
were full-time.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
     State  Street is  registered  with the Board of  Governors  of the  Federal
Reserve  System (the  "Board") as a bank  holding  company  pursuant to the Bank
Holding  Company Act of 1956,  as amended  (the  "Act").  The Act,  with certain
exceptions, limits the activities that may be engaged in by State Street and its
non-bank  subsidiaries  to those  which are deemed by the Board to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling  banks as to be a proper  incident
thereto.  In making  such  determination,  the Board must  consider  whether the
performance  of any such activity by a subsidiary of State Street can reasonably
be expected to produce  benefits  to the  public,  such as greater  convenience,
increased  competition or gains in efficiency,  that outweigh  possible  adverse
effects,  such  as  undue  concentration  of  resources,   decreased  or  unfair
competition,  conflicts of interest or unsound banking  practices.  The Board is
authorized  to  differentiate  between  activities  commenced  de novo and those
commenced by the  acquisition in whole or in part of a going concern.  The Board
may order a bank holding  company to terminate  any activity or its ownership or
control  of a nonbank  subsidiary  if the Board  finds  that  such  activity  or
ownership  or  control  constitutes  a  serious  risk to the  financial  safety,
soundness  or  stability of a  subsidiary  bank and is  inconsistent  with sound
banking principles or statutory purposes.  In the opinion of management,  all of
State Street's  present  subsidiaries  are within the statutory  standard or are
otherwise permissible.

     The Act also  requires a bank holding  company to obtain prior  approval of
the Board  before it may  acquire  substantially  all the  assets of any bank or
ownership  or control of more than 5% of the  voting  shares of any bank.  Until
September  29, 1995,  the Act  prohibits a bank holding  company from  acquiring
shares  of a bank  located  outside  the state in which  the  operations  of the
holding company's banking subsidiaries are principally  conducted unless such an
acquisition  is  specifically  authorized  by  statute  of the other  state.  On
September 29, 1994, President Clinton signed into law the Riegle-Neal Interstate
Banking  and  Branching  Efficiency  Act of 1994  (the  "Interstate  Act").  The
Interstate  Act  generally  authorizes  bank holding  companies to acquire banks
located in any state commencing on September 29, 1995. In addition, it generally
authorizes  national and state  chartered banks to merge across state lines (and
thereby  create  interstate   branches)  commencing  June  1,  1997.  Under  the
provisions  of the  Interstate  Act,  states are  permitted to "opt out" of this
latter interstate branching authority by taking action prior to the commencement
date.  States  may also  "opt in"  early  (i.e.,  prior to June 1,  1997) to the
interstate merger provisions.  Further,  the Interstate Act provides that states
may act affirmatively to permit de novo branching by banking institutions across
state lines.

     The  Board has  established  risk-based  capital  guidelines  that  require
minimum ratios of capital to risk-weighted  assets and certain off-balance sheet
credit  exposure.  The Board also maintains a leverage ratio guideline that is a
measure of capital to total average  balance sheet assets.  Information on State
Street's capital appears in State Street's 1994 Annual Report to Stockholders on
page 34 and is incorporated by reference.

     State Street and its non-bank  subsidiaries  are affiliates of State Street
Bank under the federal  banking  laws,  which  impose  certain  restrictions  on
transfers of funds in the form of loans,  extensions of credit,  investments  or
asset  purchases  by  State  Street  Bank  to  State  Street  and  its  non-bank
subsidiaries.   Transfers  of  this  kind  to  State  Street  and  its  non-bank
subsidiaries  by State  Street  Bank are limited to 10% of State  Street  Bank's
capital and surplus with respect to each  affiliate and to 20% in the aggregate,
and are also subject to certain collateral requirements.  A bank holding company
and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements
in  connection  with any  extension  of credit or lease or sale of  property  or
furnishing of services. Federal law also provides that certain transactions with
affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances,  including credit standards
that are  substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution as
those  prevailing  at the  time  for  comparable  transactions  involving  other
non-qualified companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions,  on terms
and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be
offered  to,  or  would  apply  to,  nonaffiliated   companies.  The  Board  has
jurisdiction  to  regulate  the terms of  certain  debt  issues of bank  holding
companies.

     State Street,  State Street Bank and their  affiliates  are also subject to
restrictions  with respect to issuing,  floating and  underwriting,  or publicly
selling or distributing,  securities in the United States.  State Street and its
affiliates are able to underwrite and deal in specific categories of securities,
including U.S. government and certain agency, state, and municipal securities.

     Board  policy  requires  a bank  holding  company  to act  as a  source  of
financial  strength for its subsidiary  banks and to commit resources to support
such banks. Under this policy,  State Street may be required to commit resources
to its subsidiary  banks in  circumstances  where it might not do so absent such
policy. In the event of a bank holding company's  bankruptcy,  any commitment by
the bank  holding  company to a federal bank  regulatory  agency to maintain the
capital  of a  subsidiary  bank will be assumed by the  bankruptcy  trustee  and
entitled to a priority payment.

     The primary banking agency  responsible for regulating State Street and its
subsidiaries,  including State Street Bank, for both domestic and  international
operations is the Federal  Reserve Bank of Boston.  State Street is also subject
to the Massachusetts  bank holding company statute.  The  Massachusetts  statute
requires prior approval by the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation for the
acquisition  by  State  Street  of more  than  5% of the  voting  shares  of any
additional bank and for other forms of bank acquisitions.

     State  Street's  banking   subsidiaries  are  subject  to  supervision  and
examination by various regulatory authorities.  State Street Bank is a member of
the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  (the
"FDIC")  and is subject to  applicable  federal  and state  banking  laws and to
supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, as well as by
the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks,the FDIC, and the regulatory authorities
of those  countries  in which a branch of State  Street Bank is  located.  Other
subsidiary banks are subject to supervision and examination by the Office of the
Comptroller  of the  Currency or by the  appropriate  state  banking  regulatory
authorities  of the states in which they are  located.  State  Street's  foreign
banking   subsidiaries   are  also  subject  to  regulation  by  the  regulatory
authorities  of the countries in which they are located.  The capital of each of
these  banking   subsidiaries   is  in  excess  of  the  minimum  legal  capital
requirements as set by those authorities.

RECENT STATUTORY DEVELOPMENTS
     The Financial  Institutions  Reform,  Recovery and  Enforcement Act of 1989
("FIRREA")  broadened the enforcement  powers of the federal  banking  agencies,
including  increased  power to impose fines and  penalties,  over all  financial
institutions, including bank holding companies and commercial banks. As a result
of FIRREA,  State  Street  Bank and any or all of its  subsidiaries  can be held
liable for any loss incurred by, or  reasonably  expected to be incurred by, the
FDIC after August 9, 1989,  in  connection  with (a) the default of State Street
Bank or any other subsidiary bank or (b) any assistance  provided by the FDIC to
State Street Bank or any other subsidiary bank in danger of default.

    In 1990, Massachusetts adopted a law which permits Massachusetts banking
institutions to acquire banking institutions located in other states based on
a reciprocal basis. The Crime Control Act of 1990 further broadened the
enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies in a significant number of
areas.

     The  Federal  Deposit  Insurance   Corporation   Improvement  Act  of  1991
("FDICIA") has as its primary objectives to recapitalize the Bank Insurance Fund
and strengthen the regulation and supervision of financial institutions.  During
1994,  the  federal  banking  agencies  continued  the  process of  promulgating
regulations to implement the statute.

     The "Prompt  Corrective Action" provisions of the FDICIA are for the stated
purpose:  "to resolve the  problems of insured  depository  institutions  at the
least  possible  long-term  loss to the deposit  insurance  fund." Each  federal
banking agency has  implemented  prompt  corrective  action  regulations for the
institutions that it regulates.  The statute requires or permits the agencies to
take certain  supervisory  actions when an insured depository  institution falls
within one of five specifically enumerated capital categories. It also restricts
or  prohibits  certain  activities  and  requires  the  submission  of a capital
restoration  plan when an  insured  institution  becomes  undercapitalized.  The
implementing   regulations  establish  the  numerical  limits  for  the  capital
categories and establish procedures for issuing and contesting prompt corrective
action  directives.  The five  tiers of  capital  measurement  range  from "well
capitalized" to "critically  undercapitalized".  To be within the category "well
capitalized",  an insured  depository  institution must have a total risk- based
capital ratio of 10.0 percent or greater,  a Tier 1 risk-based  capital ratio of
6.0 percent or greater,  and a leverage ratio of 5.0 percent or greater, and the
institution  must  not  be  subject  to an  order,  written  agreement,  capital
directive,  or prompt  corrective  action  directive  to meet  specific  capital
requirements.  An insured  institution is "adequately  capitalized"  if it has a
total  risk-based  capital ratio of 8.0 percent or greater,  a Tier 1 risk-based
capital ratio of 4.0 percent or greater,  and a leverage ratio of 4.0 percent or
greater  (or a leverage  ratio of 3.0 percent or greater if the  institution  is
rated composite 1 under the regulatory  rating system).  The final three capital
categories are levels of  undercapitalized,  which trigger  mandatory  statutory
provisions.  While  other  factors in addition to capital  ratios  determine  an
institution's  capital category,  State Street Bank's capital ratios were within
the "well-capitalized" category at December 31, 1994.

     The Federal  Reserve Board adopted a final rule, as required by the FDICIA,
prescribing  standards that will limit the risks posed by an insured  depository
institution's exposure to any other depository  institution.  Banks are required
to develop  written  policies and procedures to monitor credit exposure to other
banks,   and  to   limit  to  50%  and  25%  of  total   capital   exposure   to
"undercapitalized" banks in 1995 and 1996, respectively.

     As required by the FDICIA,  the FDIC adopted a regulation that permits only
well  capitalized  banks,  and adequately  capitalized  banks that have received
waivers  from  the  FDIC,  to  accept,  renew  or  rollover  brokered  deposits.
Regulations have also been adopted by the FDIC to limit the activities conducted
as a principal by, and the equity investments of, state-chartered banks to those
permitted  for  national  banks.  Banks  may apply to the FDIC for  approval  to
continue to engage in excepted investments and activities.

     Other FDICIA regulations adopted require independent audits, an independent
audit  committee of the bank's board of directors,  stricter  truth-  in-savings
provisions,  and standards for real estate  lending.  The FDICIA amended deposit
insurance  coverage and the FDIC has implemented a rule specifying the treatment
of accounts to be insured up to $100,000.

     Under  other  provisions  of FDICIA,  the  federal  banking  agencies  have
proposed  safety  and  soundness  standards  for  banks  in a  number  of  areas
including:  internal  controls,  internal  audit systems,  information  systems,
credit  underwriting,  interest rate risk,  executive  compensation  and minimum
earnings.  The agencies have also proposed  rules to revise  risk-based  capital
standards to take account of interest rate risk, as required by FDICIA.

     FDICIA and related  regulations  may result in higher costs for the banking
industry in terms of costs of compliance and recordkeeping.

     Legislation  enacted as part of the Omnibus  Budget  Reconciliation  Act of
1993   provides  that   deposits  in  U.S.   offices  and  certain   claims  for
administrative  expenses  and  employee  compensation  against  a  U.S.  insured
depository  institution  which has failed will be afforded a priority over other
general  unsecured  claims,  including  deposits in non-U.S.  offices and claims
under  non-depository  contracts in all offices,  against such an institution in
the  "liquidation of other  resolution" of such and institution by any receiver.
Accordingly, such priority creditors (including FDIC, as the subrogee of insured
depositors)  of State  Street Bank will be entitled to priority  over  unsecured
creditors  in  the  event  of  a  "liquidation  or  other  resolution"  of  such
institution.

DIVIDENDS
     As a bank holding  company,  State  Street is a legal  entity  separate and
distinct  from State  Street  Bank and its other  non-bank  subsidiaries.  State
Street's  principal  source of cash revenues is dividends from State Street Bank
and its other non-bank subsidiaries. The right of State Street to participate as
a stockholder in any distribution of assets of a subsidiary upon its liquidation
or  reorganization  or  otherwise is subject to the prior claims by creditors of
the subsidiary, including obligations for federal funds purchased and securities
sold under repurchase  agreements,  as well as deposit  liabilities.  Payment of
dividends by State  Street Bank is subject to  provisions  of the  Massachusetts
banking  law  which  provides  that  dividends  may be paid  out of net  profits
provided (i) capital  stock and surplus  remain  unimpaired,  (ii)  dividend and
retirement fund requirements of any preferred stock have been met, (iii) surplus
equals or exceeds  capital  stock,  and (iv) there are deducted from net profits
any  losses  and bad  debts,  as  defined,  in excess of  reserves  specifically
established  therefor.  Under the Federal Reserve Act, the approval of the Board
of  Governors  of the Federal  Reserve  System  would be  required if  dividends
declared  by the Bank in any year would  exceed the total of its net profits for
that year combined  with retained net profits for the preceding two years,  less
any  required  transfers  to  surplus.  Under  applicable  federal and state law
restrictions,  at December  31, 1994 State  Street Bank could have  declared and
paid dividends of  $426,554,000  without  regulatory  approval.  Future dividend
payments of the Bank and  non-bank  subsidiaries  cannot be  determined  at this
time.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES
     Economic  policies  of  the  government  and  its  agencies  influence  the
operating environment of State Street.  Monetary policy conducted by the Federal
Reserve Board  directly  affects the level of interest  rates and overall credit
conditions of the economy.  Policy  instruments  utilized by the Federal Reserve
Board include open market operations in U.S. Government  securities,  changes in
reserve  requirements for depository  institutions,  and changes in the discount
rate and availability of borrowing from the Federal Reserve.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

     State Street's  headquarters are located in the State Street Bank Building,
a 34-story  building at 225 Franklin Street,  Boston,  Massachusetts,  which was
completed in 1965.  State Street leases  approximately  451,000  square feet (or
approximately 49% of the space in this building) for a 30-year initial term with
two successive  extension  options of 20 years each at rentals to be negotiated.
State Street  exercised the first of the two (2) options which will be effective
on January 1, 1996 for a term of 20 years.

     State Street owns five buildings located in Quincy, Massachusetts, a suburb
of Boston. Four of the buildings,  containing a total of approximately 1,365,000
square feet, function as State Street Bank's operations facilities. State Street
Bank occupies  approximately  1,320,000  square feet and subleases the remaining
space.  The  fifth  building,  with  186,000  square  feet,  is leased to Boston
Financial Data Services, Inc., a 50% owned affiliate. Additionally, State Street
owns a 98,000 square foot building in  Westborough,  Massachusetts  for use as a
second data center.

     The remaining  offices and facilities of State Street and its  subsidiaries
are leased. As of December 31, 1994, the aggregate  mortgage and lease payments,
net of sublease revenue,  payable within one year amounted to $29,066,000,  plus
assessments for real estate tax, cleaning and operating escalations.

Financial Statements.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     State Street is subject to pending and threatened  legal actions that arise
in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, after discussion
with counsel,  these can be successfully defended or resolved without a material
adverse effect on State Street's financial position or results of operations.
