FACTORS
  AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS

From time to time,
  information provided by State Street, statements made by its employees, or
  information included in its filings with the SEC (including this Form 10-K), may contain statements that are
  considered “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of U.S. federal
  securities laws, including statements about the Corporation’s confidence and
  strategies and its expectations about revenue and market growth, acquisitions
  and divestitures, new technologies, services and opportunities, and earnings.
  These statements may be identified by such forward looking terminology as
  “expect,” “look,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “may,” “will,” or similar
  statements or variations of such terms. These forward-looking statements
  involve certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to
  differ materially. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are
  not limited to, the factors appearing in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s
  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation”
  under the caption “Financial Goals and Factors That May Affect Them,” factors
  further described in conjunction with the forward-looking information, and
  factors elsewhere mentioned in this Form 10-K. Each of these factors, and
  others, are also discussed from time to time in the Corporation’s other
  filings with the SEC, including its reports on
  Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. The forward-looking statements contained in this Form
  10-K speak only as of the time the statements were made, and the Corporation
  does not undertake to revise those forward-looking statements to reflect
  events after the date of this report.


(1)

Net interest margin is
  taxable-equivalent net interest revenue divided by average interest-earning
  assets.

(2)

Interest revenue on
  non-taxable investment securities and leases includes the effect of
  taxable-equivalent adjustments, a method of presentation in which interest
  income on tax-exempt securities is adjusted to present the earnings
  performance on a basis equivalent to interest earned on fully taxable
  securities with a corresponding charge to income tax expense. The adjustment
  is computed using a federal income tax rate of 35%, adjusted for applicable
  state income taxes, net of the related federal tax benefit. The taxable-equivalent adjustments included in interest revenue above were $51 million,
  $61 million and $67 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
  2001, respectively.


The table below summarizes
  changes in taxable-equivalent interest revenue and interest expense due to
  changes in volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
  liabilities, and changes in interest rates. Changes attributed to both
  volumes and rates have been allocated based on the proportion of change in
  each category.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

Investment securities
  consisted of the following as of December 31:


The maturities of debt
  investment securities as of December 31, 2003, and the weighted average
  taxable-equivalent yields were as follows:

(1)

Yields calculated for
  interest revenue on non-taxable investment securities includes the effect of
  taxable-equivalent adjustments, a method of presentation in which interest
  income on tax-exempt securities is adjusted to present the earnings
  performance on a basis equivalent to interest earned on fully taxable
  securities with a corresponding charge to income tax expense. The adjustment
  is computed using a federal income tax rate of 35%, adjusted for applicable
  state income taxes, net of the related federal tax benefit. The taxable
  equivalent adjustment included in interest revenue to calculate the yields
  above was $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

LOAN PORTFOLIO

U.S. and non-U.S. loans as
  of December 31, and average loans outstanding for the years ended December
  31, were as follows:

At December 31, 2003, 6% of
  State Street’s assets comprised loans. State Street’s loan policies limit the
  size of individual loan exposures to reduce risk through diversification.
  Loans are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the appropriateness
  of originating or renewing each loan. State Street does not have a general
  rollover


policy. Unearned revenue
  included in leases was $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion for non-U.S. leases, and
  $123 million and $140 million for U.S. leases, as of December 31, 2003 and
  2002, respectively.

Loan maturities for
  selected loan categories as of December 31, 2003, were as follows:

EXECUTIVE
  OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

The following table sets
  forth certain information with regard to each executive officer of State
  Street. As used herein, the term “executive officer” corresponds to those

  elected to hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until
  their respective successors are chosen and qualified. Other executive
  officers hold office at the discretion of the Board. There are no family
  relationships among any of the directors and executive officers of State
  Street. All of the executive officers have been officers of State Street for
  five years or more, with the exception of Mr. Resch.

ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY
  SECURITIES

State Street’s Board of
  Directors has authorized a publicly-announced stock purchase program for
  State Street Common Stock for use in employee benefit programs and for
  general corporate purposes. The program was first anounced in 1995 and has
  been increased several times, most recently in December 2001. As of December
  31, 2003, the number of shares purchased under the program aggregated
  20,567,000, and authorization for the purchase of an additional 8,320,000
  shares remained available for purchase under the program. Additionally,
  shares may be acquired by a consolidated trust for other deferred
  compensation plans, held by an external trustee, that are not part of the
  publicly-announced stock purchase program. These shares are purchased in
  open-market transactions by the trustee. There were no shares purchased by
  the trust in the quarter ended December 31, 2003. The following table
  discloses purchase of Common Stock and related information for the three
  months ended December 31, 2003:

ASSETS
  UNDER CUSTODY

At year-end 2003, total assets under custody
  were $9.4 trillion, including $2.1 trillion from the GSS business. This
  compares with $6.2 trillion a year earlier. The value of assets under custody
  is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served. Changes in
  the value of assets under custody do not result in proportional changes in
  revenue. State Street uses relationship pricing for clients who take
  advantage of multiple services. Many services are priced on factors other
  than asset values, including the mix of assets under custody, securities
  positions held, portfolio transactions, and types of products and services.
  Assets under custody at December 31 comprised the following:



Net interest revenue was
  $810 million in 2003, compared to $979 million in 2002, a decrease of $169
  million. Lower prevailing yields on assets, as maturing assets were
  reinvested at the lower market rates during 2003, more than offset lower
  liability costs. The excess of rates earned over rates paid decreased from
  1.26% in 2002 to 1.04% in 2003, on a taxable-equivalent basis.






>

COMPARISON
  OF 2002 VERSUS 2001












Loan commitments (unfunded
  loans and unused lines of credit), liquidity asset purchase agreements and
  standby letters of credit are issued to accommodate the financing needs of
  State Street’s clients and to provide liquidity and credit enhancements to
  variable interest entities. Loan commitments are agreements by State Street
  to lend monies at a future date. Liquidity asset purchase agreements are
  commitments to purchase receivables or securities, subject to conditions
  established in the agreements.



State Street has increased
  its quarterly dividend twice each year since 1978. Over the last ten years,
  dividends per share have grown at a 16% compound annual growth rate. At
  December 31, 2003, State Street Bank had $1.9 billion of retained earnings
  available for distribution to State Street in the form of dividends.

  carrying amount and accumulated amortization of other intangible assets as of
  December 31, were as follows:

The
  following table summarizes the weighted average remaining contractual life of
  stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2003:



(1)

State Street Bank must meet
  the regulatory designation of “well capitalized” in order to maintain State
  Street’s status as a financial holding company, including maintaining a
  minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio (Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted
  risk-weighted assets and market-risk equivalents) of 6%, a minimum total
  risk-based capital ratio (total capital divided by adjusted risk-weighted
  assets and market-risk equivalents) of 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio (Tier
  1 capital divided by quarterly average adjusted assets) of 5%. In addition,
  Regulation Y defines “well capitalized” for a bank holding company such as
  State Street for the purpose of determining eligibility for a streamlined
  review process for acquisition proposals. For such Regulation Y purposes,
  “well capitalized” requires State Street to maintain a minimum Tier 1
  risk-based capital ratio of 6% and a minimum total risk-based capital ratio
  of 10%.



The
  following is a summary of the results for lines of business:



No expenses were incurred prior to 2003 related to
  the VSP. No further expenses are expected to be incurred after 2003.
  Following is a rollforward of the restructuring accrual for the year ended
  December 31, 2003:

The restructuring costs were recorded at the time
  the accounting events and measurement date occurred. Severance costs included
  salaries and related benefits to be paid out over a defined period of up to
  two years. Pension costs will be paid out primarily in equal annual
  installments over a five-year period. Stock compensation expense was
  attributable to the modification of various stock options and restricted and
  deferred stock awards for individuals who accepted the VSP (see Note 1).
  Other restructuring costs include outplacement services associated with the
  termination of employees and professional and actuarial fees incurred. It is
  expected that a majority of accrued costs will be paid by June 30, 2004.

In April 2002, State Street incurred $20 million of
  expenses related to cost control efforts through the elimination of
  positions, all of which was paid during the year ended December 31, 2002.
  These expenses have been reclassified as restructuring costs in the
  Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2002
  included herein.





In connection with the VSP (see Note 16), State
  Street recorded approximately $80 million during the year ended December 31,
  2003 for enhanced pension benefits.


Current and deferred income taxes for 2002 and 2001
  have been reclassified to reflect tax returns as actually filed. The income
  tax expense related to net realized securities gains was $9 million, $31
  million and $17 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Pre-tax income
  attributable to operations located outside the United States was $176
  million, $147 million and $201 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In 2003, State Street recorded a one-time, after tax
  charge of $12 million representing settlement of a REIT-related tax matter
  with the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. The tax rate for the year ended
  December 31, 2003 was 34.0% excluding the impact of the REIT settlement and
  35.1% if the REIT settlement is included.


Significant components of the deferred tax
  liabilities and assets at December 31 were as follows:

(1)

The adjustment for the non-operating item reported
  in 2003 is the result of the increase in the effective tax rate for a state
  tax matter that was settled. The 2002 adjustment includes the increase in the
  effective tax rate resulting from the gain on the sale of State Street’s
  Corporate Trust business. In 2001, the adjustment includes the decrease in
  the effective tax rate for the write-off of State Street’s investment in
  Bridge.

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is conducting
  an examination of State Street’s federal income tax returns for the years
  ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the
  IRS issued Notices of Proposed Adjustment for these years with respect to
  State Street’s tax treatment of several lease-in, lease-out transactions. The
  proposed adjustments relate to the timing of the recognition of income and
  expense for tax purposes; for financial reporting purposes, deferred taxes
  have been provided. State Street believes that its tax return reporting of
  these transactions was consistent with applicable tax law and intends to
  defend its position.



In connection with its interest rate risk management
  strategies, State Street has executed interest rate swap agreements with a
  notional value of $2.6 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2003 and
  2002, respectively, designated as fair value hedges to hedge the changes in
  the fair value of certain securities. For the years ended December 31, 2003,
  2002 and 2001, State Street recognized net pre-tax losses of approximately $5
  million, $5 million and $2 million, respectively, which represented the
  ineffective portion of the hedge, reported in processing fees and other
  revenue.


Foreign exchange trading revenue related to foreign
  exchange contracts was $330 million, $300 million and $368 million for the
  years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2003, State
  Street also recorded $61 million from Deutsche Bank as foreign exchange
  trading revenue. For other financial instrument contracts, there were losses
  of $31 million in 2003, $38 million in 2002 and $22 million in 2001 recorded
  in processing fees and other revenue. Future cash requirements, if any,
  related to foreign currency contracts are represented by the gross amount of
  currencies to be exchanged under each contract unless State Street and the counterparty
  have agreed to pay or receive the net contractual settlement amount on the
  settlement date. Future cash requirements on other financial instruments are
  limited to the net amounts payable under the agreements.
