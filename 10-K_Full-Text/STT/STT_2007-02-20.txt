ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

State Street Corporation is a financial holding
company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and
through its subsidiaries, provides a full range of products and services for
institutional investors worldwide. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the
context requires otherwise, all references in this Form 10-K to “State
Street,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar terms mean State Street Corporation and
its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The parent company is a legal entity
separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, assisting those subsidiaries by
providing financial resources and management. At December 31, 2006, we had
total assets of $107.35 billion, total deposits of $65.65 billion, total
shareholders’ equity of $7.25 billion and employed 21,700. Our executive
offices are located at One Lincoln Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02111
(telephone (617) 786-3000).

We make available, without charge, on or through our
Internet website at

www.statestreet.com

all reports we electronically file with, or furnish to, the Securities and
Exchange Commission, or “SEC,” including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K,
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K,
as well as any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable
after those documents have been filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. These
documents are also accessible on the SEC’s website at

www.sec.gov

.
We have included the web addresses of State Street and the SEC as inactive
textual references only. Except as specifically incorporated by reference into
this Form 10-K, information on those websites is not part of this Form 10-K.

We have adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, as
well as written charters for the Executive Committee, the Examining and Audit
Committee, the Executive Compensation Committee, and the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, or “Board,” and a
Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, a Standard of Conduct for
Directors, and a Standard of Conduct for our employees. Each of these documents
is posted on our website, and each is available in print to any shareholder who
requests it by writing to the Office of the Secretary, State Street
Corporation, One Lincoln Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02111.

In February 2007, we
announced a definitive agreement to acquire Investors Financial Services Corp.,
or “Investors Financial,” a $12 billion bank holding company based in Boston.
Under the terms of the agreement, we will exchange .906 shares of our common
stock for each share of Investors Financial common stock. The transaction is
subject to customary conditions, including the approvals of Investors Financial
shareholders and regulatory agencies, and we expect to close the acquisition in
the third quarter of 2007. The acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase.
Additional information about this acquisition is included in “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
included in this Form 10-K under Item 7.

GENERAL

We were organized under the laws of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts in 1970 and we conduct our business primarily through our
principal bank subsidiary, State Street Bank and Trust Company, which we refer
to in this Form 10-K as “State Street Bank” or “the Bank.” State
Street Bank traces its beginnings to the founding of the Union Bank in 1792.
The charter under which State Street Bank now operates was authorized by a
special act of the Massachusetts Legislature in 1891, and its present name was
adopted in 1960.

With $11.85 trillion of
assets under custody and $1.75 trillion of assets under management at year-end
2006, we are a leading specialist in meeting the needs of institutional
investors worldwide. Our customers include mutual funds and other collective
investment funds, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies,
foundations, endowments and other investment pools, and investment managers.


Including
the United States, we operate in 26 countries and more than 100 geographic
markets worldwide. For a discussion of our business activities, refer to the “Lines
of Business” section that follows. For information about our management of
capital, liquidity, market risk, including interest-rate risk, and other risks
inherent in our businesses, refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” included under Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
Financial information with respect to our non-U.S. activities is included in
Note 23 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this Form 10-K
under Item 8 .

LINES OF BUSINESS

We report two lines of
business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management. These two lines of
business provide services to support institutional investors, including
custody, recordkeeping, daily pricing and administration, shareholder services,
foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services, securities finance,
deposit and short-term investment facilities, loan and lease financing, investment
manager and hedge fund manager operations outsourcing, performance, risk and
compliance analytics, investment research and investment management, including
passive and active U.S. and non-U.S. equity and fixed income strategies. For additional
information about our lines of business, see the “Line of Business Information”
section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis included under Item 7, and Note
22 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included under Item 8,
of this Form 10-K.

COMPETITION

We operate in a highly competitive environment in all
areas of our business worldwide. We face competition from other financial
services institutions, deposit-taking institutions, investment management
firms, insurance companies, mutual funds, broker/dealers, investment banking
firms, benefits consultants, leasing companies, and business service and
software companies. As we expand globally, we encounter additional sources of
competition.

We believe that there are certain key competitive
considerations in these markets. These considerations include, for investment
servicing, quality of service, economies of scale, technological expertise,
quality and scope of sales and marketing, and price; and for investment
management, expertise, experience, the availability of related service
offerings, and price.

Our competitive success
will depend upon our ability to develop and market new and innovative services,
to adopt or develop new technologies, to bring new services to market in a
timely fashion at competitive prices, to continue and expand our relationships
with existing customers and to attract new customers.

SUPERVISION AND
REGULATION

We are registered with the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, or “Federal Reserve Board,” as a bank holding company
pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or “the Act.” The
Act, with certain exceptions, limits the activities in which we and our
non-bank subsidiaries may engage, including non-bank companies for which we own
or control more than 5% of a class of voting shares, to those that the Federal
Reserve Board considers to be closely related to banking or managing or
controlling banks. The Federal Reserve Board may order a bank holding company
to terminate any activity or its ownership or control of a non-bank subsidiary
if the Federal Reserve Board finds that such activity, ownership or control
constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of a
bank subsidiary or is inconsistent with sound banking principles or statutory
purposes. In the opinion of management, all of our present subsidiaries operate
within the statutory standard or are otherwise permissible. The Act also
requires a bank holding company to obtain prior approval of the Federal


Reserve Board before it
may acquire substantially all the assets of any bank or ownership or control of
more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank.

The parent company elected to become a financial
holding company, which reduces to some extent the restrictions on our
activities. A financial holding company and the companies under its control are
permitted to engage in activities considered “financial in nature” as defined
by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and Federal Reserve Board interpretations, and
therefore may engage in a broader range of activities than permitted for bank
holding companies and their subsidiaries. Financial holding companies may
engage directly or indirectly in activities considered financial in nature,
either

de novo

or by acquisition, provided the
financial holding company gives the Federal Reserve Board after-the-fact notice
of the new activities. Activities defined to be financial in nature include,
but are not limited to, the following: providing financial or investment
advice; underwriting; dealing in or making markets in securities; merchant
banking, subject to significant limitations; and any activities previously
found by the Federal Reserve Board to be closely related to banking. In order
to maintain status as a financial holding company, each of a bank holding
company’s depository subsidiaries must be well capitalized and well managed, as
judged by regulators, and must comply with Community Reinvestment Act
obligations. Failure to maintain such standards may ultimately permit the
Federal Reserve Board to take certain enforcement actions against such company.

Many aspects of our
business are subject to regulation by other U.S. federal and state governmental
and regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations (including securities
exchanges), and by non-U.S. governmental and regulatory agencies and
self-regulatory organizations. Aspects of our public disclosure, corporate
governance principles and internal control systems are subject to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations and rules of the SEC
and the New York Stock Exchange.

Capital Adequacy

Like other bank holding companies, we are subject to
Federal Reserve Board minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratio guidelines.
State Street Bank is subject to similar risk-based capital and leverage ratio
guidelines. As of December 31, 2006, our capital levels on a consolidated
basis, and the capital levels of the Bank, exceeded the applicable minimum
capital requirements. Failure to meet capital requirements could subject us to
a variety of enforcement actions, including the termination of deposit
insurance of the Bank by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or “FDIC,”
and to certain restrictions on our business that are described further in this “Supervision
and Regulation” section.

For additional information
about our capital position and capital adequacy, refer to the “Capital” section
of Management’s Discussion and Analysis included under Item 7, and Note 14 of
the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included under Item 8, of this
Form 10-K.

Subsidiaries

The Federal Reserve Board is the primary federal
banking agency responsible for regulating us and our subsidiaries, including
State Street Bank, for both our U.S. and non-U.S. operations.

Our bank subsidiaries are subject to supervision and
examination by various regulatory authorities. State Street Bank is a member of
the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC and is subject to applicable federal
and state banking laws and to supervision and examination by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston, as well as by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks,
the FDIC, and the regulatory authorities of those countries in which a branch
of the Bank is located. Other subsidiary trust companies are subject to
supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
other offices of the Federal Reserve System or by the appropriate state banking
regulatory authorities of the states in which they are located. Our non-U.S.
bank subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the regulatory authorities of
the


countries in which they
are located. As of December 31, 2006, the capital of each of these banking
subsidiaries exceeded the minimum legal capital requirements as set by those
authorities.

The parent company and its non-bank subsidiaries are
affiliates of State Street Bank under federal banking laws, which impose
certain restrictions on transfers of funds in the form of loans, extensions of
credit, investments or asset purchases from the Bank to the parent and its
non-bank subsidiaries. Transfers of this kind to affiliates by State Street
Bank are limited with respect to each affiliate to 10% of the Bank’s capital
and surplus, as defined, and to 20% in the aggregate for all affiliates, and
are subject to certain collateral requirements. As a bank holding company, the
parent company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain
tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or lease or sale
of property or furnishing of services. Federal law also provides that certain
transactions with affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances,
including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as
favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable
transactions involving other non-affiliated companies or, in the absence of
comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit
standards, that in good faith would be offered to, or would apply to,
non-affiliated companies. The Federal Reserve Board has jurisdiction to
regulate the terms of certain debt issues of bank holding companies. Federal
law provides as well for a depositor preference on amounts realized from the
liquidation or other resolution of any depository institution insured by the
FDIC.

We are subject to the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which
contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and requires
implementation of regulations applicable to financial services companies,
including standards for verifying client identification and monitoring client
transactions and detecting and reporting suspicious activities. Anti-money
laundering laws outside the U.S. contain similar requirements.

Our investment management subsidiary is registered as
an investment adviser with the SEC. Our U.S. broker/dealer subsidiary is
registered as a broker/dealer with the SEC, is subject to regulation by the SEC
(including the SEC’s net capital rule) and is a member of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, a self-regulatory organization. Many aspects
of our investment management activities are subject to federal and state laws
and regulations primarily intended to benefit the investment holder. These laws
and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad
administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict us from
carrying on our investment management activities in the event that we fail to
comply with such laws and regulations, and examination authority. Our business
relating to investment management and trusteeship of collective trust funds and
separate accounts offered to employee benefit plans subject to ERISA is regulated
by the U.S. Department of Labor.

Our businesses, including our investment management
and securities and futures businesses, are also regulated extensively by
non-U.S. governments, securities exchanges, self-regulatory organizations,
central banks and regulatory bodies, especially in those jurisdictions in which
we maintain an office. For instance, the Financial Services Authority, the
London Stock Exchange, and the Euronext.liffe regulate activities in the United
Kingdom; the Deutsche Borse AG and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority
regulate activities in Germany; and the Financial Services Agency, the Bank of
Japan, the Japanese Securities Dealers Association and several Japanese
securities and futures exchanges, including the Tokyo Stock Exchange, regulate
activities in Japan. We have established policies, procedures, and systems
designed to comply with these requirements. However, as a global financial
services institution, we face complexity and costs in our worldwide compliance
efforts.

Most of our non-U.S. operations are conducted pursuant
to Federal Reserve Board Regulation K through State Street Bank’s Edge Act
corporation subsidiary or through international branches of the Bank. An Edge
Act corporation is a corporation organized under federal law that, in general,
conducts foreign business activities. With prior approval of the Federal
Reserve Board, State Street Bank may invest up to 20% of its capital and
surplus in Edge Act and Agreement corporation subsidiaries. An Agreement


corporation subsidiary is
a subsidiary organized under state law that operates as if it was organized
under federal law and is subject to Regulation K. Agreement corporation
subsidiaries are generally restricted to foreign banking operations. The Bank
has applied to renew its approval to invest 18% of its capital and surplus,
which is less than the maximum 20% permitted by law.

Historically, we generally have invested abroad
through our Edge Act corporation subsidiaries. However, under Federal Reserve
Board Regulation Y, we may continue to make new investments abroad directly
(through the parent company or through direct, non-bank subsidiaries of the
parent company) or through international bank branch expansion without being
subject to the 20% investment limitation for Edge Act corporation subsidiaries.
We cannot predict with certainty the impact of the Edge Act corporation
subsidiary investment limitation on the pace of our future international
expansion. Nonetheless, in light of available alternatives, we do not believe
that the Edge Act corporation subsidiary investment limitation will materially
limit our ability to expand internationally.

We are also subject to the
Massachusetts bank holding company statute. The Massachusetts statute requires
prior approval by the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation for our
acquisition of more than 5% of the voting shares of any additional bank and for
other forms of bank acquisitions.

Support of
Subsidiary Banks

Under Federal Reserve
Board guidelines, a bank holding company is required to act as a source of
financial and managerial strength to its bank subsidiaries. Under these
guidelines, the parent company is expected to commit resources to the Bank and
any other bank subsidiary in circumstances where it might not do so absent such
guidelines. In the event of our bankruptcy, any commitment by the parent
company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a bank subsidiary
will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and will be entitled to a priority
payment.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES

Economic policies of the U.S. government and its agencies
influence our operating environment. Monetary policy conducted by the Federal
Reserve Board directly affects the level of interest rates, which may impact
overall credit conditions of the economy. Policy is applied by the Federal
Reserve Board through open market operations in U.S. government securities,
changes in reserve requirements for depository institutions, and changes in the
discount rate and availability of borrowing from the Federal Reserve.
Government regulation of banks and bank holding companies is intended primarily
for the protection of depositors of the banks, rather than for the shareholders
of the institutions.

RISK
FACTORS

This Form 10-K contains statements (including,
without limitation, statements in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” included in this Form 10-K
under Item 7) that are considered “forward-looking statements” within the
meaning of U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, State Street and its
management may make other written or oral communications from time to time that
contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, including
statements as to industry trends, future expectations of State Street and other
matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts, are based on certain
assumptions by management, and are often identified by such forward-looking
terminology as “expect,” “look,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “seek,” “may,”
“will,” “trend,” “target” and “goal,” or similar statements or variations of
such terms. Forward-


looking statements may
include statements about State Street’s confidence in its strategies and its
expectations about revenue and market growth, acquisitions and divestitures,
new technologies, services and opportunities, and earnings.

Forward-looking
statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which change over
time, and are based on management’s expectations and assumptions at the time
the statements are made. These expectations and assumptions, and the continued
validity of the forward-looking statements, are subject to change due to a
broad range of factors affecting the national and global economies, the equity,
debt, currency and other financial markets, and factors specific to the parent
company and to the Bank. Factors that could cause changes in the expectations
or assumptions on which forward-looking statements are based include, but are
not limited to:

·

Economic
conditions and monetary and other governmental actions designed to address
those conditions;

·

The
performance and volatility of securities, currency and other markets in the
U.S. and internationally;

·

The
level and volatility of interest rates, particularly in the U.S. and Europe;

·

Our
ability to attract non-interest bearing deposits and other low-cost funds;

·

The
enactment of legislation, including tax legislation, and changes in regulation
and enforcement that impact State Street and its customers;

·

The
competitive environment in which we operate, including the willingness of our
competitors to reduce fees or add to their products and services to seek to
attract our customers, as well as our ability to cross-sell services to our
customers and to maintain service levels, technology and product offerings that
are sufficient to attract new customers and retain current customers;

·

Our
ability to continue to grow revenue, control expenses and attract the capital
necessary to achieve our business goals and comply with regulatory
requirements;

·

Our
ability to control systemic and operating risks;

·

Trends
in the globalization of investment activity and the growth on a worldwide basis
in financial assets;

·

Trends
in governmental and corporate pension plans and savings rates;

·

Changes
in accounting standards and practices, including changes in the interpretation
of existing standards, that impact our consolidated financial statements; and

·

Changes
in tax legislation and in the interpretation of existing tax laws by U.S. and
non-U.S. tax authorities that impact the amount of taxes due.

Forward-looking statements should not be viewed as
predictions, and should not be the primary basis upon which investors evaluate
State Street. Any investor in State Street should consider all risks and
uncertainties disclosed in this Form 10-K and in our other SEC
filings, including our reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K,
which are accessible on the SEC’s website at

www.sec.gov

or on our website at

www.statestreet.com.

In addition to factors
discussed above and elsewhere in this Form 10-K or previously
disclosed in our other SEC filings, the factors discussed below could cause
actual future results to differ materially from those contemplated by
forward-looking statements and from our historical financial results. State
Street undertakes no obligation to revise the forward-looking statements
contained in this Form 10-K to reflect events after the date it is
filed with the SEC. These factors are not intended to be a complete summary of


all
risks and uncertainties that may affect our businesses. Though we strive to
monitor and mitigate risk, we cannot anticipate all potential economic,
operational and financial developments that may adversely impact our operations
and our financial results.

Business
Conditions/Economic Risk

Our businesses are affected by global economic
conditions, political uncertainties and volatility and other developments in
the financial markets. Factors such as interest rates and commodities prices,
regional and international rates of economic growth, inflation, political
instability, the liquidity and volatility of equity, credit, currency,
derivative and other financial markets, and investor confidence can
significantly affect the financial markets in which we and our customers are
engaged. Such factors have affected, and may further unfavorably affect, both
regional and worldwide economic growth, creating adverse effects on many
companies, including us, in ways that are not predictable.

A significant market downturn may lead to a decline in
the value of assets under management and custody, which would reduce our
asset-based fee revenue and the value of securities we hold in our investment
portfolio, and may adversely impact transaction revenue and the volume of
transactions that we execute for our customers. In addition, lower market
volatility, even in a generally rising market environment, may reduce trading
volumes of our customers, and our ability to achieve attractive spreads, which
could lead to lower trading revenues. Our revenues, particularly our trading
revenues, may increase or decrease depending upon the extent of increases or
decreases in cross-border investments made by our customers. The level of
cross-border activity can be influenced by a number of factors, including
geopolitical instabilities and customer mix. General market downturns would
also likely lead to a decline in the volume of transactions we execute on
behalf of our customers, decreasing our fee and revenue opportunities and
reducing the level of assets under management and custody.

In addition, revenues during a calendar year, driven
by the products and services we provide, can fluctuate commensurate with normal
course business activity of our customers, typically resulting in stronger
revenues in the second and fourth quarters and relatively weaker revenues in
the first and third quarters.

In recent years,
investment manager and hedge fund manager operations outsourcing and non-U.S.
asset servicing have been areas of rapid growth in our business. If the demand
for these types of services were to decline, we could see a slowing in the
growth rate of our revenue.

Strategic/Competition
Risk

We expect the markets in which we operate to remain both
highly competitive and global across all facets of our business, resulting in
increases in both regional and global competitive risks. We have experienced,
and anticipate that we will continue to experience, pricing pressure in many of
our core businesses. Many of our businesses compete with other domestic and
international banks and financial services companies, such as custody banks, investment
advisors, broker/dealers, outsourcing companies and data processing companies. Many
of our competitors, including our competitors in core services, have
substantially greater capital resources. In some of our businesses, we are
service providers to significant competitors. The ability of a competitor to
offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price would likely
negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.  In addition, pricing pressures as a result of
the activities of competitors, customer pricing reviews and rebids, as well as
the introduction of new products, may result in a reduction in the prices we
can charge for our products and services.

Acquisitions of complementary businesses and
technologies, development of strategic alliances and divestitures of portions
of our business, in addition to fostering organic growth opportunities, are an
active part of our overall business strategy to remain competitive. We may not
be able to effectively assimilate


services, technologies,
key personnel or businesses of acquired companies into our business or service
offerings, alliances may not be successful, and related revenue growth or cost
savings may not be achieved. In addition, we may not be able to successfully
manage the divestiture of identified businesses on satisfactory terms, if at
all, which would reduce anticipated benefits to earnings. Ongoing consolidation
within the financial services industry could provide opportunities and pose
challenges in the markets we serve.

Acquisitions present risks that differ from the risks
associated with our ongoing operations. In January 2007, we announced a
definitive agreement to acquire Currenex, Inc., an independently owned
electronic foreign exchange trading platform. In addition, in
February 2007, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Investors
Financial. Our financial results for 2007 and for the next few years may be
significantly impacted by our ability to achieve the cost savings and other benefits
that we anticipate as a result of the acquisition of Investors Financial, as
well as our ability to retain its customer base and to successfully cross-sell
our products and services to its customers.

Intellectual property of an acquired business such as
Currenex may be an important component of the value that we agree to pay for
such a business; however, these types of acquisitions entail the risk that the
acquired business does not own the intellectual property that we believe we are
acquiring, that the intellectual property is dependent upon licenses from third
parties, or that the acquired business infringes upon the intellectual property
rights of others. Acquisitions of investment servicing businesses such as
Investors Financial normally entail information technology systems conversions,
which involve operational risks and may result in customer dissatisfaction and
defection. Customers of businesses that we acquire, including, in the case of
Investors Financial, its largest customer, are competitors of our non-custody
businesses. The loss of some of these customers or a significant reduction in
revenues generated from them, for competitive or other reasons, would adversely
affect the benefits that we expect to achieve from the acquisition.

In connection with most acquisitions, before the
acquisition can be completed, we must obtain various regulatory approvals or
consents, which approvals may include the Federal Reserve Board, the
Massachusetts Commissioner of Banking and other domestic and foreign regulatory
authorities. These regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the
completion of the acquisition or require changes to its terms. Although we
would not enter into a transaction anticipating materially adverse regulatory
conditions, such conditions may be imposed, or we may experience regulatory
delays that limit the benefits of the transaction.

With any acquisition, the integration of the
operations and resources of the two businesses could result in the loss of key
employees, the disruption of our and the acquired company’s ongoing businesses,
or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could
adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers,
and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.
Integration efforts may also divert management attention and resources. Where
we acquire a business and combine it with our operations, we are also exposed
to risks of unknown or contingent liabilities as to which we may have no
recourse against the seller. While we normally seek to mitigate that risk
through pre-acquisition due diligence, increasingly acquisition transactions
are competitive auctions in which we have limited time and access to
information to evaluate the risks inherent in the business being acquired, and
no or limited recourse against the seller if undisclosed liabilities are
discovered after we enter into a definitive agreement.

Our financial results may be adversely affected by the
accounting treatment for an acquisition. 
We may not achieve the benefits we sought in an acquisition, or, if
achieved, those benefits may come later than we anticipated. Failure to achieve
anticipated benefits from an acquisition, such as our acquisitions of Investors
Financial and Currenex, could result in increased costs and lower revenues than
expected of the combined company.


We actively strive to achieve significant cost savings
by shifting certain business processes to lower-cost geographic locations,
while continuing to maintain service quality, control and effective management
of risks within these business operations. This transition to a true “shared
services” operational model focuses on certain core service offerings,
including middle- and back-office reconciliations, securities processing and
transfer agency activities. The increased elements of risk that arise from
conducting certain operating processes in some jurisdictions could lead to an
increase in reputation risk. Reputation risk is inherent in our current
operating model; shifting business processes merely accentuates these risks
through the transition process, until such time as technology, training and
infrastructure changes are in place to mitigate the risk. The extent and pace
at which we are able to move functions to lower-cost locations may also be impacted
by regulatory and customer acceptance issues. Such relocation of functions also
entails costs, such as technology and real estate expenses, that partially
offset the financial benefits of the lower-cost locations.

Our financial performance depends, in part, on our
ability to develop and market new and innovative services and to adopt or
develop new technologies that differentiate our products or provide cost
efficiencies, while avoiding increased related expenses. The risks we face
include rapid technological change in the industry, our ability to access
technical and other information from our customers, and the significant and
ongoing investments required to bring new products and services to market in a
timely fashion at competitive prices. We proactively cross-sell multiple
products and services to our customers, which can exacerbate the negative
financial effects associated with the risk of loss of any one customer.
Developments in the securities processing industry, including shortened
settlement cycles and straight-through processing, have required continued
internal procedural enhancements and further technology investment.

Our growth strategy
depends upon both attracting new customers and cross-selling additional
products and services to our existing customer base. To the extent that we are
not able to achieve these goals, we may not be able to achieve our financial
goals. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with the
introduction of new products and services, including technical and control
requirements that may need to be developed and implemented to offer such
products while also managing associated risks. The introduction of new products
and services can also entail significant time and resources. Regulatory and
internal control requirements, capital requirements, competitive alternatives
and shifting market preferences may also determine if such initiatives can be
brought to market in a manner that is timely and attractive to our customers. Failure
to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new
products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, as
well as our results of operations and financial condition.

Credit Risk

Our focus on large
institutional investors and their businesses requires that we assume credit and
counterparty risk, both on- and off-balance sheet, in a variety of forms. We
may experience significant intra- and inter-day credit exposure through
settlement-related extensions of credit. From time to time, we may assume
concentrated credit risk at the individual counterparty, industry and/or
country level, thereby potentially exposing us to a single market or political
event or a correlated set of events. The credit quality of our on- and
off-balance sheet exposures may be affected by many factors, such as economic
and business conditions or deterioration in the financial condition of an
individual counterparty or group of counterparties. If there is a significant
economic downturn in either a country or a region, or we experience the failure
of a significant individual counterparty, we could incur financial losses that
could adversely affect our earnings.


Financial Markets
Risk

As asset values in worldwide financial markets
increase or decrease, our opportunities to invest in and service financial
assets change. Given that a portion of our fees is based on the value of assets
under custody and management, fluctuations in the valuation of worldwide
securities markets will affect revenue. Many of the costs of providing our
services are relatively fixed; therefore, a decline in revenue could have a
disproportionate effect on our earnings. In addition, if investment performance
in our asset management business fails to meet either benchmarks or the
performance of our competitors, we could experience a decline in assets under
management and a reduction in the fees we earn, irrespective of economic or
market conditions.

We have increased the portion of our management fee
revenue that is generated from enhanced index and actively managed products,
with respect to which we receive higher fees compared to passive products. We
may not be able to continue to increase this segment of our business at the
same rate that we have achieved in the past few years. In addition, with
respect to certain of these products, we have entered into performance fee
arrangements, where the management fee revenue we earn is based on the
performance of managed funds against specified benchmarks. The reliance on performance
fees increases the potential volatility of our management fee revenue.

The degree of volatility
in foreign exchange rates can affect our foreign exchange trading revenue. In
general, we benefit from currency volatility, although it can increase risk,
and foreign exchange revenue, all other things being equal, is likely to
decrease during times of decreased currency volatility. In addition, as our
business grows globally, our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange
rates could affect our levels of revenue, expense and earnings, as well as the
value of our investment in our non-U.S. operations. Our other financial markets
trading businesses, as well as our asset and liability management activities,
are also subject to market risks. Adverse movements in levels and volatilities
of financial markets could cause losses that may affect our consolidated
results of operations and financial condition.

Liquidity Risk

We depend on access to
global capital markets to provide us with sufficient capital resources and
liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, and to accommodate the
transaction and cash management needs of our customers. Any occurrence that may
limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of
debt purchasers, depositors or counterparties participating in the capital
markets with us in particular, or a downgrade of our debt rating, may adversely
affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our
liquidity. General market disruptions, natural disasters or operational
problems may affect either third parties or us, and can also have an adverse
affect on our liquidity.

Interest Rate Risk

State Street’s financial performance could be
unfavorably affected by changes in interest rates as they impact our asset and
liability management process. The levels of global market interest rates, the
shape of these yield curves (changes in the relationship between short- and
long-term interest rates), the direction and speed of interest rate changes,
and the asset and liability spreads relative to the currency and geographic mix
of our interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, affect our net
interest revenue. Our ability to anticipate these changes and/or to hedge the
related exposures on and off our balance sheet can significantly influence the
success of our asset and liability management process and the resulting level
of our net interest revenue. The impact of changes in interest rates will
depend on the relative durations of assets and liabilities in accordance with
their relevant currencies. In general, sustained lower interest rates, a flat or
inverted yield curve and narrow interest-rate spreads have a constraining
effect on our net interest revenue.


Operational Risk

Operational risk is inherent in all of State Street’s
activities. Our customers have a broad array of complex and specialized
servicing, confidentiality and fiduciary requirements. We have established
policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulatory and
operational risk requirements. We also face the potential for loss resulting
from inadequate or failed internal processes, employee supervisory or
monitoring mechanisms, or other systems or controls, and from external events,
which could materially affect our future results of operations. We may also be
subject to disruptions from events that are wholly or partially beyond our
control, which could cause delays or disruptions to operational functions,
including functions such as information processing and financial market
settlement. In addition, our customers, vendors and counterparties could suffer
from such events. Should these events affect us, or the customers, vendors or
counterparties with which we conduct business, our results of operations could
be negatively affected. We use various strategies and processes to monitor and
mitigate operational and other risks. These risk management measures entail
many assumptions regarding events that are not possible to predict. As a
result, our risk management framework may not always be successful.

Our

success
depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people.
Competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be
intense, and we may not be able to hire people or retain them. The unexpected
loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material
adverse impact on our business because of their skills, their knowledge of our
markets, their years of industry experience, in some cases, and the difficulty
of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.  In some of our businesses, we have
experienced significant employee turnover, which increases costs, requires
additional training and increases the potential for operational risks.

We enter into long-term fixed price contracts to
provide middle office or investment manager and hedge fund manager operations
outsourcing services to customers, services related but not limited to certain
trading activities, cash reporting, settlement and reconciliation activities,
collateral management and information technology development. These long-term
contracts require considerable up-front investment by us, including technology
and conversion costs, and carry the risk that pricing for the products and
services we provide might not prove adequate to generate expected operating
margins over the term of the contracts. Profitability of these contracts is
largely a function of our ability to accurately calculate pricing for our
services and our ability to control our costs and maintain the relationship
with the customer for an adequate period of time to recover our up-front
investment. Performance risk exists in each contract, given our dependence on
successful conversion and implementation onto our own operating platforms of
the service activities provided. In addition, our failure to meet specified
service levels may adversely affect our revenue from such arrangements, or
permit early termination of the contracts by the customer.

Our businesses depend on an information technology
infrastructure to record and process a large volume of increasingly complex
transactions, in many currencies, on a daily basis, across numerous and diverse
markets. Any interruptions, delays and/or breakdowns of this infrastructure can
result in significant costs. As a result, we continue to invest significantly
in this infrastructure.

Regulatory/Legal/Accounting/Tax
Risk

Most of our businesses are subject to extensive
regulation, and many of the customers to which we provide services are
themselves subject to a broad range of regulatory requirements. These
regulations may affect the manner and terms of delivery of our services. As a
financial institution with substantial international operations, we are subject
to extensive regulatory and supervisory oversight, both in the U.S. and
overseas in connection with our global operations. Our businesses are subject
to stringent regulation and examination by U.S. federal and state governmental
and regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the SEC and the
Massachusetts Commissioner of Banking, 
and self-regulatory organizations (including securities exchanges), and
by non-U.S. governmental and regulatory agencies and self-


regulatory organizations. The
regulations affect, among other things, the scope of our activities and
customer services, our capital structure and our ability to fund the operations
of our subsidiaries, our lending practices, our dividend policy and the manner
in which we market our services. Evolving regulations, such as the new Basel II
capital framework and anti-money laundering regulations, can require
significant effort on our part to ensure compliance. New or modified
regulations and related regulatory guidance may have unforeseen or unintended
adverse effects on the financial services industry.

If we do not comply with governmental regulations, we
may be subject to fines, penalties or material restrictions on our businesses
in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred, which can adversely affect
our business operations and, in turn, our financial results. Similarly, many of
our customers are subject to significant regulatory requirements, and retain
our services in order for us to assist them in complying with those legal
requirements. Changes in these regulations can significantly affect the
services that we are asked to provide, as well as our costs. If we cause a
customer to fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, we may be liable
to them for losses and expenses that they incur. In addition, adverse publicity
and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to
comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could affect our
ability to attract and retain customers or to maintain access to capital
markets, or could result in enforcement actions, fines, penalties and lawsuits.

In
recent years, regulatory oversight and enforcement has increased substantially,
imposing additional costs and increasing the potential risks associated with
our operations. If this regulatory trend continues, it could adversely affect
our operations and, in turn, our financial results.

From time to time, our customers may make claims and
take legal action pertaining to our performance of fiduciary or contractual
responsibilities. If such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner
favorable to us, such claims may result in financial liability to us and/or
adversely affect the market perception of State Street and its products and
services, and could impact customer demand for our products and services.  We record balance sheet reserves for such
known and unknown loss contingencies, including litigation and operational
losses; however, we cannot always estimate the ultimate outcome, and as a
result the adequacy of these reserves to cover any settlements or judgments
into which State Street ultimately enters or to which we are subject.

New accounting requirements, or changes in the
interpretation of existing accounting requirements, by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, the SEC, and bank regulators can potentially affect our consolidated
financial condition and results of operations, as accounting rules in the
U.S. and other jurisdictions consistently evolve to reflect the increasing
complexities of business. These changes are very difficult to predict, and can
materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results
of operations and other financial information. In some cases, we could be
required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the revised
treatment of certain transactions or activities, and, in some cases, the restatement
of prior period financial statements.

Our businesses are subject
to changes in tax legislation, and the interpretation of existing tax laws
worldwide. These legislative actions may impact our business directly or
indirectly through their impact on the financial markets. In the normal course
of business, we are subject to reviews by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities
regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews may result in adjustments to
the timing or amount of taxes due and the allocation of taxable income among
tax jurisdictions. While such changes may or may not have an economic impact on
our business, these changes could affect the attainment of our current
financial goals.

PROPERTIES

Our headquarters is located at State Street Financial
Center, One Lincoln Street, Boston, Massachusetts, a 36-story office
building. We have leased the entire 1,025,000 square feet of this building, as
well as the entire 366,000-square-foot parking garage at One Lincoln
Street, under 20-year non-cancelable capital leases. A portion of the
lease payments is offset by a sublease for 160,000 square feet of the building.

We occupy two buildings located in Quincy, Massachusetts,
one of which we own and the other we lease. The buildings, containing a total
of approximately 822,000 square feet, function as State Street Bank’s principal
operations facilities. Additionally, we own a 92,000-square-foot building
in Westborough, Massachusetts, and a 138,000-square-foot building in
Grafton, Massachusetts, each of which is used as a data center. Our remaining

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

We are broadly involved
with the securities industry worldwide, including the mutual fund industry.
Securities industry practices and the mutual fund industry in the U.S. continue
to be the subject of intense regulatory, governmental and public scrutiny. In
that regard, we have received various industry-related regulatory, governmental
and law enforcement inquiries and subpoenas relating to our activities and the
activities of our mutual fund customers. We continue to respond to these
regulatory, governmental and law enforcement inquiries and subpoenas in the
normal course of business. We are also involved in various legal proceedings
that arise in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management,
after discussion with counsel, these regulatory, governmental and law
enforcement inquiries and subpoenas, and legal proceedings can be successfully
defended or resolved without a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

MARKET
FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED

STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

MARKET FOR
REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY

Our Common Stock is listed on the New York and Boston
Stock Exchanges under the ticker symbol STT. There were 4,586 shareholders of
record at December 31, 2006. Information concerning the market prices of,
and dividends on, our common stock during the past two years is included in
this Form 10-K under Item 8, under the caption “Quarterly Summarized
Financial Information.”

In February 2005, our Board authorized the
purchase of up to 15 million shares of our common stock for general corporate
purposes, including mitigation of the dilutive impact of shares issued under
employee benefit programs, and canceled a program authorized in 1995. In March 2006,
the Board cancelled the remaining 2005 authorization and authorized a new
program for the purchase of up to 15 million of our common shares for the
same purposes.

During the first quarter
of 2006, we purchased 3 million shares of our common stock under the 2005
program. Under the 2006 program, we purchased 2.8 million shares of our common
stock during the first six months of 2006, and no common shares were purchased
by us during the third and fourth quarters of 2006. As of December 31,
2006, 12.2 million shares remained available for purchase under the 2006
program. We employ third-party broker-dealers to acquire shares on the open
market for our publicly announced stock purchase program.

RELATED STOCKHOLDER
MATTERS

As a bank holding company, the parent company is a
legal entity separate and distinct from its principal banking subsidiary, State
Street Bank, and its non-bank subsidiaries. The right of the parent company to
participate as a shareholder in any distribution of assets of State Street Bank
upon its liquidation, reorganization or otherwise is subject to the prior
claims by creditors of State Street Bank, including obligations for federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements and deposit liabilities.
Payment of dividends by State Street Bank is subject to the provisions of Massachusetts
banking law, which provide that dividends may be paid out of net profits
provided (i) capital stock and surplus remain unimpaired, (ii) dividend
and retirement fund requirements of any preferred stock have been met, (iii) surplus
equals or exceeds capital stock, and (iv) losses and bad debts, as
defined, in excess of reserves specifically established for such losses and bad
debts, have been deducted from net profits.

Under the Federal Reserve
Act, the approval of the Federal Reserve Board would be required if dividends
declared by State Street Bank in any year exceeded the total of its net profits
for that year combined with retained net profits for the preceding two years,
less any required transfers to surplus. Information about dividends from our
subsidiary banks is in Note 14 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” included in this Form 10-K under Item 8. Future dividend
payments of State Street Bank and other non-bank subsidiaries cannot be
determined at this time.


SHAREHOLDER RETURN
PERFORMANCE PRESENTATION

The graph presented

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS

GENERAL

State Street Corporation is a financial holding
company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Unless
otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in
this Management’s Discussion to “State Street,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar
terms mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis. At December 31, 2006, we had total assets of $107.35 billion, total
deposits of $65.65 billion, total shareholders’ equity of $7.25 billion and
employed 21,700. With $11.85 trillion of assets under custody and $1.75
trillion of assets under management at year-end 2006, we are a leading
specialist in meeting the needs of institutional investors worldwide.

In February 2007, we announced a definitive
agreement to acquire Investors Financial Services Corp., or “Investors
Financial,” a $12 billion bank holding company based in Boston. Under the terms
of the agreement, we will exchange .906 shares of our common stock for each
share of Investors Financial common stock. The transaction is subject to customary
conditions, including the approvals of Investors Financial shareholders and regulatory
agencies, and we expect to close the acquisition in the third quarter of 2007.
We cannot be certain that approvals of Investors Financial shareholders or the
regulators will be obtained.

The acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase. The
acquisition agreement contains certain termination rights for both State Street
and Investors Financial, and further provides that, if the agreement is
terminated under specified circumstances, Investors Financial will be required
to pay State Street a termination fee of up to $165 million.

We report two lines of business: Investment Servicing
and Investment Management. These lines of business provide a full range of
products and services for our customers, which include mutual funds and other
collective investment funds, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance
companies, foundations, endowments and other investment pools, and investment
managers. Investment Servicing provides services to support institutional
investors, such as custody, product- and participant-level accounting, daily
pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; recordkeeping;
shareholder services, including mutual fund and collective investment fund
shareholder accounting; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services;
securities finance; deposit and short-term investment facilities; loans and
lease financing; investment manager and hedge fund manager operations
outsourcing; and performance, risk and compliance analytics. Investment
Management provides a broad array of services for managing financial assets,
such as investment research services and investment management, including
passive and active U.S. and non-U.S. equity and fixed income strategies. For
additional information about our lines of business, see the “Line of Business
Information” section of this Management’s Discussion and Note 22 of the “Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this Form 10-K under
Item 8.

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis is part of
our Annual Report on Form 10-K to the SEC, and should be read in
conjunction with the “Consolidated Financial Statements” and the related “Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements,” included in this Form 10-K
under Item 8. Certain previously reported amounts presented have been
reclassified to conform to current period classifications. We prepare our
consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the U.S. or “GAAP.” The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions in the application of certain accounting policies that materially
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Estimates
that require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective or
complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods
are discussed in more depth in the “Significant Accounting Estimates” section
of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.


This Management’s Discussion
and Analysis contains statements that are considered “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws. Forward-looking
statements are based on our current expectations about revenue and market
growth, acquisitions and divestitures, new technologies, services and
opportunities, earnings and other factors. These forward-looking statements
involve certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to
differ materially. We undertake no obligation to revise the forward-looking
statements contained in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis to reflect
events after the date we file this Form 10-K with the SEC. Additional
information about forward-looking statements and related risks and
uncertainties is included in this Form 10-K under Item 1A.

Summary

Our financial
results for 2006 reflect our overall objectives of consistent revenue growth,
balancing expense growth with growth in revenue and continuing to expand our
business overseas. The highlights are as follows:

·

Each
category of revenue, as reported in our consolidated statement of income,
increased in double digits compared to 2005, with the exception of processing
fees and other revenue.

·

We
achieved positive operating leverage for 2006 compared to 2005.

·

Our
Investment Management business, State Street Global Advisors, or “SSgA,”
increased its contribution to our consolidated results of operations to
approximately 19% of consolidated total revenue and approximately 24% of
consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2006,
compared to 18% and 21%, respectively, for 2005.


·

We
grew the proportion of our non-U.S. revenue to approximately 43% of
consolidated total revenue, from approximately 39% for 2005.

·

We
ended 2006 with record levels of assets under custody and assets under
management.

·

We
exceeded our operating-basis financial goals for 2006 concerning growth in
total revenue, growth in earnings per share from continuing operations and
return on shareholders’ equity from continuing operations, all compared to
2005.

Our financial results for
2006 are summarized in the following “Financial Highlights” section, followed
by a more detailed discussion in the “Consolidated Results of Operations”
section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

Financial Highlights

For 2006, we recorded
income from continuing operations of $1.1 billion, or $3.26 per diluted share,
a 16% increase from $945 million, or $2.82 per diluted share, for 2005. Total
revenue increased 15% from 2005, and return on equity from continuing
operations was 16.2%.

Overall results for 2006
included net income from discontinued operations of $10 million (pre-tax income
of $16 million reduced by related tax expense of $6 million), or $.03 per
share, the result of the finalization of certain legal, selling and other costs
recorded in connection with our divestiture of Bel Air Investment Advisors LLC.
Our results for 2005 included a net loss from discontinued operations of $107 million
($165 million charge reduced by related tax benefit of $58 million), related to
our commitment to divest Bel Air.

Total revenue for 2006
grew 15% from 2005, with about three-quarters of the growth generated from
existing customers. Total fee revenue for 2006, which grew 14%, reflected
consistent growth throughout the year in servicing and management fees, up 10%
and 26%, respectively, compared to 2005. Generally, servicing fees benefited
from our continued expansion overseas and our cross-selling of services to our
broad customer base, while management fees benefited from the strategic
introduction of quantitative active products, which provide higher-margin
revenue. Trading services revenue, which benefited from strong capital markets
in the first half of 2006, grew 24% year over year. Securities finance revenue,
which peaked in the second quarter and declined in the third quarter as a
result of seasonality, benefited from increases in volumes of securities loaned,
and for the full year increased 17% from 2005. We continued to cross-sell our
existing customer relationships and to introduce new products and services to
existing and new customers.

Net interest revenue
increased 22% compared to 2005, and net interest margin increased to 1.25% from
1.08%. This growth was the result of several favorable trends—(1) the
balance sheet repositioning we began to execute in late 2004; (2) higher
yields on the re-investment of securities as they matured; (3) growth in
our average balance sheet due to increased customer activity; (4) a more
favorable mix of customer deposits, particularly non-U.S. deposits; and (5) the
absence of increases in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve during
the second half of the year. We accomplished the repositioning of the balance
sheet without adversely affecting the credit profile of our investment
portfolio, and at year-end 2006 had about 94% of the portfolio invested in “AAA”
or “AA” rated securities, with 88% invested in “AAA” rated securities, compared
to 95% and 90%, respectively, at year-end 2005.

Total operating expenses
increased 12% from 2005, as we continued to carefully balance consistent
expense management with revenue growth. Most of the increase was the result of
increased incentive compensation due to our improved performance and increased
headcount to support new business, particularly internationally. As a result,
we generated positive operating leverage of almost 300 basis points on an
annual basis, which we define as a rate of total revenue growth that exceeds
the rate of growth of total operating expenses.


SSgA is increasingly
becoming a more significant contributor to our overall results, as that
business comprised about 19% of our total consolidated revenue and about 24% of
our total income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2006,
compared to 18% and 21%, respectively, for 2005, and achieved a pre-tax
operating margin of 35%, up from 31% for 2005. Net new business at SSgA was about
$86 billion, with about two-thirds in active management products, such as
enhanced indexing, hedge fund strategies and active quantitative management.

We continue to expand our
business outside of the U.S., particularly in Europe and the Asia-Pacific
region. For 2006, approximately 43% of our consolidated total revenue was
generated from non-U.S. activities, up from approximately 39% for 2005, and at
year-end 2006 we employed 8,630 outside the U.S. Our goal is to eventually
generate 50% of our consolidated total revenue from outside the United States.

Assets under custody and
assets under management both increased to record levels at year-end 2006, with
assets under custody at $11.85 trillion, up 17% from $10.12 trillion a year
ago, and assets under management at $1.75 trillion, up 21% from $1.44 trillion
a year ago. Assets under custody have grown at a compound annual rate of 18%
since year-end 2002, with U.S. assets growing by 14% and non-U.S. assets growing
by 36%, while assets under management have grown at a compound annual rate of
23% over the same period.

Financial Goals

In
early 2006, we reaffirmed our financial goals for State Street for 2006. These
financial goals were:

·

Growth
in operating-basis revenue of between 8% and 12%;

·

Growth
in operating-basis earnings per share from continuing operations of between 10%
and 15%; and

·

Operating-basis
return on shareholders’ equity from continuing operations of between 14% and
17%.

Operating-basis results,
as defined by management, include fully taxable-equivalent net interest revenue,
reflecting tax-equivalent adjustments of $45 million and $42 million
for 2006 and 2005, respectively, and a corresponding charge to income tax
expense, and for 2006, exclude aggregate tax-related adjustments of $65
million, or $.20 per share. The tax adjustments related to additional
provisions that resulted from the impact of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation
Act and issues with respect to certain of our leveraged leases.

Management measures our
financial goals and related results on an operating basis to provide financial
information that is comparable from period to period, and to present comparable
financial trends with respect to our ongoing business operations. The use of
fully taxable-equivalent net interest revenue facilitates the comparison of
revenues from both taxable and non-taxable sources. The previously described
tax-related adjustments are not part of our normal ongoing business operations,
and as a result prevent a meaningful comparison of earnings per share and
return on shareholders’ equity with that of other periods. Management believes
that operating-basis financial information facilitates an investor’s
understanding and analysis of State Street’s underlying performance and trends
in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

For 2006, we exceeded our
financial goals. We increased our operating-basis earnings per share from
continuing operations by 23%, from $2.82 to $3.46 (up 16% from $2.82 to $3.26
on a GAAP basis, including the tax-related adjustments). Our operating-basis
revenue increased 15% from $5.52 billion to $6.36 billion (including taxable-equivalent
adjustments of $45 million for 2006 and $42 million for 2005); and we recorded
operating basis return on shareholders’ equity from continuing operations of
17.1% (16.2% on a GAAP basis, including the tax-related adjustments).


Outlook

Our long term
financial goals remain the same, but based on our recently announced agreement
to acquire Investors Financial, we have adjusted our financial goals for 2007
to the following, assuming the acquisition closes in July 2007:

·

Growth
in operating-basis revenue of between 16% and 18%;

·

Growth
in operating-basis earnings per share from continuing operations of between 8%
and 10%; and

·

Operating-basis
return on shareholders’ equity from continuing operations of between 12% and
15%.

Operating-basis
results for 2007 will exclude merger, integration and restructuring charges
related to the above-mentioned acquisition, and for 2006 will exclude the
previously discussed tax-related adjustments. Some of the factors and
assumptions that we considered in determining this outlook for 2007 were as
follows:

·

Expected
equity market growth, based on S&P 500 and/or MSCI

®

EAFE indices, of about 7%;

·

Growth
in revenue generated from active quantitative asset management products;

·

Relatively
stable domestic interest rates;

·

The
expected flattening of the U.S. dollar yield curve;

·

The
continuation of beneficial trends in non-U.S. interest rates;

·

Modest
growth in non-U.S. deposits, as well as the maintenance of a favorable mix of
customer deposits, including demand deposits;

·

A
stable income tax and regulatory environment;

·

Shareholder
and regulatory approvals of the Investors Financial acquisition;

·

Achievement
of expected cost savings from the acquisition; and

·

Retention
of, and success in cross-selling to, Investors Financial’s customer base.

Information about other
risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially
from those expected is included in this Form 10-K under Item 1A.

We are one of the world’s
leading specialists in servicing mutual funds, other collective investment
funds and pension plans. We are consistently gaining business globally, and for
2006, our non-U.S. revenue was approximately 43% of our total revenue, compared
to 26% for 2000. We provide a broad range of reliable, easy-to-integrate
investment services that are global and enable our customers to develop and
launch competitive new investment products. We also provide active management
products, including enhanced indexing, hedge fund strategies and quantitative
management, and passive investment management products and strategies.

We provide fund
accounting, custody, investment management, securities finance, transfer agency
services, and operations outsourcing for investment managers and hedge fund
managers. These services support the complex financial strategies and
transactions of our customers worldwide, in any time zone across multiple
currencies. Our focus on the total needs of the customer allows us to develop
active, long-term relationships that result in high customer retention,
cross-selling opportunities and recurring revenue. The servicing markets in
which we compete are very price-competitive, and we consistently focus on
winning and retaining customer business. This focus requires a strong
commitment to customers while constantly working toward providing services at
lower costs.

Our broad range of
services generates fee revenue and net interest revenue. Fee revenue generated
by investment servicing and investment management is augmented by securities
finance, trading services and other processing fee revenue. We earn net
interest revenue from customers’ deposits and short-term investment activities,
by providing deposit services and short-term investment vehicles, such as
repurchase agreements and commercial paper, to meet customers’ needs for
high-grade liquid investments, and investing these sources of funds and
additional borrowings in assets yielding a higher rate.

Fee Revenue

Servicing and management
fees are the largest components of fee revenue, and collectively comprised
approximately 71% of total fee revenue for 2006 and 2005. These fees are a
function of several factors, including the mix and volume of assets under
custody and assets under management, securities positions held and the volume
of portfolio transactions, and the types of products and services used by
customers, and are affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed income
valuations.


Generally, servicing fees
are impacted, in part, by changes in daily average valuations of assets under
custody, while management fees are impacted by changes in month-end valuations
of assets under management. Additional factors, such as transaction volumes,
balance credits, customer minimum balances and other factors may have a
significant impact on servicing fee revenue. Generally, management fee revenue
is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue. In addition,
performance fees have become a larger component of management fee revenue over
the past two years, and amounted to about 9% of management fees for 2006. Performance
fees are generated when the performance of managed funds exceeds benchmarks
specified in the management agreements.

In light of the above, we
estimate, assuming all other factors remain constant, that a 10% increase or
decrease in worldwide equity values would result in a corresponding change in
our total revenue of approximately 2%. If fixed income security values were to
increase or decrease by 10%, we would anticipate a corresponding change of
approximately 1% in our total revenue.

The following table
presents selected equity market indices. Daily averages and the averages of
month-end indices demonstrate worldwide equity market valuation changes that
impact servicing and management fee revenue, respectively. Year-end indices
impact the value of assets under custody and management at those dates. The
index names listed in the table and elsewhere in this Management’s Discussion
and Analysis are service marks of their respective owners.

(1)

Includes performance
fees of $84 million, $41 million and $29 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Almost 70% of the $635
million increase in total fee revenue over 2005 came from servicing and
management fees.

Servicing Fees:

Servicing fees include fee revenue from U.S. mutual
funds, collective investment funds worldwide, corporate and public retirement
plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and other investment
pools. Products and services include custody; product- and participant-level
accounting; daily pricing and administration; recordkeeping; investment manager
and hedge fund manager operations outsourcing services; master trust and master
custody; and performance, risk and compliance analytics.


The increase in servicing fees of $249 million from
2005 primarily resulted from net new business from existing and new customers,
higher average equity market valuations, and higher customer transaction
volumes. Net new business is defined as new business net of lost business. For
2006, servicing fees generated from customers outside the U.S. were
approximately 44% of total servicing fees, up from 40% in  2005.

We are the largest provider of mutual fund custody and
accounting services in the United States. We distinguish ourselves from other
mutual fund service providers by offering customers a broad array of integrated
products and services, including accounting, daily pricing and fund
administration. We calculate more than 31% of the U.S. mutual fund prices
provided to NASDAQ that appear daily in

The Wall Street Journal

and other publications with an accuracy rate of 99.9%.

We have a leading position for servicing U.S. tax-exempt
assets for corporate and public pension funds. We provide trust and valuation
services for more than 4,300 daily-priced portfolios, making us a leader for
both monthly and daily valuation services.

We are a leading service provider outside of the U.S.
as well. In Germany, we provide Depotbank services for approximately 17% of
retail and institutional fund assets. In the United Kingdom, we provide custody
services for 19% of pension fund assets and provide administration services to
more than 23% of mutual fund assets. We service approximately 13% of the hedge
fund market and more than $500 billion of offshore assets, primarily domiciled
in the Cayman Islands, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Channel Islands. We have
more than $800 billion in assets under administration in the Asia-Pacific
region, and are a leader in Japan with more than 36% of the trust assets held
by non-domestic trust banks.

At year-end 2006, our total assets under custody were
$11.85 trillion, compared to $10.12 trillion a year earlier. The value of
assets under custody is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets
served. Changes in the value of assets under custody do not necessarily result
in proportional changes in revenue. Assets under custody consisted of the
following at December 31:

financial services for corporations, public funds, and other sophisticated
investors. These services are offered through State Street Global Advisors

®

, or “SSgA

®

,” a division of State Street. Based upon
assets under management, SSgA is the largest manager of institutional assets
worldwide, the largest manager of assets for tax-exempt organizations
(primarily pension plans) in the United States, and the fourth largest
investment manager overall in the world. SSgA offers a broad array of
investment management strategies, including passive and active, such as
enhanced indexing and hedge fund strategies, using quantitative and fundamental
methods for both U.S. and global equities and fixed income securities. SSgA
also offers exchange traded funds, or “ETFs,” such as the SPDR

®

Dividend ETFs.

The $192 million increase
in management fees from 2005 primarily resulted from higher equity market
valuations and net new business. In addition, performance fees increased from
$41 million in 2005 to $84 million in 2006. Management fees generated
from customers outside the United States were approximately 32% of total
management fees, up from 30% for 2005.

At
year-end 2006, assets under management were $1.75 trillion, compared to $1.44
trillion at year-end 2005. While certain management fees are directly
determined by the value of assets under management and the investment strategy
employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including our
relationship pricing for customers who use multiple services, and the benchmarks
specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees. Accordingly,
there is not necessarily a direct correlation between the value of assets under
management, market indices and management fee revenue. Assets under management
consisted of the following at December 31.

Trading Services:

Trading services revenue includes revenue from foreign
exchange trading and brokerage and other trading services. We offer a complete
range of foreign exchange services under an account model that focuses on the
global requirements of our customers to execute trades and receive market
insights in any time zone. We have exclusive ownership of FX Connect

®

, the world’s first and leading
foreign exchange trading platform, and we provide quantitatively-based research
into investor behavior, as well as consultative services that use quantitative
tools designed to optimize our customers’ returns. Foreign exchange trading
revenue is influenced by three principal factors: the volume and type of
customer foreign exchange transactions; currency volatility and trend; and the
management of currency market risks.

For 2006, foreign exchange trading revenue increased
31%, to $611 million from $468 million in 2005, and benefited from a strong
first half of the year. The increase from 2005 resulted from increased
transaction volumes, a favorable transaction mix related to custody FX services,
and an increase in FX trading profits, partially offset by a decline in customer
volume-weighted currency volatility.

We also offer a range of brokerage and other trading
products tailored specifically to meet the needs of the global pension
community, including transition management, commission recapture and
self-directed brokerage. These products are differentiated by our position as
an agent of the institutional investor. Brokerage and other trading fees were
$251 million in 2006, up 11% compared to 2005. Growth was attributable to a
significant increase in other trading services and trading profits, offset by a
slight decrease in brokerage revenue, the result of a decline in commission recapture
revenue.

Securities Finance:

Securities finance provides liquidity to the financial
markets and an effective means for customers to earn revenue on their existing
portfolios. By acting as a lending agent and coordinating loans between lenders
and borrowers, we lend securities and provide liquidity in more than 35 markets
around the world. Borrowers provide collateral in the form of cash or
securities to State Street in return for loaned securities. For cash collateral,
we pay a usage fee to the provider of the cash collateral, and invest the cash
collateral in certain investment vehicles. The spread between the yield on the
investment vehicle and the usage fee


paid to the provider of
the collateral is split between the lender of the securities and State Street
as agent. For non-cash collateral, the borrower pays a fee for the loaned
securities, and the fee is split between the lender of the securities and State
Street.

Securities finance revenue has historically been
affected by seasonality during the year, and is principally a function of the
volume of securities loaned and the interest-rate spreads earned on the
collateral. During 2006, securities finance revenue peaked in the second
quarter, as a result of heavy borrowing demand from customers, declined in the
third quarter, and rebounded slightly in the fourth quarter. Overall,
securities finance revenue increased 17% from a year earlier. Growth in this
revenue over 2005 resulted from a 22% increase in securities lending volumes. Consolidated
spread was essentially unchanged from the prior year.

Processing Fees and Other:

Processing fees and other
revenue includes diverse types of fees and other revenue, including fees from
our structured products business, fees from software licensing and maintenance,
profits and losses from unconsolidated subsidiaries, gains and losses on sales
of leased equipment and other assets, and amortization of investments in
tax-advantaged financings. Processing fees and other revenue decreased 10% from
2005, with the decline partially due to the absence of fees from Deutsche Bank
AG related to customer deposits of the acquired Global Securities Services, or
“GSS,” business, which were converted to our systems in prior years.

Net Interest
Revenue

In
servicing sophisticated global investors, we provide short-term funds
management, deposit services and repurchase agreements for cash positions
associated with our customers’ investing activities.

Additional detail about the components of interest
revenue and interest expense is in Note 16 of the “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” included in this Form 10-K under Item 8.

The increase in net interest revenue for 2006 compared
to 2005 was due to several factors. On the asset side, there was an increase in
average interest-earning assets as well as higher yields on our investment
securities portfolio. The higher yields were the result of a higher interest
rate environment as well as a repositioning program begun in late 2004 and
substantially completed in the second half of 2006. On the liability side, a
higher level of customer deposits, primarily resulting from the growth of our
non-U.S. operations, as well as a more favorable mix of deposits, also
contributed to the growth in net interest revenue. These benefits were
partially offset by the impact of higher funding costs, as the Federal Reserve
raised short-term interest rates during the first half of the year.


For the year ended December 31, 2006, our average
investment securities portfolio increased from approximately $51.2 billion to
approximately $61.6 billion. The portfolio included a higher percentage of
collateralized mortgage obligations and floating-rate, asset-backed securities
compared to a year earlier, and a lower percentage of U.S. Treasuries and
direct obligations of federal agencies. The shift in the portfolio was designed
to better position us in a rising short-term interest-rate environment, without
adversely affecting overall risk, as we continued to invest conservatively in
“AA” and “AAA” rated securities. “AA” and “AAA” rated securities comprised
approximately 94% of the investment securities portfolio, with approximately
88% “AAA” rated, at December 31, 2006.

Several factors could
affect future levels of net interest revenue and margin, including the Federal
Reserve’s ongoing actions to manage short-term interest rates, the level and
pace of changes in non-U.S. rates, particularly by the European Central Bank
and the Bank of England, the mix of customer liabilities, and the shapes of the
various yield curves around the world.

Gains (Losses) on
Sales of Available-for-Sale Securities, Net

Our management of the
investment securities portfolio has many objectives, the foremost of which is
to generate maximum return with modest duration and credit risk. In addition,
we structure the portfolio to provide liquidity and to serve as a source of
collateral for customer activities. These objectives may entail strategic sales
of specific securities as market conditions warrant. We recorded net gains of
$15 million on sales of available-for-sale securities for 2006, compared to net
losses of $1 million for 2005. At December 31, 2006, approximately
93% of the investment securities portfolio, or $60.45 billion, was classified
as available for sale. Additional information about available-for-sale
securities, and the gross gains and losses that comprise the net gains, is in
Note 3 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this
Form 10-K under Item 8.

The 19% increase in salaries and employee benefits
from 2005 was driven primarily by higher incentive compensation costs due to
improved performance, the impact of higher staffing levels and annual merit
increases, and planned benefit increases. Staffing levels increased to support
growth in our Investment Servicing business, particularly in Europe, and in our
Investment Management business, as well as in information technology and risk
management.

The slight increase in information systems and
communications expense primarily resulted from higher telecommunications costs
and third party software expenditures to support overseas growth.

Transaction processing services expenses are
volume-related, and include equity trading services and fees related to
securities settlement, sub-custodian fees and external contract services. The
10% increase primarily resulted from higher transaction volumes, as well as expansion
of our operations in Europe.


Occupancy expense was down 5% from 2005, primarily due
to the absence of the $26 million charge recorded in 2005 related to a
long-term sub-lease agreement for space in our headquarters building, offset by
a slight increase in energy and other utility costs.

The 7% increase in other
expenses from 2005 primarily resulted from increased costs to support growth
initiatives, offset by a decline in professional services fees related to
information technology and the restructuring of our Global Treasury function,
which occurred in 2005.

Income Taxes

The increase in income tax expense from continuing
operations to $675 million for 2006, from $487 million a year ago,
resulted from increased pre-tax earnings, as well as $81 million of aggregate
adjustments recorded during 2006 primarily related to the Tax Increase
Prevention and Reconciliation Act and the potential resolution of issues with
the IRS with respect to certain of our leveraged leases. Additional information
about these adjustments is in Notes 10 and 20 of the “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” included in this Form 10-K under Item 8. The
effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2006 was 38.1%, compared to
34% for 2005.

The 2006 income tax expense from discontinued
operations of $6 million was related to $16 million of income associated with
the finalization of certain costs recorded in connection with our divestiture
of Bel Air, which was completed during 2006. The 2005 income tax benefit
from discontinued operations of $58 million was related to the loss of $165
million recorded in connection with our agreement to divest Bel Air in
2005.

Information about income
tax contingencies related to our leveraged lease portfolio is in Note 10 of the
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this Form 10-K
under Item 8.

LINE OF BUSINESS
INFORMATION

We report two lines of business: Investment Servicing
and Investment Management. Given our services and management organization, the
results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily
comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial
services industry. Information about revenue, expense and capital allocation
methodologies is in Note 22 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”
included in this Form 10-K under Item 8.


The following
is a summary of line of business results. These results exclude the income
(loss) from discontinued operations related to our previously discussed
divestiture of Bel Air. The “Other/One-Time” column for 2005 includes the
additional gain from our sale of the Private Asset Management business, and for
2004, includes merger and integration costs related to the GSS acquisition.

Investment
Servicing

The 14% increase in total revenue from 2005 was
primarily driven by increases in servicing and trading services fees and
securities finance revenue, as well as a 19% increase in net interest revenue,
slightly offset by a decline in processing fees and other revenue.

Servicing fees were up from 2005 due to net new
business from existing and new customers, higher equity valuations and higher
customer transaction volumes. The increase in trading services revenue
reflected a higher dollar volume of foreign exchange trades for customers and a
higher volume of fixed income transition management business. Processing fees
and other revenue declined from 2005, partly as a result of a decline in fees
from Deutsche Bank AG as GSS customer deposits were converted to our systems.

Servicing and trading services fees and gains (losses)
on sales of available-for-sale securities for our Investment Servicing business
line are identical to the respective consolidated results. Refer to the
“Servicing Fees,” “Trading Services” and “Gains (Losses) on Sales of
Available-For-Sale Securities, Net” captions in the “Total Revenue” section of
this Management’s Discussion and Analysis for a more in-depth discussion. A
discussion of processing fees and other revenue is provided under the caption
“Processing Fees and Other” in the “Total Revenue” section.

Net interest revenue for 2006 increased 19% from 2005
due to an increase in average interest-earning assets, as well as higher yields
on our investment securities portfolio. The higher yields were the result of a
repositioning program begun in late 2004 and substantially completed in the
second half of 2006, which is further discussed under the caption “Net Interest
Revenue” in the “Total Revenue” section of this


Management’s Discussion
and Analysis. In 2004, we reduced the allowance for loan losses through a
reduction of the loan loss provision as a result of reduced credit exposures
and overall improved credit quality. A portion of net interest revenue is
recorded in the Investment Management business line based on the volume of customer
liabilities attributable to that business.

Operating expenses
increased from 2005, driven primarily by higher incentive compensation costs
due to improved performance, the impact of higher staffing levels and annual
merit increases, and planned benefit increases. Staffing levels increased to
support growth in business, particularly in Europe. Transaction processing
costs increased due to a higher volume of securities settlements and higher
sub-custodian fees. Other expenses increased as a result of an increase in
costs to support growth initiatives, offset by lower professional services
fees partly related to the restructuring of Global Treasury.

Investment
Management

Total revenue for 2006 increased 25% from 2005.
Management fees for the Investment Management business line, which were up 26%,
are identical to the respective consolidated results. Refer to the “Management
Fees” caption in the “Total Revenue” section of this Management’s Discussion
and Analysis for a more in-depth discussion. Performance fees increased from
$41 million for 2005 to $84 million for 2006, and accounted for almost
one-quarter of the increase in management fees. Securities finance revenue for
2006 was up 34% from 2005, reflecting higher securities lending volumes. Net
interest revenue improved due to higher volumes of customer liabilities,
primarily resulting from the growth of our non-U.S. operations, as well as a
more favorable mix of deposits.

Operating expenses increased 18%
from 2005, primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation costs due to
improved performance.

The increase in total revenue for 2005 compared to
2004 primarily reflected growth in fee revenue, but also reflected higher net
interest revenue and a $16 million gain from final settlement of the sale of
our Private Asset Management business. Fee revenue in 2005 primarily reflected
growth in servicing, management, trading services and securities finance fees.

The increase in servicing fees was the result of new
business from existing and new customers, and higher equity market valuations.
Our business continued to grow outside the U.S., with approximately 40% of our
servicing fees derived from non-U.S. customers, up from 34% in 2004. Assets
under custody increased to $10.12 trillion at December 31, 2005, up $624
billion from $9.50 trillion a year earlier.

The increase in management fees reflected continued
new business and higher average month-end equity market valuations.
Approximately 30% of management fees were from customers outside the U.S. in
2005 and 2004. Assets under management increased to $1.44 trillion at December 31,
2005, up $87 billion from $1.35 trillion a year earlier.

The growth in trading services revenue, which includes
foreign exchange trading, brokerage and other trading revenue, reflected an
increase in brokerage and other trading fees of $51 million, primarily due to
increased global transition management business, as well as an increase in
equity trading revenue in the U.S. Trading services revenue also benefited from
a $48 million increase in foreign exchange trading revenue. Customer spot and
forward trading volumes were strong in 2005, both in the volume and value of
transactions, up 32% from 2004. The impact of volume increases was somewhat
offset by lower currency volatility, as measured by our index of 26 currencies,
down 12% from 2004.


Securities finance revenue reflected the effect of
improved interest rate spreads and a 9% increase in securities lending volumes.

The decline in processing fees and other revenue
reflected a decrease of $30 million in payments made by Deutsche Bank AG in consideration
of net interest revenue earned from GSS customer deposits, largely offset by an
increase in revenue from our structured products business. The deposits were
held by Deutsche Bank until customers and their related deposits were converted
to our systems. The net loss on sales of available-for-sale securities of $1
million in 2005 compared to a gain of $26 million in 2004.

The increase in net interest revenue reflected an
increase in the size of our average balance sheet and the impact of
repositioning and increasing the average size of our investment securities
portfolio. Net interest revenue for 2004 reflected a $19 million cumulative
reduction in interest revenue, which resulted from a change in the applicable
state tax rate for leveraged lease transactions.

We reduced the allowance
for loan losses in 2004 by recording an $18 million benefit in the related
income statement provision in response to reduced credit exposure and improved
credit quality.

The increase in operating expenses from 2004 reflected
higher expenses for salaries and employee benefits, transaction processing,
occupancy and other expenses, somewhat offset by a decline in information
systems and communications expense and the absence of merger, integration,
divestiture and restructuring costs.

The increase in salaries and employee benefits was
driven by higher staffing levels and higher compensation costs related to
improved earnings, higher averages salaries due to merit increases and higher
costs of employee benefits.

Information systems and communications expense
decreased because of efficiencies gained as GSS customers were converted
to our operation platforms, somewhat offset by costs for new outsourcing
customers and costs of the new data center.

Transaction processing services expenses, which in
large part are volume-related, include equity trading services and fees related
to securities settlement, sub-custodian fees and external contract services.
The increase resulted from a higher volume of investment activity combined with
higher net asset values that impact sub-custodian fees.

Occupancy expense for 2005 reflected a
$26 million pre-tax charge related to a long-term sub-lease agreement with
an unrelated third party for space in our headquarters building. Occupancy
expense for 2004 reflected a loss of $16 million from a sub-lease agreement at
our former headquarters building. Aside from these charges, the increases year
over year reflected increased occupancy costs in Europe to accommodate new
investment manager operations outsourcing customers.


The decline in other
operating expenses was primarily due to the absence of merger and integration
costs of $62 million recorded in 2004 related to the conversion of customers
gained in the GSS acquisition to our systems, and the absence of 2004
restructuring costs of $21 million related to severance and benefit costs
associated with a 425-position workforce reduction.

Income Taxes

The increase in income tax
expense from continuing operations resulted from increased pre-tax earnings. The
effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2005 was 34%. Our effective
rate for 2004 was 33.1%, including the impact of a cumulative benefit of $18
million resulting from a change in the effective state tax rate applied to
leveraged lease transactions. Excluding this item, the effective rate for 2004
was 34%.

SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note
1 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this Form 10-K
under Item 8.

The majority of these accounting policies do not
involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates in their
application, or the variability of the estimates is not material to the
consolidated financial statements. However, certain of these accounting
policies, by their nature, require management to make judgments, involving significant
estimates and assumptions, about the effects of matters that are inherently
uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available
as of the date of the financial statements, and changes in this information
over time could materially impact amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and
expenses reported in subsequent financial statements.

Based on the sensitivity of reported financial
statement amounts to the underlying policies, estimates and assumptions, the
relatively more significant accounting policies applied by State Street have
been identified by management as accounting for lease financing; accounting for
goodwill; accounting for income taxes; and accounting for pension costs. These policies
require the most subjective or complex judgments, and related estimates and
assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes
available. An understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions
underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our
reported consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

The following is a brief
discussion of the above-mentioned significant accounting policies. Management
of State Street has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the
Examining and Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, or “Board.”

Lease Financing

We have a leveraged lease portfolio consisting of U.S.
and cross-border financings, primarily for transportation equipment, including
trains, aircraft and ships. Lease financing investments are reported at the
aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values, net of
non-recourse debt and unearned income. Unearned income is recognized in
interest revenue to yield a level rate of return on the net investment in the
leases.

Measuring the net investment and interest revenue
related to lease financing requires the use of several assumptions regarding
estimates of residual values, the amount and timing of cash flows, and the
impact of income tax regulations and income tax rates relating to the leases.
Due to the complexity and long-term nature of many of these leases, these
assumptions are reviewed regularly for adjustments that may be required,
including the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment of residual
values.


Changes in these
assumptions in future periods could affect asset balances and related interest
revenue, as well as the amount of income tax expense. Certain of these
assumptions could be affected by changes in tax positions established with
respect to the amount and timing of tax deductions taken with respect to
certain lease transactions, which could be impacted by the enactment of tax
legislation or changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws by U.S. and
non-U.S. tax authorities. As we discussed in the “Income Taxes” section of this
Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we recorded additional income tax expense
of $81 million during 2006, as a result of the impact of the Tax Increase
Prevention and Reconciliation Act and changes in tax positions that we
established with respect to certain of our leveraged lease transactions.

Additional information
about lease financing balances is in Note 4 of the “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” included in this Form 10-K under Item 8.

Goodwill

Goodwill arises when the purchase price exceeds the
assigned value of net assets of acquired businesses, and represents the value
attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired. Almost all
of our goodwill resulted from business acquisitions of our Investment Servicing
line of business. Approximately 99% of the total goodwill recorded in our
consolidated statement of condition was recorded by this business line, and the
remaining 1% was recorded by Investment Management.

The sustained value of the majority of this goodwill
is supported ultimately by revenue from our investment servicing business. A
decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth, or our inability to
deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods, could lead to a
perceived impairment of goodwill, which would be evaluated and, if necessary,
be recorded as a write-down of the reported amount of goodwill through a charge
to earnings in our consolidated statement of income.

On an annual basis, or more frequently if
circumstances dictate, management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or
other developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount. We
perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level, which is one level below
our two major business lines. The evaluation methodology for potential
impairment is inherently complex and involves significant management judgment
in the use of estimates and assumptions.

We evaluate impairment using a two-step process.
First, we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its
carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying
amount, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit
exceeds the fair value, then we compare the “implied” fair value of the
reporting unit’s goodwill with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of
the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then goodwill impairment is
recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value. The implied
fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the
reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if the
unit had been acquired in a business combination and the overall fair value of
the unit was the purchase price.

To determine the aggregate fair value of the reporting
unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment, we use one of two principal
methodologies—external or independent valuation, using quoted market prices in
active markets; or an analysis of comparable recent external sales or market
data, such as multiples of earnings or similar performance measures. In limited
circumstances, these methodologies are not available, and as such, we estimate
future cash flows using present-value techniques.

Events that may indicate goodwill impairment include
significant or adverse changes in the business, economic or political climate;
an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; and
a more-likely-than-not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a
business to which the goodwill relates. Our goodwill impairment testing for 2006
indicated that none of our goodwill was impaired. Goodwill recorded in our
consolidated statement of condition at December 31, 2006 totaled approximately
$1.4 billion.


Additional information
about goodwill is in Note 5 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Income Taxes

Our overall tax position is fundamentally complex, and
management judgment is involved in the analysis of income tax assets and
liabilities. We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and
municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which State Street
operates. These tax laws can be subject to different interpretations by the
taxpayer and the taxing authorities.

In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we
must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these
inherently complex tax laws. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may
be adjudicated by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be
settled with the taxing authority upon examination or administrative appeal.

Management’s determination of the likelihood that
deferred tax assets can be realized is subjective and involves estimates and
assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. The realization of
deferred tax assets arises from carrybacks to prior taxable periods, future
taxable income, including foreign source income, and the achievement of tax
planning strategies. Underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time,
influencing our overall tax positions, as a result of unanticipated events or
circumstances.

Management continually
monitors and evaluates the worldwide impact of tax legislation, decisions,
rulings and other current developments on the estimates and assumptions
underlying our calculations of current and deferred taxes and our analysis of
the expected realization of deferred tax assets. Additional information about
income taxes is in Notes 10 and 20 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.”

Pension Costs

We maintain a tax-qualified non-contributory defined
benefit pension plan covering substantially all domestic employees, as well as
certain non-U.S. defined benefit plans. Measuring cost and reporting
liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of
many assumptions, including estimates of future interest rates, asset returns,
compensation increases and other actuarial-based projections relating to the
plans. Pension-related estimates have a significant impact on the determination
of pension obligations and related expense.

We use December 31 as a measurement date for our
pension asset and projected benefit obligation balances. Each year, we review
actual demographic and investment experience with the plans’ actuaries. In
addition to actual experience, adjustments to assumptions consider published
interest-rate indices, known compensation trends and policies and economic
conditions that may affect the estimated long-term rate of return on plan
assets.

The significant
assumptions used to measure periodic benefit cost and pension obligations are
described below.

Size and
Characteristics of the Employee Population

Periodic benefit cost is
directly related to the number of employees covered by the plans and other
factors, including salary, age and years of employment.

Actuarial
Assumptions

Actuarial assumptions used
to estimate benefit obligations consider factors such as mortality rate,
turnover rate, retirement rate, disability rate and the rate of compensation
increases. These factors tend to


change
gradually over time. The aggregate impact of assumptions is reviewed each year
and specific assumptions are reviewed periodically.

Expected Long-Term
Rate of Return on Plan Assets

We calculate the expected return on plan assets each
year based on the composition of assets at the beginning of the plan year and
the expected long-term rate of return on that portfolio. The expected long-term
rate of return is designed to approximate the actual long-term rate of return
on plan assets over time and is not expected to change significantly.

To determine if the expected rate of return is
reasonable, we consider such factors as (1) the actual return earned on
plan assets, (2) historical rates of return on the various asset classes
in the plan portfolio, (3) projections of returns on various asset
classes, and (4) current/prospective capital market conditions and
economic forecasts.

If we were to assume a 25
basis point increase or decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for all defined benefit
pension plans and keep all other assumptions constant, benefit cost would increase or decrease by
approximately $2 million.

Discount Rate

We use the discount rate to determine the present
value of our future benefit obligations. It reflects the rates available on
long-term, high-quality fixed-income debt instruments, reset annually on the
measurement date. If we were to assume a 25 basis point increase or decrease in
the discount rate for all defined benefit pension plans and keep all other
assumptions constant, benefit cost would increase or decrease by approximately
$5 million, and the projected benefit obligation would increase or decrease by
approximately $37 million.

Additional information about our pension plans and
related benefit costs is in Note 17 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” included in this Form 10-K under Item 8.

Overview of Consolidated Statement of Condition

The structure of our
consolidated statement of condition, or balance sheet, is primarily driven by
the liabilities generated by our core Investment Servicing and Investment
Management businesses. As our customers execute their worldwide cash management
and investment activities, they use short-term investments and deposits that
constitute the majority of our liabilities. These liabilities are generally in
the form of non-interest-bearing demand deposits; interest-bearing transaction
account deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; and
repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short-term investment
alternatives for our customers.

Our customers’ needs and
our operating objectives determine the volume, mix and currency denomination of
our consolidated balance sheet. Deposits and other liabilities generated by
customer activities are invested in assets that generally match the liquidity
and interest-rate characteristics of the liabilities. As a result, our assets
consist primarily of high-quality, marketable securities held in our
available-for-sale or held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio and
short-term money-market instruments, such as inter-bank placements, federal
funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements. The actual mix of
assets is determined by the characteristics of the customer liabilities and our
desire to maintain a well-diversified portfolio of high-quality assets.
Managing our consolidated balance sheet structure is a disciplined process
conducted within specific Board-approved policies for interest rate risk,
credit risk and liquidity.


For 2006, the growth in average interest-bearing
liabilities of $5.1 billion was composed of a $6.5 billion increase in
foreign deposits offset by a decline in repurchase agreements of $1.5 billion. These
changes are representative of the higher levels of customer activity outside
the U.S. Average interest-earning assets in 2006 increased $4.9 billion from
2005, consistent with the increased level of customer liabilities.

During 2006, we
substantially completed the investment portfolio restructuring begun in late 2004.
The average investment portfolio increased $10.4 billion, offset in part by a
decline in average interest-bearing deposits with banks of $7.6 billion. The
composition of the investment portfolio continued to favor mortgage- and
asset-backed securities because of their high credit quality, higher yields and
highly liquid nature. The credit quality of the investment portfolio remained
very strong at year-end 2006, with 88% of the securities rated “AAA” and 6%
rated “AA.”

Investment Securities

We
consider a well-diversified, high-credit quality investment securities
portfolio to be an important element in the management of our consolidated
balance sheet. The portfolio continues to be concentrated in marketable
securities with high credit quality, with approximately 94% of the carrying
value of the portfolio “AAA” or “AA” rated. The percentages of the carrying
value of the investment securities portfolio by credit rating were as follows
as of December 31:



AAA(1)


%


%

AA



A



BBB



Non-rated




%

(1)   Includes
U.S. Treasury securities

The investment securities portfolio is also
diversified with respect to asset class. The bulk of the portfolio is in
high-grade mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. The largely
floating-rate asset-backed portfolio consists of home-equity loan, credit card,
auto- and student-loan securities. Mortgage-backed securities are split between
securities of Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation and large-issuer collateralized mortgage obligations.

We had $378 million of net pre-tax unrealized losses
on available-for-sale investment securities at December 31, 2006, or $227
million after-tax. Net pre-tax unrealized losses on available-for-sale
securities at December 31, 2005 were $475 million, or $285 million after
tax. Management considers the aggregate decline in fair value and the resulting
net unrealized losses to be temporary and primarily the result of increases in
interest rates, not the result of any material changes in the credit
characteristics of the investment securities portfolio. Management has the
ability and the intent to hold the securities until recovery in market value.
We generally configure our investment securities portfolio so that any change
in its fair value is largely, but not totally, offset by changes in the
economic value of our customer liabilities; however, existing accounting
standards do not allow for the change in economic value of our customer
liabilities to offset unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities.

We intend to continue managing our investment
securities portfolio to align with interest-rate and duration characteristics
of our customer liabilities and in the context of our overall balance sheet
structure, which is maintained within internally approved risk limits, and in
consideration of the global interest-rate environment. Even with material
changes in unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities, we may not
experience material changes in our interest-rate risk profile, or experience a
material impact on our net interest revenue. Additional information about these
and other unrealized losses is in Notes 3 and 12 of the “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” included in this Form 10-K under Item 8.

The increase in state and political subdivisions in
the available-for-sale category compared to 2005 resulted from the
consolidation onto our balance sheet of certain trusts utilized in connection
with our tax-exempt investment programs. This consolidation is more fully
discussed in Note 11 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”
included in this Form 10-K under Item 8. The increase in collateralized
mortgage obligations resulted from our previously discussed investment
securities repositioning program.

At December 31, 2006, approximately 8% of our
assets consisted of loans and lease financing. The aggregate increase in loans from
2005 reflected an increase in daily overdrafts, which result primarily from
securities settlement advances related to customer investment activities.
Overdrafts included in loans were $5.69 billion and $3.41 billion at
December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. Average
overdrafts were approximately $5.21 billion and $3.24 billion for the
years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These balances do
not represent significant credit risk because of their short-term nature, which
is generally overnight, the lack of significant concentration and their occurrence
in the normal course of the securities settlement process.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, unearned income
included in lease financing was $1.01 billion and $1.07 billion for
non-U.S. leases, respectively, and $129 million and $125 million for U.S.
leases, respectively. Information about our allowance for loan losses is
included in the “Risk Management—Credit Risk” section of this Management’s Discussion

Cross-Border
Outstandings

Cross-border outstandings, as defined by bank
regulatory rules, are amounts payable to State Street by residents of foreign
countries, regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated, and
local country claims in excess of local country obligations. These outstandings
consist primarily of deposits with banks, loans and lease financing and
investment securities.

In addition to credit risk, cross-border outstandings
have the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a
country, borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment
obligations of principal and/or interest when due because of the unavailability
of, or restrictions on, foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their
obligations. We manage our cross-border outstandings using internally-approved
exposure limits.

Cross-border

Capital

Regulatory and economic
capital management both use key metrics evaluated by management to ensure that
our actual level of capital is commensurate with our risk profile, is in
compliance with all regulatory requirements, and is sufficient to provide us
with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business
initiatives.

Regulatory Capital

Our objective with respect to regulatory capital
management is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial
flexibility for our business needs, including funding corporate growth and
supporting customers’ cash management needs, and to provide protection against
loss to depositors and creditors. We strive to maintain an optimal level of
capital, commensurate with our risk profile, on which


an attractive return to
shareholders will be realized over both the short and long term, while
protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and satisfying
regulatory requirements. The Capital Committee, working in conjunction with the
Asset and Liability Committee, or “ALCO,” oversees the management of regulatory
capital, and is responsible for ensuring capital adequacy with respect to
regulatory requirements, internal targets and the expectations of credit rating
agencies. Our capital management process focuses on our risk exposures, our
capital position relative to our peers, regulatory capital requirements and the
evaluations of the major independent credit rating agencies that assign ratings
to our public debt.

The primary regulator of both State Street and State
Street Bank for capital purposes is the Federal Reserve Board. Both State
Street and the Bank are subject to the minimum capital requirements established
by the Federal Reserve Board and defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, or “FDICIA.” The Bank must meet the
regulatory capital thresholds for “well capitalized” in order for State Street
to maintain its status as a financial holding company.

Regulatory
capital ratios and related regulatory guidelines for State Street and State
Street Bank were as follows as of December 31:

Regulatory guideline for

At December 31, 2006, State Street’s and State
Street Bank’s tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios increased compared to
year-end 2005, the result of growth in capital, primarily from earnings. Total
risk-weighted assets were flat year over year, as growth in balance sheet
risk-weighted assets, primarily investment securities available for sale and
loans, was offset by a decrease in off-balance sheet equivalent risk-weighted
assets. The decrease resulted primarily from allowable changes in the
calculation of exposure related to our securities finance activities. Both
ratios for State Street and State Street Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum
and well-capitalized thresholds.

To manage fluctuations in the tier 1 and total risk-based
capital of State Street and State Street Bank resulting from foreign currency
translation, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a
portion of our net foreign investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries. The notional
value of these contracts was

€

million, or approximately $132 million, at December 31, 2006.

In June 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision released the final version of its capital adequacy framework, known
as Basel II. In 2006, the four U.S. banking regulatory agencies jointly issued
their second draft of implementation rules, and are seeking industry comment by
the end of March 2007. Additional supervisory guidance is expected to be
available by the end of March 2007, and the release of the final
implementation rules is expected prior to the end of 2007. Under the
current implementation plan, State Street, along with other large
internationally-active U.S. institutions, will be required to be fully
implemented under the U.S. rules during 2010. State Street previously
established a comprehensive implementation program to ensure these regulatory
requirements are met within prescribed timeframes. At this time, we cannot
predict the final form of the rules in the U.S., nor their impact on State
Street’s or State Street Bank’s risk-based capital.


We have increased our quarterly dividend twice each
year since 1978. Over the last ten years, dividends per share have grown at a 15%
compound annual growth rate. Funds for cash distributions to our shareholders
by the parent company are derived from a variety of sources. The level of
dividends to shareholders on our common stock, which totaled $265 million in
2006, is reviewed regularly and determined by the Board considering our
liquidity, capital adequacy and recent earnings history and prospects, as well
as economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant. Federal and state
banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary
banks to the parent holding company. In addition, bank regulators have the
authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if they deem
such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice. At December 31, 2006,
the parent company had $10.13 billion of liquid assets with which to meet
dividend declaration and other payment obligations. Information concerning
dividends from our subsidiary banks is in Note 14 of the “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” included in this Form 10-K under Item 8.

During the first quarter
of 2006, we purchased 3 million shares of our common stock under a program
authorized by our Board in 2005. On March 16, 2006, the Board authorized a
new program for the purchase of up to 15 million shares of our common stock for
general corporate purposes, including mitigating the dilutive impact of shares
issued under employee benefit programs, and terminated the 2005 program. Under
this new program, we purchased 2.8 million shares of our common stock during
2006, and as of December 31, 2006, 12.2 million shares were available for
purchase. We utilize third-party broker-dealers to acquire common shares on the
open market in our execution of the stock purchase program. Additional
information about share purchases is in Note 12 of the “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” included in this Form 10-K under Item 8.

Economic Capital

We define economic capital as the common equity
required to protect debt holders against unexpected economic losses over a
one-year period at a level consistent with the solvency of a firm with our
target “AA” debt rating. Our entire economic capital process is the
responsibility of our Capital Committee. The framework and methodologies used
to quantify economic capital for each of the risk types described below have
been developed by our Enterprise Risk Management, Global Treasury and Finance
groups, and are designed to be generally consistent with our risk management
principles. This framework has been approved by senior management and has been
reviewed by the Executive Committee of the Board. Due to the evolving nature of
quantification techniques, we expect to periodically refine the methodologies
used to estimate our economic capital requirements, which could result in a
different amount of capital needed to support our risk profile.

We quantify capital
requirements for the risks inherent in our business activities and group them
into one of the following broadly-defined categories:

·

Market
risk: the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in market
prices, primarily as they relate to our trading activities

·

Interest-rate
risk: the risk of loss in non-trading asset and liability management positions,
primarily the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the repricing
mismatches that exist between balance sheet assets and liabilities

·

Credit
risk: the risk of loss that may result from the default or downgrade of a
borrower or counterparty

·

Operational
risk: the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and
systems, or from external events


·

Business
risk: the risk of adverse changes in our earnings from business factors,
including changes in the competitive environment, changes in the operational
economics of business activities, and the effect of strategic and reputation
risks

Economic capital for each
of these five categories is estimated on a stand-alone basis using statistical
modeling techniques applied to internally generated and, in some cases,
external data. These individual results are then aggregated at the State Street
consolidated level. A capital reduction or diversification benefit is then
applied to reflect the unlikely event of experiencing an extremely large loss
in each risk type at the same time.

Liquidity

The objective of liquidity management is to ensure
that we have the ability to meet our financial obligations in a timely and
cost-effective manner, and that we maintain sufficient flexibility to fund
strategic corporate initiatives as they arise. Effective management of
liquidity involves assessing the potential mismatch between the future cash
needs of our customers and our available sources of cash under normal and
adverse economic and business conditions. Uses of liquidity consist primarily
of meeting deposit withdrawals and funding outstanding commitments to extend
credit as they are drawn upon. Liquidity is provided by the maintenance of
broad access to the global capital markets and our balance sheet asset
structure, as described below.

Global Treasury is responsible for the day-to-day
management of our global liquidity position, which is conducted within risk
guidelines established and monitored by ALCO. Management maintains a liquidity
measurement framework, including a contingency funding plan designed to manage
through a potential liquidity crisis. The plan defines roles, responsibilities,
and management actions to be undertaken in the event of deterioration in our
liquidity profile caused by either a State Street-specific event or a broader
disruption in the capital markets. The plan outlines several levels of
potential risk to our liquidity and identifies several “triggers” that we use
as early warning signals of a possible difficulty. These triggers are a
combination of internal and external measures of increases in potential cash
needs or decreases in available cash sources and possible impairment of our
ability to access the global capital markets.

We generally manage our liquidity risk on a global
basis at the consolidated level, but we also manage parent company liquidity
separately. State Street Bank generally has broader access to funding products
and markets limited to banks, specifically the federal funds market and the
Federal Reserve’s discount window. The parent company is managed to a more conservative
liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access. We typically hold enough
cash, primarily in the form of interest-bearing deposits with subsidiary banks,
to meet current debt maturities and cash needs and those projected over the
next one-year period.

Material risks to the sources of short-term liquidity
would include, among other things, rating agency downgrades of our deposits and
debt securities below investment-grade level, which would restrict our ability
to access the funding markets and may lead to withdrawals of unsecured deposits
by our customers. In addition, a large volume of unanticipated funding
requirements, such as fundings under liquidity asset purchase agreements that
have met draw conditions, or large draw-downs of existing lines of credit,
could require additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2006, there were no
circumstances that management considered reasonably likely to occur that would
adversely impact our sources of short-term liquidity.

While maintenance of our high investment-grade credit
rating is of primary importance to our liquidity management program, on-balance
sheet liquid assets represent significant liquidity that we can directly
control and provide a source of cash in the form of principal maturities and
the ability to borrow from the capital markets using our securities as
collateral. Our liquid assets consist primarily of short-term money-market
assets, such as federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks,
the latter of which are multicurrency instruments invested with major
multinational banks; and high-quality,


marketable investment
securities not already pledged, which generally are more liquid than other
types of assets and can be sold or borrowed against to quickly generate cash.
As of December 31, 2006, our liquid assets, as defined, totaled $42 billion.
Securities carried at $23.28 billion as of December 31, 2006 were
designated as pledged for public and trust deposits, borrowed funds and for
other purposes as provided by law, and are excluded from the liquid assets
calculation.

Based upon our level of liquid assets and our ability
to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary, management
considers overall liquidity at December 31, 2006 more than sufficient to
meet State Street’s current commitments and business needs, including
accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of its customers.

Our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity
is fostered by the maintenance of high investment-grade ratings on our debt, as
measured by the major independent credit rating agencies. Factors essential to
retaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings; strong
risk management; strong capital ratios; diverse liquidity sources, including
the global funds markets and customer deposits; and strong liquidity monitoring
procedures. High ratings on debt minimize borrowing costs and enhance our
liquidity by ensuring the largest possible market for our debt. A downgrade or
reduction in credit ratings could have an adverse impact to our ability to
access funding at favorable interest rates. There were no changes to our
ratings in 2006.

Risk Management

The global scope of our business activities requires
that we balance what we perceive to be the primary risks in our businesses with
a comprehensive and well-integrated risk management function. The measurement,
monitoring and mitigation of risks are essential to the financial performance
and successful management of State Street’s businesses. These risks, if not
effectively managed, can result in current losses to State Street as well as
erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation. Our systematic approach
also allows for a more precise assessment of risks within a framework for
evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital.

We have a disciplined approach to risk management that
involves all levels of management. The Board provides extensive review and
oversight of State Street’s overall risk management programs, including the approval
of key risk management policies and the periodic review of State Street’s key
risk indicators. These indicators are designed to identify major business
activities of State Street with significant risk content, and to establish
quantifiable thresholds for risk measurement. Key risk indicators are reported
regularly to the Executive Committee of the Board, and are reviewed
periodically for appropriateness. Modifications to the indicators are made to
reflect changes in our business activities or refinements to existing
measurements. Enterprise Risk Management, or “ERM,” a dedicated corporate
group, provides oversight, support and coordination across business units and
is responsible for the


formulation and
maintenance of enterprise-wide risk management policies and guidelines. In
addition, ERM establishes and reviews approved limits, and with the support of
business line management, monitors key risks. The head of ERM meets regularly
with the Board or a Board committee, as appropriate, and has the authority to
escalate issues as necessary.

The execution of duties in the management of people,
products, business operations and processes is the responsibility of business
unit managers. The function of risk management is responsible for designing,
orchestrating and directing the implementation of risk management programs and
processes consistent with corporate and regulatory standards. Accordingly, risk
management is a shared responsibility and requires joint efforts in goal
setting, program design and implementation, resource management, and
performance evaluation between business and functional units.

Responsibility for risk management is overseen by a
series of management committees. The Major Risk Committee, or “MRC,” is
responsible for the formulation, recommendation and approval of policies,
guidelines and programs governing the identification, analysis, measurement and
control of material risks across State Street. Chaired by the head of ERM, the
MRC focuses on the review of business activities with significant risk content
and the assessment of risk management programs and initiatives, and also serves
as the credit policy committee for State Street. The Capital Committee, chaired
by the Chief Financial Officer, oversees the management of our regulatory and
economic capital, the determination of the framework for capital allocation and
strategies for capital structure and debt and equity issuances. ALCO, chaired
by the Treasurer, oversees the management of our consolidated balance sheet,
including management of our global liquidity and interest-rate risk positions.
The Fiduciary Review Committee reviews the criteria for the acceptance of
fiduciary duties, and assists our business lines with their fiduciary
responsibilities executed on behalf of customers. Several other committees with
specialized risk management functions report to the MRC.

Corporate Audit serves in a complementary role to our program
of risk management, providing the Board and management with continuous
monitoring and control assessments to ensure adherence to State Street’s
policies and procedures and the effectiveness of its system of internal
controls. The group also has responsibility for the independent validation of
financial models utilized in our businesses. Additionally, the internal control
environment is evaluated through external examinations and regulatory
compliance efforts. The Corporate Compliance, Regulatory and Industry Affairs,
and Legal groups also serve essential roles in risk management. Corporate
Compliance is responsible for the design, implementation and oversight of
policies, guidelines and programs to ensure our compliance with applicable laws
and regulations wherever State Street conducts business. The Regulatory and Industry
Affairs group monitors proposed changes in rules and legislation, and the Legal
group provides counsel that enables us to deal with complex legal and
regulatory environments, maximize business opportunities and minimize legal,
regulatory and other risks.

While we believe our risk
management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses,
external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or
anticipated. For example, a material counterparty failure or a default of a
material obligor could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Market Risk

Market risk is defined as
the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in interest rates,
foreign exchange rates and other market-driven rates or prices. State Street is
exposed to market risk both in its trading and non-trading, or asset and
liability management, activities. State Street manages its overall market risk
through a comprehensive risk management framework. This framework includes risk
management groups that report independently to senior management through ERM. The
process of


managing
market risk for these activities, discussed in further detail below, applies to
both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures.

Trading Activities

We primarily engage in trading and investment
activities to serve our customers’ needs and to contribute to overall corporate
earnings and liquidity. In the conduct of these activities, we are subject to,
and assume, market risk. The level of market risk that we assume is a function
of our overall objectives and liquidity needs, customer requirements and market
volatility. Interest-rate risk, a component of market risk, is more thoroughly discussed
in the “Asset and Liability Management” portion of this “Market Risk” section.

Market risk associated with foreign exchange and
trading activities is controlled through established limits on aggregate and
net open positions, sensitivity to changes in interest rates, and
concentrations, which are supplemented by stop-loss limits. We use an array of
risk management tools and methodologies, including value-at-risk, to measure,
monitor and control market risk. All limits and measurement techniques are
reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular basis by business managers, the
market risk management group and the Trading and Market Risk Committee.

We use a variety of derivative financial instruments
to support customers’ needs, conduct trading activities and manage our
interest-rate and currency risk. These activities are designed to create
trading revenue or hedge volatility in net interest revenue. In addition, we
provide services related to derivative financial instruments in our role as
both a manager and servicer of financial assets.

Our customers use derivative financial instruments to
manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business
activities. With the growth of cross-border investing, customers have an
increasing need for foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for
international investment and to manage the currency risk in international
investment portfolios. As an active participant in the foreign exchange
markets, we provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support
of these customer needs.

As part of our trading activities, we assume positions
in the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets by buying and selling cash
instruments and using derivative financial instruments, including foreign
exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest-rate options and
interest-rate swaps. As of December 31, 2006, the notional amounts of all
of these derivative financial instruments were $514.04 billion, of which $492.06 billion
were foreign exchange forward contracts. In the aggregate, long and short
foreign exchange forward positions are closely matched to minimize currency and
interest-rate risk. All foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current
market rates.

We use a variety of risk measurement and estimation
techniques, including value-at-risk. Value-at-risk is an estimate of potential
loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. We use
a system of risk management to estimate value-at-risk daily for all material
trading positions. We have adopted standards for estimating value-at-risk, and
we maintain capital for market risk in accordance with applicable regulatory
guidelines. Value-at-risk is estimated for a 99% one-tail confidence interval
and an assumed one-day holding period using a historical observation period of
greater than one year. A 99% one-tail confidence interval implies that daily
trading losses should not exceed the estimated value-at-risk more than 1% of
the time, or approximately three days out of the year. The methodology uses a
simulation approach based on observed changes in market prices and takes into
account the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our
trading positions.

Like all quantitative risk measures, value-at-risk is
subject to certain limitations and assumptions inherent in the methodology. Our
methodology gives equal weight to all market-rate observations regardless of
how recently the market rates were observed. The estimate is calculated using
static


portfolios consisting of
positions held at the end of the trading day. Implicit in the estimate is the
assumption that no intraday action is taken by management during adverse market
movements. As a result, the methodology does not represent risk associated with
intraday changes in positions or intraday price volatility.

The
following table presents our market risk for our trading activities as measured
by our value-at-risk methodology:

trading losses in excess of our end-of-day value-at-risk estimate.

Asset and Liability
Management Activities:

The primary objective of asset and liability
management is to provide sustainable and growing net interest revenue, or “NIR,”
under varying economic environments, while protecting the economic values of
our balance sheet assets and liabilities from the adverse effects of changes in
interest rates. Most of our NIR is earned from the investment of deposits
generated by our core Investment Servicing and Investment Management
businesses. We structure our balance sheet assets to generally conform to the
characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, but we manage our overall
interest-rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market
conditions and within internally approved risk guidelines.

Our overall interest-rate risk position is maintained
within a series of policies approved by the Board and guidelines established
and monitored by ALCO. Our Global Treasury unit has responsibility for managing
State Street’s day-to-day interest-rate risk. To effectively manage the
consolidated balance sheet and related net interest revenue, Global Treasury
has the authority to take a limited amount of interest-rate risk based on
market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates
over both short-term and long-term time horizons. Global Treasury manages our
exposure to changes in interest rates on a consolidated basis, and they have
organized themselves into three regional treasury units, North America, Europe,
and Asia/Pacific, to reflect the growing, global nature of our exposures and to
capture the impact of change in regional market environments on our total risk
position.

Our investment activities and our use of derivative
financial instruments are the primary tools used in managing interest-rate
risk. We invest in financial instruments with currency, repricing, and maturity
characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest-rate
risk position. In addition to on-balance sheet assets, we use certain
derivatives, primarily interest-rate swaps, to alter the interest-rate
characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities. The use of
derivatives is subject to ALCO-approved guidelines. Additional
information about our use of derivatives is in Note 15 of the “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this Form 10-K under
Item 8.

As a result of growth in our non-U.S. operations,
non-U.S. dollar denominated customer liabilities are a significant portion of
our consolidated balance sheet. This growth results in exposure to changes in
the shape and level of non-U.S. dollar yield curves, which we include in our
consolidated interest-rate risk management process.


Because no one individual measure can accurately
assess all of our risks to changes in rates, we use several quantitative
measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes
in interest rates and their impact on net interest revenue and balance sheet
values.

Net interest revenue simulation

is the
primary tool used in our evaluation of the potential range of possible net
interest revenue results that could occur under a variety of interest-rate
environments. We also use

market valuation

and

duration analysis

to assess changes in
the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed
changes in interest rates. Finally,

gap analysis

—the
difference between the amount of balance sheet assets and liabilities
re-pricing within a specified time period—is used as a measurement of our
interest-rate risk position.

To measure, monitor, and report on our interest-rate
risk position, we use (1) NIR simulation, or “NIR-at-risk,” which measures
the impact on NIR over the next twelve months to immediate, or “rate shock,”
and gradual, or “rate ramp,” changes in market interest rates; and (2) economic
value of equity, or “EVE,” which measures the impact on the present value of
all NIR-related principal and interest cash flows of an immediate change in
interest rates. NIR-at-risk is designed to measure the potential impact of
changes in market interest rates on net interest revenue in the short term.
EVE, on the other hand, is a long-term view of interest-rate risk, but with a view
toward liquidation of State Street. Both of these measures are subject to
ALCO-established guidelines, and are monitored regularly, along with other
relevant simulations, scenario analyses and stress tests by both Global
Treasury and ALCO.

In calculating our NIR-at-risk, we start with a base
amount of net interest revenue that is projected over the next twelve months,
assuming that the then-current yield curve remains unchanged over the period.
Our existing balance sheet assets and liabilities are adjusted by the amount
and timing of transactions that are forecasted to occur over the next twelve
months. That yield curve is then “shocked,” or moved immediately, ±100 basis
points in a parallel fashion, or at all points along the yield curve. Two new
twelve-month NIR projections are then developed using the same balance sheet
and forecasted transactions, but with the new yield curves, and compared to the
base scenario. We also perform the calculations using interest rate ramps,
which are ±100 basis point changes in interest rates that are assumed to occur
gradually over the next twelve-month period, rather than immediately as we do
with interest-rate shocks.

EVE is based on the change in the present value of all
NIR-related principal and interest cash flows for changes in market rates of
interest. The present value of existing cash flows with a then-current yield
curve serves as the base case. We then apply an immediate parallel shock to
that yield curve of ±200 basis points and recalculate the cash flows and
related present values. A large shock is used to better capture the embedded
option risk in our mortgage-backed securities that results from the borrower’s
prepayment opportunity.

Key assumptions used in the models described above
include the timing of cash flows; the maturity and repricing of balance sheet
assets and liabilities, especially option-embedded financial instruments like
mortgage-backed securities; changes in market conditions; and interest-rate
sensitivities of our customer liabilities with respect to the interest rates
paid and the level of balances. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and,
as a result, the models cannot precisely calculate future NIR or predict the
impact of changes in interest rates on NIR and economic value. Actual results
could differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency
of changes in interest rates and market conditions, changes in spreads and
management strategies, among other factors. Projections of potential future
streams of NIR are assessed as part of our forecasting process.

The
following table presents the estimated exposure of NIR for the next twelve
months, calculated as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, due to an immediate ±
100 basis point shift in then-current interest rates. Estimated incremental
exposures presented below are dependent on management’s assumptions about asset
and liability sensitivities under various interest-rate scenarios, such as
those previously discussed, and


do not reflect any actions management may undertake in
order to mitigate some of the adverse effects of interest-rate changes on State
Street’s financial performance.

While the measures presented in the tables above are
not a prediction of future NIR or valuations, they do suggest that if all other
variables remained constant, in the short term, falling interest rates would
lead to NIR that is higher than it would otherwise have been, and rising rates
would lead to lower NIR. Other important factors that impact the levels of NIR
are balance sheet size and mix; interest-rate spreads; the slope and
interest-rate level of U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar yield curves and the
relationship between them; the pace of change in market interest rates; and
management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions. Incremental
increases in the levels of NIR-at-risk and EVE exposures for upward shifts
in interest rates presented in the tables above are largely the result of the increased
purchases of fixed-rate securities, primarily securities available for sale, in
response to management’s expectations concerning the future direction of U.S.
interest rates. These

purchases resulted in an overall
interest-rate risk position that was well within internally approved
guidelines. The securities were purchased in accordance with management’s
intention to maintain the high credit quality of

our investment
portfolio.


One of the most
significant assumptions underlying our modeling methodologies and the level of
our NIR is the reaction of our balance sheet liabilities, such as deposits, to
movements in market interest rates. Generally, we invest customer deposits in
money-market assets and high-quality investment securities, the mix of which is
determined by the interest-rate and balance sensitivities of customer deposits
under a variety of economic environments. We regularly assess the
characteristics of customer liabilities by product, geography, currency and
customer type to ensure that the characteristics have not materially changed in
a way that would create material risk to our NIR and net interest margin.

Credit Risk

Credit and counterparty risk is defined as the risk of
financial loss if a borrower or counterparty is either unable or unwilling to
repay borrowings or settle in accordance with contractual terms. The extension
of credit and acceptance of counterparty risk by State Street are governed by
corporate guidelines based on the prospective customer’s risk profile, the
markets served, counterparty and country concentrations, and regulatory
compliance. Our focus on large institutional investors and their businesses
requires that we assume concentrated credit risk in a variety of forms to
certain highly-rated entities. This concentration risk is mitigated by
comprehensive guidelines and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of
credit and counterparty risk that we undertake. Exposures are evaluated on an
individual basis at least annually.

We provide, on a limited basis, traditional loan
products and services to key customers and prospects in a manner that enhances
customer relationships, increases profitability and minimizes risk. We employ a
relationship model in which credit decisions are based upon credit quality and
the overall institutional relationship. This model is typical of financial
institutions that provide credit to institutional customers in the markets that
we serve.

An allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb
probable credit losses in the loan portfolio and is reviewed regularly by
management for adequacy. An internal rating system is used to assess potential
risk of loss based on customer investment profile, current economic and/or
customer financial indicators. The provision for loan losses is a charge to
earnings to maintain the overall allowance for loan losses at a level
considered adequate relative to the level of credit risk in the loan and lease
financing portfolio. No provision was recorded in either 2006 or 2005. In 2004,
we reversed $18 million through the provision as a result of reduced credit
risk exposures and improved credit quality.


At December 31,
2006 and 2005, the allowance for loan losses was $18 million, less than 1% of
total loans as of each year-end. Changes in the allowance for loan losses were
as follows for the years ended December 31:

for off-balance sheet commitments. Subsequent to the reclassification, the
reserve for off-balance sheet commitments was reduced by $10 million, and
recorded as an offset to other operating expenses.

Past-due loans are loans on which principal or
interest payments are over 90 days delinquent, but where interest continues to
be accrued. There were no past-due loans as of December 31, 2006, 2005,
2004, 2003 and 2002.

We generally place loans on non-accrual status once
payments are 60 days past due, or earlier if management determines that full
collection is not probable. Loans 60 days past due, but considered both
well-secured and in the process of collection, may be excluded from non-accrual
status. For loans placed on non-accrual status, revenue recognition is
suspended. There were no non-accrual loans at year-end 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003
and 2002.

We purchase securities under agreements to resell.
Risk is minimized by establishing the acceptability of counterparties; limiting
purchases almost exclusively to low-risk U.S. government securities; taking
possession or control of transaction assets; monitoring levels of underlying
collateral; and limiting the duration of the agreements. Securities are revalued
daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary from the borrower.
Most repurchase agreements are short-term, with maturities of less than 90
days.

We also provide customers with off-balance sheet
liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the form of letters of credit,
lines of credit and liquidity asset purchase agreements. These exposures are
subject to an initial credit analysis, with detailed approval and review
processes. These facilities are also actively monitored and reviewed on an
annual basis. We maintain a separate reserve for probable credit losses related
to certain of these off-balance sheet activities. Management reviews the
adequacy of this reserve on a regular basis.

On behalf of our customers, we lend their securities
to creditworthy banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most
circumstances, we indemnify our customers for the fair market value of those


securities against a
failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions
are well-collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities
necessitates thorough credit-based underwriting and monitoring processes. State
Street requires the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in
excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. Collateral
funds received in connection with our securities lending services are held by
us as agent and are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. The
borrowed securities and collateral are revalued daily to determine if
additional collateral is necessary. State Street held, as agent, cash and
securities totaling $527.37 billion and $387.22 billion as collateral for
indemnified securities financing at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

Processes for credit approval and monitoring are in
place for other credit extensions. As part of the approval and renewal process,
appropriate due diligence is conducted based on the size and term of the
exposure, as well as the quality of the counterparty. Exposures to these
entities are aggregated and evaluated by ERM.

Investments in debt and
equity securities, including investments in affiliates, are monitored regularly
by Corporate Finance and ERM. To the extent necessary, procedures are in place
for evaluating potentially impaired securities. Total non-performing investment
securities were $4 million at both December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Operational Risk

We define operational risk as the potential for loss
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, and
from external events. As a leading provider of services to institutional
investors, our customers have a broad array of complex and specialized
servicing, confidentiality and fiduciary requirements. Active management of
operational risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business, and
responsibility for the management of operational risk lies with every
individual at State Street. Our Operational Risk Policy Statement defines
operational risk and details roles and responsibilities for managing
operational risk. The Policy Statement is reinforced by the Operational Risk
Guidelines, which codify our approach to operational risk. The Guidelines
document our sound practices and provide a mandate within which programs,
processes, and regulatory elements are implemented to ensure that operational
risk is identified, measured, managed and controlled in an effective and
consistent manner across State Street.

We maintain an operational risk governance structure
to ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined and to provide independent
oversight of operational risk management. Business units periodically review
the status of the business controls and monitor and report key risk indicator
results. ERM oversees the overall operational risk management program. The MRC
and the Operational Risk Committee review key risk indicators and policies
related to operational risk, provide oversight to ensure compliance with the
operational risk program, and escalate operational risk issues of note to the
Executive Committee of the Board. Corporate Audit performs independent reviews
of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies
and reports to the Examining and Audit Committee of the Board.

State Street’s internal
control environment is designed to provide a sound operational environment. Our
discipline in managing operational risk provides the structure to identify,
evaluate, control, monitor, measure, mitigate and report operational risk.

Business Risk

We define business risk as the risk of adverse changes
in our earnings related to business factors, including changes in the
competitive environment, changes in the operational economics of business
activities and the potential effect of strategic and reputation risks, not
already captured as market, credit or operational risks. We incorporate
business risk into our assessment of our economic capital needs. Active


management of business
risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business, and
responsibility for the management of business risk lies with every individual
at State Street.

It is sometimes difficult to separate the effects of a
potential adverse event into operational and business risks. For instance, the
direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or
penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss, while the impact on
our reputation and the potential loss of customers and corresponding decline in
revenue would be classified as a business risk loss. An additional example of
business risk is the integration of a major acquisition. Failure to
successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business, and the
resultant inability to retain customers, would be classified as a business risk
loss.

Business risk is managed
with a long-term focus. Techniques include the careful development of business
plans and appropriate management oversight. The potential impact of the various
elements of business risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of
precision. We use a combination of historical earnings volatility, scenario
analysis, stress-testing and management judgment to help assess the potential
effect on State Street attributable to business risk. Management and control of
business risks are generally the responsibility of the business units as part
of their overall and strategic planning and internal risk management processes.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET
ARRANGEMENTS

In the normal course of business, we hold assets under
custody and assets under management in a custodial or fiduciary capacity for
our customers, and, in accordance with GAAP, we do not record these assets in
our consolidated statement of condition. Similarly, collateral funds resulting
from our securities finance activities are held by us as agent; therefore, we
do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition.
Additional information about these activities is in Note 10 of the “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this Form 10-K under
Item 8.

In the normal course of business, we sell and
distribute securities for three types of off-balance sheet entities, two of
which are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Additional
information about these special purpose entities is in Notes 10 and 11 of the “Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this Form 10-K
under Item 8.

The risks associated with providing administration,
liquidity, and/or credit enhancements to these special purpose entities are
reviewed as part of our corporate risk management process in a manner that is
consistent with applicable policies and guidelines. We believe that State
Street has sufficient liquidity and has provided adequate credit reserves to
cover any risks associated with these activities.

In the normal course of
business, we utilize derivative financial instruments to support our customers’
needs, to conduct trading activities and to manage our interest-rate and foreign
currency risk. Additional information about our use of derivatives is in Note
15 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this Form 10-K
under Item 8.

RECENT ACCOUNTING
DEVELOPMENTS

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, or “FASB,” issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88,
106 and 132(R)

. This new standard is intended to make it easier for
financial statement users to understand an employer’s financial position and
ability to meet the obligations of its benefit plans. The standard requires
recognition in our consolidated statement of condition of the overfunded or
underfunded status of our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan,
nonqualified retirement plans and postretirement benefit plans, which is the
difference between the fair value of plan assets and the related benefit
obligations. The standard also requires the


reclassification of the
after-tax amount of any unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and
unrecognized prior service costs to accumulated other comprehensive income, a
component of shareholders’ equity. In subsequent years, the after-tax amount of
changes in unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, as well as unrecognized
prior service costs, will be recorded in other comprehensive income.

The standard was effective on December 31, 2006
with respect to the recognition of our plans’ funded status, and the standard’s
remaining provisions must be applied prospectively. Upon adoption of the
standard, to recognize the after-tax difference between our plans’ net funded
status and the amounts currently recorded in the consolidated statement of
condition, we recorded an after-tax reduction of accumulated other
comprehensive income of approximately $164 million. Disclosures required by the
new standard are included in Note 17 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” included in this Form 10-K under Item 8.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position, or “FSP,” No. FAS 13-2,

Accounting
for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income
Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction

. The FSP, which
must be applied as of January 1, 2007, requires that the recognition of
lease income over the term of a lease be recalculated if there is a change in
the expected timing of tax-related cash flows. The cumulative effect of
applying the provisions of the FSP must be recorded as an adjustment to the
beginning balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2007.

Our application of the FSP’s provisions to certain of
our leveraged leases resulted in an after-tax reduction of the beginning
balance of retained earnings on January 1, 2007 of approximately $226
million. Future revenue from the affected leases is expected to increase over
the remaining terms of the affected leases by an amount approximately equal to
the after-tax reduction. Future developments concerning our resolution of
issues with the IRS with respect to the affected leases could affect management’s
estimate of the timing of tax-related cash flows used to record the cumulative effect
adjustment. Changes in estimates of the timing of these tax-related cash flows
could result in income tax expense in our consolidated statement of income
during 2007 or later years.

Information related to
other recent accounting developments is in Note 1 of the “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” included in this Form 10-K under Item 8.


To Our Shareholders

2006 was a very good year for State Street.

We exceeded all of our financial goals (excluding tax
adjustments), grew our business globally, expanded relationships with our
customers, launched new products, acquired new capabilities and continued to be
a strong corporate citizen in the communities in which we live and work.

Our performance in 2006
was driven by a number of themes that I define as setting the standard for our
industry.

Consistency

The first theme is consistency, which is best
illustrated by our financial performance. 2006 was our twenty-ninth consecutive
year of operating earnings per share growth and our twenty-eighth consecutive
year of dividend increases, with an 11 percent increase from 2005. We
outperformed our peer group in revenue and EPS growth while generating lower
expense growth. Earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the
tax adjustments recorded in the second and fourth quarters, rose 23 percent
from 2005 (exceeding our goal of between 10 and 15 percent); our top-line
operating revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was up 15 percent from
2005 (exceeding our goal of between 8 and 12 percent); and our return on equity
from continuing operations, excluding the above-mentioned tax adjustments,
improved from 15.3 percent in 2005 to 17.1 percent (exceeding our range of
between 14 and 17 percent).

We also achieved 290 basis points of positive
operating leverage in 2006 compared to 2005, and generated four more quarters
of year-over-year operating leverage, bringing State Street’s number of
consecutive quarters of year-over-year positive operating leverage to nine.
This consistent performance was rewarded with a 22 percent increase in our
stock price in 2006.

We increased net interest revenue on a fully
taxable-equivalent basis by 22 percent over 2005 and improved net interest
margin to 1.25 percent, up from 1.08 percent in 2005. We also repurchased 5.8 million
shares of our common stock.

State Street Global Advisors (SSgA), our investment
management arm and the largest institutional asset manager in the world*,
contributed to our strong financial performance with another outstanding year
in 2006, accounting for 24 percent of the company’s total pretax profit in
2006, up from 21 percent in 2005. Pretax profit at SSgA increased 40 percent
compared to 2005, with its pretax margin up to 35 percent from 31 percent in
2005.  Assets under management grew 21.4
percent in 2006 to $1.7 trillion.

Consistency is also reflected in our approach to
community support, sustainable development and the environment. Since 1977, we
have contributed a portion of pretax profits to the State Street Foundation,
which in turn provided more than $11.4 million in grants in 2006 to support
affordable housing, education and health.

Additionally, our
employees worldwide devoted 40,000 hours to volunteer activities. In our home
state of Massachusetts, we were the largest corporate contributor to the United
Way of Massachusetts Bay for the sixteenth consecutive year. This consistent
performance on behalf of our communities was a key factor in State Street being
named to

Business Ethics

magazine’s “100 Best
Corporate Citizens” list for 2006. State Street was also selected for both the
World and North America Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes, based on our enhanced
environmental management and corporate governance policies, in addition to our
strong citizenship and philanthropy programs.

* Based on assets under
management


Global Growth

The second theme underpinning our strong performance
in 2006 is global growth.  We made
considerable progress in 2006 against our long-term goal of growing non-US
revenue to 50 percent, achieving a total of 43 percent in 2006, up from 39
percent in 2005.

This
increase in non-US revenue highlights our ability to capitalize on key growth
areas, such as hedge and offshore fund servicing, enhanced and active
strategies, investment manager operations outsourcing and electronic foreign
exchange trading. At SSgA, 32 percent of revenue now comes from non-US sources,
up from 30 percent in 2005.

“Global” not only applies to our business but also to
our people. Today, approximately 40 percent of our employees are located
outside of the US, which provides us with a strong foundation for future growth
as we seek to outpace our competitors in markets that are growing faster than
the US.

This diversity starts at the top of our company,
highlighted by the election in December of three European nationals to our
board of directors—Peter Coym, Amelia Fawcett and Maureen Miskovic, all of whom
bring a wealth of global and financial industry experience to our board.

“Global” also describes
our customer base in 2006, with key asset servicing and asset management
business wins being awarded to us in Beijing, Boston, Edinburgh, Hong Kong,
London, Luxembourg, Munich, New York, Paris, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo and
Toronto. These wins represent a total of 779 new investment servicing wins and
1,345 new asset management business wins from companies that include Virgin
Money, Bayerische Versorgungskammer, CIMB Group, IKANO Fund Management S.A.,
TOWER Australia Limited and John Hancock Funds.

Innovation

The third theme, innovation, remains a key driver in
fueling our growth and deepening our relationships with customers. This focus
on innovation is supported by our commitment to investing in technology—22
percent of our operating expenses in 2006—and pioneering new products and
solutions.

In 2006, we launched a number of industry firsts. This
innovation ranges from the launch of our Sovereign Bond Flow Indicator that
measures investor flows into sovereign bonds covering 13 countries, to the
expansion of our alternative investment strategies capabilities with a new
line-up of cutting-edge absolute return strategies, to 12 new exchange-traded
funds providing investors with precise exposure to targeted sectors such as the
oil and gas sector and the metals and mining sector.

Our leading position in
investment manager operations outsourcing, a capability that we pioneered in
the industry in 2000, continued to expand in 2006 with the completion of the
first European customer migration onto our Enterprise technology and the
addition of two new North American customers—Evergreen Investments and Putnam
Investments.

Customer Focus

The fourth and final theme is customer focus. Our
commitment to delivering a value to our customers that they cannot find
anywhere else proved to be a strong differentiator for State Street in 2006,
with more than 75 percent of our new revenue coming from deepening
relationships with existing customers. For example, AXA Investment Managers
expanded its relationship with us to include servicing for its Luxembourg- and
Dublin-based fund groups for more than

€

billion in assets. Calamos Investments, a customer since 2004, chose State
Street to provide fund accounting services for an additional nine open-ended
mutual funds and one variable insurance fund representing $29.8 billion in
assets.

The California Public Employees’ Retirement System
(CalPERS) reappointed State Street to provide investment services for its $200
billion pension fund, a testament to the high-quality customer service that


State Street has provided
to CalPERS for more than 13 years. CalPERS also selected SSgA as one of its
first managers to implement a domestic long-short equity strategy, underscoring
the

success SSgA
continues to achieve in offering the most innovative investment strategies
available in the industry today.

Our ability to deliver for our customers continued to
yield business from new customers as well. For example, SSgA was selected by
China’s National Council for Social Security Fund (NCSSF) as external manager
for the National Social Security Fund’s global equity mandate—the first time
the NCSSF chose a global manager.

Customer focus is part of our corporate culture at
State Street and a value that is reflected across our leadership team. Three
members of this team were promoted to vice chairman in 2006, in recognition of
the considerable contributions they have made to the evolution of our company
and the impact of their responsibilities on our current and future growth.
Joseph L. (Jay) Hooley, a 20-year veteran of State Street, is head of
global investment servicing and investment research and trading. Under his
leadership, State Street has achieved consistently high growth and has expanded
its global presence. Today, the company is the No. 1 provider of
investment manager operations outsourcing services, a leading provider of hedge
fund servicing and a world leader in multi-asset class trading and transition
management.

William W. Hunt is president and chief executive
officer of SSgA and a 12-year State Street veteran. With more than a
decade of experience working outside of the US, Hunt plays a key role in
driving State Street’s global expansion as well as accelerating SSgA’s push
into active and enhanced strategies.

Joseph C. Antonellis, a 16-year
veteran of State Street, is chief information officer and heads the company’s
global securities services, operations and technology. Antonellis, named “Best
CIO” by the American Financial Technology Awards, is also responsible for the
company’s investment servicing business in North America.

What’s Next?

Looking ahead to 2007, the question that I am most
often asked is: “What’s next?”  This is a
question that we continually ask ourselves to ensure that we don’t become
complacent and falsely assume that by simply doing more of the same we will
deliver similar results. While we have confidence in our strategic focus, we
will continue to evolve our business to ensure that we retain our leadership
position in the industry and set the standard for others to follow.

We will also continue to balance revenue growth with
expense discipline to generate positive operating leverage, and aggressively
pursue capabilities that will augment our market share in high-growth markets
and will increase our revenue. Our proposed acquisitions of Investors Financial
Services Corporation and Currenex, which we announced at the beginning of 2007,
are examples of actions we are taking to enhance our leadership position.

With the acquisition of Boston-based Investors
Financial Services, State Street strengthens its position as a worldwide
service provider of fund accounting to the mutual fund industry, enhances its
capabilities in servicing the offshore fund market, and further extends its
leadership in the fastest growing segment of the asset servicing business—hedge
fund administration.

Key to this transaction is the tremendous cross-sell
opportunities that it provides State Street. Investors Financial Services
serves 12 of the top 25 global investment managers. These institutions will now
have access to State Street’s global capabilities, from foreign exchange to
securities lending to servicing cross-border assets.

The Investors Financial Services acquisition also
expands State Street’s product line, bringing private equity fund servicing
capabilities along with approximately $30 billion in private equity fund assets
under administration and strengthens State Street’s leadership position in key
areas. With the addition of


Investors Financial
Services’ $2.2 trillion in assets under custody, State Street will have more
than $14 trillion in assets under custody. State Street will also be the
No. 1 administrator of hedge funds, with assets under administration of
more than $340 billion. In addition, the acquisition helps extend State
Street’s lead in investment manager operations outsourcing.

The combination of expanded market share in key growth
markets, cross-sell opportunities with new customers and the addition of new
products will help us generate significant new revenue.

The Investors Financial
Services acquisition also complements our acquisition of the Currenex foreign
exchange trading platform, which accelerates our participation in the
electronic foreign exchange trading market and its fastest growing segment:
hedge funds. Foreign exchange is the largest and most-liquid market in the
world, with trading volumes of approximately $2.3 trillion per day. With the
Currenex acquisition, State Street can offer its customers more efficient
access to markets as well as the industry’s most flexible, comprehensive
trading solutions.

Setting the
Industry Standard

When we talk about “setting the industry standard,” we
define this standard as delivering financial results that are better than the
market and our peer group. Our long-term financial goals remain the same as I
previously described. Due to the Investors Financial Services Corp.
acquisition, however, we have set financial goals for 2007 of achieving growth
in operating earnings per share of 8 to 10 percent, growth in operating revenue
of 16 to 18 percent and return on equity of between 12 and 15 percent. We
expect to achieve near the middle of these ranges in 2007.

Our operating results for 2007 will exclude
merger, integration and restructuring charges related to the Investors
Financial Services acquisition, and for 2006 will exclude the previously
mentioned tax adjustments.

We expect that further improvements in net interest
revenue and net interest margin resulting from the actions we have taken over
the past two years will improve the yields from our balance sheet, without
adding any significant new credit risk.

By setting the standard
for our industry, we will continue to deliver superior results for
shareholders, customers, employees and the community. We are committed to
ensuring that we consistently achieve this level of performance across the
globe, while continually innovating to create products and services that deepen
our relationships with our customers.  We
delivered on our commitment in 2006, and I will ensure that we remain equally
committed to superior results for all of our stakeholders in 2007.

Sincerely,

/s/ RONALD E. LOGUE

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF

STATE STREET CORPORATION

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
statement of condition of State Street Corporation as of December 31, 2006
and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of State Street Corporation at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and
the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of State Street Corporation’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 15,
2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

As discussed in Note 1 to
the financial statements, in 2006, the Corporation changed its method of
accounting for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

The accounting and
financial reporting policies of State Street Corporation conform to accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or “GAAP.” Unless
otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in
these notes to consolidated financial statements to “State Street,” “we,” “us,”
“our” or similar references mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis. The parent company is a financial holding company
headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. We report two lines of business:

·

Investment
Servicing provides services for U.S. mutual funds and collective investment
funds, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations,
endowments and other investment pools worldwide. Products include custody,
product- and participant-level accounting, daily pricing and administration;
master trust and master custody; recordkeeping; foreign exchange, brokerage and
other trading services; securities finance; deposit and short-term investment
facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and hedge fund
manager operations outsourcing; and performance, risk and compliance analytics
to support institutional investors.

·

Investment
Management offers a broad array of services for managing financial assets,
including investment management and investment research services, primarily for
institutional investors worldwide. These services include passive and active
U.S. and non-U.S. equity and fixed income strategies, and other related
services, such as securities finance.

The preparation of
consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions in the application of certain of our accounting policies that
materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and
expenses. As a result of unanticipated events or circumstances, actual results
could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of our
significant accounting policies.

Basis of Presentation:

Our consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the parent company and its majority-owned subsidiaries, including
its principal banking subsidiary, State Street Bank and Trust Company, or “State
Street Bank,” as well as special purpose entities considered to be variable
interest entities for which State Street is the primary beneficiary under
existing accounting standards. All material inter-company transactions and
balances have been eliminated. Certain previously reported amounts have been
reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

We consolidate
subsidiaries in which we hold a majority of the voting rights or exercise
control. Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, recorded in other assets,
are generally accounted for using the equity method of accounting if we have
the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of the
investee. For investments accounted for under the equity method, our share of
income or loss is recorded in processing fees and other revenue. Investments
not meeting the criteria for equity method treatment are accounted for using
the cost method of accounting.

Foreign Currency Translation:

The assets and liabilities
of our operations with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are
translated at month-end exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated
at rates that approximate average monthly exchange rates. Gains or losses from
the translation of the net assets of subsidiaries with functional currencies
other than the U.S. dollar, net of related taxes, are recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income.


Cash and Cash Equivalents:

For purposes of the
consolidated statement of cash flows, cash equivalents have been defined as
cash and due from banks.

Securities Purchased Under Resale
Agreements and Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements:

U.S. Treasury and federal
agency securities, or “U.S. government securities,” purchased under resale
agreements or sold under repurchase agreements are treated as collateralized
financing transactions, and are recorded in the consolidated statement of
condition at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently resold or
repurchased, plus accrued interest. Our policy is to take possession or control
of securities underlying resale agreements, allowing borrowers the right of
collateral substitution and/or short-notice termination. We revalue these
securities daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary from the
borrower to protect us against credit exposure. We can use these securities as
collateral for repurchase agreements. For securities sold under repurchase
agreements collateralized by our U.S. government securities portfolio, the
dollar value of the U.S. government securities remains in investment securities
in our consolidated statement of condition. Where a master netting agreement
exists or both parties are members of a common clearing organization, resale
and repurchase agreements with the same counterparty or clearing house and
maturity date are reported on a net basis.

Investment Securities Available for
Sale and Held to Maturity:

Our investment securities portfolio principally
includes debt securities purchased in connection with our asset and liability
management activities. These securities are classified at the time of purchase,
based on management’s intentions, as available for sale or held to maturity.
Securities available for sale are those that management intends to hold for an
indefinite period of time, including securities used as part of our asset and
liability management strategy that may be sold in response to changes in
interest rates, pre-payment risk, liquidity needs or other similar factors.
Debt and marketable equity securities classified as available for sale are
reported at fair value, and after-tax net unrealized gains and losses are
reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders’
equity. Gains or losses on sales of available-for-sale securities are computed
using the specific identification method. Securities held to maturity are debt
securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to
maturity. Securities classified as held to maturity are reported at cost,
adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts.

Management reviews the
fair value of the portfolio at least quarterly, and evaluates individual securities
for declines in fair value that may be other than temporary, considering
factors such as current and expected future interest rates, credit ratings,
dividend payments, the financial health of the issuer and other pertinent
information, including current developments with respect to the issuer, as well
as the duration of the decline and management’s intent and ability to hold the
security. If declines are deemed other than temporary, an impairment loss is
recognized and the amortized cost basis of the investment security is written
down to its current fair value, which becomes the new cost basis.
Other-than-temporary unrealized losses on available-for-sale and
held-to-maturity securities, if any, are recorded as a reduction of processing
fees and other revenue.

Loans and Lease Financing:

Loans are generally reported at the principal amount
outstanding, net of the allowance for loan losses, unearned income, and any net
unamortized deferred loan origination fees. Interest revenue is recognized using
the interest method or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the
term of the loan. Fees received for providing loan commitments and letters of
credit that we anticipate will result in loans typically are deferred and
amortized to interest revenue over the life of the related loan, beginning with
the


initial borrowing. Fees on
commitments and letters of credit are amortized to processing fees and other
revenue over the commitment period when funding is not known or expected.

Loans are placed on non-accrual status when they
become 60 days past due as to either principal or interest, or earlier when, in
the opinion of management, full collection of principal or interest is not
probable. Loans 60 days past due, but considered both well secured and in the
process of collection, are treated as exceptions and may be exempted from
non-accrual status. When we place a loan on non-accrual status, the accrual of
interest is discontinued and previously recorded but unpaid interest is reversed
and generally charged against net interest revenue. For loans on non-accrual
status, revenue is recognized on a cash basis after recovery of principal, if
and when interest payments are received.

Leveraged lease
investments are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and
estimated residual values, net of non-recourse debt and unearned income. Lease
residual values are reviewed regularly for other-than-temporary impairment,
with valuation adjustments recorded currently against processing fees and other
revenue. Unearned income is recognized to yield a level rate of return on the
net investment in the leases. Gains and losses on residual values of leased
equipment sold are recorded in processing fees and other revenue.

Allowance for Loan Losses:

The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is
evaluated on a regular basis by management. Factors considered in evaluating
the adequacy of the allowance include previous loss experience, current
economic conditions and adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s
ability to repay, the estimated value of the underlying collateral and the
performance of individual credits in relation to contract terms, and other
relevant factors. The provision for loan losses charged to earnings is based
upon management’s judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at
a level adequate to absorb estimated probable credit losses.

Loans are charged off to the allowance for loan losses
in the reporting period in which either an event occurs that confirms the
existence of a loss or it is determined that a loan or a portion of a loan is
not collectible. Recoveries are recorded on a cash basis.

In addition, we maintain a
reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposures that is recorded in other
liabilities. The adequacy of this reserve is subject to the same considerations
and review as the allowance for loan losses. Provisions to change the level of
this reserve are recorded in other operating expenses.

Premises and Equipment:

Buildings, leasehold improvements, computers, software
and other equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation and amortization recorded in operating expenses are
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
related assets or the remaining terms of the leases, generally 3 to 40 years.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while major
leasehold improvements are capitalized and expensed over their estimated useful
lives or terms of the lease. For premises held under leases where we have an
obligation to restore the facilities to their original condition upon
expiration of the lease, we expense the anticipated related costs over the term
of the lease.

Costs related to
internal-use software development projects that provide significant new
functionality are capitalized. We consider projects for capitalization that are
expected to yield long-term operational benefits, such as applications that
result in operational efficiencies and/or incremental revenue streams. Software
customization costs relating to specific customer enhancements are expensed as
incurred.


Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets:

Goodwill represents the
excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible
and other intangible assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent
purchased assets that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual
rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with
a related contract, asset or liability. Goodwill is not amortized, but is
subject to annual impairment tests. Customer-list intangible assets generally
are amortized on a straight-line basis over fifteen years, and the amortization
is recorded in other operating expenses. Impairment of goodwill is deemed to
exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit, including its allocation of
goodwill and other intangible assets, exceeds its estimated fair value.
Impairment of other intangibles is deemed to exist if the balance of the other
intangible asset exceeds the cumulative net cash inflows related to the asset
over its remaining estimated useful life. If it is determined, based on these
reviews, that goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired, the value of
the goodwill or the other intangible asset is written down through a charge to
other operating expenses.

Fee and Net Interest Revenue:

Fees from investment
servicing, investment management, securities finance, trading services and
certain types of processing fees and other revenue are recorded based on
estimates or specific contractual terms as transactions occur or services are
rendered, provided that persuasive evidence exists, the price to the customer
is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Amounts
accrued at period-end are recorded in accrued income receivable in our
consolidated statement of condition. Investment management performance fees are
recorded in arrears after the performance period ends, based on predetermined
benchmarks associated with the applicable fund’s performance. Interest revenue
on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities
is recorded based on the effective yield of the related financial instrument.

Employee Benefits Expense:

Employee benefits expense
includes prior and current service costs of pension and other postretirement
benefit plans, which are accrued on a current basis, as well as contributions
under defined contribution savings plans, unrestricted awards under other
employee compensation plans, and the amortization of restricted stock awards.

Equity-Based Compensation:

We record compensation expense, equal to the estimated
fair value of employee stock options on the grant date, on a straight-line
basis over the options’ vesting period. We use a Black-Scholes option-pricing
model to determine the fair value of the options granted.

On January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards, or “SFAS,” No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

. This new standard requires the
fair value of all share-based payments to employees, including awards made
prior to January 1, 2003, to be recognized in the consolidated statement
of income. We elected to use the modified prospective method, under which
compensation expense is recorded over the remaining vesting period for only the
portion of stock awards not fully vested as of January 1, 2006. The impact
of adoption of the new standard was not material to our consolidated financial
condition or results of operations, because the number of options granted prior
to January 1, 2003, that were not fully vested as of January 1, 2006,
was not significant. In addition, we elected to adopt the alternative
transition method prescribed by Financial Accounting Standards Board, or “FASB,”
Staff Position FAS 123(R)-3, and reclassified $86 million of tax benefits
related to equity-based compensation from a general surplus account to a
specifically designated surplus account within shareholders’ equity.

Income Taxes:

We use an asset and
liability approach to account for income taxes. Our objective is to recognize
the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year through charges
or credits to the current tax provision, and to recognize deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the future tax consequences resulting from temporary
differences between the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and their respective tax bases. The measurement of tax assets and
liabilities is based on enacted tax laws and applicable tax rates. A deferred
tax valuation allowance is established if it is considered more likely than not
that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Earnings Per Share:

Basic earnings per share
is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, which
excludes unvested shares of restricted stock. Diluted earnings per share is
calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period and the
shares representing the dilutive effect of stock options and awards and other
equity-related financial instruments. The effect of stock options and
restricted stock outstanding is excluded from the calculation of diluted
earnings per share in periods in which their effect would be antidilutive.

Derivative Financial Instruments:

A derivative financial instrument is a financial
instrument or other contract which has one or more underlying and one or more
notional amounts, no initial net investment, or a smaller initial net
investment than would be expected for similar types of contracts, and which
requires or permits net settlement. Derivatives that we enter into include
forwards, futures, swaps, options and other instruments with similar
characteristics.

We record derivatives in our consolidated statement of
condition at their fair value. On the date a derivative contract is entered
into, we designate the derivative as: (1) a hedge of the fair value of a
recognized fixed-rate asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment
(a “fair value” hedge); (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the
variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized
variable-rate asset or liability (a “cash flow” hedge); (3) a foreign
currency fair value or cash


flow hedge (a “foreign
currency” hedge); (4) a hedge of a net investment in a non-U.S. operation;
or (5) held for trading purposes (“trading” instruments).

Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is
highly effective—and that is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge—are
recorded currently in processing fees and other revenue, along with the changes
in fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk.
Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective—and that is
designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge—are recorded, net of tax, in
other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the hedged cash
flows (

e.g.,

when periodic settlements on a
variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings). Cash flow hedge
ineffectiveness, defined as the extent to which the changes in fair value of
the derivative exceed the variability of cash flows of the forecasted
transaction, is recorded in processing fees and other revenue.

Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is
highly effective—and that is designated and qualifies as a foreign currency
hedge—are recorded currently either in processing fees and other revenue or in
other comprehensive income, net of tax, depending on whether the hedge
transaction meets the criteria for a fair value or a cash flow hedge. If,
however, a derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a non-U.S.
operation, its changes in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, are
recorded, net of tax, in the foreign currency translation component of other
comprehensive income. Lastly, entire changes in the fair value of derivatives
classified as trading instruments are recorded in trading services revenue.

At both the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing
basis, we formally assess and document the effectiveness of a derivative
designated as a hedge in offsetting changes in the fair value of hedged items
and the likelihood that the derivative will be an effective hedge in future
periods. We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when we determine that
the derivative will not remain effective in offsetting changes in fair value or
cash flows of the underlying risk being hedged, the derivative expires,
terminates or is sold, or management discontinues the hedge designation.

Unrealized gains and
losses on foreign exchange and interest-rate contracts are reported at fair
value in the consolidated statement of condition as a component of other assets
and other liabilities, respectively, on a gross basis, except where such gains
and losses arise from contracts covered by qualifying master netting
agreements.

Recent Accounting Developments:

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88,
106 and 132(R)

. This new standard is intended to make it easier for
financial statement users to understand an employer’s financial position and
ability to meet the obligations of its benefit plans. The standard requires
recognition in our consolidated statement of condition of the overfunded or
underfunded status of our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan,
nonqualified retirement plans and postretirement benefit plans, which is the
difference between the fair value of plan assets and the related benefit
obligations. The standard also requires the reclassification of the after-tax
amount of any unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized prior
service costs to accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of
shareholders’ equity. In subsequent years, the after-tax amount of changes in
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, as well as unrecognized prior service
costs, will be recorded in other comprehensive income.

The standard was effective as of December 31,
2006 for the recognition of our plans’ funded status, and applies prospectively
for the remaining provisions. Upon adoption of the standard, to recognize the
after-tax difference between our plans’ net funded status and the amounts
currently recorded in the consolidated statement of condition, we recorded an
after-tax reduction of accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately
$164 million. Disclosures required by the new standard are included in Note 17.


In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

. This new
standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
in conformity with GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
Prior to this standard, there were varying definitions of fair value and
limited guidance for applying those definitions under GAAP. In addition, the
guidance was dispersed among the many accounting pronouncements that require
fair value measurements. This standard is intended to increase consistency and
comparability in fair value measurements and disclosures about fair value
measurements. The provisions of this standard are effective beginning January 1,
2008. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption of this
standard on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange
Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin, or “SAB,” No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements
When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements.

SAB
No. 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover
or reversal of prior year financial statement misstatements should be
considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The guidance provided by
SAB No. 108 must be initially applied to financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2006. This guidance has not had any material impact on
our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position, or “FSP,” No. FAS 13-2,

Accounting
for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income
Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction

. The FSP, which
must be applied as of January 1, 2007, requires that the recognition of
lease income over the term of a lease be recalculated if there is a change in
the expected timing of tax-related cash flows. The cumulative effect of
applying the provisions of the FSP must be recorded as an adjustment to the
beginning balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2007. Our
application of the FSP’s provisions to certain of our leveraged leases resulted
in an after-tax reduction of the beginning balance of retained earnings on January 1,
2007 of approximately $226 million. Future revenue from the affected leases is
expected to increase over the remaining terms of the affected leases by an
amount approximately equal to the after-tax reduction.

In July 2006, to improve comparability in the
reporting of income tax assets and liabilities in the absence of guidance in
existing income tax accounting standards, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

. Generally, this
Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in a company’s financial statements in accordance with existing
income tax accounting standards, and prescribes certain thresholds and
attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Interpretation
must be applied as of January 1, 2007, and t

he cumulative effect of applying the
Interpretation’s provisions must be recorded as an adjustment of the beginning
balance of retained earnings as of that date. Our application of the
Interpretation’s provisions to our tax positions as of January 1, 2007 did
not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

In April 2006, the FASB issued FSP No. FIN
46(R)-6,

Determining the Variability
to Be Considered in Applying FASB Interpretation No. 46(R).

This
FSP addresses how a reporting enterprise should determine the variability to be
considered in applying FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,

or “FIN 46(R).” The variability that is considered in applying FIN
46(R) affects the determination of (a) whether an entity is a
variable interest entity, or “VIE;” (b) which interests are variable
interests in a VIE; and (c) which party, if any, is the primary
beneficiary of a VIE. This variability will affect any calculation of expected
losses and expected residual returns, if such a calculation is necessary to
determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The FSP was effective prospectively
for all VIEs (including newly created VIEs) beginning July 1, 2006. Upon
adoption, the FSP

did not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.


In February 2006, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for Certain
Hybrid Financial Instruments—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and

. This standard amends SFAS No. 133,

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, and SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial
Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities

.

The standard resolves certain
previous implementation issues with respect to beneficial interests in
securitized financial assets, and requires that these interests be evaluated to determine if they are free-standing
derivatives, or if they are hybrid financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives
requiring separate accounting. The standard also permits fair value
re-measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded
derivative that otherwise would require separation, and eliminates the
prohibition concerning passive derivatives that a qualifying special purpose
entity may hold. The standard is effective for all financial instruments
acquired, issued or subject to re-measurement occurring on or after January 1, 2007.
We do not anticipate that this standard will have a material impact on our
consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Note 2. Acquisitions
and Divestitures

In February 2007, we announced a definitive agreement
to acquire Investors Financial Services Corp., or “Investors Financial,” a $12
billion bank holding company based in Boston. Under the terms of the agreement,
we will exchange .906 shares of our common stock for each share of Investors
Financial common stock. The transaction, which is subject to customary
conditions, including the approvals of Investors Financial shareholders and
regulatory agencies, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2007, and
will be accounted for as a purchase.

In January 2007, we announced a definitive agreement
to acquire Currenex, Inc., an independently owned electronic foreign exchange
trading platform. Under the terms of the agreement, we will acquire Currenex
for approximately $564 million in cash. The transaction, which is subject to
customary conditions, including regulatory approvals, is expected to close in
the first half of 2007, and will be accounted for as a purchase.

In 2005, we committed to a plan to divest our
ownership interest in Bel Air Investment Advisors LLC, or “Bel Air,” and at
that time recorded a $165 million discontinued operations charge and
corresponding tax benefit of $58 million. During 2006, we completed the
divestiture and recorded income of approximately $16 million, or
$10 million after-tax, related to the finalization of certain legal,
selling and other costs recorded in connection with the divestiture. We have
not reclassified Bel Air’s results of operations for 2006, 2005 and 2004 to
discontinued operations because these results were not material to State Street’s
consolidated results.

In 2003, we completed the
sale of our Private Asset Management, or “PAM,” business, and recorded a
pre-tax gain of $285 million at the time of the transaction. During 2005, as a
result of the achievement of certain target levels of customer conversions to
the buyer, we recognized an additional pre-tax gain of $16 million from final
settlement of the sale.

As more fully described in Note 1, management periodically
reviews the investment securities portfolio to determine if
other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. This review encompasses all
investment securities and includes such quantitative factors as current and
expected future interest rates, the length of time the cost basis has exceeded
the fair value and the severity of the impairment measured as the ratio of fair
value to amortized cost, and includes all investment securities for which we
have issuer-specific concerns regardless of quantitative factors. After a full
review of all investment securities, taking


into consideration current
economic conditions, adverse situations that might affect our ability to fully
collect interest and principal, the timing of future payments, the value of
underlying collateral of asset-backed securities, and other relevant factors, management
considers the aggregate decline in fair value and the resulting gross
unrealized losses of $563 million on 3,897 securities at December 31,
2006 to be temporary. The losses are primarily the result of rising interest
rates over the course of 2005 and part of 2006, not the result of any material
changes in the credit characteristics of the investment securities portfolio.
Management has the ability and the intent to hold the securities until recovery
in market value.

Additionally, we reduced the allowance for loan losses by $18 million through
the provision for loan losses as a result of reduced credit exposures and

During 2005, we entered into an agreement with a
clearing organization that enables us to net all securities purchased under
resale agreements and sold under repurchase agreements with counterparties that
are also members of this organization. As a result of netting, the average
balances of securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold
under repurchase agreements were each reduced by $6.41 billion for 2006 and
$1.70 billion for 2005.

Other short-term borrowings at December 31, 2006
included $1.5 billion related to our tax-exempt investment programs, which were
consolidated onto our statement of condition during 2006. These trusts, and the
consolidation, are more fully discussed in Note 11.

We maintain a commercial paper program under which we
can issue up to $3 billion with original maturities of up to 270 days from the
date of issue. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, $998 million and $864 million,
respectively, of commercial paper were outstanding. In addition, State Street
Bank currently has authority to issue bank notes up to an aggregate of $750
million with original maturities ranging from 14 days to five years. At December 31,
2006 and 2005, no notes payable were outstanding, and at December 31,
2006, all $750 million was available for issuance.

State Street Bank
currently maintains a line of credit of CAD $800 million, or approximately $688 million,
to support its Canadian securities processing operations. The line of credit
has no stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior
notice. At December 31, 2006, no balance was due on this line of credit.

(1)   We have entered into various interest-rate swap contracts to
modify our interest expense on certain subordinated notes from a fixed rate to
a floating rate. These swaps are recorded as fair value hedges, and at December 31,
2006 and 2005, we recorded a decrease of $9 million and an increase of $18
million, respectively, in the carrying value of long-term debt.

(2)   We have entered into interest-rate swaps, which are recorded as
cash flow hedges, to modify our floating-rate interest expense on the
subordinated notes due 2028 and 2015 to a fixed rate.

See Note 15 for additional
information about derivatives.

We maintain an effective
universal shelf registration that allows for the offering and sale of debt
securities, capital securities, common stock, depositary shares and preferred
stock, and warrants to purchase such securities, including any shares into
which the preferred stock and depositary shares may be convertible, or any
combination thereof.

Statutory Business Trusts:

We have three statutory
business trusts, State Street Capital Trusts A and B and State Street Capital
Trust I, and as of both December 31, 2006 and 2005, these trusts
collectively have issued $650 million of cumulative semi-annual and quarterly
income trust preferred capital securities.

Proceeds received by the
trusts from their capitalization and from their capital securities issuances
were invested in junior subordinated debentures issued by the parent company. The
junior subordinated debentures are the sole assets of the trusts. The trusts
are wholly-owned by us; however, we do not consolidate the trusts under
existing accounting standards.

Payments made by the
trusts on the capital securities are dependent on our payments made to the
trusts on the junior subordinated debentures. Our fulfillment of these
commitments has the effect of providing a full, irrevocable and unconditional
guarantee of the trusts’ obligations under the capital securities. While the
capital securities are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition,
they continue to qualify as Tier 1 capital under federal regulatory capital guidelines.
Information about restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our
subsidiary banks is in Note 14.

Interest paid on the
debentures is recorded in interest expense. Distributions on the capital
securities are payable from interest payments received on the debentures and
are due semi-annually by State Street Capital Trusts A and B, and quarterly by
State Street Capital Trust I, subject to deferral for up to five years under
certain conditions. The capital securities are subject to mandatory redemption
in whole at the stated maturity upon repayment of the debentures, with an
option by us to redeem the debentures at any time upon the occurrence of
certain tax events or changes to tax treatment, investment company regulation
or capital treatment; or at any time after March 15, 2007, for the Capital
Securities B, after December 30, 2006, for the Capital Securities A, and
after May 15, 2008, for the Capital Trust I securities. For State Street
Capital Trusts A and B, redemption premiums are payable on a declining basis
according to the terms of the trust agreements. All redemptions are subject to
federal regulatory approval.

Parent Company and
Non-Bank Subsidiary Issuances:

At December 31, 2006
and 2005, $501 million and $515 million, respectively, were included in
long-term debt related to the capital leases for One Lincoln Street and the One
Lincoln Street parking garage. See Note 18 for additional information.

The 7.65% subordinated
notes due 2010 qualify as Tier 2 capital under federal regulatory capital guidelines.
The 7.35% notes are unsecured.

The 9.50% mortgage note
was fully collateralized by property at December 31, 2005. The scheduled
principal payments for the next three years are $3 million for 2007 and 2008
and less than $1 million for 2009, at which time the debt will be entirely paid
off.


State
Street Bank Issuances:

State Street Bank
currently has authority to issue up to an aggregate of $1 billion of
subordinated fixed-rate, floating-rate or zero-coupon bank notes with a
maturity of five to fifteen years. With respect to the 5.25% subordinated bank
notes due 2018, State Street Bank is required to make semi-annual interest
payments on the outstanding principal balance of the notes on April 15 and
October 15 of each year, and the notes qualify as Tier 2 capital under
regulatory capital guidelines.

With respect to the 5.30%
subordinated notes due 2016 and the floating-rate subordinated notes due 2015,
State Street Bank is required to make semi-annual interest payments on the
outstanding principal balance of the 5.30% notes on January 15 and July 15
of each year beginning in July 2006, and quarterly interest payments on
the outstanding principal balance of the floating-rate notes on March 8, June 8,
September 8 and December 8 of each year beginning in March 2006.
The notes qualify as Tier 2 capital under regulatory capital guidelines.

Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies

Off-Balance
Sheet Commitments and Contingencies:

Credit-related financial
instruments include indemnified securities financing, unfunded commitments to
extend credit or purchase assets and standby letters of credit. The total
potential loss on unfunded commitments, standby and commercial letters of
credit and securities finance indemnifications is equal to the total
contractual amount, which does not consider the value of any collateral.

The following is a summary
of the contractual amount of credit-related, off-balance sheet financial instruments
at December 31. Amounts reported do not reflect participations to
unrelated third parties.

On behalf of our
customers, we lend their securities to creditworthy brokers and other
institutions. In certain circumstances, we may indemnify our customers for the
fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to
return such securities. Collateral funds received in connection with our
securities finance services are held by us as agent and are not recorded in our
consolidated statement of condition. We require the borrowers to provide
collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of 100% of the fair market value
of the securities borrowed. The borrowed securities are revalued daily to
determine if additional collateral is necessary. We held, as agent, cash and
U.S. government securities totaling $527.37 billion and $387.22 billion as
collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively.

Approximately 81% of the
unfunded commitments to extend credit and liquidity asset purchase agreements
expire within one year from the date of issue. Since many of the commitments
are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the total commitment
amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

In the normal course of
business, we provide liquidity and credit enhancements to asset-backed
commercial paper programs, or “conduits.” These conduits are more fully
described in Note 11. The commercial paper issuances and commitments of the
conduits to provide funding are supported by liquidity asset purchase
agreements and backup liquidity lines of credit, the majority of which are
provided by us. In addition, we provide direct credit support to the conduits
in the form of standby letters of credit. Our commitments under liquidity asset
purchase agreements and backup lines of credit totaled $23.99 billion at December 31,
2006, and are included in the preceding table. Our commitments under


standby
letters of credit totaled $1.01 billion at December 31, 2006, and are also
included in the preceding table.

Deterioration in asset
performance or certain other factors may shift the asset risk from the
commercial paper investors to us as the liquidity or credit enhancement
provider. In addition, the conduits may need to draw upon the backup facilities
to repay maturing commercial paper. In these instances, we would either acquire
the assets of the conduits or make loans to the conduits secured by the
conduits’ assets. Potential losses, if any, from these conduits are not
expected to materially affect our consolidated financial condition or results
of operations.

In the normal course of
business, we hold assets under custody and management in a custodial or
fiduciary capacity. Management conducts regular reviews of its responsibilities
in this regard and considers the results in preparing the consolidated
financial statements. In the opinion of management, no contingent liabilities existed
at December 31, 2006, that would have had a material adverse effect on
State Street’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Legal Proceedings:

We are involved in various
industry-related regulatory, governmental and law enforcement inquiries and
subpoenas, as well as legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of
business. In the opinion of management, after discussion with counsel, these
regulatory, governmental and law enforcement inquiries and subpoenas, and legal
proceedings can be successfully defended or resolved without a material adverse
effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Tax Contingencies:

In the normal course of
business, we are subject to challenges from U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities
regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges may result in adjustments
to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of
income among tax jurisdictions. During 2004, the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service, or “IRS,” completed its review of our federal income tax returns for
tax years 1997, 1998 and 1999 and proposed to disallow tax deductions related
to lease-in-lease-out, or “LILO,” transactions. We believe that we reported the
tax effects of these transactions properly, based on applicable statutes,
regulations and case law in effect at the time they were entered into. During
the second quarter of 2005, we filed an appeal with the IRS, which continues,
with respect to their proposed disallowance of these tax deductions. In
January 2007, a U.S. District Court found for the government in a LILO
case involving another financial institution. The financial institution is
appealing the decision. The IRS has indicated that it is reviewing its LILO
settlement position in light of the outcome of this case.

During 2005, the IRS
announced that it had classified sale-in-lease-out, or “SILO,” transactions as
tax shelters, or “listed transactions.” The IRS began its review of our tax
returns for the years 2000–2003 during the second quarter of 2005, and is
reviewing these SILO transactions. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the IRS
proposed to disallow tax deductions related to certain SILO transactions. We
believe that we reported the tax effects of these transactions properly, based
on applicable statutes, regulations and case law in effect at the time they
were entered into.

During 2006, we recorded
an additional tax provision of approximately $46 million to accrue for

the potential resolution of the above-described
issues with the IRS. While it is unclear whether we will be able to
reach an acceptable settlement with the IRS with respect to LILO transactions,
management believes we are sufficiently accrued as of December 30, 2006
for tax exposures, including exposures related to LILO and SILO transactions,
and related interest expense. In future periods, if management revises its
evaluation of this tax position, the effect of the revision will be recorded in
income tax expense in that period.


Note 11. Securitizations and Variable Interest
Entities

Tax-Exempt Investment
Programs:

In the normal course of
business, we structure and sell certificated interests in pools of tax-exempt
investment-grade assets principally to mutual fund customers. We utilize trusts
which are structured as qualifying special purpose entities, or “QSPEs,” which,
while not subject to the requirements of FIN 46(R), are governed by the
accounting and reporting provisions of SFAS No. 140,

Accounting
for the Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities.

We may also provide liquidity and remarketing services
to the QSPEs. Historically, we transferred assets to these unaffiliated QSPEs
from our investment securities portfolio at fair market value and treated such
transfers as sales. The QSPEs financed the acquisition of these assets by
selling certificated interests issued by the QSPE to third-party investors and
we typically purchased a minority residual interest in these QSPEs.

During the third quarter
of 2006, we determined that off-balance sheet accounting treatment for these
trusts was not appropriate. As a result, we consolidated the trusts onto our
consolidated statement of condition as of September 30, 2006, resulting in
an increase in assets, composed of municipal securities available for sale, and
liabilities, composed of other short-term borrowings, of approximately $1.5
billion. In addition, we recorded a cumulative gain of $15 million in trading
services revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. The
consolidation of these trusts did not change the economic substance of the
programs, and its impact was not material to consolidated financial statements
of prior periods. The consolidation of the trusts is reported as a non-cash
acquisition of investment securities available for sale in our consolidated
statement of cash flows.

The trusts had a
weighted-average life of approximately 4.9 years at December 31, 2006,
compared to approximately 6.2 years at December 31, 2005. Under separate
agreements, we provide standby bond purchase agreements to most of these
trusts, which obligate State Street to acquire the bonds at par value in the
event that the re-marketing agent is unable to place the certificated interests
of the trusts with investors. The standby bond purchase agreements are subject
to early termination by State Street in the event of a shortfall in the
required over-collateralization in the trust. As the primary standby bond
purchase agreement provider, we are not obligated to acquire bonds in the event
of the following credit events: payment default, bankruptcy of issuer or credit
enhancement provider, imposition of taxability, or downgrade of an asset held by
the trust below investment grade. Our commitments to the trusts under these
standby bond purchase agreements totaled $1.68 billion at December 31,
2006, none of which were utilized at period-end. In the event that our
obligations under these agreements are triggered, no material impact to our
consolidated financial condition or results of operations would occur, because
the bonds are recorded in our consolidated statement of condition.

Asset-Backed Commercial
Paper Programs:

We established an
asset-backed commercial paper program in 1992. Currently, we administer four
third-party owned, special purpose, multi-seller asset-backed commercial paper
programs, or “conduits,” that purchase financial assets with various asset
classifications from a variety of third-parties. These conduits, which are
structured as bankruptcy-remote limited liability companies, provide access to
the efficiencies of the global commercial paper markets, which have
historically offered an attractive cost of financing relative to bank-based
borrowing. Asset purchases by the conduits are funded by issuing commercial
paper, which is supported by liquidity asset purchase agreements and backup
liquidity lines of credit, the majority of which are provided by us. In addition,
we provide direct credit support to the conduits in the form of standby letters
of credit. All fees are charged based on market price. The sellers continue to
service the transferred assets and absorb the first losses of the conduits by
providing collateral in the form of excess assets also known as
over-collaterization.

We hold no equity ownership in these conduits. These
entities typically meet the definition of a variable interest entity as defined
by FIN 46(R). We are not the primary beneficiary of these conduits, as


defined by FIN 46(R),
as a result of the issuance of subordinated notes by the conduits to
third-party investors, and we do not record these conduits in our consolidated
financial statements. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, total assets in
unconsolidated conduits were $25.25 billion and $17.90 billion,
respectively. Our off-balance sheet commitments to these conduits are disclosed
in Note 10.

Collateralized Debt
Obligations:

We manage a series of
collateralized debt obligations, or “CDOs.” A CDO is a managed investment
vehicle which purchases a portfolio of diversified highly-rated assets. A CDO
funds purchases through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity,
the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets
in the CDO. Typically, our involvement is as collateral manager. We may also
invest in a small percentage of the debt issued. These entities typically meet
the definition of a variable interest entity as defined by FIN 46(R). We are
not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, as defined by FIN 46(R), and do not
record these CDOs in our consolidated financial statements. At December 31,
2006 and 2005, total assets in these CDOs were $3.48 billion and $2.73 billion,
respectively.

During 2005, we acquired
and transferred $60 million of investment securities from our
available-for-sale portfolio into a CDO. This transfer, which was executed at
fair market value in exchange for cash, was treated as a sale. We did not
acquire or transfer any investment securities to a CDO during 2006.

Note 12. Shareholders’ Equity

Treasury Stock:

During the first quarter
of 2006, we purchased 3 million shares of our common stock under a program
authorized by our Board of Directors, or “Board,” in 2005. On March 16,
2006, the Board authorized a new program for the purchase of up to 15 million
shares of our common stock for general corporate purposes, including mitigating
the dilutive impact of shares issued under employee benefit programs, and
terminated the 2005 program. Under this new program, we purchased 2.8 million
shares of our common stock during 2006, and as of December 31, 2006, 12.2
million shares were available for purchase. We utilize third-party
broker-dealers to acquire common shares on the open market in the execution of our
stock purchase program.

In addition, shares may be
acquired for other deferred compensation plans, held by an external trustee,
that are not part of the common stock purchase program. As of December 31,
2006, on a cumulative basis, approximately 395,000 shares have been purchased
and are held in trust. These shares are recorded as treasury stock in our
consolidated statement of condition.

During 2006, 2005 and
2004, we purchased and recorded as treasury stock a total of 5.8 million
shares, 13.1 million shares and 4.1 million shares, respectively, at
an average historical cost per share of 
$63, $51 and $43, respectively.

Note 13.
Equity-Based Compensation

The 2006 Equity Incentive Plan was approved by
shareholders in April 2006, and 20,000,000 shares of common stock were
approved for issuance for stock and stock-based awards, including stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, deferred stock and
performance awards. In addition, up to 8,000,000 shares from our 1997 Equity
Incentive Plan, that were available to issue or become available due to
cancellations and forfeitures, may be awarded under the 2006 Plan. The 1997
Plan expired on December 18, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, 1,305,420
shares from the 1997 Plan have been added to and may be awarded from the 2006 Plan.
As of December 31, 2006, 106,045 awards have been made under the 2006 Plan.
We have stock options outstanding from previous plans, including the 1997 Plan,
under which no further grants can be made.

The exercise price of non-qualified and incentive
stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair value
of such shares at the date of grant. Stock options and stock appreciation
rights issued under the 2006 Plan and the prior 1997 Plan generally vest over
four years and expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. For
restricted stock awards issued under the 2006 Plan and the prior
1997 Plan, stock certificates are issued at the time of grant and
recipients have dividend and voting rights. In general, these grants vest over
three years. For deferred stock awards issued under the 2006 Plan and the prior
1997 Plan, no stock is issued at the time of grant. Generally, these grants
vest over two-, three- or four-year periods. Performance awards granted under
the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan and the prior 1997 Plan are earned over a
performance period based on achievement of goals, generally over two- to
three-year periods. Payment for performance awards is made in shares of our
common stock or in cash equal to the fair market value of our common stock,
based on certain financial ratios after the conclusion of each performance
period.

We record compensation expense, equal to the estimated
fair value of the options on the grant date, on a straight-line basis over the
options’ vesting period. We use a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to
estimate the fair value of the options granted.

The
weighted-average assumptions used in connection with the option-pricing model
were as follows for the years indicated.

$208 million, $110 million and $74 million for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The related total income tax benefit
recorded in our consolidated statement of income was $83 million, $44 million
and $30 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

2006, total unrecognized compensation cost related to performance awards was $38 million,
which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

We generally utilize
treasury shares to satisfy the issuance of stock under our equity incentive
plans. We do not have a specific policy concerning purchases of our common
stock to satisfy stock issuances, including exercises of options. We have a
general policy concerning purchases of stock to meet common stock issuances
under our employee benefit plans, including option exercises and other
corporate purposes. Various factors determine the amount and timing of our
purchases of our common stock, including our capital requirements, the number
of shares we expect to issue under employee benefit plans, market conditions
(including the trading price of our common stock), and legal considerations. These
factors can change at any time, and there can be no assurance as to the number
of shares of common stock we will purchase or when we will purchase them.


Note 14. Regulatory
Matters

Regulatory Capital:

We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements
administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital
requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by
regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our consolidated
financial condition. Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, we must meet
specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of our
consolidated assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures as calculated
under regulatory accounting practices. Our capital amounts and classification
are subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk
weightings and other factors.

Quantitative measures established by regulation to
ensure capital adequacy require State Street and State Street Bank to maintain
minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios as set forth in the following
table. The risk-based capital ratios are Tier 1 capital and total capital
divided by adjusted total risk-weighted assets and market-risk equivalents, and
the Tier 1 leverage ratio is Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted quarterly
average assets. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, State Street and State
Street Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject.

As of December 31, 2006, State Street Bank was
categorized as “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework. To be
categorized as “well capitalized,” State Street Bank must exceed the “well
capitalized” guideline ratios, as set forth in the table, and meet certain
other requirements. State Street Bank exceeded all “well capitalized”
requirements as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. There are no conditions or
events since December 31, 2006 that management believes have changed the
capital category of State Street Bank.

State
Street Bank must meet the regulatory designation of “well capitalized” in order
for us to maintain our status as a financial holding company, including
maintaining a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio (Tier 1 capital divided
by adjusted total risk-weighted assets and market-risk equivalents) of 6%, a
minimum total risk-based capital ratio (total capital divided by adjusted total
risk-weighted assets and market-risk equivalents) of 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage
ratio (Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted quarterly average assets) of 5%. In
addition, Federal Reserve Regulation Y defines “well capitalized” for a bank
holding company such as us for purposes of determining


eligibility for a
streamlined review process for acquisition proposals. For such Regulation Y
purposes, “well capitalized” requires us to maintain a minimum Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio of 6% and a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of
10%.

Cash, Dividend, Loan and Other
Restrictions:

During 2006, our bank subsidiaries were required by
the Federal Reserve to maintain average cash reserve balances of $103 million.
In addition, federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions
on dividends paid by bank subsidiaries to a parent holding company. For 2007,
aggregate dividends by State Street Bank without prior regulatory approval are
limited to approximately $766 million of its undistributed earnings at December 31,
2006, plus an additional amount equal to its net profits, as defined, for 2007
up to the date of any dividend.

The Federal Reserve Act requires that extensions of
credit by State Street Bank to certain affiliates, including the parent
company, be secured by specific collateral, that the extension of credit to any
one affiliate be limited to 10% of its capital and surplus (as defined), and
that extensions of credit to all such affiliates be limited to 20% of its capital
and surplus.

At December 31, 2006,
consolidated retained earnings included $230 million representing
undistributed earnings of affiliates that are accounted for using the equity
method.

Note 15. Derivative
Financial Instruments

We use derivatives to support customers’ needs,
conduct trading activities, and manage our interest-rate and currency risk.

As part of our trading activities, we assume positions
in both the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets by buying and selling
cash instruments and using derivative financial instruments, including foreign
exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest-rate options, and
interest-rate swaps. In the aggregate, long and short foreign exchange forward
positions are matched closely to minimize currency and interest-rate risk. All
foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates.

Interest-rate contracts involve an agreement with a
counterparty to exchange cash flows based on the movement of an underlying
interest-rate index. An interest-rate swap agreement involves the exchange of a
series of interest payments, either at a fixed or variable rate, based upon the
notional amount without the exchange of the underlying principal amount. An
interest-rate option contract provides the purchaser, for a premium, the right,
but not the obligation, to receive an interest rate based upon a predetermined
notional value during a specified period. An interest-rate futures contract is
a commitment to buy or sell, at a future date, a financial instrument at a
contracted price; it may be settled in cash or through the delivery of the
contracted instrument.

Foreign exchange contracts involve an agreement to
exchange one currency for another currency at an agreed-upon rate and
settlement date. Foreign exchange contracts consist of cross-currency swap
agreements and foreign exchange forward and spot contracts.

2006, the fair value hedges of long-term debt decreased the carrying value of
long-term debt presented in our consolidated statement of condition by $9
million and in the year ended December 31, 2005 it increased the value by $18
million.

(3)

For the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005, the overall weighted-average interest rate for long-term debt
was 6.72% and 6.58%, respectively, on a contractual basis, and 6.77% and 5.63%,
respectively, including the effects of hedges.

For cash flow hedges, any changes in the fair value of
the derivative financial instruments remain in accumulated other comprehensive
income and are generally recorded in our consolidated statement of income in
future periods when earnings are affected by the variability of the hedged cash
flow. Hedge ineffectiveness recorded in processing fees and other revenue was
not material in 2006, 2005 or 2004.

We have entered into foreign exchange forward
contracts with an aggregate notional amount of

€

million, or approximately $132 million, to hedge a portion of our net foreign
investment in non-U.S.


subsidiaries. As a result,
approximately $18 million of after-tax translation losses and $37 million of
after-tax translation gains for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively, on the hedge contracts were recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income.

Foreign exchange trading
revenue related to foreign exchange contracts was $611 million, $468 million
and $420 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. For other financial instrument contracts, recorded in
trading services revenue were gains of $18 million in 2006, gains of $4 million
in 2005 and losses of $25 million in 2004. Future cash requirements, if
any, related to foreign exchange contracts are represented by the gross amount
of currencies to be exchanged under each contract unless we and the
counterparty have agreed to pay or receive the net contractual settlement
amount on the settlement date. Future cash requirements on other financial
instruments are limited to the net amounts payable under the agreements.

2012–2016




The accumulated benefit obligation for all of our U.S.
defined benefit pension plans was $613 million and $581 million at December 31,
2006, and 2005, respectively.

To develop the assumption of the expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets, we considered the historical returns and the
future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target
asset allocation of the pension portfolio. This analysis resulted in the determination
of the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00% for the year
ended December 31, 2006.

For the tax-qualified U.S.
defined benefit pension plan, the asset allocation as of December 31, 2006
and 2005, and the strategic target allocation for 2007, by asset category, were
as follows:

ASSET CATEGORY

Strategic Target

Allocation

Percentage of Plan

Assets at December 31,




Equity securities


%


%


%

Fixed income
  securities




Other




Total


%


%


%

The preceding strategic target asset allocation was
last amended effective July 31, 2006. Consistent with that target
allocation, the plan should generate a real return above inflation, and
superior to that of a benchmark index consisting of a combination of
appropriate capital markets indices weighted in the same proportions as the
plan’s strategic target asset allocation. Equities included domestic and
international publicly-traded common, preferred and convertible securities.
Fixed income securities included domestic and international corporate and
government debt securities, as well as asset-backed securities and private
debt. The “other” category included real estate, alternative investments and
cash and cash equivalents. Derivative financial instruments are an acceptable
alternative to investing in these types of securities, but may not be used to
leverage the plan’s portfolio.

Expected employer contributions to the tax-qualified
U.S. defined benefit pension plan, SERPs and post-retirement plan for the year
ending December 31, 2007 are $14 million, $7 million and $8 million,
respectively.


State
Street has unfunded SERPs that provide certain officers with defined pension
benefits in excess of qualified plan limits imposed by U.S. federal tax law.

For those defined benefit plans that had accumulated
benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of December 31, 2006 and
2005, the accumulated benefit obligations were $326 million and $262 million,
respectively, and the plan assets were $200 million and $163 million,
respectively.

For those defined benefit plans that had projected
benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of December 31, 2006 and
2005, the projected benefit obligations were $411 million and $866 million,
respectively, and the plan assets were $204 million and $706 million,
respectively.

If trend rates in health care costs were increased by
1%, the post-retirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2006, would
have increased 7%, and the aggregate expense for service and interest costs for
2006 would have increased 13%. Conversely, if trend rates in health care costs were
reduced by 1%, the post-retirement benefit obligation as of December 31,
2006, would have decreased 6%, and the aggregate expense for service and interest
costs for 2006 would have decreased 11%.

Certain of our U.S. employees are eligible to
contribute a portion of their pre-tax salary to a 401(k) savings plan and
an Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or “ESOP.” Our matching portion of these
contributions is paid in cash, and the related expense was $20 million for
2006, $21 million for 2005 and $16 million for 2004. In addition, employees in
certain non-U.S. offices participate in other local plans. Expenses related to
these plans were $32 million, $39 million and $31 million for 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.

The ESOP is a
non-leveraged plan. Compensation cost is equal to the contribution called for
by the plan formula and is equal to the cash contributed for the purchase of
shares on the open market or the fair value of the shares contributed from
treasury stock. Dividends on shares held by the ESOP are charged to retained
earnings, and shares are treated as outstanding for purposes of calculating
earnings per share.

Note 18.

Occupancy
Expense and Information Systems and Communications Expense

Occupancy expense and information systems and
communications expense included expense for depreciation of buildings,
leasehold improvements, computers, equipment and furniture and fixtures.
Total depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004 was $309 million, $315 million and $301 million, respectively.

As of December 31,
2006, accumulated amortization of assets under capital leases was $83 million.
Amortization of assets recorded under capital leases and the costs of operating
leases for office space are recorded in occupancy expense. The costs of
operating leases related to computers and equipment are recorded in information
systems and communications expense.

We lease approximately 865,000 square feet at One
Lincoln Street, an office building located in Boston, Massachusetts, and a
related 366,000 square-foot underground parking garage, under 20-year,
non-cancelable capital leases expiring in September 2023. As of December 31,
2006 and 2005, an aggregate net book value of $447 million and $474 million,
respectively, for the capital leases was recorded in premises and equipment in
our consolidated statement of condition, and the related liability was recorded
in long-term debt. Capital lease asset amortization is recorded in occupancy
expense over the lease terms. Lease payments are recorded as a reduction of the
liability, with a portion recorded as imputed interest expense. For the years
ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, interest expense related to these
capital lease obligations, recorded in net interest revenue, was $37 million
and $38 million, respectively.

We have entered into non-cancelable operating leases
for premises and equipment. Future minimum rental commitments in the preceding
table have been reduced by aggregate sublease rental commitments


of $151 million for
operating leases and $64 million for capital leases. Nearly all leases
include renewal options.

Total rental expense
amounted to $179 million, $181 million and $190 million in 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. Rental expense has been reduced by sublease revenue of $13
million, $10 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During 2005 and 2004, we entered into
sub-lease agreements for our headquarters building and other office space in
Boston. These sub-lease agreements resulted in the recognition of charges to
occupancy expense of $26 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively.

Current and deferred income taxes from continuing operations
for 2005 and 2004 have been reclassified to reflect tax returns as actually
filed. The income tax expense (benefit) related to net realized securities
gains or losses was $6 million, $(1) million and $10 million for 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. Pre-tax income from continuing operations
attributable to operations located outside the U. S. was $759 million,
$494 million and $424 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

For those foreign subsidiaries for which accumulated
earnings of the subsidiary are considered to be permanently invested, no
provision for deferred U.S. income taxes is recorded. The total undistributed


retained earnings of these
subsidiaries was $324 million at December 31, 2006. If the accumulated
earnings in these subsidiaries had been temporarily invested, a deferred U.S.
tax liability of $56 million would have been recorded.

Income tax expense from continuing operations for 2006
included an additional provision of $35 million primarily related to the
impact of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act, or “TIPRA,” on
income generated from certain of our leveraged leases, more fully described
below, and $46 million related to the potential resolution of issues with
the IRS concerning our LILO and SILO transactions. Additional information about
issues related to LILO and SILO transactions is in Note 10. Income tax expense
from continuing operations for 2004 included a cumulative benefit of $18
million resulting from a change in the effective state tax rate applied to
leveraged lease transactions.

During 2006, TIPRA repealed the federal income tax
exclusion, effective on January 1, 2007, which was previously allowed for
a portion of the income generated from certain leveraged leases of aircraft. As
a result of this legislation, and in accordance with existing lease accounting
standards, we recalculated the allocation of the components of leasing-related
income over the terms of the affected leases and recorded a non-cash charge to
income tax expense of approximately $35 million primarily related to the impact
of this legislation.

Note 22. Line of
Business Information

We report two lines of business: Investment Servicing
and Investment Management. Given our services and management organization, the
results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily
comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial
services industry.

Investment Servicing provides services for U.S. mutual
funds, collective investment funds worldwide, corporate and public retirement
plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and other investment
pools. Products include custody, accounting, daily pricing and administration;
master trust and


master custody;
recordkeeping; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services;
securities finance; deposit and short-term investment facilities; loans and
lease financing; investment manager and hedge fund manager operations
outsourcing; and performance, risk and compliance analytics to support
institutional investors. We provide shareholder services, which include mutual
fund and collective investment fund shareholder accounting, through 50%-owned
affiliates, Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. and the International
Financial Data Services group of companies.

Investment Management offers a broad array of services
for managing financial assets, including investment management and investment
research, primarily for institutional investors worldwide. These services
include passive and active U.S. and non-U.S. equity and fixed income investment
management strategies, and other related services, such as securities finance.

Revenue and expenses are directly charged or allocated
to the lines of business through management information systems. We price our
products and services on the basis of overall customer relationships and other
factors; therefore, revenue may not necessarily reflect market pricing on
products within the business lines in the same way it would for independent
business entities. Assets and liabilities are allocated according to rules that
support management’s strategic and tactical goals. Capital is allocated based
on risk-weighted assets employed and management’s judgment. Capital allocations
may not be representative of the capital that might be required if these lines
of business were independent business entities.

The
following is a summary of line of business results. These results exclude the
income (loss) from discontinued operations related to our divestiture of Bel
Air, more fully discussed in Note 2. The “Other/One-Time” column for 2005
includes the additional gain from our sale of the PAM business, more fully
discussed in Note 2. For 2004, this column includes merger and integration costs
related to the GSS acquisition.

Note 23. Non-U.S.
Activities

We define non-U.S. activities as those
revenue-producing assets and transactions that arise from customers domiciled
outside the United States. Due to the nature of our business, precise
segregation of U.S. and non-U.S. activities is not possible. Subjective
judgments have been used to arrive at operating results related to non-U.S.
activities, including the application of transfer pricing and asset and
liability management policies. Interest expense allocations are based on the
average cost of short-term borrowed funds.

The
following table summarizes non-U.S. operating results for the years ended December 31,
and assets as of December 31, based on the domicile location of customers:

Note 24. Fair
Values of Financial Instruments

Fair value estimates are generally subjective in
nature, and are made as of a specific point in time based on the
characteristics of the financial instruments and relevant market information.
Disclosure of fair values is not required for certain items, such as lease
financing, equity method investments, obligations for pension and other
postretirement plans, premises and equipment, other intangible assets and
income tax assets and liabilities. Accordingly, aggregate fair value amounts
presented do not purport to represent, and should not be considered
representative of, our underlying “market” or franchise value. In addition,
because of differences in methodologies and assumptions used to estimate fair
values, our fair values should not be compared to those of other financial
institutions.

We use the
following methods to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:

·

For
financial instruments that have quoted market prices, those quoted prices are
used to determine fair value.

·

Financial
instruments that have no defined maturity, have a remaining maturity of 180
days or less, or reprice frequently to a market rate are assumed to have a fair
value that approximates reported value, after taking into consideration any
applicable credit risk.


·

If
no quoted market prices are available, financial instruments are valued by
discounting the expected cash flow(s) using an estimated current market
interest rate for the financial instrument.

·

For
derivative financial instruments, fair value is estimated as the amount at
which an asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction
between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or sale.

The short maturity of our assets and liabilities
results in a significant number of financial instruments for which fair value
equals or closely approximates the value reported in our consolidated statement
of condition. These financial instruments are reported in the following
captions in the consolidated statement of condition: cash and due from banks;
interest-bearing deposits with banks; securities purchased under resale
agreements; accrued income receivable; deposits; securities sold under
repurchase agreements; federal funds purchased; and other short-term
borrowings. The fair value of trading account assets equals their reported
value. In addition, due to the relatively short-term nature of our net loans
(excluding leases), substantially all of which are due within one year, we have
determined that fair value approximates the reported value. Loan commitments
have no reported value because terms are at prevailing market rates.


The
reported value and fair value for other captions in the consolidated statement
of condition were as follows as of December 31:

(1)

Net interest margin is fully taxable-equivalent net
interest revenue divided by average interest-earning assets.

(2)

Fully taxable-equivalent revenue is a method of
presentation in which the tax savings achieved by investing in tax-exempt
securities are included in interest revenue with a corresponding charge to
income tax expense. This method facilitates the comparison of the performance
of tax-exempt and taxable securities. The adjustment is computed using a
federal income tax rate of 35%, adjusted for applicable state income taxes, net
of the related federal-tax benefit. The fully taxable-equivalent adjustments
included in interest revenue above were $45 million, $42 million and $45
million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

(3)

Non-U.S. noninterest-bearing deposits were $326
million, $122 million and $71 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.


The table below summarizes
changes in fully taxable-equivalent interest revenue and interest expense due
to changes in volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities, and changes in interest rates. Changes attributed to both volumes
and rates have been allocated based on the proportion of change in each
category.

CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES:
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

State Street has established and maintains disclosure
controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that material
information relating to State Street and its subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to State Street
management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. For
the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2006, State Street carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of State Street management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of State Street’s disclosure controls
and procedures. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and
procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that State Street’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,
2006.

State Street has also
established and maintains internal control over financial reporting as a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. In the ordinary course of business, State Street
routinely enhances its internal controls and procedures for financial reporting
by either upgrading its current systems or implementing new systems. Changes
have been made and will be made to State Street’s internal controls and
procedures for financial reporting as a result of these efforts. During the
fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2006, there was no change in State
Street’s internal control over financial reporting that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, State Street’s internal
control over financial reporting.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

Management’s Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of State Street is responsible for the
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements and other
financial information contained in this Form 10-K. Management is
also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting. Management has designed business processes and
internal controls and has also established and is responsible for maintaining a
business culture that fosters financial integrity and accurate reporting. To
these ends, management maintains a comprehensive system of internal controls
intended to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements of State Street in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. State Street’s accounting policies and internal controls over
financial reporting, established and maintained by management, are under the
general oversight of State Street’s Board of Directors, including State Street’s
Examining and Audit Committee.

Management has made a comprehensive review,
evaluation, and assessment of State Street’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006. The standard measures adopted by
management


in making its evaluation
are the measures in the Integrated Framework published by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO Framework).

Based upon its review and evaluation, management has
concluded that State Street’s internal control over financial reporting is
effective at December 31, 2006, and that there were no material weaknesses
in State Street’s internal control over financial reporting as of that date.

Ernst & Young
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which has audited and
reported on the consolidated financial statements contained in this Form 10-K,
has issued its written attestation report on management’s assessment of State
Street’s internal control over financial reporting which follows this report.

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS

STATE STREET CORPORATION

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, that State Street Corporation maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). State
Street Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s
assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.


In our opinion, management’s assessment that State
Street Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, State Street Corporation
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated statement of condition of State Street
Corporation as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 of State Street
Corporation and our report dated February 15, 2007 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.

One compensation plan under which equity securities of
State Street are authorized for issuance has been adopted without the approval
of shareholders.

In 2001, the Board adopted the State Street
Corporation Savings-Related Stock Plan, or “SAYE Plan,” for employees in the
United Kingdom. Under the SAYE Plan, employee-participants could commit to save
a specified amount from after-tax pay for a fixed period (either three or five
years). Savings are deducted automatically. At the end of the period chosen, a
tax-free bonus is added by State Street to the savings amount (the level of the
bonus depends on the length of the fixed period of savings), and participants
have the option to receive the savings and bonus amount in cash, or to use the
amount to purchase common stock from State Street at an exercise price equal to
the market price of the stock as of the date of joining the SAYE Plan less a
discount fixed by State Street at the date of joining. For participants joining
the SAYE Plan in 2001, the discount was 15%. There was no discount for
participants joining in 2002. Options granted under the SAYE Plan are
non-transferable. If a participant withdraws from participation before the end
of the fixed period, the options to purchase stock are forfeited. If a
participant terminates during the period due to retirement, disability,
redundancy or sale of the employer from State Street’s group, the options may
be exercised within six months of the occurrence, or one year if by reason of
death. Under the SAYE Plan, an aggregate of 170,000 shares of common stock was
authorized for issuance. The SAYE Plan has been discontinued and no new
participations under the SAYE Plan are permitted. At December 31, 2006, a
total of 24,000 shares of common stock are eligible to be purchased under
outstanding options.


In addition, individual directors who are not our
employees have received annual awards of deferred stock for a number of shares
based on the amount of their annual retainer, payable after the director leaves
the Board or attains a specific age. The number of deferred shares includes, in
the case of certain directors, additional deferred share amounts in respect of
an accrual under a terminated retirement plan, and for all directors is
increased to reflect dividends paid on the common stock. Also, directors who
are not our employees may receive their annual retainer payable at their option
either in shares of our common stock or cash, and may further elect to defer
either 50% or 100% until after termination of their services as a director. The
number of deferred shares is increased to reflect dividends paid on the common
stock. A total of 211,000 shares of common stock were outstanding at
December 31, 2006; awards made through June 30, 2003 have not been
approved by shareholders. Awards of deferred stock made or non-deferred
retainer shares paid to individual directors after June 30, 2003 have been
or will be made under our 1997 or 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, approved by
shareholders.
