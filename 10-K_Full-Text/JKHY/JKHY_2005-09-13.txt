 Item 1.  Business

 Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. ("JHA" or the "Company") is a leading provider
 of integrated  computer systems  providing  data processing  and  management
 information to  banks,  credit  unions, other  financial  and  non-financial
 institutions in the United States.  The Company was formed  in 1976 and made
 its initial public  offering in  1985.  Since  formation, JHA  has grown  by
 developing highly  specialized  products  and  services  for  its  financial
 institution customers,  acquiring  organizations that complement and add  to
 the infrastructure of the Company, retaining satisfied  customers and adding
 new customers.

 We  offer  a complete,  integrated suite of data processing system solutions
 to improve  our  customers'  management  of  their  entire  back-office  and
 customer/member interaction processes.  We believe our solutions enable  our
 financial institution customers to provide better service to their customers
 and compete  more  effectively  against  other  banks,  credit  unions,  and
 alternative financial institutions.  Our customers  either install  and  use
 our systems in-house or outsource these  operations to us.  We perform  data
 conversion  and  hardware  and  software installation for the implementation
 of our systems  and  integrated applications.  We  also  provide  continuing
 customer  support  services  to   ensure  proper  product  performance   and
 reliability, which  provides us  with  continuing client  relationships  and
 recurring revenue.  For our customers who prefer not to acquire hardware and
 software, we  provide outsourcing  services through  6  data  centers and 22
 item-processing centers located across the United States.

 Our gross revenue  has grown from  $366.9 million in  fiscal 2001 to  $535.9
 million in fiscal 2005, representing a compound annual growth rate over this
 five-year period  of 17%.  Net income from  continuing operations has  grown
 from $55.6 million in fiscal  2001 to $75.5 million  in fiscal 2005, also  a
 compound annual growth rate of 17%.

 Industry Background

 According to the Automation in Banking 2005 report, United States  financial
 institutions,  including  commercial  banks,  thrifts  and  credit   unions,
 increased spending on hardware, software, services and telecommunications to
 $45.9 billion  in  calendar  2004  from  $38.3  billion  in  calendar  2000,
 representing a compound annual growth rate of 5%.  There was an increase  in
 industry spending of 8% from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004.

 The Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation ("FDIC")  reported  there  were
 approximately 9,000 commercial and savings banks in the United States as  of
 December 31, 2004.  Our bank systems and services segment, which represented
 approximately  80% of  our  total revenues  in  fiscal  2005,  is  primarily
 commercial banks with less than $30.0 billion in assets, of which there were
 approximately 8,900 at December 31, 2004.  Consolidation within the  banking
 and savings services industry has resulted  in a 3% compound annual  decline
 in the population  of  commercial  banks  from calendar years  2000 to 2004.
 Even with the  decline in the  population, aggregate assets  of these  banks
 increased at an annual  compound rate of 8%  between calendar year 2000  and
 2004.  Comparing calendar year 2004 to 2003, new bank charters increased  8%
 and mergers increased 17%.

 Our other market  segment is credit union systems  and  services within  the
 United States.  The  National Credit Union  Association reported there  were
 approximately 9,200 credit unions  in the United States  as  of December 31,
 2004.  This segment represented approximately  20% of our total revenues  in
 fiscal 2005.  These  are  primarily  cooperative,  not-for-profit  financial
 institutions organized to promote savings and provide credit and services to
 their members.  Although the number of these credit unions has declined at a
 3% compound annual rate between calendar year 2000 and 2004, their aggregate
 assets have increased  at a  compound annual growth  rate of  10% to  $661.8
 billion at December 31, 2004.

 Commercial banks and credit unions play an important role  in the geographic
 and  demographic communities and with the  customers they serve.  Typically,
 customers and members of these financial  institutions rely on them  because
 of  their  ability  to  provide  personalized,  relationship-based  services
 while  focusing  on  retail,  commercial  and  business  needs.  We  believe
 these core  strengths  will  allow our  financial  institution customers  to
 effectively  compete  with  other   banks,  credit  unions  and  alternative
 financial institutions. In order to  succeed and to maintain strong customer
 relationships, we believe these banks and credit unions must:

        *  focus on  excellence in  delivery  to customers/members  of  their
           primary products and service offerings;

        *  sell more products  and  services  to existing  customers  through
           utilization of customer relationship management ("CRM") products;

        *  deploy products  and services  that  enable customers  to  conduct
           their banking transactions  through the channel  of  their choice,
           such as  internet banking  and  bill payment,  electronic  account
           statements, interactive voice  response systems  and  ATM delivery
           channels;

        *  capitalize on deposit  growth opportunities through  technological
           solutions that allow for remote deposit capture at the  merchant's
           place of business;

        *  manage by  using  products  and  services  that  deliver  business
           intelligence assimilated and analyzed on an automated basis;

        *  implement advanced  technologies and  services, such  as  enhanced
           security protection,  imaging for  all transactions  and  platform
           automation;

        *  use advanced  technologies  in back-office  processes  to  improve
           operating efficiency and control costs,  while increasing  service
           and lowering costs to their customers;

        *  introduce   new   revenue   generating   products   and   services
           complementing traditional  banking  services,  such  as  insurance
           products; and

        *  manage risks by implementing technology that monitors  and  tracks
           transactions for fraud and criminal behavior.

 According to Automation in  Banking 2005 and Callahan  &  Associates 2004 in
 calendar 2004  approximately 56%  of all  commercial banks  and 75%  of  all
 credit  unions utilized  in-house hardware  and  software systems to perform
 all of their  core  systems  and  data processing functions.  Off-site  data
 processing centers provided system services on  an outsourced basis for  44%
 of all banks and 25%  of all credit unions.  For a number of years,  we have
 been expanding our outsourcing services  and  capacity to include all of our
 core solution products.

 Internet banking, on-line bill payment, and other services for  individuals,
 plus cash management, Automated Clearing House ("ACH") management  and other
 services for the commercial customers of financial institutions continue  to
 grow rapidly within the industry. Callahan and Associates' 2005 Credit Union
 Technology Survey  reported  91%  of  credit  union  respondents  now  offer
 internet home  banking  and  87% offer  on-line  bill pay.  In  the  banking
 industry Grant Thornton's Twelfth Annual  Survey of Bank Executives  reports
 that 7 in 10  bankers promoted internet banking  and bill payment to  retain
 deposits in 2004 and  6 in 10  report plans to  emphasize these services  in
 2005.

 According to  Callahan  &  Associates 2004  Credit Union  Technology  Survey
 released  in  April  2005  95%   of  the  respondents  stated   multi-factor
 authentication or biometrics  technology was  a spending  priority in  2005,
 while 63%  of respondents  indicated new  full  service ATM  deployment  was
 necessary in 2005.

 Our Solution

 We are a  single-source provider of a comprehensive  and  flexible suite  of
 integrated products and services that address the information  and  security
 technology, and data processing needs  of financial institutions on  various
 hardware platforms  and  operating systems.  Our  business derives  revenues
 from three primary sources of revenue:

      *  software licenses;

      *  support and service fees which include implementation services; and

      *  hardware sales, which includes all non-software remarketed products.

 We develop  software applications  designed primarily  for use  on  hardware
 supporting IBM  and UNIX/NT  operating systems.   Our  marketed product  and
 service offerings are  centered on five  proprietary software  applications,
 each  comprising  the  core  data  processing  and  information   management
 functions of a commercial bank or credit  union.  Any of these core  systems
 can be utilized  either through an  in-house or  outsourced delivery  method
 depending on the financial institution's  management style  and  philosophy.
 Key functions of each  of our core  software  applications include deposits,
 loans,  general  ledger,  and  customer  information  file.   Our   software
 applications make  extensive use  of parameters  allowing our  customers  to
 tailor the software to their needs  without needing to customize or  program
 the  software.  Our software applications  are designed  to provide  maximum
 flexibility in meeting  our customer data  processing requirements within  a
 single, integrated system.  To complement our core software applications, we
 provide approximately 100 integrated complementary products and services for
 use on an in-house or an outsourced basis by financial institutions.

 The financial  services  industry  today is  highly  competitive,  with  new
 entrants  competing  for  market  share  of  traditional  banking  services,
 including the  formation  of  banking  affiliates  by  insurance  companies,
 brokerage firms  and  even retailers.  We believe  our integrated  solutions
 provide our  customers  with  tools  and  strategies  to increase  revenues,
 contain costs,  and deliver  premium  customer  services.  Specifically  our
 integrated products and services enable them to:

        *  Implement  Advanced  Technologies  with  Full  Functionality.  Our
           comprehensive suite of products  and  services is designed to meet
           our  customers'  information  technology  needs  through   custom-
           tailored  solutions  using  proprietary  software  products.   Our
           clients can either  perform these functions  themselves  on an in-
           house basis through the implementation of our software systems  or
           outsource those functions to us.

        *  Rapidly  Deploy  New  Products  and  Services.  Once  a  financial
           institution has implemented our core software, either in-house  or
           on an outsourced basis, we  can quickly and efficiently  implement
           additional applications and functions.  This allows our  customers
           to rapidly deploy new products and services for their clients  and
           members while generating new  revenue streams.  We offer state-of-
           the-art  solutions  with  the   latest  technology  which   allows
           financial  institutions  to   concentrate  on  critical   business
           processes while attending to  the needs  of  their customers.  Our
           products include a full suite of ATM management products,  a suite
           of fraud detection  and prevention products,  a  suite of document
           and check  image products,  ACH and  remote merchant  capture  and
           electronic clearing  services  and  a  fingerprint  authentication
           solution utilizing biometric security.

        *  Integrate  with  Other  Solutions.  Our open  system  architecture
           "jXchange" will  allow for  easier integration  between  products,
           whether it is a JHA product or an application from another vendor,
           to allow the customer to best meet their particular needs.

        *  Focus on Customer Relationships.  Our products and services  allow
           our customers  to  stay  focused  on  their  primary  business  of
           gaining, maintaining  and expanding  their customer  relationships
           while providing the  latest technology in  financial products  and
           services.

        *  Access Outsourcing  Solutions to  Improve Operating  Efficiency.
           Customers utilizing our outsourcing solutions benefit from  access
           to all of  our products and  services without  having to  maintain
           personnel to update and  run these systems  and without having  to
           make  large  up-front  capital  expenditures  to  implement  these
           advanced technologies.

        *  Solve Complex Business Operating Needs.  Our customers' businesses
           have become more complex and carry added regulatory and  reporting
           burdens  unique  to financial  institutions.  Customers using  our
           unique products specifically developed  to satisfy niche,  complex
           business issues can  contain costs, and  have increased levels  of
           accuracy and provide assurance that the customer is in  compliance
           with regulatory requirements.

        *  Manage  Risk.  We  offer  a  range  of  solutions  that  help  our
           customers manage  operational risks,  including disaster  recovery
           services, biometric security, and software designed to detect  and
           react to fraudulent transactions.

 Our Strategy

 Our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings organically,  supplemented
 by strategic acquisitions.  The key components of our business strategy  are
 to:

        *  Provide High  Quality, Value-Added  Products and  Services to  Our
           Clients.  We compete on the basis of providing our customers  with
           the highest-value products and services in the market.  We believe
           we have achieved  a reputation as  a premium  product and  service
           provider.

        *  Continue  to  Expand  Our  Product  and  Service  Offerings.    We
           continually upgrade  our core software applications and expand our
           complementary  product  and  service   offerings  to  respond   to
           technological  advances  and  the  changing  requirements  of  our
           clients.  For  example, we offer  several turn-key solutions  that
           enable  financial  institutions  to rapidly  deploy  sophisticated
           and state-of-the-art  new  products and services.  Our  integrated
           solutions enable  our  customers  to  offer  competitive  services
           relative to larger banks and alternative  financial  institutions.
           We intend  to  continue  to expand  Internet  solutions,  security
           solutions, exception  management  reporting,  document  management
           solutions and other products and services.

        *  Expand Our Existing Customer Relationships.   We seek to  increase
           the information technology and  security products and services  we
           provide to those customers that do  not utilize our full range  of
           products  and  services.  In this  way, we  are able  to  increase
           revenues from current customers with minimal additional sales  and
           marketing expenses.

        *  Extend Our Markets.  We now market and sell products and  services
           to virtually  any financial  institution regardless  of what  core
           processing  solution  is   utilized,  effectively  extending   our
           targeted market for selected complementary products to over 16,000
           additional financial institutions in the United States, as well as
           additional vertical industries.

        *  Adopt  Open  Integration  Standards.    We  are  increasing    our
           utilization of  more open  integration standards  through  Service
           Oriented  Architecture  and  Web  Services  through  our  jXchange
           integration tools enabling increased interoperability between  our
           products and services and those of third parties.

        *  Expand  Our  Customer  Base.   We  seek  to   establish  long-term
           relationships with new customers through our sales  and  marketing
           efforts and selected acquisitions.  As  of June 30, 2005, we  have
           over 6,900 customers, an  increase of 142%  from fiscal 2000  with
           2,850 customers.

        *  Build Recurring Revenue.  We  enter into contracts with  customers
           to provide services that meet their ongoing information technology
           needs.  We provide  ongoing  software  support  for  our  in-house
           customers.  Additionally,  we  provide  data  processing  for  our
           outsourcing customers and ATM and debit card transaction switching
           services, both on contracts that  typically extend for periods  of
           five to ten years.

        *  Maximize Economies of Scale.  We strive to develop and maintain  a
           sufficiently large  client  base  to create  economies  of  scale,
           enabling us to provide value-priced  products and services to  our
           clients while expanding our operating margins.

        *  Attract and Retain Capable Employees.   We believe attracting  and
           retaining high-quality  employees is  essential to  our  continued
           growth and success.  Our corporate culture focuses on the needs of
           employees; a  strategy  which  has  contributed  to  low  employee
           turnover.

 Our Acquisitions

 To complement and  accelerate our  internal growth,  we selectively  acquire
 companies that provide us with one or more of the following:

        *  products and services to complement our existing offerings;

        *  new customers;

        *  entry into new markets within financial services as well as  other
           vertical markets; and/or.

 Our Products and Services

 Changing  technologies,  business  practices  and  financial  products  have
 resulted in issues  of compatibility, scalability  and increased  complexity
 for the hardware  and  software  used  in  many  financial institutions.  We
 have  responded  to  these  issues by developing a fully integrated suite of
 products and services  consisting  of core software systems,  hardware,  and
 complementary products and services.

 We provide our full range of products and services to financial institutions
 on either an in-house or outsourced basis. For those customers who prefer to
 purchase systems for their in-house facilities, we contract to sell computer
 hardware with the  licenses for core  and  complementary software.  We  also
 contract to  provide installation,  data  conversion, training  and  ongoing
 support, and other services along with other services to assist customers in
 management of operation efficiencies.

 We also  offer  our full  suite  of software  products  and services  on  an
 outsourced basis to customers who do  not wish to maintain, update, and  run
 these systems or to  make large up-front  capital expenditures to  implement
 these  advanced  technologies.  Our  principal  outsourcing service  is  the
 delivery of mission-critical data processing services using our data centers
 located within  the  United  States.  We  provide our  outsourcing  services
 through an extensive national data and service center network, comprised  of
 6 data centers and 22 item-processing centers.  We monitor and maintain  our
 network on a seven-day, 24-hour basis.  Customers typically pay monthly fees
 on service contracts of up to 5 years for these services.

 While it is  our goal to  provide the full  suite of  solutions a  financial
 institution may  require, we  recognize the  reality that  a number  of  our
 clients will  wish to  deploy some  technology solutions  provided by  other
 companies.  Accordingly, we are deploying enhanced integration  capabilities
 with third party solutions.  This  is particularly important as we  continue
 to expand  our presence  in the  mid-tier banking  space, defined  as  banks
 ranging from $1 to $30 billion in assets.

 Information regarding  the  classification  of our  business  into  separate
 segments serving the  banking and credit  union industries is  set forth  in
 Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (see item 8 below).

 Hardware Systems

 Our software operates  on a variety  of hardware systems.   We have  entered
 into remarketing  agreements with  IBM Corporation,  Avnet, Inc.  and  other
 hardware providers which  allow us to  purchase hardware at  a discount  and
 sell (remarket) it  to our  customers.  We  currently sell  the IBM  eServer
 systems (iSeries, pSeries and xSeries);  IBM workstations; Dell servers  and
 workstations; NCR, BancTec  and Unisys check  transports; and  a variety  of
 other devices that complement our software solutions.

 We have a long-term strategic relationship  with IBM, dating to the  initial
 design of our first core software applications 29 years ago.  In addition to
 our remarketing agreement with IBM, which  we regularly renew, we have  been
 named a "Premier Business Partner" of IBM for the last thirteen consecutive
 years.  Our relationship with IBM provides us with a substantial and ongoing
 source of revenue.

 Biometrics is  the latest  technology in  security  for financial  and  non-
 financial institutions.  We offer a fingerprint scanner along with flexible,
 state-of-the-art software  components which  provide the  framework for  the
 complete suite of applications.

 In continuing our  belief of being  a 'complete solution',  we also offer  a
 full line of financial institution forms required for day-to-day operations,
 year-end tax forms, plus office and operating supplies for their  equipment.

 Core Software Applications

 Each of  our  core software  systems  consists of  several  fully-integrated
 application modules,  such  as  deposits, loans,  general  ledger,  and  the
 customer information file, which is  a centralized file containing  customer
 data for all  applications.  We  can custom-tailor  these modules  utilizing
 parameters determined by our customers.  The  applications can be  connected
 to  a  wide  variety  of  peripheral  hardware  devices  used  in  financial
 institutions' operations.  Our  software  is  designed  to  provide  maximum
 flexibility in meeting our customers' data processing requirements within  a
 single system to minimize data entry and improve operational efficiencies.

 For a customer who  chooses to acquire  in-house capabilities, we  generally
 license our core system under a  standard license agreement, which  provides
 the customer with a fully paid,  nonexclusive, nontransferable right to  use
 the software on a single computer and at  a single location.  The same  core
 software system can be delivered on an outsourced basis as well.

 Our core software applications are differentiated broadly by customer  size,
 scalability, functionality,  customer  competitive  environment  and,  to  a
 lesser extent, cost.  Our core applications include:

 Bank Systems and Services Segment

        *  Silverlake  System[R]  operates  on  the  IBM  iSeries  processing
           platform and is used primarily by banks with total assets  ranging
           from $500 million to $30.0 billion;

        *  CIF 20/20[R] operates on the  IBM iSeries processing platform  and
           is primarily used by and targeted to banks ranging from de novo up
           to $1.0 billion in assets;

        *  Core Director[R]  operates on  the Windows  Server-based  platform
           employing client/server technology  and is primarily  used by  and
           targeted to  banks ranging  from de  novo up  to $1.0  billion  in
           assets.

 Credit Union Systems and Services Segment

        *  Episys[R] operates on the IBM  pSeries processing platform with  a
           UNIX/NT operating system  and is used  primarily by credit  unions
           with  total  assets  greater  than  $50.0  million.  According  to
           Callahan and Associates 2005 Credit Union Directory, our Episys[R]
           core product is the most widely installed data processing solution
           among credit  unions  with assets  exceeding  $25 million  in  the
           United States.

        *  Cruise[R]  operates  on  the   IBM  xSeries  platform,   utilizing
           Microsoft SQL Server  with a 100%  Windows[R] interface,  allowing
           all data available with 'point and  click' simplicity.  Cruise  is
           used primarily  by credit  unions with  total assets  under  $50.0
           million.

 Complementary Products and Services

 In years past  our strategy has  been focused on  two fronts; acquiring  new
 core banking and credit union clients, and selling additional  complementary
 products and services to those banks  and credit unions that were using  our
 core solutions.  We did not  generally offer our complementary products  and
 services to banks  or credit  unions that  were not  using one  of our  core
 processing  solutions.  With our acquisitions  in recent years,  we are  now
 marketing and selling selected complementary products and solutions to banks
 and  credit  unions  regardless  of  which  core  processing  solutions  the
 financial institutions are using.  Thus, in today's environment we now  have
 essentially two categories of complementary products: 1) those that we offer
 only  to those banks or credit unions  that use one  of our core  processing
 solutions,  and  2)  those  that  we  offer  to  any  financial  institution
 regardless of core provider, which are primarily those products and services
 we acquired in 2004 and 2005.

 We offer  the banks  and  credit unions  using  Jack Henry  core  processing
 systems  approximately   100  complementary  products  or  services.   These
 products have been developed and designed to assist banks and credit  unions
 accomplish specific  business  strategies.  Our  complementary products  are
 categorized into product  families  by particular  business  strategy needs.
 The product families and  a sample of some  of the solutions offered  within
 each family are as follows:

 Implementation and Training

 Although  not  a  requirement,  the  majority  of  our  customers   contract
 separately with us  for implementation and  training services in  connection
 with  their  purchase  of  in-house  systems.  The  complete  implementation
 process  of  a  core  system  typically  includes  planning,  design,   data
 conversion, and testing.  At the  culmination  of this  process, one of  our
 implementation  teams  travels  to  our  customer's  facilities   to  ensure
 the smooth  transfer  of data  to  the  new  system.  Separate  charges  for
 implementation fees are  billed to our  customers on either  a fixed fee  or
 hourly charge model depending  on the system.   Implementation and  training
 services are also required in connection with new outsourcing customers, and
 are billed separately at the time of installation.

 Both in connection  with implementation  of new  systems and  on an  ongoing
 basis, we provide extensive  training services and  programs related to  our
 products and  services.   Training  is  provided in  our  regional  training
 centers, at meetings and conferences, onsite at our customers' locations, or
 online with JHA  Webex. Training can  be customized to  meet our  customers'
 requirements.  The large majority of our customers acquire training services
 from us, both to improve their  employees' proficiency and productivity  and
 to make full use of the  complete functionality  of our systems.  Generally,
 training services  are  paid  for  on  an  hourly  basis  or  as  an  annual
 subscription, representing blocks of training time  that can be used by  our
 customers in a flexible fashion.

 Support and Services

 Following the implementation of our integrated software at a customer  site,
 we provide  ongoing software  support services  to assist  our customers  in
 operating the systems.  We also offer support services for hardware systems,
 primarily through  our  hardware  suppliers, providing  customers  who  have
 contracted  for  this  service  with  "one-call"   system  support  covering
 hardware and software applications.

 Support is provided  through a 24-hour  telephone service  available to  our
 customers seven days a week.  Our experienced support staff can resolve most
 questions and problems  quickly.  For  more complicated  issues, our  staff,
 with our customers' permission and assistance, can log on to our  customers'
 systems  remotely.  We  maintain  our  customers' software  largely  through
 releases  which   contain   enhancements   and   additional   features   and
 functionality.  Updates  are  issued  also  when  required  by  changes   in
 applicable laws and regulations.  We provide support services on all of  our
 core systems as well  as our complementary  software products regardless  of
 whether it is delivered in-house or outsourced.

 In 2005, we introduced expanded company-wide support tools and  capabilities
 through a suite of customer relationship management products from PeopleSoft
 which we refer to internally as  jSource.  jSource provides the ability  for
 customers to  utilize the  internet to  initiate support  services,  request
 customization and to  track the status  of any  customer initiated  projects
 online.  The system  is designed to provide  us with comprehensive views  of
 our customers and  the ability to  view events, sales  activity or  service-
 related issues that may transpire with each customer.  jSource was initially
 rolled out for  customer service  and will be  expanded into  the sales  and
 marketing aspects of our business throughout the next 12 to 18 months.

 Nearly all of our  in-house customers contract  for annual support  services
 from us.  These services are a significant source of recurring revenue,  and
 are  contracted  for  on  an  annual  basis  and  are  typically  priced  at
 approximately 18 to 20% of the  particular software product's  license  fee.
 These fees generally increase as our customers' asset  base increases and as
 they increase  the level  of functionality  of  their system  by  purchasing
 additional complementary  products.   Software  support fees  are  generally
 billed at June 30 and are paid in  advance for the entire fiscal year,  with
 pro-ration for new contracts that start during the year at the time of final
 conversion.  Hardware support fees are  also paid in advance for the  entire
 contract  period  that  ranges  from  one  to  five  years.  Most  contracts
 automatically renew  annually  unless our  customer  or we  give  notice  of
 termination at least  60  days  prior to  expiration.  Identical support  is
 provided to our outsourced customers by  the same support personnel,  but is
 included as part  of their  overall monthly  fees and  therefore  not billed
 separately.

 Research and Development

 We devote significant effort  and expense to  develop new software,  service
 products  and  continually  upgrade  and  enhance  our  existing  offerings.
 Typically, we  upgrade  our  core software  applications  and  complementary
 services once per year.  We believe our research and development efforts are
 highly efficient because  of the extensive  experience of  our research  and
 development staff and  because our product  development is highly  customer-
 driven.  Through  our regular  contact  with  customers  through  formalized
 product Focus Groups, Change Control Boards, structured strategic  meetings,
 at annual user group  meetings, sales contacts  and our ongoing  maintenance
 services, our customers inform  us of the  new products and  functionalities
 they desire.  Research and development  expenses for fiscal 2005, 2004,  and
 2003 were $27.7 million, $23.7 million, and $15.9 million, respectively.

 Sales and Marketing

 Our primary markets consist of commercial banks and credit unions with  some
 products being utilized in other verticals and sold through our sales  staff
 or channel partners.

 Dedicated sales  forces, inside  sales teams,  and technical  sales  support
 teams conduct  our  sales efforts  for  our  two market  segments,  and  are
 overseen by regional  sales managers.  Our dedicated  sales  executives  are
 responsible for sales activities focused  on  acquiring  new core customers.
 Our account executives nurture long-term relationships with our client  base
 and cross sell  our  many complementary  products and services.  Our  inside
 sales force  markets specific  complementary products  and services  to  our
 existing customers.  We  also have a dedicated  sales force responsible  for
 new customers for our acquired businesses targeted outside our core customer
 base.   All  sales  force  personnel  have  responsibility  for  a  specific
 territory.  The sales support teams  write business proposals and  contracts
 and prepare responses  to request-for-proposals regarding  our software  and
 hardware solutions.  All  of our sales professionals  receive a base  salary
 and performance-based commission compensation.

 Our marketing efforts consist of sponsorship and attendance at trade  shows,
 e-mail newsletters, print media advertisement placements, telemarketing, and
 national and regional  marketing campaigns.  We  also  conduct  a number  of
 national user group  meetings each year,  which enable us  to keep in  close
 contact with  our customers  and demonstrate  new products  and services  to
 them.

 We continue  to sell  and support  selected products  and solutions  in  the
 Caribbean, and  now have  installations in  Europe and  South America  as  a
 result of our recent acquisitions.  Our international sales  have  accounted
 for less than 1% of our total revenues in each of the three years ended June
 30, 2005, 2004, and 2003.

 Backlog

 Our backlog consists of contracted in-house products and services (prior  to
 delivery) and  the remaining  portion of  outsourcing contracts,  which  are
 typically for five-year  periods, and approximately  represents the  minimum
 guaranteed payments over the remainder of the contract period.  Our  backlog
 at June 30, 2005  was $64.0 million for  in-house products and services  and
 $135.1 million  for outsourcing  services, with  a total  backlog of  $199.1
 million.  Of  the  $135.1  million amount  of  the backlog  for  outsourcing
 service at June 30, 2005, approximately $98.0 million is not expected to  be
 realized in our current fiscal year due  to the long-term nature of many  of
 our outsourcing  service contracts.   Backlog  at June  30, 2004  was  $67.2
 million  for  in-house  products  and   services  and  $124.1  million   for
 outsourcing services, with a total backlog of $191.3 million.  Our  in-house
 backlog is subject to seasonal variations  and can fluctuate quarterly.  Our
 outsourcing  backlog  continues   to  experience  solid   growth  with   new
 contracting activity  and  as we  recognize  revenue throughout  the  coming
 fiscal year, the backlog is expected  to remain constant due to the  revenue
 surpassing the new contracting activity.

 Competition

 The  market  for  companies  providing  technology  solutions  to  financial
 institutions is competitive and fragmented,  and we expect continued  strong
 competition from  both  existing  competitors  and  companies  entering  our
 existing or future  markets.  Some  of our current  competitors have  longer
 operating histories, larger customer bases, and greater financial resources.
 The  principal competitive  factors affecting  the market  for our  services
 include comprehensiveness of the  applications, features and  functionality,
 flexibility and  ease of  use, customer  support, references  from  existing
 customers and price.  We compete  with large vendors that offer  transaction
 processing  products  and  services  to  financial  institutions,  including
 Fidelity National Financial Inc., Fiserv, Inc., and Metavante. In  addition,
 we compete with  a number of  providers that offer  one or more  specialized
 products  or  services.  There  has  been  significant  consolidation  among
 providers of  information  technology  products and  services  to  financial
 institutions, and we believe this consolidation will continue in the future.

 Intellectual Property, Patents, and Trademarks

 Although we believe that  our success depends  upon our technical  expertise
 more than  on our  proprietary rights,  our future  success and  ability  to
 compete depends in part upon our proprietary technology.  We have registered
 or filed applications for our primary trademarks.  Most of our technology is
 not  patented.  Instead, we rely on a combination of contractual rights  and
 copyrights, trademarks  and  trade  secrets to  establish  and  protect  our
 proprietary technology.  We generally enter into confidentiality  agreements
 with  our  employees,  consultants,  resellers,  customers,  and   potential
 customers.  We restrict  access to and distribution  of our source code  and
 further limit  the disclosure  and use  of  other  proprietary  information.
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized  parties
 may attempt to copy  or otherwise obtain  or use our products or technology.
 We  cannot  be  certain  that  the  steps taken  by us  in this  regard will
 be  adequate   to  prevent  misappropriation  of  our  technology,  or  that
 our  competitors  will  not  independently  develop  technologies  that  are
 substantially equivalent or superior to our technology.

 Government Regulation

 The financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex  federal
 and state regulation.  Our current and prospective customers, which  consist
 of financial  institutions  such  as  community/regional  banks  and  credit
 unions, operate  in  markets  that are  subject  to  substantial  regulatory
 oversight and supervision.  We  must ensure our  products and services  work
 within the extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to  our
 customers, including but not  limited to those  under the federal  truth-in-
 lending and  truth-in-savings  rules,  the  Privacy  of  Consumer  Financial
 Information regulations, usury laws, the  Equal Credit Opportunity Act,  the
 Fair Housing  Act,  the  Electronic Funds  Transfer  Act,  the  Fair  Credit
 Reporting Act, the Bank Secrecy Act,  the USA Patriot Act, the  Gramm-Leach-
 Bliley Act,  and the  Community Reinvestment  Act.   The compliance  of  our
 products and  services  with these  requirements  depends on  a  variety  of
 factors including the particular  functionality, the interactive design  and
 the classification of  customers.  Our customers  must assess and  determine
 what is required of them under  these regulations and they contract with  us
 to ensure that our products and services conform to their  regulatory  needs
 It is not possible to predict the impact any of these regulations could have
 on our business in the future.

 We are not chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, the Board
 of Governors  of  the Federal  Reserve  System, the  National  Credit  Union
 Administration or other federal or state agencies that regulate or supervise
 depository institutions.  The services provided by our OutLink Data  Centers
 are subject to examination by the Federal Financial Institution  Examination
 Council regulators under the  Bank Service Company  Act.  On occasion  these
 services are also subject to examination by state banking authorities.

 We provide outsourced  data and item  processing through our  geographically
 dispersed OutLink Data  Centers, electronic  transaction processing  through
 PassPort  ATM  and  Select  Payment,  Internet  banking  through  NetTeller,
 Internet Teller and MemberConnect online banking, and bank business recovery
 services through  Centurion Disaster  Recovery.  As  a service  provider  to
 financial institutions, our operations are  governed by the same  regulatory
 requirements as those imposed on financial institutions.  We are subject  to
 periodic  review  by  Federal  Financial  Institution  Examination   Council
 regulators who have broad supervisory  authority to remedy any  shortcomings
 identified in such reviews.

 Employees

 As of June 30, 2005  and  2004, we had 2,989 and 2,533  full time employees,
 respectively.  Of our employees,  approximately  600  are  employed  in  the
 credit  union segment  of our business,  with the remainder  employed in the
 bank business segment or in general and administrative functions  that serve
 both segments.  Our  employees  are  not  covered by a collective bargaining
 agreement and there have been  no labor-related work stoppages.  We consider
 our relationship with our employees to be good.

                                RISK FACTORS

 The Company's business  and the results  of its operations  are affected  by
 numerous  factors and uncertainties,  some of  which are beyond our control.
 The following is  a description of  some of the  important risk factors  and
 uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the Company's  operations
 in future  periods to  differ materially  from those  currently expected  or
 desired.

 Changes within the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for
 our  products.  In the current  environment of low  interest rates,  revenue
 growth at many commercial banks and credit unions has stagnated.  Many banks
 and credit unions have been slow to resume their capital spending, including
 spending on computer software and hardware, affecting both our sales to  new
 customers and upgrade/complementary product sales to existing customers.

 We  may  not  be  able  to  manage  growth.   We have grown  both internally
 and through acquisitions.  Our  expansion has  and  will  continue  to place
 significant  demands  on  our  administrative,  operational,  financial  and
 management personnel and systems.  We cannot assure you that we will be able
 to  enhance  and  expand  our  product   lines,  manage  costs,  adapt   our
 infrastructure and modify our systems to accommodate future growth.

 If we fail to adapt our products  and  services  to  changes  in technology,
 we  could  lose existing customers  and  be unable to  attract new business.
 The markets  for  our  software  and  hardware  products  and  services  are
 characterized by  changing  customer requirements  and  rapid  technological
 changes.  These  factors  and  new  product introductions  by  our  existing
 competitors or  by new  market  entrants could  reduce  the demand  for  our
 existing products and services and we may be required to develop or  acquire
 new products and services.  Our  future success is dependent on  our ability
 to enhance our  existing products  and services in  a timely  manner and  to
 develop or acquire  new products and services.  If we are unable to  develop
 or acquire new products and services  as planned, or fail to achieve  timely
 market acceptance of our new or enhanced products and services, we may incur
 unanticipated expenses, lose sales or fail to achieve anticipated revenues.

 Our growth may be  affected if we  are unable to  find or complete  suitable
 acquisitions.  We have augmented the growth of our business with a number of
 acquisitions and  we plan  to continue  to acquire  appropriate  businesses,
 products and services.  This  strategy depends on  our ability to  identify,
 negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions.  Substantial recent merger  and
 acquisition activity  in  our industry  has  affected the  availability  and
 pricing  of  such  acquisitions.  If  we  are  unable  to  acquire  suitable
 acquisition candidates, we may experience slower growth.

 Acquisitions may be costly and difficult  to integrate.  We have acquired  a
 number of  businesses  in  the  last  year  and  will  continue  to  explore
 acquisitions  in the future.  We may not  be able to successfully  integrate
 acquired  companies.  We  may  encounter  problems in  connection  with  the
 integration of  new businesses  including:  financial control  and  computer
 system compatibility; unanticipated costs; unanticipated quality or customer
 problems with  acquired  products  or services;  diversion  of  management's
 attention; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers
 and customers; loss of key employees; and significant amortization  expenses
 related to identifiable intangible assets.  Without additional acquisitions,
 we may not  be able  to grow and  to develop  new products  and services  as
 quickly as we  have in  the past  to  meet  competitive challenges.  If  our
 integration strategies fail,  our  business, financial condition and results
 of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

 If our strategic  relationship with  IBM were  terminated, it  could have  a
 negative  impact  on  the  continuing  success  of  our  business.  We  have
 developed a strategic relationship with IBM.  As part of this  collaborative
 relationship, we market and sell IBM hardware and equipment to our customers
 under an  IBM  Business Partner  Agreement  and resell  maintenance  on  IBM
 hardware products  to  our  customers.  Much  of  our  software  is designed
 to  be  compatible  with  the  IBM hardware that is run by a majority of our
 customers.  If IBM were to  terminate or fundamentally modify our  strategic
 relationship, our  relationship  with our  customers  and our  revenues  and
 earnings could  suffer.   We could  also lose  software market  share or  be
 required to redesign existing products or develop new products that would be
 compatible with the hardware used by our customers.

 Competition may  result in  price reductions  and decreased  demand for  our
 products and services.  We expect  that competition in the markets we  serve
 will  remain  vigorous.   We  compete  on  the  basis  of  product  quality,
 reliability, performance, ease of use, quality of support, integration  with
 other products and pricing.  We cannot  guarantee that  we  will be able  to
 compete  successfully  with  our  existing  competitors  or  with  companies
 entering our markets in the future.  Certain of our competitors have  strong
 financial, marketing  and  technological resources  and,  in some  cases,  a
 larger customer base than we do.  They may be able to adapt more quickly  to
 new or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the promotion
 and sale of their products and services.

 The loss of key employees could adversely affect our business.  We depend to
 a significant  extent  on the  contributions  and abilities  of  our  senior
 management.  Our  Company has grown  significantly in recent  years and  our
 management remains concentrated  in a small number of key employees.  If  we
 lose one or more of our key employees,  we could suffer a loss of sales  and
 delays in new product development, and management resources would have to be
 diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss.  We do not  have
 employment agreements with any of our  executive officers.  We do,  however,
 have a management succession plan in place.

 Consolidation of financial institutions will  continue to reduce the  number
 of our customers and  potential customers.  Our  primary market consists  of
 approximately 9,000 commercial  banks (includes savings & loans)  and  9,200
 credit unions.  The  number  of  commercial  banks  and  credit  unions  has
 decreased because of mergers and acquisitions over the last several  decades
 and  is  expected  to  continue  to  decrease  as more consolidation occurs,
 which  will  reduce our number  of  potential  customers.  Because  of  this
 consolidation, some of our existing customers could terminate, or refuse  to
 renew their  contracts  with us  and  potential customers  could  break  off
 negotiations with us.

 The  services  we  provide  to  our  customers  are  subject  to  government
 regulation that could hinder our ability to develop portions of our business
 or impose additional constraints on the way we conduct our operations.   The
 financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal  and
 state regulation.  As a supplier of services to financial institutions, some
 of our  operations are  examined by  the Office  of the  Comptroller of  the
 Currency, the  Federal  Reserve  Board and  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance
 Corporation, among  other  regulatory  agencies.   These  agencies  regulate
 services we provide and the manner in which we operate, and we are  required
 to  comply  with  a broad  range  of applicable  laws  and  regulations.  In
 addition, existing  laws,  regulations, and  policies  could be  amended  or
 interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that has a negative impact
 on  our  existing operations or that  limits our future growth or expansion.
 Our customers  are  also  regulated  entities,  and  actions  by  regulatory
 authorities could  determine both  the decisions  they make  concerning  the
 purchase  of  data  processing  and  other  services  and  the  timing   and
 implementation of these decisions.  The provision of financial services over
 the Internet has raised concerns with  respect to the use,  confidentiality,
 and security of private customer information.  Regulatory agencies, Congress
 and state  legislatures are  considering numerous  regulatory and  statutory
 proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance by
 the industry with standards and policies that have not been defined.

 Network or  Internet  security  problems could  damage  our  reputation  and
 business.  We rely on standard  network and Internet security systems,  most
 of which  we  license  from  third parties,  to  provide  the  security  and
 authentication necessary to  effect secure transmission  of data.   Computer
 networks and the  Internet are vulnerable  to unauthorized access,  computer
 viruses and other disruptive  problems.  In  addition, advances in  computer
 capabilities, new discoveries in the field  of cryptography or other  events
 or developments may render our security measures inadequate.  Someone who is
 able  to  circumvent  security  measures  could  misappropriate  proprietary
 information or  cause  interruptions  in our  operations  or  those  of  our
 customers.  Security risks may result in liability to us and also may  deter
 financial institutions from purchasing our products.  We may need to  expend
 significant capital  or other  resources protecting  against the  threat  of
 security breaches or alleviating problems  caused by breaches.   Eliminating
 computer viruses  and  alleviating other  security  problems may  result  in
 interruptions, delays or cessation of service  to users, any of which  could
 harm our business.

 As technology becomes less expensive and  more advanced, purchase prices  of
 hardware  may  decline  and  our  revenues  and  profits  from   remarketing
 arrangements  may  decrease.   Computer  hardware  technology   is   rapidly
 developing.  Hardware  manufacturers are producing  less expensive and  more
 powerful equipment each year, and we expect this trend to continue into  the
 future.  As computer hardware becomes  less expensive, revenues and  profits
 derived from  our hardware  remarketing may  decrease and  become a  smaller
 portion of our revenues and profits.

 An  operational  failure  in  our  outsourcing  facilities could cause us to
 lose customers.  Damage  or  destruction  that interrupts  our  provision of
 outsourcing services could  damage our relationship  with certain  customers
 and may  cause us  to  incur substantial  additional  expense to  repair  or
 replace damaged equipment.  Although we  have installed back-up systems  and
 procedures to prevent  or reduce disruption,  we cannot assure  you that  we
 will not  suffer  a prolonged  interruption  of our  transaction  processing
 services.  In the event that an interruption of our network extends for more
 than several hours, we may experience  data loss or a reduction in  revenues
 by reason of such interruption.  In addition, a significant interruption  of
 service could have a  negative impact on our  reputation and could lead  our
 present and potential customers to choose service providers other than us.

 If others claim that we have  infringed their intellectual property  rights,
 we could be liable for significant damages.   We do not believe that any  of
 our products or services infringe the  proprietary rights of third  parties.
 We cannot be sure, however, that  others will not make infringement  claims,
 and we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against those  claims.
 We  anticipate that the number of  infringement claims will increase as  the
 number of software solutions and services increases and the functionality of
 our products and  services expands.  Any of  those claims,  whether with  or
 without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and  may
 not be resolved on terms favorable to us.

 Expansion of services to  non-traditional customers could  expose us to  new
 risks. Some  of our  recent acquisitions  include  business lines  that  are
 marketed outside our traditional,  regulated, and litigation-averse base  of
 financial institution customers.  These  non-regulated customers may  entail
 greater operational, credit and litigation risks  than we have faced  before
 and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs.

 Competitive pressures in  our industry  or general  economic conditions  may
 require that  we  reduce  our  prices or  offer  other  favorable  terms  to
 customers on our products and services  which could result in lower  margins
 and reduce net income.  We compete with a variety of software vendors in all
 of our major  product lines.  Some of  our competitors may  have  advantages
 over us due to  their size, product lines,  greater marketing resources,  or
 exclusive intellectual property rights.  If competitors offer more favorable
 pricing, payment or other  contractual terms, warranties, or  functionality,
 or if  general economic  conditions decline  such  that customers  are  less
 willing or able to pay the cost of our products, we may need to lower prices
 or offer other favorable terms in order to successfully compete.

 The accounting treatment for employee stock options has changed, which  will
 affect our earnings and cause us  to reconsider our business practices.   We
 previously accounted for the issuance of stock options under APB Opinion No.
 25 and recognized no compensation expense  for employee stock options.  With
 the recent  adoption  of Statement  of  Financial Accounting  Standards  No.
 123(R), we will be required in FY2006 to recognize compensation  expense for
 granted stock options based upon a calculation of their fair values at  date
 of grant.  We have decided to reduce the number of stock options granted  to
 employees and to rely instead on  alternative forms of equity  compensation,
 such as grants of restricted stock.  This could affect our ability to retain
 existing employees and attract qualified candidates, and also could increase
 the cash compensation we would have to pay them.

 Increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues may  decrease
 overall margins.  We continue to experience a trend of a greater  proportion
 of our  products being  sold as  outsourcing services  rather than  in-house
 licenses.  We  realize lower  margins on  service revenues  than on  license
 revenues.  Thus,  if  service revenue  increases as  a percentage  of  total
 revenue, our gross margins  will be lower and  our operating results may  be
 impacted.

 Failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could  negatively
 impact our  outsourcing business.  Our  contracts  with  our  customers  for
 outsourced data processing services generally run for a period of 3-5 years.
 Because  of the rapid growth of our outsourcing business over the last  five
 years, we will experience greater numbers  of these contracts coming up  for
 renewal over  the next few years.  Renewal time presents our customers  with
 the  opportunity  to  consider  other  providers  or  to  renegotiate  their
 contracts with us.  If we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates
 upon favorable terms,  our revenues from  outsourcing and associated  profit
 margins could be negatively impacted.


 Item 2.     Properties

 We own  approximately 153  acres located  in Monett,  Missouri on  which  we
 maintain eight  office and shipping  &  receiving and maintenance buildings.
 We also  own buildings  in Houston, Texas;  Allen, Texas;  Albuquerque,  New
 Mexico;  Birmingham,  Alabama;  Lenexa,  Kansas;  Angola,  Indiana;  Shawnee
 Mission, Kansas; Rogers,  Arkansas; Oklahoma City,  Oklahoma and San  Diego,
 California.  Our  owned  facilities represent  approximately 778,000  square
 feet of office space in nine states.  We have 48 leased office facilities in
 24 states, which total approximately 291,000 square feet.  All of the  space
 is utilized for normal business purposes.

 Of our  facilities, the  credit union  business  segment uses  office  space
 totaling approximately 121,500 square feet  in six facilities. The  majority
 of our San Diego, California offices  are used in the credit union  business
 segment, as are portions of five other office facilities.  The remainder  of
 our leased and owned facilities, approximately 948,000 square feet of office
 space, is primarily devoted to serving our bank business segment or supports
 our whole business.

 We own seven  aircraft.  Many  of our customers  are located in  communities
 that  do  not have  an  easily accessible  commercial  airline  service.  We
 primarily use  our airplanes  in connection  with implementation,  sales  of
 systems and internal requirements for day-to-day operations.  Transportation
 costs for  implementation and  other customer  services  are billed  to  our
 customers.  We lease property, including real estate and related facilities,
 at the Monett, Missouri municipal airport.


 Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

 We are subject to  various routine legal proceedings  and claims arising  in
 the ordinary course of business. We do not expect that the results in any of
 these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our business,
 financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.


 Item 4.  Submission of Matters To a Vote of Security Holders

 None.

 The Company established a practice of paying quarterly dividends at the  end
 of fiscal 1990 and  has paid dividends with  respect to every quarter  since
 that time.  Quarterly dividends per share  paid on the common stock for  the

 Item 6.   Selected Financial Data



 Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
           Results of Operations

 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the
 "Selected Financial  Data" and  the  consolidated financial  statements  and
 related notes included elsewhere in this report.

 OVERVIEW

 Background and Overview

 We provide  integrated computer  systems for  in-house and  outsourced  data
 processing  to  commercial   banks,  credit  unions   and  other   financial
 institutions.  We have  developed  and  acquired banking  and  credit  union
 application software  systems  that  we  market,  together  with  compatible
 computer hardware, to these  financial institutions.   We also perform  data
 conversion and software implementation services for our systems and  provide
 continuing customer support services after the systems are implemented.  For
 our customers  who prefer  not to  make an  up-front capital  investment  in
 software and hardware, we provide our full range of products and services on
 an outsourced  basis through  our six  data centers  and 22  item-processing
 centers located throughout the United States.

 A detailed discussion of the major  components of the results of  operations
 follows.  All amounts are in  thousands and discussions compare fiscal  2005
 to fiscal 2004 along with fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2003.

 We derive revenues from three primary sources of revenue:

   - software licenses;

   - support and service fees, which include implementation services; and

   - hardware sales, which includes all non-software remarketed products.

 Over the last five  fiscal years, our revenues  have grown from $366,903  in
 fiscal 2001 to $535,863 in fiscal  2005.  Income from continuing  operations
 has grown from  $55,631  in  fiscal 2001 to $75,501  in  fiscal  2005.  This
 growth has  resulted  primarily  from  internal  expansion  supplemented  by
 strategic acquisitions, allowing us to develop and acquire new products  and
 services for approximately  2,300 customers  who utilize  our core  software
 systems as of June 30, 2005.

 Since the start of fiscal 2001, we  have completed  16 acquisitions.  All of
 these  acquisitions  were  accounted  for  using  the  purchase  method   of
 accounting and our consolidated financial statements include  the results of
 operations of  the  acquired  companies from  their  respective  acquisition
 dates.

 License revenue represents  the sale  and delivery  of application  software
 systems contracted  with us  by the  customer.  We license  our  proprietary
 software products under standard  license agreements that typically  provide
 the customer  with  a  non-exclusive,  non-transferable  right  to  use  the
 software on  a  single  computer and  for  a  single  financial  institution
 location.

 Support  and  services  fees  are  generated  from  implementation  services
 contracted with us by the customer,  ongoing support services to assist  the
 customer in operating the  systems and to enhance  and update the  software,
 and from providing  outsourced data processing  services and  ATM and  debit
 card processing services.  Outsourcing  services  are performed through  our
 data and item centers. Revenues from outsourced item and data processing and
 ATM and debit card processing services  are derived from monthly usage  fees
 typically under five-year service contracts with our customers.

 Cost of license fees represents the third party vendor costs associated with
 license fee revenue.

 Cost  of   services  represents   costs  associated   with  conversion   and
 implementation  efforts,  ongoing  support   for  our  in-house   customers,
 operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced
 customers, ATM  and debit  card processing  services, and  direct  operation
 costs.

 We  have  entered   into  remarketing  agreements   with  several   hardware
 manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware and related services  to
 our customers.  Cost of hardware consists of the direct and related costs of
 purchasing  the  equipment  from  the  manufacturers  and  delivery  to  our
 customers.

 We have two business  segments: bank systems and  services and credit  union
 systems and services.  The respective segments include all related  license,
 support  and  service, and hardware sales  along with  the related  cost  of
 sales.


 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004

 Fiscal 2005 showed strong growth in license and support and service revenues
 and improved gross and operating margins, which allowed us to leverage a 15%
 increase in total revenue to a 21% increase in net income.  The Company  has
 made acquisitions which have had little effect on the results of operations.

 REVENUE

 License Revenue
                                   Year Ended June 30,  % Change
                                   -------------------  --------
                                     2005       2004
                                   --------   --------
 License                          $  82,374  $  62,593      +32%
 Percentage of total revenue            15%        13%

 License revenue  represents  the  delivery  and  acceptance  of  application
 software systems  contracted  by  us  with  the  customer.  We  license  our
 proprietary  software  products  under  standard  license  agreements   that
 typically provide the customer with a non-exclusive, non-transferable  right
 to use  the  software  on a  single  computer  and for  a  single  financial
 institution location.

 License revenue increased by $19,781 compared to last fiscal year mainly due
 to growth in  delivery and acceptance  of software systems  within both  the
 bank and credit union segments. Year-to-date license revenue in fiscal  2005
 experienced growth in many  software solutions.  The leading  elements  were
 Episys[R] (our flagship software solution  for larger credit unions),  third
 party credit union ancillary  software solutions, Silverlake System[R]  (our
 flagship software solution for larger banks), 4|sight[TM] (our complementary
 image solution),  and Fraud  Detective[TM]  (our anti-fraud  and  anti-money
 laundering software solution).

 Support and Service Revenue
                                   Year Ended June 30,  % Change
                                   -------------------  --------

    In-House Support & Other Services        $  23,264       16%
    EFT Support                                 15,577       43%
    Outsourcing Services                        11,016       13%
    Implementation Services                      2,932        7%

    Total Increase                           $  52,789
                                              ========

 Support and  service revenues  are  generated from  implementation  services
 (including conversion,  installation,  configuration  and  training), annual
 support to assist the customer in operating their systems and to enhance and
 update the software, outsourced data processing  services and ATM and  debit
 card processing services.

 There  was  strong  growth  in  all  of  the  support  and  service  revenue
 components.  In-house  support and other  services increased  primarily from
 additional software licenses sold  during the previous  twelve  months.  EFT
 support, including  ATM  and  debit card  transaction  processing  services,
 experienced the largest percentage of growth.  Our daily transaction  counts
 are rapidly  growing  as our  customers  continue to  experience  consistent
 organic growth in  ATM and  debit card transactions  as well  as strong  new
 customer contracting activity.  Outsourcing  services  for banks and  credit
 unions also continue to drive revenue growth at a strong pace as we add  new
 bank and credit  union customers  and  open new  data processing  sites.  We
 expect growth in  outsourcing to  continue as  we add  services from  recent
 acquisitions to our  existing and  new  customers.  Implementation  services
 reflect  growth   as  contracting   activity  continues   for  new   license
 implementation as well as merger conversions for our existing customers.

 Hardware Revenue
                                   Year Ended June 30,  % Change
                                   -------------------  --------
                                     2005       2004
                                   --------   --------
 Hardware                         $  89,413  $  93,535       -4%
 Percentage of total revenue            17%        20%

 The Company has  entered into remarketing  agreements with several  hardware
 manufacturers under which  we sell computer  hardware, hardware  maintenance
 and related services to our customers.  Revenue related to hardware sales is
 recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers.

 Hardware revenue continued to decrease as in prior years due to the  overall
 rising equipment processing power and decreasing equipment prices. There was
 an increase  in servers  and  the related  components.  Hardware maintenance
 revenue  which  represents  1.9%  of the hardware  revenue  increased due to
 maintenance contracts acquired relating to acquisitions.

 COST OF SALES AND GROSS PROFIT

 Cost of license  represents the cost  of software from  third party  vendors
 through remarketing  agreements.  These  costs are  recognized when  license
 revenue  is  recognized.  Cost  of  support  and  service  represents  costs
 associated with conversion and  implementation efforts, ongoing support  for
 our in-house customers,  operation of our  data and  item centers  providing
 services for  our  outsourced  customers,  ATM  and  debit  card  processing
 services and direct operating costs.  These costs are recognized as they are
 incurred. Cost  of hardware  consists of  the direct  and related  costs  of
 purchasing  the  equipment  from  the  manufacturers  and  delivery  to  our
 customers.  These costs  are  recognized  at the  same time  as the  related
 hardware revenue is recognized.  Ongoing operating costs to provide  support
 to our customers are recognized as they are incurred.

   TOTAL GROSS PROFIT             $ 222,450  $ 187,978      +18%
   Gross Profit Margin                  42%        40%

 Cost of  license increased  for the  fiscal  year due  to more  third  party
 reseller agreement software vendor costs.  These  costs increased  primarily
 in the prior quarters of  the current fiscal year.  Gross  profit margin  on
 license revenue increased  slightly due to  the associated  costs for  third
 party software marketed through  reseller agreements.  Cost of  support  and
 service increased for the year, in line with the support and service revenue
 increase, primarily due to additional personnel costs and costs relating  to
 the expanding  infrastructure  (including  depreciation,  amortization,  and
 maintenance contracts) as compared to the same periods last year.  The gross
 profit margin remained at 33% in support and service for both fiscal  years,
 primarily due  to  increased  headcount relating  to  support  and  service,
 facility costs related to new acquisitions, and depreciation expense of  new
 equipment.  Cost of  hardware decreased  for  the year,  in  line  with  the
 decrease in hardware sales,  primarily due to the  types of equipment  sold,
 with varying vendor incentives in the current year.  Incentives and  rebates
 received from  vendors  fluctuate quarterly  and  annually due  to  changing
 thresholds  established  by  the  vendors.   Hardware  gross  profit  margin
 increased minimally due to the number  of hardware shipments, sales mix  and
 vendor rebates received throughout the year.

 OPERATING EXPENSES

 Selling and Marketing

 Selling and marketing            $  46,630  $  35,964      +30%
 Percentage of total revenue            9%         8%

 Dedicated sales forces,  inside sales teams,  technical sales support  teams
 and  channel  partners  conduct  our  sales efforts for our market segments,
 and are  overseen  by regional sales  managers.  Our  sales  executives  are
 responsible for pursuing lead generation activities for new core  customers.
 Our account executives  nurture long-term relationships with our client base
 and cross sell  our  many complementary  products and services.  Our  inside
 sales force  markets specific  complementary products  and services  to  our
 existing customers.

 For the 2005 fiscal  year, selling and marketing  expenses increased due  to
 commissions and expenses related to revenue growth with a direct correlation
 to license and hardware revenue.  Sales force  head count from  acquisitions
 during fiscal 2005 also contributed to the additional expenses for the year.

 Research and Development
                                   Year Ended June 30,  % Change
                                   -------------------  --------
                                     2005       2004
                                   --------   --------
 Research and development         $  27,664  $  23,674      +17%
 Percentage of  total revenue            5%         5%

 We  devote  significant  effort  and  expense  to  develop new software;  to
 service  products  and  to  continually  upgrade  and  enhance our  existing
 offerings.  Typically, we upgrade all of our core and complementary software
 applications once per year.  We believe our research and development efforts
 are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and
 development staff and  because our product  development is highly  customer-
 driven.

 Research and  development  expenses grew  primarily  due to  employee  costs
 associated with increased headcount for ongoing development of new  products
 and  enhancements   to  existing   products,  depreciation   and   equipment
 maintenance expense and  employees added  from acquisitions.   Research  and
 development expenses remained at 5% of total revenue for both fiscal years.

 General and Administrative
                                   Year Ended June 30,  % Change
                                   -------------------  --------

 General and administrative       $  29,087  $  29,534       -2%
 Percentage of  total revenue            5%         6%

 General and administrative  expense decreased  due to  overall cost  control
 measures  implemented  throughout  the  year.   In  addition,  General   and
 administrative expenses decreased  due to a  loss on disposal  of assets  of
 approximately $1,000 along with assets being fully depreciated during fiscal
 2005.

 INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)

 Interest income increased 16% from $1,006 to $1,162 due primarily to  higher
 interest rates on invested balances.  Interest expense increased  263%  from
 $107 to $388 due to borrowings on the revolving bank credit facilities.

 PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

 The provision for income taxes was $44,342 or 37.0% of income before  income
 taxes in fiscal 2005 compared with  $37,390 or 37.5% of income before income
 taxes fiscal 2004.  The decrease in the percentage  for  fiscal  2005 is due
 to  changes  in  the estimated state tax  rates and from our reevaluation of
 changes in state tax laws in relationship to our tax structure.

 NET INCOME

 Net income increased 21% from $62,315, or $0.68 per diluted share in  fiscal
 2004 to $75,501, or $0.81 per diluted share in fiscal 2005.


 FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003

 Fiscal 2004  showed  strong  growth  in  revenues  and  improved  gross  and
 operating margins, which allowed us to  leverage a 16% increase in  revenues
 to a 26% increase in net income.

 License revenue  represents  the  delivery  and  acceptance  of  application
 software systems  contracted  with  us  by  the  customer.  We  license  our
 proprietary  software  products  under  standard  license  agreements   that
 typically provide the customer with a non-exclusive,  non-transferable right
 to use  the  software  on a  single  computer  and  for  a  single financial
 institution location.

 License revenue  grew  by  $14,309  compared to  last  fiscal  year  due  to
 increased delivery of software relating to the timing of installations.

                                              ========

 Support and  service revenues  are  generated from  implementation  services
 (including conversion, implementation,  configuration and training),  annual
 support services to assist  the customer in operating  their systems and  to
 enhance and update the software, outsourced data processing services and EFT
 support (including ATM and debit card processing services).

 In-house  support  and  other  services  increased  due  to  our   continued
 implementation of core  and complementary products  during the fiscal  year,
 for which  most of  these customers  contract for  ongoing support  service,
 beginning upon final implementation. Outsourcing services experienced growth
 in volume with existing customers and installations of new customers,  which
 led to expansion of our data centers.  EFT services (including ATM and debit
 card processing) were offered to the  credit union segment this year,  which
 contributed to the growth.  Implementation services grew over the prior year
 correlating to the increase of license revenue.  Recurring revenue  (support
 and service revenue less implementation services) increased to 57% of  total
 revenue in fiscal 2004 from 55% of total fiscal 2003 revenue.

 The Company has  entered into remarketing  agreements with several  hardware
 manufacturers under which  we sell computer  hardware, hardware  maintenance
 and related services to our customers.  Revenue related to hardware sales is
 recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers.

 Hardware revenue remained relatively flat  year over year, while  decreasing
 to 20% of revenues compared with  24% of fiscal 2003 revenues primarily  due
 to the  increase in  our license  revenue and  expansion and  growth  in our
 support and service revenue for the year.

 COST OF SALES AND GROSS PROFIT

 Cost of license  represents the cost  of software from  third party  vendors
 through remarketing agreements.  These  costs  are  recognized when  license
 revenue  is  recognized.  Cost  of  support  and  service  represents  costs
 associated with conversion and  implementation efforts, ongoing support  for
 our in-house customers,  operation of our  data and  item centers  providing
 services for  our  outsourced  customers,  ATM  and  debit  card  processing
 services and direct operating costs.  These costs are recognized as they are
 incurred. Cost  of hardware  consists of  the direct  and related  costs  of
 purchasing  the  equipment  from  the  manufacturers  and  delivery  to  our
 customers, plus  the  ongoing operating  costs  to provide  support  to  our
 customers.  These  costs  are recognized  at the  same time  as the  related
 hardware revenue is recognized.

   Gross Profit Margin                  40%        38%

 The increase in total cost of  sales is primarily due  to a 12% increase  in
 employee related  expenses for  increased headcount  and a  24% increase  in
 depreciation and amortization expense  included in the  cost of support  and
 service.  This is due mainly to our efforts to continue improving  operating
 efficiencies by investing and upgrading  technology equipment.  Both  fiscal
 years' cost  of  support and  service  remained  constant at  44%  of  total
 revenue.  Cost of license increased mainly due to obligations to third party
 vendors for  the  software  we  resell.  The decrease  in cost  of  hardware
 correlates to the decrease in hardware revenue.

 Gross margin  increased  from 38%  to  40% in  fiscal  2004 due  to  overall
 increase in revenue while exercising cost control.  Gross margin on  license
 revenue remained consistent at 92% for both fiscal years.  The gross  profit
 improvement is  due  to  a  significant increase  in  the  delivery  of  the
 Company's  core  and  complementary  software  licenses.  For  fiscal  2004,
 delivery of third party license revenue and cost remained flat when compared
 with fiscal 2003.  The increase in  gross margin for support and service  is
 primarily due  to  increased volumes,  increased  number of  customers,  and
 continued  leveraging  of  resources  of  employees  and  equipment  in  our
 outsourcing and ATM/Debit card processing services.

 Hardware gross margin for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 remained even at  28%.

 Dedicated sales  forces, inside  sales teams,  and technical  sales  support
 teams conduct  our  sales efforts  for  our  two market  segments,  and  are
 overseen  by regional sales managers.  Our sales executives are  responsible
 for pursuing lead generation activities for new core customers.  Our account
 executives nurture long-term  relationships with our  client base and  cross
 sell our many complementary products and  services.  Our inside sales  force
 markets  specific  complementary  products  and  services  to  our  existing
 customers.

 The increase in selling  and marketing expenses  relates to higher  employee
 related expenses  in  fiscal  2004  compared  with  fiscal  2003,  which  is
 relatively in line with the growth in revenue.

 We devote significant effort  and  expense to develop new software,  service
 products  and  continually  upgrade  and  enhance  our  existing  offerings.
 Typically,  we  upgrade   all  of  our   core  and  complementary   software
 applications annually.  We believe our research and development efforts  are
 highly efficient because  of the extensive  experience of  our research  and
 development staff and  because our product  development is highly  customer-
 driven.

 The increase in research and  development expense is primarily  attributable
 to  a  45% increase  in employee  related expenses.  The  increase  includes
 standard salary  increases  along  with  additional employee  headcount  for
 ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products in
 both segments of our business.

 General and administrative expenses remained flat  year over year.  This  is

 INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)

 Interest income increased  60% from $630  to $1,006 due  to higher  invested
 balances.  Interest expense decreased 3% from $110 in fiscal 2003 to $107 in
 fiscal 2004.

 PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

 The provision for income taxes was $37,390 or 37.5% of income before  income
 taxes in fiscal 2004 compared with $28,394, or 36.5% of income before income
 taxes in fiscal 2003.  The increase in the percentage for fiscal 2004 is due
 to changes in various state tax laws  and  the allocation of income  amongst
 states.

 NET INCOME

 Net income increased 26% from $49,397, or $0.55 per diluted share in  fiscal
 2003 to $62,315, or $0.68 per diluted share in fiscal 2004.

 Gross Profit Margin       42%                   40%                    39%

 The revenue increase in  the bank systems and  services business segment  is
 primarily due  to improved  license sales  for most  products and  continued
 growth in support and service revenue.  Gross profit increased due to growth
 in license  and support  and service  revenue, which  carry a  higher  gross
 profit  margin.  There was  a decrease  in hardware  revenue, which  usually
 carries a lower  gross  profit  margin.  The  mix of  revenue combined  with
 improved procedures and  overall cost controls  allowed us  to leverage  our
 resources, resulting in  a steady increase  to our profit  margin year  over
 year.

 In fiscal 2004, revenues in the  bank systems and services business  segment
 increased primarily  due to  improved license  sales for  most products  and
 continued growth  in support  and service  revenue.   Gross profit  in  this
 business segment  increased  due the  revenue  mix, combined  with  improved
 procedures and overall cost controls.

 Gross Profit        $ 40,658       22%     $33,332       82%      $18,341

 Gross Profit Margin       38%                   39%                    30%

 Revenues in the credit union systems and services business segment increased
 substantially in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004.  This increase is mainly  due
 to strong growth in support and service revenue from new services introduced
 in the  prior  year, with  the  outsourced area  experiencing  the  greatest
 increase.  Gross  profit  in this  business  segment decreased  slightly  in
 fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 mainly  due to the decrease in hardware  margin
 relating to the sales mix and vendor rebates.

 Revenues in the credit union systems and services business segment increased
 in fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003 primarily due to improved license sales  and
 strong growth in support  and service revenue  from new services  introduced
 this year.  Gross profit in  this business segment increased in fiscal  2004
 from fiscal 2003 due to additional products and services sold which carry  a
 higher gross  profit  margin,  continued  leverage  of  existing  resources,
 improved processes and procedures combined with overall cost controls.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 We have historically generated positive cash  flow from operations and  have
 generally used existing  resources and  funds generated  from operations  to
 meet capital requirements.  We expect this trend to continue in the future.

 The Company's cash  and cash equivalents  decreased to $11,608  at June  30,
 2005, from $53,758 at  June 30, 2004. Cash provided by operations  decreased
 $4,534 to $108,275 for the  fiscal year ended  June 30, 2005 as compared  to
 $112,809 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.  The decrease consists  of
 an increase  in net  income  of $13,186,  an  increase in  depreciation  and
 amortization expense  of $5,371,  a total  decrease  of $1,479  in  deferred
 income taxes, loss on disposal of property and equipment and other expenses.
 Net income was affected  by the following items: $17,120 in the use of trade
 receivables,  $8,651  in  prepaid  expenses,  $5,520 in accounts payable and
 accrued expenses,  $6,236 in deferred revenues  and  a decrease of $7,597 in
 accrued income taxes.

 Cash used in investing  activities for the fiscal  year ended June 2005  was
 $185,062, which included  capital expenditures of  $58,046, primarily for  a
 new building in  Allen, TX of  $13,000, computer equipment  and software  of
 $28,300, and building  infrastructure within the  company.  Acquisitions  of
 eight companies,  which  expanded our  product  offerings and  expanded  our
 potential market, used $119,501  in fiscal 2005, while  $7,846 was used  for
 software development costs.  Financing activities generated cash of $34,637,
 primarily from the proceeds  from issuance of stock  upon exercise of  stock
 options of $14,264, the sale of common stock  of $781 and a short term  note
 payable  of  $45,000.  Generated  cash  was  offset  by  dividends  paid  to
 stockholders of $15,456 and the purchase of treasury stock of $9,952.

 In 2001, the Company's  Board of Directors approved  a stock buyback of  the
 Company's common stock of up to 3.0 million shares, and approved an increase
 to 6.0 million shares  in 2002.  Through fiscal  2004, a total of  3,00,9384
 shares had  been  repurchased by  the  Company under  these  authorizations.
 Repurchases through fiscal 2004 were funded with cash from operations.

 During fiscal 2004 there  were 2,009,694 shares  and 37,776 shares  reissued
 from treasury stock for the shares exercised under the employee stock option
 plan and purchased under the employee stock purchase plan, respectively.  At
 June 30, 2004, there were 315,651 shares remaining in treasury stock.

 During fiscal 2005 there were 306,027 shares and 9,624 shares reissued  from
 treasury stock for the shares exercised under the employee stock option plan
 and  purchased  under  the  employee  stock  purchase  plan,   respectively,
 depleting the existing treasury shares.

 In  April  2005,  the  Board  of  Directors  increased  the  existing  stock
 repurchase authorization by 2.0  million shares.  Under this  authorization,
 the Company may finance its share  repurchases with available cash  reserves
 or  short-term  borrowings  on  its  existing  credit  facility.  The  share
 repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and
 may be suspended at any time.  As of June 30, 2005, 553,300 shares  had been
 repurchased during the fiscal year for $9,952. At June 30, 2005, there  were
 553,300 shares remaining in treasury stock and the Company had the remaining
 authority to repurchase up to 4,437,316 shares.

 Subsequent  to June 30, 2005, the  Company's Board of  Directors declared  a
 cash dividend of $.045  per share on its  common stock payable on  September
 19, 2005,  to  stockholders of record  on September 8, 2005.  Current  funds
 from operations are adequate for this purpose.  The Board has indicated that
 it plans to  continue paying dividends  as long as  the Company's  financial
 picture continues to be favorable.

 The Company renewed a bank credit line on March 22, 2005 which provides  for
 funding of up to $8,000 and bears interest at the prime rate (6.00% at  June
 30, 2005).  The credit line expires March 22, 2006 and is secured by  $1,000
 of investments.  At June 30, 2005, no amount was outstanding.

 In October 2004, the  Company renewed a bank  credit line that provided  for
 funding up to $25,000 and bore interest  at a variable LIBOR-based rate.  At
 March 31, 2005, there was a  30-day note outstanding for $14,000 under  such
 credit line.  The  credit line was  terminated and the  outstanding note  of
 $14,000 was paid in  full on April 19,  2005, using the  proceeds of a  loan
 under a new unsecured  revolving bank credit facility,  entered into on  the
 same date.

 The new unsecured revolving bank credit  facility allows borrowing of up  to
 $150,000, which may  be increased by  the Company at  any time  in the  next
 three years to $225,000.  The unsecured revolving bank credit facility bears
 interest at a rate  equal to (a) LIBOR  or (b) an  alternate base rate  (the
 greater of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2% or (b) the Prime Rate), plus
 an applicable percentage in each case  determined by the Company's  leverage
 ratio.  The new unsecured revolving credit line terminates April 19,  2010.
 At June 30, 2005, the revolving bank credit facility balance was $45,000.

 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS

 At  June  30,  2005  the  Company's  total  off-balance  sheet   contractual
 obligations were $14.3 million.  This  balance consists  of $9.7 million  of
 long-term operating leases for various facilities which expire from  2006 to
 2011 and the remaining $4.6 million  is for purchase commitments related  to
 property and equipment. The Company also has contingent earn-out obligations
 of  up  to  $28.4  million  to  the  sellers in three acquisitions completed
 during fiscal year 2005.  These amounts are payable over three to five years
 based  variously upon gross revenues,  net earnings and net operating income
 achieved by the individual acquired business units.

 The Company's new unsecured revolving bank credit facility allows  borrowing
 of up to  $150,000, which may  be increased at  any time in  the next  three
 years to $225,000.  The unsecured revolving credit ling terminates on  April
 19, 2010.  At June 30, 2005  the revolving bank credit facility balance  was
 $45,000.  The balance was subsequently paid in full on August 8, 2005.

 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

 In  December  2004,  the  FASB  issued  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
 Standards No. 123 (R), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123(R)"),  a revision of
 SFAS 123.  SFAS 123 (R) supersedes APB 25 and amends Statement  of Financial
 Accounting  Standards  No. 95  "Statement of Cash Flows"  ("SFAS 95").  SFAS
 123(R)  is similar  to the approach described  in SFAS 123 except  that SFAS
 123(R) requires all share-based payments  to employees,  including grants of
 employee stock options, to be recognized in the  consolidated  statements of
 income, in lieu of pro forma disclosure as provided above.  SFAS 123 (R)  is
 effective  for  fiscal  periods  beginning after June 15, 2005.  The Company
 adopted the provisions of SFAS 123 (R) as of July 1, 2005,  the first day of
 fiscal  2006  and  currently  intends to use the modified-prospective method
 and  use  the  Black-Scholes model  for  estimating the fair value of equity
 compensation.

 In December 2004, the  FASB issued SFAS No.  153 ("SFAS 153"), Exchanges  of
 Nonmonetary Assets,  an  Amendment of  APB  Opinion No.  29,  effective  for
 nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June
 15, 2005, and therefore effective for the Company on July 1, 2005.  SFAS No.
 153 requires that exchanges  of productive assets be  accounted for at  fair
 value unless fair value cannot be  reasonably determined or the  transaction
 lacks commercial substance.  SFAS No. 153 is not expected to have a material
 effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

 In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position 109-1, "Application on FASB
 Statement No.  109,  Accounting for  Income  Taxes, for  the  Tax  Deduction
 Provided to U.S. Based  Manufacturers by the American  Jobs Creation Act  of
 2004" ("FSP 109-1").  FSP 109-1 clarifies how  to apply Statement No. 109 to
 the new law's tax deduction for income attributable to "Domestic  production
 activities."  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new law.

 In May 2005,  the FASB issued  SFAS No. 154,  "Accounting Changes and  Error
 Corrections - a replacement of APB  Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement  No.3"
 ("SFAS 154").  SFAS 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for, and
 reporting of, a change  in accounting principle.  SFAS 154  requires that  a
 voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all
 prior period financial statements presented using the accounting  principle.
 SFAS 154 is effective  for accounting changes and  corrections of errors  in
 fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.  The implementation of  SFAS
 154 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's  consolidated
 financial statements.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 We  prepare  our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance   with
 accounting  principles  generally  accepted   in  the  United  States.   The
 significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the  consolidated
 financial statements.   Certain of  these accounting  policies as  discussed
 below require  management to  make estimates  and assumptions  about  future
 events  that  could  materially  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,
 liabilities, revenues and expenses and  disclosure of contingent assets  and
 liabilities.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
 assumptions or conditions.

 Revenue Recognition

 We recognize  revenue in  accordance with  the  provisions of  Statement  of
 Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition," as amended by SOP 98-
 9, "Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions," and
 clarified by Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 101, "Revenue Recognition  in
 Financial Statements," SAB 104,  "Revenue Recognition," and Emerging  Issues
 Task  Force  Issue  No.  00-21  ("EITF  00-21"),  "Accounting  for   Revenue
 Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables."  The Company derives revenues from
 the following sources:  license fees, support and service fees and  hardware
 sales.

 License Fee Revenue.   For software license agreements  that do not  require
 significant modification  or  customization  of the  software,  the  Company
 recognizes  software  license  revenue   when  persuasive  evidence  of   an
 arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, the license fee is
 fixed and determinable and collection is  probable.  The Company's  software
 license agreements  generally  include  multiple products  and  services  or
 "elements."   None of  these elements  are  deemed to  be essential  to  the
 functionality of the  other elements.   SOP 97-2,  as amended  by SOP  98-9,
 generally  requires  revenue  earned  on  software  arrangements   involving
 multiple elements to be allocated to  each element based on Vendor  Specific
 Objective Evidence ("VSOE")  of fair value.   Fair value  is determined  for
 license fees  based  upon the  price charged when  sold separately.  In  the
 event that we  determine that VSOE  does not exist  for one  or  more of the
 delivered elements of a software arrangement, but does exist for all of  the
 undelivered elements, revenue is recognized  the residual method allowed  by
 SOP  98-9.  Under  the  residual  method, a  residual  amount of  the  total
 arrangement fee is recognized  as revenue for  the delivered elements  after
 the established fair value of all undelivered elements has been deducted.

 Support  and  Service  Fee  Revenue.  Software implementation  services  are
 generally  for  training,  implementation,  and  configuration  of  licensed
 software.  These services are not considered essential to the  functionality
 of  the  related  software.  VSOE  of  fair  value is established by pricing
 used when these services are sold separately.  Generally, for implementation
 services under $50,000, revenue is recognized  when services  are completed.
 On certain larger implementations, revenue is recognized based on milestones
 during the implementation.  Milestones  are triggered by tasks completed  or
 based on direct labor hours.

 Maintenance support revenue is recognized pro-rata over the contract period,
 typically  one year.  VSOE  of fair value  is determined  based on  contract
 renewal rates.

 Outsourced  data  processing  services  and  ATM,  debit  card,  and   other
 transaction processing services  revenues are  recognized in  the month  the
 transactions were processed or the services were rendered.

 Hardware Revenue.   Hardware  revenue is  recognized  upon delivery  to  the
 customer, when title and risk of loss  are transferred.  VSOE of fair  value
 is determined based on pricing used when the items are sold separately.  The
 Company  also remarkets maintenance contracts on hardware  to our customers.
 Hardware maintenance  revenue  is  recognized  ratably  over  the  agreement
 period.

 Depreciation and Amortization Expense

 The calculation of  depreciation and amortization  expense is  based on  the
 estimated economic lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment and
 intangible assets,  which  have been  examined  for their  useful  life  and
 determined that no impairment  exists.  We believe  it is unlikely that  any
 significant changes  to the  useful lives  of  our tangible  and  intangible
 assets will  occur in  the near  term, but  rapid changes  in technology  or
 changes in market  conditions could result  in revisions  to such  estimates
 that could materially  affect the  carrying value  of these  assets and  the
 Company's future consolidated operating results.  All long lived assets  are
 tested for valuation and potential impairment on a scheduled annual basis.

 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

 Except  for  the  historical  information  contained  herein,  the   matters
 discussed in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
 and Results of Operations and other portions of this report contain forward-
 looking statements within the  meaning of federal  securities laws.   Actual
 results are  subject  to  risks  and  uncertainties,  including  both  those
 specific to the  Company and  those specific  to the  industry, which  could
 cause results to differ materially from  those contemplated.  The risks  and
 uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the matters detailed in "Risk
 Factors" in Item 1 of the Company's 2005 Form 10-K annual report filed  with
 the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Undue reliance should not be placed
 on the  forward-looking statements.   The  Company  does not  undertake  any
 obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements.

 Potential risks and uncertainties which  could adversely affect the  Company
 include: the  financial  health of  the  banking industry,  our  ability  to
 continue or effectively manage growth, adapting our products and services to
 changes  in  technology,  changes  in  our  strategic  relationships,  price
 competition, loss of key employees,  consolidation in the banking  industry,
 increased government  regulation,  network or  internet  security  problems,
 declining  computer  hardware  prices,  and  operational  problems  in   our
 outsourcing facilities and others listed in "Risk Factors" of Item 1.


 Item 7A.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

 Market risk refers to  the risk that a  change in the level  of one or  more
 market prices, interest rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or  other
 market factors  such as  liquidity,  will result  in  losses for  a  certain
 financial instrument or group  of financial instruments.   We are  currently
 exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and interest risk  on
 investments in U.S. government securities.  We actively monitor these  risks
 through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management.   We
 do not currently  use any derivative  financial instruments.   Based on  the
 controls in place, credit worthiness of  the customer base and the  relative
 size of these  financial instruments, we  believe the  risk associated  with
 these  instruments  will  not  have  a   material  adverse  effect  on   our
 consolidated financial position or results of operations.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
 Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.
 Monett, Missouri


 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Jack Henry &
 Associates, Inc. and subsidiaries  (the "Company") as of  June 30, 2005  and
 2004, and  the  related  consolidated statements  of  income,  stockholders'
 equity,  and  cash  flows  for  each  of the three years in the period ended
 June 30, 2005.  These financial statements  are  the  responsibility  of the
 Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on  these
 financial statements based on our audits.

 We conducted  our audits  in accordance  with the  standards of  the  Public
 Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
 that we plan  and perform  the audit  to obtain  reasonable assurance  about
 whether the  financial  statements  are free  of material  misstatement.  An
 audit includes examining, on a test  basis, evidence supporting the  amounts
 and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  An  audit  also  includes
 assessing the accounting principles used  and significant estimates made  by
 management,  as  well   as  evaluating  the   overall  financial   statement
 presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
 opinion.

 In our opinion,  such consolidated financial  statements present fairly,  in
 all material respects, the financial position of Jack Henry & Associates and
 subsidiaries at June 30, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their  operations
 and their cash flows for each  of the three years  in the period ended  June
 30, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
 United States of America.

 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
 Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States),  the  effectiveness  of  the
 Company's internal control  over financial reporting  as  of  June 30, 2005,
 based on the criteria  established in Internal Control-Integrated  Framework
 issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway
 Commission and our report dated September 12, 2005  expressed an unqualified
 opinion on management's  assessment of  the effectiveness  of the  Company's
 internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on  the
 effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

 MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

 The  management  of  Jack  Henry  &  Associates,  Inc.  is  responsible  for
 establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over  financial
 reporting.   Jack Henry  &  Associates, Inc.'s internal  control system  was
 designed to provide  reasonable assurance  to the  company's management  and
 board of  directors  regarding  the preparation  and  fair  presentation  of
 published financial statements.

 All internal control  systems, no matter  how well  designed, have  inherent
 limitations.  Therefore, even those systems  determined to be effective  can
 provide only  reasonable  assurance  with  respect  to  financial  statement
 preparation and presentation.

 Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. management  assessed the effectiveness of  the
 company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005.  In
 making this assessment, it used the  criteria set forth by the Committee  of
 Sponsoring Organizations  of  the  Treadway Commission  (COSO)  in  Internal
 Control - Integrated Framework.  Based  on our assessment, we believe  that,
 as of June 30, 2005, the company's internal control over financial reporting
 is effective based on those criteria.

 Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. independent registered public accounting  firm
 has issued  an audit  report on  our assessment  of the  company's  internal
 control over financial reporting, which report is included herein.



 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
 Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.
 Monett, Missouri


 We have  audited  management's  assessment,  included  in  the  accompanying
 Management's Annual  Report on  Internal Control  over Financial  Reporting,
 that  Jack  Henry  &  Associates,  Inc.  and  subsidiaries  (the  "Company")
 maintained effective internal  control over financial  reporting as of  June
 30, 2005,  based  on  criteria established  in  Internal  Control-Integrated
 Framework issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the
 Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining
 effective internal control over financial reporting and for  its  assessment
 of the  effectiveness  of internal  control  over  financial reporting.  Our
 responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion on  management's assessment and
 an  opinion  on the  effectiveness  of  the Company's  internal control over
 financial reporting based on our audit.

 We conducted  our audit  in  accordance with  the  standards of  the  Public
 Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
 that we plan  and perform  the audit  to obtain  reasonable assurance  about
 whether effective internal control  over financial reporting was  maintained
 in  all  material  respects.  Our audit included obtaining  an understanding
 of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  evaluating  management's
 assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
 internal control,  and performing  such other  procedures as  we  considered
 necessary  in  the circumstances.  We  believe  that  our audit  provides  a
 reasonable basis for our opinions.

 A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process  designed
 by, or  under the  supervision of,  the  company's principal  executive  and
 principal financial officers, or  persons performing similar functions,  and
 effected  by  the  company's  board  of  directors,  management,  and  other
 personnel to  provide  reasonable  assurance regarding  the  reliability  of
 financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
 purposes in accordance  with generally  accepted accounting  principles.   A
 company's internal control over financial reporting includes those  policies
 and procedures  that (1)  pertain to  the maintenance  of records  that,  in
 reasonable detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and
 dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable  assurance
 that transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of
 financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting
 principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
 only in accordance with  authorizations of management  and directors of  the
 company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
 detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the  company's
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

 Because of  the  inherent limitations  of  internal control  over  financial
 reporting, including  the possibility  of collusion  or improper  management
 override of controls, material misstatements due  to error or fraud may  not
 be prevented  or detected  on a  timely  basis.  Also,  projections  of  any
 evaluation of  the  effectiveness of  the  internal control  over  financial
 reporting to future periods  are subject to the  risk that the controls  may
 become inadequate because of  changes in conditions, or  that the degree  of
 compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 In  our  opinion,  management's  assessment  that  the  Company   maintained
 effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005,  is
 fairly stated, in all material respects,  based on the criteria  established
 in  Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee   of
 Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.   Also in our  opinion,
 the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
 over financial  reporting  as  of  June 30,  2005,  based  on  the  criteria
 established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
 of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
 Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States),  the  consolidated financial
 statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2005 of the Company and our
 report dated September 12, 2005  expressed  an unqualified opinion on  those
 financial statements.

                JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
              (In Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Amounts)


 NOTE 1.  NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY

 Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. and Subsidiaries ("JHA" or the "Company") is a
 leading provider  of  integrated computer  systems  that has  developed  and
 acquired a  number  of  banking  and  credit  union  software  systems.  The
 Company's revenues are  predominately earned by  marketing  those systems to
 financial  institutions   nationwide   together  with   computer   equipment
 (hardware) and  by  providing  the conversion  and  software  implementation
 services for a financial institution to  utilize a JHA software system.  JHA
 also provides continuing support and services to customers using in-house or
 outsourced systems.

 CONSOLIDATION

 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of JHA and all of
 its subsidiaries, which are wholly- owned, and all significant  intercompany
 accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

 STOCK OPTIONS

 In accordance with Accounting Principles  Board Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting
 for Stock  Issued  to Employees"  ("APB  25"), no  compensation  expense  is
 recorded for stock options or other  stock-based awards that are granted  to
 employees with an exercise price equal to or above the common stock price on
 the grant date.

 In October 1995,  the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")  issued
 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards  (SFAS) No. 123  "Accounting for
 Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS  123").  SFAS 123 establishes fair value as
 the measurement basis for equity instruments issued in exchange for goods or
 services and  stock-based compensation  plans.  Fair value may  be  measured
 using quoted  market  prices,  option-pricing  models  or  other  reasonable
 estimation methods. SFAS 123 permits the Company to choose between  adoption
 of the fair  value based method  or disclosing pro  forma net income  (loss)
 information. The Statement was effective for transactions entered into after
 December 31, 1995.  Through fiscal 2005,  the Company  accounted for  stock-
 based compensation in accordance with APB 25, as amended, and provides below
 the  pro  forma  disclosures  required  by SFAS 123  as amended by Statement
 of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 148  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based
 Compensation Transition and Disclosure" ("SFAS 148").

 Pro  forma  information regarding  net income  and  net income per share  is
 required by SFAS  123.  The Company  computes fair  value for  this  purpose
 using  the  Black-Scholes  option valuation  model.  Option valuation models
 require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including  the  expected
 stock price volatility.

 The weighted average  fair value  of options  granted was $6.97,  $7.43  and
 $4.68 for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option
 pricing model.  The assumptions  used  in this model  to estimate fair value
 and resulting values are as follows:

                                                  Year Ended June 30,
                                          -----------------------------------

                                          ---------    ---------    ---------
      Weighted Average Assumptions:
        Expected life (years)                3.53         3.88         4.35
        Volatility                             48%          53%          55%
        Risk free interest rate               3.1%         1.6%         1.3%
        Dividend yield                       0.88%        0.75%        1.16%

 The following table illustrates the effect on net income and net income  per
 share if the Company  had applied the fair  value recognition provisions  of
 SFAS 123 (in thousands, except per share amounts):

 In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS  No. 123 (R),  "Share-Based  Payment"
 ("SFAS 123(R)"), a revision of SFAS 123.  SFAS 123 (R) supersedes APB 25 and
 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95 "Statement of Cash
 Flows" ("SFAS  95").  SFAS 123(R) is similar to  the approach  described  in
 SFAS  123  except  that  SFAS  123(R)  requires all share-based  payments to
 employees,  including grants of employee stock options,  to be recognized in
 the  consolidated  statements of income, in lieu of pro forma disclosure  as
 provided  above.  SFAS  123 (R)  is  effective  for fiscal periods beginning
 after June 15, 2005.  The  Company  adopted  the  provisions of SFAS 123 (R)
 as  of  July 1, 2005, the first  day  of fiscal 2006  and  currently intends
 to use the modified-prospective method  and  use the Black-Scholes model for
 estimating the fair value of equity compensation.

 On  June 29, 2005,  the  Board of Directors  approved  the immediate vesting
 of all stock options previously granted under the  1996  Stock  Option  Plan
 ("1996 SOP") that had exercised prices higher than the market price  on such
 date.   As a result  of  this  action,  the  vesting  of 201,925 options was
 accelerated by  an average of 15 months.  No other changes to  these options
 were made.  The weighted average exercise price of these accelerated options
 is  $21.15, and exercise  prices of  the affected options range from  $18.64
 to  $25.00.  The  accelerated  options constitute only 2.1% of the company's
 outstanding options.  No options held by any directors or executive officers
 of the Company were accelerated or affected in any manner by this action.

 The purpose of accelerating vesting of the options was to enable the Company
 to reduce the impact of  recognizing future compensation expense  associated
 with these  options  upon  adoption of  SFAS  123(R).  Commencing  with  the
 Company's fiscal year  that begins July 1, 2005,  SFAS  123(R) will  require
 that the Company recognize compensation expense  equal to the fair value  of
 equity-based compensation awards over the vesting period of each such award.
 The aggregate pre-tax expense for the  shares subject to acceleration  that,
 absent the  acceleration  of  vesting, would  have  been  reflected  in  the
 Company's consolidated  financial statements  beginning  in fiscal  2006  is
 estimated  to  be  a  total  of  approximately  $802  (approximately $510 in
 fiscal  2006,  approximately  $185  in  fiscal  2007,  approximately $89  in
 fiscal 2008  and  approximately $18 in fiscal 2009).  See "Recent Accounting
 Pronouncements," below for additional information related to stock options.

 For options currently outstanding,  the  adoption  of the fair value  method
 under SFAS  123(R) is  not expected  to  have a  significant impact  on  the
 Company's  consolidated  statements  of income and,  the  Company's  overall
 financial position will not be affected by the adoption of SFAS 123(R).  The
 actual impact of  SFAS 123(R) cannot  be predicted at  this time because  it
 will depend on  levels of  share-based payments  granted in  the future  and
 other factors.

 USE OF ESTIMATES

 The preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  accounting
 principles generally  accepted  in the  United  States of  America  requires
 management to  make  estimates  and assumptions  that  affect  the  reported
 amounts of assets and  liabilities and disclosure  of contingent assets  and
 liabilities as of  the date  of the  financial statements  and the  reported
 amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
 could differ from those estimates.

 REVENUE RECOGNITION

 The  Company  recognizes  revenue  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
 Statement of  Position  ("SOP")  97-2, "Software  Revenue  Recognition,"  as
 amended by SOP 98-9, "Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to  Certain
 Transactions," and  clarified  by  Staff Accounting  Bulletin  ("SAB")  101,
 "Revenue  Recognition   in   Financial  Statements,"   SAB   104,   "Revenue
 Recognition," and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21 ("EITF 00-21"),
 "Accounting  for  Revenue  Arrangements  with  Multiple  Deliverables."  The
 Company derives revenues from the following sources:  license fees,  support
 and  service  fees  and  hardware sales.  There  are  no rights  of  return,
 condition  of  acceptance  or  price  protection  in  the  Company's   sales
 contracts.

 License Fee Revenue.   For software license agreements  that do not  require
 significant modification  or  customization  of the  software,  the  Company
 recognizes  software  license  revenue   when  persuasive  evidence  of   an
 arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, the license fee is
 fixed and determinable and collection is  probable.  The Company's  software
 license agreements  generally  include  multiple products  and  services  or
 "elements."  None  of  these elements  are  deemed to  be essential  to  the
 functionality  of  the  other  elements.  SOP 97-2,  as  amended,  generally
 requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements
 to be allocated to each element based on Vendor Specific Objective  Evidence
 ("VSOE") of fair  value.  Fair  value is determined  for license fees  based
 upon the price charged when sold separately.  In the event that we determine
 that VSOE does  not exist for  one or more  of the delivered  elements of  a
 software arrangement, but does  exist for all  of the undelivered  elements,
 revenue is recognized the  residual method allowed by  SOP 98-9.  Under  the
 residual  method,  a  residual  amount  of  the  total  arrangement  fee  is
 recognized as revenue for the delivered elements after the established  fair
 value of all undelivered elements has been deducted.

 Support  and  Service  Fee Revenue.  Software  implementation  services  are
 generally  for  training,  implementation,  and  configuration  of  licensed
 software.  These services are not considered essential to the  functionality
 of  the  related  software.  VSOE  of  fair  value is established by pricing
 used when these services are sold separately.  Generally, for implementation
 services under $50,000 revenue is  recognized  when services  are completed.
 On certain larger implementations, revenue is recognized based on milestones
 during  the implementation.  Milestones are triggered by tasks completed  or
 based on direct labor hours.

 Maintenance support revenue is recognized pro-rata over the contract period,
 typically one year.  VSOE  of fair value  is  determined  based on  contract
 renewal rates.

 Outsourced  data  processing  services  and  ATM,  debit  card,  and   other
 transaction processing services  revenues are  recognized in  the month  the
 transactions are processed or the services are rendered.

 Hardware Revenue.   Hardware  revenue is  recognized  upon delivery  to  the
 customer, when title and risk of loss  are transferred.  VSOE of fair  value
 is determined based on pricing used when the items are sold separately.  The
 Company also remarkets maintenance contracts on hardware to our customers.
 Hardware maintenance  revenue  is  recognized  ratably  over  the  agreement
 period.

 PREPAID COST OF PRODUCT

 Costs for remarketed hardware and software maintenance contracts, which  are
 prepaid, are recognized ratably over the life of the contract, generally one
 to five years, with the related revenue amortized from deferred revenues.

 DEFERRED REVENUES

 Deferred revenues consist primarily of prepaid annual software support  fees
 and prepaid hardware  maintenance fees. Hardware  maintenance contracts  are
 multi-year; therefore, the deferred  revenue and maintenance are  classified
 in  accordance  with  the terms  of  the  contract.  Software  and  hardware
 deposits received are also reflected as deferred revenues.

 COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

 The Company  capitalizes new  product development  costs incurred  from  the
 point at which  technological feasibility has  been established through  the
 point at  which the  product is  ready  for general  availability.  Software
 development costs that are capitalized are evaluated on a product-by-product
 basis annually and are assigned an estimated economic life based on the type
 of product,  market characteristics,  and maturity  of the  market for  that
 particular product.  The Company's amortization policy for these capitalized
 costs is to amortize  the costs in accordance  with SFAS 86, Accounting  for
 the Costs  of Computer  Software to be Sold, Leased,  or Otherwise Marketed.
 Generally, these costs are initially amortized on a straight-line basis, and
 are monitored on a regular basis to assess that the  amortization  method is
 still  appropriate and that  the remaining estimated  life of  the asset  is
 reasonable (generally five to ten years).

 CASH EQUIVALENTS

 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three
 months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalents.

 INVESTMENTS

 The Company invests  its cash that  is not required  for current  operations
 primarily in  U.S. government  securities and  money market  accounts.   The
 Company has the  positive intent  and ability  to hold  its debt  securities
 until maturity and accordingly, these securities are classified as  held-to-
 maturity and are  carried at historical  cost adjusted  for amortization  of
 premiums and accretion  of discounts.  Premiums and discounts are  amortized
 and accreted, respectively, to interest income using the level-yield  method
 over the  period  to  maturity.  The held-to-maturity  securities  typically
 mature in less than one year.  Interest on investments in debt securities is
 included in income when earned.

 The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities  is $993 and $998 at  June
 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Fair market values of these securities did
 not differ  significantly from  amortized  cost due  to  the nature  of  the
 securities and minor interest rate fluctuations during the periods.

 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

 Property and equipment is stated at  cost and depreciated principally  using
 the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

 Intangible assets  consist  of goodwill,  customer  relationships,  computer
 software,  and  trade  names  acquired in  business acquisitions in addition
 to internally developed computer software.  The amounts are amortized,  with
 the  exception  of  goodwill  and  trade  names,  over an estimated economic
 benefit  period,  generally  five to twenty years,  using  the straight-line
 method.

 The Company reviews its long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets
 with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
 have indicated  that  the  carrying  amount  of  its  assets  might  not  be
 recoverable.  The Company evaluates goodwill and trade names for  impairment
 of value on an annual basis and between annual tests if events or changes in
 circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.

 COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

 Comprehensive income for each of the three years ended June 30, 2005  equals
 the Company's net income.

 BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

 In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosure About Segments of an  Enterprise
 and Related  Information, the  Company's operations  are classified  as  two
 business segments: bank systems  and services and  credit union systems  and
 services (see Note 13).  Revenue by type of product and service is presented
 on the face of the consolidated statements of income.  Substantially all the
 Company's revenues are derived from operations and assets located within the
 United States of America.

 COMMON STOCK

 In 2001, the Company's  Board of Directors approved  a stock buyback of  the
 Company's common stock of up to 3.0 million shares, and approved an increase
 to 6.0 million shares  in 2002.  Through fiscal  2004, a total of  3,00,9384
 shares had  been  repurchased by  the  Company under  these  authorizations.
 Repurchases through fiscal 2004 were funded with cash from operations.

 During fiscal 2004 there  were 2,009,694 shares  and 37,776 shares  reissued
 from treasury stock for the shares exercised under the employee stock option
 plan and purchased under the employee stock purchase plan, respectively.  At
 June 30, 2004, there were 315,651 shares remaining in treasury stock.

 During fiscal 2005 there were 306,027 shares and 9,624 shares reissued  from
 treasury  stock  for  the  shares  exercised under the employee stock option
 plan and purchased under the employee stock purchase plan, respectively.

 In  April  2005,  the  Board  of  Directors  increased  the  existing  stock
 repurchase authorization by 2.0 million shares to 8.0 million shares.  Under
 this  authorization,  the  Company  may finance  its share  repurchases with
 available cash  reserves or short-term  borrowings  on its  existing  credit
 facility.  The  share  repurchase  program  does  not include specific price
 targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time. As of June 30, 2005,
 553,300 shares had  been repurchased during the fiscal year  for $9,952.  At
 June 30, 2005, there were 553,300 shares remaining in treasury stock and the
 Company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to 4,437,316 shares.

 INCOME PER SHARE

 Per share information  is based  on the  weighted average  number of  common
 shares outstanding during the year.  Stock options have been included in the
 calculation  of  income per  diluted share to the  extent they are dilutive.
 The difference between basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding
 is the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options (see Note 10).

 INCOME TAXES

 Deferred tax liabilities and  assets are recognized for  the tax effects  of
 differences between  the financial  statement and  tax bases  of assets  and
 liabilities.  A valuation allowance would be established to reduce  deferred
 tax assets if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will  not
 be realized.

 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

 In December 2004,  the FASB  issued  SFAS No. 123 (R), "Share-Based Payment"
 ("SFAS 123(R)"), a revision of SFAS 123. SFAS 123 (R) supersedes APB 25  and
 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95 "Statement of Cash
 Flows"  ("SFAS 95").  SFAS  123(R) is  similar  to  the  approach  described
 in  SFAS  123  except that SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based payments  to
 employees, including grants of employee stock  options,  to be recognized in
 the consolidated statements of income,  in lieu  of pro forma disclosure  as
 provided above. SFAS 123 (R) is effective for fiscal periods beginning after
 June 15, 2005.  The Company adopted  the  provisions  of  SFAS 123 (R) as of
 July 1, 2005, the first day of fiscal 2006 and currently intends  to use the
 modified-prospective method and use the  Black-Scholes  model for estimating
 the fair value of equity compensation.

 In December 2004, the  FASB issued SFAS No.  153 ("SFAS 153"), Exchanges  of
 Nonmonetary Assets,  an  Amendment of  APB  Opinion No.  29,  effective  for
 nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June
 15, 2005, and therefore effective for the Company on July 1, 2005.  SFAS No.
 153 requires that exchanges  of productive assets be  accounted for at  fair
 value unless fair value cannot be  reasonably determined or the  transaction
 lacks commercial substance.  SFAS No. 153 is not expected to have a material
 effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

 In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position 109-1, "Application on FASB
 Statement No.  109,  Accounting for  Income  Taxes, for  the  Tax  Deduction
 Provided to U.S. Based  Manufacturers by the American  Jobs Creation Act  of
 2004" ("FSP 109-1").  FSP  109-1 clarifies how to apply Statement No. 109 to
 the new law's tax deduction for income attributable to "Domestic  production
 activities."  The Company is currently evaluating the impact  of the new law
 on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

 In May 2005,  the FASB issued  SFAS No. 154,  "Accounting Changes and  Error
 Corrections - a replacement of APB  Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement  No.3"
 ("SFAS 154").  SFAS 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for, and
 reporting of, a change  in accounting principle.  SFAS 154 requires  that  a
 voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all
 prior period financial statements presented using the accounting  principle.
 SFAS 154 is effective  for accounting changes and  corrections of errors  in
 fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.  The implementation of  SFAS
 154 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's  consolidated
 financial statements.


 NOTE 2: FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

 Fair values  for  held-to-maturity securities  are  based on  quoted  market
 prices.  For all other  financial instruments, including amounts  receivable
 or payable  and  short-term  borrowings, fair  values  approximate  carrying
 value, based on the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities and  the
 variability of the interest rates on the borrowings.


 NOTE 3: PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

 The classification of property and equipment, together with their estimated
 useful lives is as follows:

  (1)  Lesser of lease term or economic life


 At June 30,  2005 and  2004, the  Company had  commitments of  approximately
 $4,600 and $6,900, respectively, to purchase property and equipment.


 NOTE 4: OTHER ASSETS

 Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended June 30, 2005

 NOTE 5: LINES OF CREDIT

 The Company  renewed a  credit line  on  March 22, 2005  which provides  for
 funding of up to $8,000 and bears interest at the prime rate (6.00% at  June
 30, 2005).  The credit line expires March 22, 2006 and is secured by  $1,000
 of investments.  There were no outstanding amounts at June 30, 2005 or 2004.

 In October 2004, the  Company renewed a bank  credit line that provided  for
 funding up to $25,000 and bore interest at a variable LIBOR-based rate.   At
 March 31, 2005, there was a  30-day note outstanding for $14,000 under  such
 credit line.  The  credit line was  terminated and the  outstanding note  of
 $14,000 was paid in  full on April 19,  2005, using the  proceeds of a  loan
 under a new unsecured  revolving bank credit facility,  entered into on  the
 same date.

 The new unsecured revolving bank credit  facility allows borrowing of up  to
 $150,000, which may  be increased by  the Company at  any time  in the  next
 three years to $225,000.  The unsecured revolving bank credit facility bears
 interest at a rate  equal to (a) LIBOR  or (b) an  alternate base rate  (the
 greater of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2% or (b) the Prime Rate), plus
 an applicable percentage in each case  determined by the Company's  leverage
 ratio.  The new unsecured revolving credit line  terminates  April 19, 2010.
 At June 30, 2005, the outstanding revolving bank credit facility balance was
 $45,000 ($15,000 at 6.00%, $15,000 at 4.27% and $15,000 at 4.15% at June 30,
 2005).

 The Company paid interest of $171, $107, and $110 in 2005, 2004,  and  2003,
 respectively.

 Net operating  loss  carryforwards  of  $9,258  (from  acquisitions)  expire
 through the year 2024.  $1,699 is available for  use  in the Company's  June
 30, 2005 federal income tax returns leaving $7,559 available for  subsequent
 years.  The Company  paid income taxes of  $34,891, $20,314, and $19,025  in
 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

 The Company's federal income tax returns for the years ended June 30, 1999 -
 June 30, 2001  have been examined  by the Internal Revenue Service  ("IRS").
 In connection with the examination of these returns, the IRS has proposed to
 disallow  research  &  experimentation  ("R&E")  credits  claimed  on  these
 returns.  The Company has appealed this proposal, but a final  determination
 has not yet been received.  The complete disallowance of these credits would
 increase the Company's federal income tax liability by approximately  $1,500
 plus interest.  The Company believes that the R&E credits claimed for  these
 years are appropriate and has contested the disallowance  of these  credits.
 While there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in  contesting
 this disallowance, it believes  the facts or the  relevant tax law does  not
 support any such  disallowance.  Consequently, the  Company has not  accrued
 any liability in connection with this matter.


 NOTE 8: INDUSTRY AND SUPPLIER CONCENTRATIONS

 The Company  sells  its products  to  banks, credit  unions,  and  financial
 institutions throughout the  United States  and generally  does not  require
 collateral.  All  billings to customers  are due net  30 days  from date  of
 billing.  Reserves (which are insignificant  at June 30, 2005 and 2004)  are
 maintained for potential credit losses.

 In addition, the Company purchases most of its computer hardware and related
 maintenance for resale in relation to  installation of JHA software  systems
 from  two suppliers.  There are a limited  number of hardware suppliers  for
 these required materials.  If these relationships were terminated, it  could
 have a significant negative impact on the future operations of the Company.


 NOTE 9: STOCK OPTION PLANS

 The Company currently issues options under two stock option plans: the  1996
 Stock Option  Plan ("1996  SOP") and  the  Non-Qualified Stock  Option  Plan
 ("NSOP").

 1996 SOP

 The 1996  SOP was  adopted by  the  Company on  October  29, 1996,  for  its
 employees.  Terms and vesting periods  of the options are determined by  the
 Compensation Committee  of  the Board  of  Directors when  granted  and  for
 options outstanding include  vesting periods up  to four years.   Shares  of
 common stock are reserved for issuance under  this plan at the time of  each
 grant, which must be at or above fair market value of the stock at the grant
 date. The options terminate 30 days  after termination of employment,  three
 months after retirement, one year after death  or  10 years after grant.  In
 October 2002, the stockholders approved an  increase in the number of  stock
 options available from 13.0 million to 18.0 million shares.

 On April 11, 2003, the Company granted approximately 3,670,000 stock options
 to approximately  2,100  full  time  employees, or  94%  of  all  full  time
 employees as of that date.  The options were issued at the exercise price of
 $10.84 per share, which represented the fair market value of the stock as of
 that date and vest in two equal portions based on stock price performance or
 on specific dates.  The two  portions vested  and  became fully  exercisable
 when the Company's common stock achieved  a closing market price of 125%  or
 more  and  150%  or  more,  respectively,  of  the  exercise  price  for  10
 consecutive  trading  days.  Such  options  fully vested  during  the  first
 quarter  of fiscal  2004.  As of June 30, 2005, there were 2,344,533  shares
 available for  future  grants under  the  plan from  the  18,000,000  shares
 approved by the stockholders.

 On June 29, 2005, the Board  of Directors approved the immediate vesting  of
 all stock options previously granted under the  1996  SOP that had exercised
 prices higher than the market price on such date (See Note 1).

 NSOP

 Retirement Savings Plan (the "Plan").  The  plan is subject to the  Employee
 Retirement  Income  Security  Act  of 1975 ("ERISA")  as amended.  Under the
 Plan, the Company matches 100% of full time employee contributions  up to 5%
 of compensation subject to a maximum  of $5 per year.  Employees  must be 18
 years of age and be employed for at least  six months.  The Company has  the
 option of making a discretionary contribution;  however, none has been  made
 for  any  of  the  three  most  recent  fiscal  years.  The  total  matching
 contributions for the Plan were $5,212, $4,487, and $4,139 for fiscal  2005,
 2004, and 2003, respectively.

 The Company also  had an Employee  Stock Ownership Plan  (the "ESOP"  Plan),

 completing its liquidation.  No contribution had been made  to the ESOP Plan

 Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures

 As of the end of the period covered by  this Annual Report on Form 10-K,  an
 evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the  participation
 of our management, including our Company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and
 Chief Financial  Officer  (CFO), of  the  effectiveness of  the  design  and
 operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act
 Rules 13a-15  and  15d-15.  Based  upon that  evaluation,  the CEO  and  CFO
 concluded that our  disclosure  controls  and procedures  are  effective  in
 timely alerting  them  to  material  information  relating  to  the  Company
 (including our consolidated  subsidiaries) required  to be  included in  our
 periodic SEC filings.

 The  Management's  Report  on  Internal  Control  over  Financial  Reporting
 required  by  this  Item  9A  is  in  Item  8,  "Financial  Statements   and
 Supplementary Data."  Our independent registered accounting firm, Deloitte &
 Touche LLP, audited management's  assessment and independently assessed  the
 effectiveness of the Company's internal  control over financial reporting.
 Deloitte &  Touche LLP  has issued  an  attestation report  concurring  with
 management's assessment, which is included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

 During the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2005, there has been no change  in
 internal control over financial reporting  that has materially affected,  or
 is  reasonably  likely  to  affect,  the  Company's  internal  control  over
 financial reporting.

 Attached as Exhibits 31.1  and 31.2 to this  Annual Report on Form 10-K  are
 certifications of the  CEO and the  CFO, which are  required  in accord with
 Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act).  This
 Controls and  Procedures section  includes  the  information  concerning the
 controls evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should be  read
 in conjunction with the certifications.
