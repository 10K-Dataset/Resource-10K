                                     PART I

 Item 1.  Business

 Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. ("JHA" or the "Company") is a leading provider
 of integrated  computer systems  providing  data processing  and  management
 information to banks, credit unions and other financial institutions in  the
 United States.  The Company was formed  in 1976 and made its initial  public
 offering  in  1985.  Since formation,  JHA has  grown by  developing  highly
 specialized products and services  for its financial institution  customers,
 acquiring organizations that complemented and added to the infrastructure of
 the Company and adding new customers.

 We offer  a complete,  integrated suite of data processing system  solutions
 to improve  our  customers'  management  of  their  entire  back-office  and
 customer/member interaction processes.  We believe our solutions  enable our
 financial institution customers to provide better service to their customers
 and compete  more  effectively  against  other  banks,  credit  unions,  and
 alternative financial institutions.   Our customers  either install  and use
 our systems in-house or outsource these  operations to us.  We perform  data
 conversion and hardware and software installation for the implementation  of
 our systems and applications.  We  also provide continuing customer  support
 services  to  ensure  proper  product  performance  and  reliability,  which
 provides us with continuing client relationships and recurring revenue.  For
 our customers who prefer  not to acquire hardware  and software,  we provide
 outsourcing  services  through  seven  data  centers  and  seventeen   item-
 processing centers located across the United States.

 Our gross revenue  has grown from  $239.8 million in  fiscal 2000 to  $467.4
 million in fiscal 2004, representing a compound annual growth rate over this
 five-year period of 18%.  Net income from  continuing operations  has  grown
 from $34.4  million  in fiscal  2000  to $62.3  million  in fiscal  2004,  a
 compound annual growth rate of 14%.

 Industry Background

 According to the Automation in Banking 2004 report, United States  financial
 institutions,  including  commercial  banks,  thrifts  and  credit   unions,
 increased spending on hardware, software, services and telecommunications to
 $42.4 billion  in  calendar  2003  from  $36.6  billion  in  calendar  1999,
 representing a compound annual growth rate of 4%.  The increase of  industry
 spending was 2% from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003.

 In an article in June 2004,  the Silicon Valley Biz Ink, Financial  Services
 News, IDC of  Silicon Valley,  a premier  advisory firm  in the  information
 technology and telecommunications  industries, conducted a  survey of  banks
 regarding the role of information technology and future strategic priorities
 within the industry.  The top bank survey responses were meeting  regulatory
 requirements, managing  customer  relationships,  managing  risks,  reducing
 costs and attracting new customers.

 The Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation ("FDIC")  reported  there  were
 approximately 9,200 commercial and savings banks in the United States as  of
 December 31, 2003.  Our primary  market segment, bank systems and  services,
 which represented approximately 82% of our total revenues in fiscal 2004, is
 commercial banks with less than $30.0 billion in assets, of which there were
 approximately 9,140 at December 31, 2003.  Consolidation within the  banking
 and savings services industry has resulted  in a 3% compound annual  decline
 in  the population  of  commercial banks from calendar  years 1999 and 2003.
 Even with the  decline in  the population, there  was a  7% compound  annual
 increase  in their  aggregate  assets between  calendar year 1999  and 2003.
 Comparing years  2003  and 2002,  new  bank charters  increased  27%,  while
 mergers decreased 22%.

 Our other market  segment is credit  union systems and  services within  the
 United States.  The  National  Credit Union  Association reported there were
 9,400 credit unions  in the United  States as  of  December 31,  2003.  This
 segment represented approximately 18% of our total revenues  in fiscal 2004.
 These  are  primarily  cooperative,  not-for-profit  financial  institutions
 organized to promote savings and provide credit to their members.   Although
 the number of these credit unions has declined at a 3% compound annual  rate
 between calendar year 1999 and 2003,  their aggregate assets have  increased
 at a compound annual  growth rate of  9% to $610.2  billion at December  31,
 2003.

 According  to Callahan and Associates, 2004 Credit Union Technology  Survey,
 Credit Unions  participating  in  the  survey  are  looking  for  technology
 enhancements in customer relationship  management to expand member  services
 and generate product usage, enhance credit  union websites and home  banking
 platforms and upgrade ATMs for imaging  and Check  21 capability.  According
 to the respondents, 72% indicated  their technology-spending budget for  the
 upcoming year included security upgrades dealing with the internet.

 We believe that  commercial and  regional banks  and credit  unions play  an
 important role  with  the geographic  and  demographic communities  and  the
 customers they serve.  Typically, customers  and members of these  financial
 institutions rely on them because of their ability to provide  personalized,
 relationship-based  service  and  their  focus  on  retail,  commercial  and
 business needs.  We  believe these core strengths  will allow our  financial
 institution customers to effectively compete with other banks, credit unions
 and alternative financial institutions.  In order to succeed and to maintain
 strong customer relationships, we believe these banks and credit unions must
 continue to:

      *    focus on excellence in delivery to customers and members of  their
           primary products and service offerings;

      *    sell more  products and  services  to existing  customers  through
           utilization of customer relationship management ("CRM") products;

      *    implement advanced  technologies and  services, such  as  Internet
           banking services, imaging, and platform automation;

      *    use advanced  technologies  in back-office  processes  to  improve
           operating efficiency and control costs,  while increasing  service
           and lowering costs to their customers; and

      *    integrate products  and services  into their  core,  complementary
           service offerings and data  processing infrastructure, to  provide
           competitive products and services to their customers and members.

      *    manage risks by implementing  technology that monitors and  tracks
           transactions for fraud and criminal behavior.

 According to Automation in Banking 2004, in calendar 2003 approximately  55%
 of all  commercial banks  and 65%  of all  credit unions  utilized  in-house
 hardware and software systems to perform all of their core systems and  data
 processing functions.   Off-site  data  processing centers  provided  system
 services on an outsourced basis for 45% of  all banks and 31% of all  credit
 unions.  We have expanded our  outsourcing services and capacity to  include
 all of our core solution products.

 Internet banking, bill  payment, and  other services  for individuals,  plus
 cash management,  Automated  Clearing  House ("ACH")  management  and  other
 services for the commercial customers of financial institutions continue  to
 grow rapidly within the industry.

 Passage of  the  Check  Truncation  Act  (Check  21)  will  impact  industry
 practices with respect to clearing checks.  Under the new legislation, a new
 electronic image  instrument  will  now be  recognized  and  known  as  "the
 substitute check" or "image replacement document"  ("IRD").  This will  pave
 the way for widespread adoption of  clearing electronic images of checks  as
 opposed to the current practice of physically sending a check to the draw on
 bank for payment.

 Our Solution

 We are a  single-source provider of  a comprehensive and  flexible suite  of
 integrated products and services that address the information technology and
 data  processing  needs  of  financial  institutions  on  various   hardware
 platforms and operating systems.  Our  business derives revenues from  three
 primary sources of revenue:

      *    sales of software licenses;

      *    support and service fees which include installation services; and

      *    hardware sales.

 We develop  software applications  designed primarily  for use  on  hardware
 supporting IBM  and UNIX/NT  operating systems.   Our  marketed product  and
 service offerings are  centered on five  proprietary software  applications,
 each  comprising  the  core  data  processing  and  information   management
 functions of a commercial bank or credit  union.  Any of these core  systems
 can be utilized  either through an  in-house or  outsourced delivery  method
 depending  on the  financial institution's  management style and philosophy.
 Key functions of each of  our  core software applications  include deposits,
 loans,   general  ledger,  and  customer  information  file.   Our  software
 applications make  extensive use  of parameters  allowing our  customers  to
 tailor the software to their needs  without needing to customize or  program
 the software.   Our software applications  are designed  to provide  maximum
 flexibility in meeting  our customer data  processing requirements within  a
 single, integrated system.  To complement our core software applications, we
 provide a variety of complementary products  and services for use on an  in-
 house or an outsourced basis by financial institutions.

 We believe our solutions  provide strategic advantages  to our customers  by
 enabling them to:

      *    Implement  Advanced  Technologies  with Full  Functionality.   Our
           comprehensive suite of products  and  services is designed to meet
           our  customers'  information  technology  needs  through   custom-
           tailored  solutions  using  proprietary  software  products.   Our
           clients can either  perform these functions  themselves on  an in-
           house basis through the installation of our hardware and  software
           systems or outsource those functions to us.

      *    Rapidly  Deploy  New  Products  and  Services.  Once  a  financial
           institution has implemented our core software, either in-house  or
           on an outsourced  basis, we  can quickly  and efficiently  install
           additional applications and functions.  This allows our  customers
           to rapidly deploy new products and services.

      *    Focus on Customer Relationships.  Our products and services  allow
           our customers  to  stay  focused  on  their  primary  business  of
           gaining, maintaining  and expanding  their customer  relationships
           while providing the latest financial products and services.

      *    Access  Outsourcing  Solutions  to  Improve Operating  Efficiency.
           Customers utilizing our outsourcing solutions benefit from  access
           to all of  our products and  services without  having to  maintain
           personnel to develop,  update  and  run these systems  and without
           having to make  large up-front  capital expenditures  to implement
           these advanced technologies.

 Our Strategy

 Our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings organically,  supplemented
 by strategic acquisitions.  The key components of our business strategy  are
 to:

      *    Provide High  Quality, Value-Added  Products and  Services to  Our
           Clients.  We compete on the basis of providing our customers  with
           the highest-value products and services in the market.  We believe
           we have achieved  a reputation as  a premium  product and  service
           provider.

      *    Continue  to  Expand  Our  Product  and  Service  Offerings.    We
           continually upgrade our core software applications  and expand our
           complementary  product  and  service   offerings  to  respond   to
           technological  advances  and  the  changing  requirements  of  our
           clients.  For  example, we offer  several turn-key solutions  that
           enable financial institutions to rapidly deploy sophisticated  new
           products  and  services.   Our  integrated  solutions  enable  our
           customers to offer competitive  services relative to larger  banks
           and alternative financial institutions.  We intend to continue  to
           expand our  range of  Internet solutions  and other  products  and
           services.

      *    Expand Our Existing Customer Relationships.   We seek to  increase
           the information  technology products  and services  we provide  to
           those customers that do not utilize our full range of products and
           services.  In  this way,  we are  able to  increase revenues  from
           current customers  with  minimal additional  sales  and  marketing
           expenses.

      *    Expand  Our  Customer  Base.    We  seek  to  establish  long-term
           relationships with new customers  through our sales and  marketing
           efforts and selected acquisitions.   As of June  30, 2004, we  had
           over 5,900 customers, up from 2,850 in 2000.

      *    Build Recurring Revenue.  We  enter into contracts with  customers
           to provide services that meet their information technology  needs.
           We  provide  ongoing  software support for our in-house customers.
           Additionally, we  provide  data  processing  for  our  outsourcing
           customers and ATM and  debit card transaction switching  services,
           both on contracts that typically extend for periods of five to ten
           years.

      *    Maximize Economies of Scale.  We strive to develop and maintain  a
           sufficiently large  client  base  to create  economies  of  scale,
           enabling us to provide value-priced  products and services to  our
           clients while expanding our operating margins.

      *    Attract and Retain Capable Employees.   We believe attracting  and
           retaining high-quality  employees is  essential to  our  continued
           growth and success.  Our corporate culture focuses on the needs of
           employees, a  strategy we  believe has  resulted in  low  employee
           turnover.  In addition, we selectively use employee stock  options
           to serve as a strong incentive and retention tool.

 Our Acquisitions

 To complement and  accelerate our  internal growth,  we selectively  acquire
 companies that provide us with one or more of the following:

      *    new customers;

      *    products and services to complement our existing offerings;

      *    additional outsourcing capabilities; and/or

      *    entry into new markets related to financial institutions.

 When evaluating  acquisition opportunities,  we focus  on companies  with  a
 strong  employee   base  and   management   team  and   excellent   customer
 relationships.  Since the start of  our fiscal year 2000, we have  completed
 the following acquisitions:

 Our Products and Services

 Changing  technologies,  business  practices  and  financial  products  have
 resulted in issues  of compatibility, scalability  and increased  complexity
 for the hardware and software used in many financial institutions.  We  have
 responded to these issues by developing a fully integrated suite of products
 and services consisting  of core software  systems, hardware,  complementary
 products, and services.

 We provide our full range of products and services to financial institutions
 on either an in-house or outsourced  basis.  For those customers who  prefer
 to purchase  systems for  their in-house  facilities,  we contract  to  sell
 computer hardware, licenses for core and complementary software and contract
 to provide installation, data conversion, training and ongoing support,  and
 other services.

 We also  offer  our full  suite  of software  products  and services  on  an
 outsourced basis to customers who do  not wish to maintain, update, and  run
 these systems or to  make large up-front  capital expenditures to  implement
 these  advanced  technologies.  Our  principal  outsourcing service  is  the
 delivery of mission-critical data processing services using our data centers
 located within  the United  States.  We  provide  our  outsourcing  services
 through an extensive national data and service center network, comprised  of
 7 data centers and 17 item-processing centers.  We monitor and maintain  our
 network on a seven-day, 24-hour basis.  Customers typically pay monthly fees
 on service contracts of up to 5 years for these services.

 Information regarding  the  classification  of our  business  into  separate
 segments serving the  banking and credit  union industries is  set forth  in
 Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (see item 8 below).

 Hardware Systems

 Our software operates  on a variety  of hardware systems.   We have  entered
 into remarketing  agreements with  IBM Corporation,  Avnet, Inc.  and  other
 hardware providers which  allow us to  purchase hardware at  a discount  and
 sell  (remarket)   it  to   our  customers   together  with   our   software
 applications.  We currently sell the  IBM eServer systems (iSeries,  pSeries
 and xSeries); IBM workstations; Dell servers and workstations; NCR,  BancTec
 and Unisys check transports; and a variety of other devices that  complement
 our software solutions.

 We have a long-term strategic relationship  with IBM, dating to the  initial
 design of our first core software  applications more than  20 years ago.  In
 addition to our remarketing agreement with IBM, which we regularly renew, we
 have been named  a "Premier Business  Partner'' of IBM  for the last  twelve
 consecutive years.  Our relationship with IBM provides us with a substantial
 and ongoing source of revenue.

 Core Software Applications

 Each  of  our core  software systems  consists  of several  fully-integrated
 application  modules,  such  as  deposits, loans,  general ledger,  and  the
 customer information file,  which  is a centralized file containing customer
 data  for all applications.  We  can custom-tailor  these modules  utilizing
 parameters  determined  by our customers.  The applications can be connected
 to  a  wide  variety  of  peripheral  hardware  devices  used  in  financial
 institutions'  operations.  Our  software  is designed  to  provide  maximum
 flexibility  in meeting our customers' data processing requirements within a
 single system to minimize data entry and improve efficiencies.

 For our customers who choose to acquire in-house capabilities, we  generally
 license our core system under standard license agreements, which provide the
 customer with a fully paid, nonexclusive,  nontransferable right to use  the
 software on a single computer and at a single location.  These same  systems
 can be delivered on an outsourced basis as well.

 Our core  software  applications  are  differentiated  broadly  by  size  of
 customer, scalability, functionality, customer competitive environment  and,
 to a lesser extent, cost.  Our core applications include:

 servicing,  account   reclassification,   and  investment   sweeps   further
 complement our core systems.

 Installation and Training

 Although  not  a  requirement  of  the  software  contract, the  majority of
 our customers contract  with  us  for  installation  and  training  services
 in  connection  with  their  purchase  of  in-house  systems.  The  complete
 installation process of a core  system typically includes planning,  design,
 data conversion, hardware set-up, and testing.   At the culmination of  this
 installation  process,  one  of  our  installation  teams  travels  to   our
 customer's facilities  to ensure  the smooth  transfer of  data to  the  new
 system.  Separate charges for installation fees are billed to our  customers
 on  either  a  fixed  fee  or  hourly  charge model depending on the system,
 with full pass-through  to  our customers  of  travel  and  other  expenses.
 Installation and training services are also required in connection with  new
 outsourcing  customers,  and   are  billed   separately  at   the  time   of
 installation.

 Both in connection with installation of new systems and on an ongoing basis,
 our customers  require,  and we  provide,  extensive training  services  and
 programs related to our products and services.  Training is provided in  our
 regional training  centers,  at  meetings and  conferences,  onsite  at  our
 customers' location, or online with JHA Webex. Training can be customized to
 meet  our  customers' requirements.  The  large  majority of  our  customers
 acquire  training  services  from  us,  both  to  improve  their  employees'
 proficiency and productivity and  to make full use  of the functionality  of
 our systems.  Generally, training services are paid for on an hourly  basis,
 however, we have recently been successful in marketing annual  subscriptions
 for training services, representing blocks of training time that can be used
 by our customers in a flexible fashion and the related revenue is recognized
 as the services are provided.

 Support and Services

 Following the installation of our  integrated software and hardware  systems
 at a customer site, we provide  ongoing software support services to  assist
 our customers in operating the systems.  We also offer support services  for
 hardware, primarily through our hardware suppliers, providing customers  who
 have contracted for  this service with  "one-call'' system support  covering
 hardware and software applications.

 Support is provided  through a 24-hour  telephone service  available to  our
 customers seven days a week.  Our experienced support staff can resolve most
 questions and problems  quickly.  For  more complicated  issues, our  staff,
 with our customers' permission and assistance, can log on to our  customers'
 systems  remotely.  We  maintain  our  customers' software  largely  through
 releases which contain improvements and incremental additions.  Updates  are
 issued also when required by changes in applicable laws and regulations.  We
 provide support services on  our core systems as  well as our  complementary
 software products.

 Nearly all of our  in-house customers contract  for annual support  services
 from us.  These services are a significant source of recurring revenue,  and
 are  contracted  for  on  an  annual  basis  and  are  typically  priced  at
 approximately  18  to 20% of the  particular software product's license fee.
 These fees will increase as our customers' asset base increases and as  they
 increase the level of functionality of their system by purchasing additional
 complementary products.  Software support fees are generally billed at  June
 30 and are paid in advance for  the entire fiscal year, with pro-ration  for
 new contracts  that start during the year  at the time  of final conversion.
 Hardware support  fees are  also paid  in advance  for the  entire  contract
 period that ranges  from one to  five years.   Most contracts  automatically
 renew annually unless our customer or we give notice of termination at least
 60  days  prior  to  expiration.   Identical  support  is  provided  to  our
 outsourced customers by the same support personnel, but is included as  part
 of their overall monthly fees and therefore not billed separately.

 Internet Banking Solutions

 We provide a suite of fully  integrated Internet products and services  that
 enables financial  institutions to  offer  Internet banking  and  e-commerce
 solutions to their customers and members.  Our offerings include:

      * DirectLine[TM]  allows NetTeller customers to  offer a direct connect
        service  utilizing  personal financial  management  tools  for  their

 their commercial customers.  Our offerings include:

        items.

 ATM Solutions

 We provide a suite of ATM  solutions that offers financial institutions  the
 ability to manager all  aspects of their ATM  and debit card transactions.
 Our offerings include:

      * ATM Manager  Pro, a stand-alone product,  provides the reporting  and
        operational analysis  tools for ATM owners  from small to very  large
        deplorers to properly manage their ATM network;

      * PassPort.atm[TM] can drive and  monitor all types of lease lines  and
        dial-up ATM's, along  with the switch processing services  connecting
        financial institutions to regional and national networks;

      * PassPort.dc[TM] allows financial institutions to issue, support,  and
        manage signature based  Visa[R] Check or MasterMoney[TM] debit  cards
        worldwide;

      * PassPort.pro[TM]   provides   all  the   capabilities   a   financial
        institution needs  for online authorization  as well  as for  driving
        and monitoring its own network of hundreds of ATMs.

 Customer Relationship Management

 We offer two different CRM solutions for our customers:

      * Synapsys[TM]  is a  powerful  stand-alone tool  integrated  with  our
        strategic core products and provides an enterprise-wide  relationship
        management solution  for both  retail and  commercial customers  that
        integrates  sales  management, customer  profiling,  automated  sales
        tracking,  profitability assessment,  lead generation,  and  referral
        tracking  capabilities.   Its client/server  system allows  users  to
        download  data  from   existing  in-house  and  external   processing
        systems;

      * ARGOKeys[TM]  is  the ARGO/JHA  joint  solution  for  our  Silverlake
        customers'  that  provides  an  enterprise  wide  branch  sales   and
        automation  solution,  including   a  deposit  platform,  a   lending
        platform with an  advanced automated decision module, and a  complete
        CRM solution,  all of  which is fully  integrated with  our core  and
        teller systems.

 Research and Development

 We devote significant effort  and expense to  develop new software,  service
 products  and  continually  upgrade  and  enhance  our  existing  offerings.
 Typically, we  upgrade  our  core software  applications  and  complementary
 services once per year.  We believe our research and development efforts are
 highly efficient because  of the extensive  experience of  our research  and
 development staff and  because our product  development is highly  customer-
 driven.  Through our regular contact with customers at user group  meetings,
 sales  contacts  and  our ongoing maintenance services, our customers inform
 us  of the  new products  and  functionalities  they  desire.  Research  and
 development expenses for  fiscal 2004, 2003,  and 2002  were $23.7  million,
 $15.9 million, $12.5 million, respectively.

 Sales and Marketing

 Our primary markets consist of commercial banks and credit unions.

 Dedicated sales  forces, inside  sales teams,  and technical  sales  support
 teams conduct  our  sales efforts  for  our  two market  segments,  and  are
 overseen by regional  sales managers.   Our dedicated  sales executives  are
 responsible for pursuing lead generation activities for new core  solutions.
 Our  account executives nurture long-term relationships with our client base
 and cross sell  our many complementary  products  and services.  Our  inside
 sales  force  markets  specific  complementary  products  to  our   existing
 customers.  All  sales force personnel  have responsibility  for a  specific
 territory.  The sales support teams  write business proposals and  contracts
 and prepare responses  to request-for-proposals regarding  our software  and
 hardware solutions.  All  of our sales professionals  receive a base  salary
 and performance-based commission compensation.

 Our marketing efforts consist of sponsorship and attendance at trade  shows,
 e-mail newsletters, print media advertisement placements, telemarketing, and
 national and regional  marketing campaigns.   We  also conduct  a number  of
 national user group  meetings each year,  which enable us  to keep in  close
 contact with  our customers  and demonstrate  new products  and services  to
 them.

 We have 18  installations in the  Caribbean.  Our  international sales  have
 accounted for less than 1% of our total revenues in each of the three  years
 ended June 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002.

 Backlog

 Our backlog consists of contracted in-house products and services (prior  to
 delivery) and  the remaining  portion of  outsourcing contracts,  which  are
 typically for  five-year  periods  and  represents  the  minimum  guaranteed
 payments over the remainder of the contract period.  Our backlog at June 30,
 2004 was $67.2 million for in-house products and services and $124.1 million
 for outsourcing services, with  a total backlog of  $191.3 million.  Of  the
 $124.1 million amount  of the backlog  for outsourcing service  at June  30,
 2004, approximately $90.5  million is  not expected  to be  realized in  our
 current fiscal year due to the  long-term nature of many of our  outsourcing
 service contracts.  Backlog at June 30, 2003 was $69.4 million for  in-house
 products and services and  $113.7 million for  outsourcing services, with  a
 total  backlog  of  $183.1 million.  Our  backlog  is  subject  to  seasonal
 variations and can  fluctuate quarterly  due to  various factors,  including
 slower contract processing rates during the summer months.

 Competition

 The  market  for  companies  providing  technology  solutions  to  financial
 institutions  is  competitive  and  fragmented,  and  we  expect   continued
 competition from  both  existing  competitors  and  companies  entering  our
 existing or future  markets.  Some  of our current  competitors have  longer
 operating histories, larger customer bases, and greater financial resources.
 The  principal competitive  factors affecting  the market  for our  services
 include comprehensiveness of the  applications, features and  functionality,
 flexibility and  ease of  use, customer  support, references  from  existing
 customers and price.  We compete  with large vendors that offer  transaction
 processing  products  and  services  to  financial  institutions,  including
 Fidelity  National  Financial  Inc.,  Fiserv,  Inc.,  Intercept  Inc.,   and
 Metavante.  In addition,  we compete with a  number of providers that  offer
 one or more specialized  products or services.   There has been  significant
 consolidation  among  providers  of  information  technology  products   and
 services to financial institutions, and  we believe this consolidation  will
 continue in the future.

 Intellectual Property, Patents, and Trademarks

 Although we believe that  our success depends  upon our technical  expertise
 more than  on our  proprietary rights,  our future  success and  ability  to
 compete depends in part upon our proprietary technology.  We have registered
 or filed applications for our primary trademarks.  Most of our technology is
 not  patented.  Instead, we rely on a combination of contractual rights  and
 copyrights, trademarks  and  trade  secrets to  establish  and  protect  our
 proprietary technology.  We generally enter into confidentiality  agreements
 with  our  employees,  consultants,  resellers,  customers,  and   potential
 customers.  We restrict  access to and distribution  of our source code  and
 further  limit  the disclosure  and use  of other  proprietary  information.
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized  parties
 may  attempt to copy  or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology.
 We cannot be sure the steps taken by us  in this regard will be adequate  to
 prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will  not
 independently develop  technologies  that are  substantially  equivalent  or
 superior to our technology.

 Government Regulation

 The financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex  federal
 and state regulation.  Our current and prospective customers, which  consist
 of financial  institutions  such  as commercial  banks  and  credit  unions,
 operate in markets that are subject to substantial regulatory oversight  and
 supervision.   We must  ensure our  products and  services work  within  the
 extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to our  customers,
 including those  under  the federal  truth-in-lending  and  truth-in-savings
 rules, usury laws, the Equal Credit  Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing  Act,
 the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the  Fair Credit Reporting Act, the  Bank
 Secrecy Act,  the  USA Patriot  Act,  the Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act,  and  the
 Community Reinvestment Act.  The  compliance  of our  products and  services
 with these  requirements  depends on  a  variety of  factors  including  the
 particular functionality, the interactive  design and the classification  of
 customers.  Our customers must assess and determine what is required of them
 under these  regulations  and they  contract  with  us to  ensure  that  our
 products and services conform to their regulatory needs.  It is not possible
 to predict the impact any of these regulations could have on our business in
 the future.

 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 implemented a variety of regulations that are
 intended to restore the  public faith in the  financial information that  is
 publicized by corporate entities.  For our fiscal year ending June 2005,  we
 will be impacted by these rules through  assessing and testing our  internal
 control over financial reporting.

 We are not chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, the Board
 of Governors  of  the Federal  Reserve  System, the  National  Credit  Union
 Administration or other federal or state agencies that regulate or supervise
 depository institutions.  The services provided by our OutLink Data  Centers
 are subject to examination by the Federal Financial Institution  Examination
 Council regulators under the Bank Service  Company Act.  On occasion,  these
 services are also subject to examination by state banking authorities.

 We provide outsourced  data and item  processing through our  geographically
 dispersed OutLink Data  Centers, electronic  transaction processing  through
 PassPort ATM and Transaction Processing Solutions, Internet banking  through
 NetTeller online  banking,  and  bank  business  recovery  services  through
 Centurion  Disaster  Recovery.  We  are  a  service  provider  to  financial
 institutions  and  our  operations  are  governed  by  the  same  regulatory
 requirements as those imposed on financial  institutions.  As to these  data
 processing services, we are subject to periodic review by federal depository
 institution regulators who  have broad supervisory  authority to remedy  any
 shortcomings identified in such reviews.

 Employees

 As of June 30, 2004 and 2003,  we  had 2,533 and  2,257 full time  employees
 respectively.  Our employees  are not  covered  by  a collective  bargaining
 agreement and there have been no labor-related work stoppages.  We  consider
 our relationship with our employees to be good.

 Available Information

 Our   internet   website   is   easily   accessible   to   the   public   at
 www.jackhenry.com.  Our key corporate governance  documents and our Code  of
 Conduct addressing matters of business ethics are available in the "Investor
 Relations" portion of the website, together with archives of press  releases
 and other materials.  Our Annual  Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports  on
 Form 10-Q, Current  Reports on Form  8-K, and other  filings and  amendments
 thereto that  we make  with the  U.S.  Securities Exchange  Commission  (the
 "SEC") are available  free of charge  on the website  as soon as  reasonably
 practicable after such reports have been filed with or furnished to the SEC.


                                 RISK FACTORS

 The Company's business  and the results  of its operations  are affected  by
 numerous  factors and uncertainties,  some of  which are beyond our control.
 The following is  a description of  some of the  important risk factors  and
 uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the Company's  operations
 in future  periods to  differ materially  from those  currently expected  or
 desired.

 Changes within the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for
 our products.  In the current environment of low interest rates, the  profit
 margins of commercial banks and credit unions have narrowed.  As the economy
 has  stumbled,  loan demand has slackened  and loan defaults have increased.
 As a  result, many  banks and  credit unions  have slowed  or stopped  their
 capital spending,  including spending  on  computer software  and  hardware,
 affecting both  sales to  new  customers and  upgrade/complimentary  product
 sales to existing customers.

 We may not  be able to  manage growth.   We have grown  both internally  and
 through  acquisitions.   Our  expansion  has  and  will  continue  to  place
 significant  demands  on  our  administrative,  operational,  financial  and
 management personnel and systems.  We cannot assure you that we will be able
 to  enhance  and  expand  our  product   lines,  manage  costs,  adapt   our
 infrastructure and modify our systems to accommodate future growth.

 If we fail to adapt our products  and services to changes in technology,  we
 could lose existing customers  and be unable to  attract new business.   The
 markets  for  our   software  and   hardware  products   and  services   are
 characterized by  changing  customer requirements  and  rapid  technological
 changes.   These  factors and  new  product introductions  by  our  existing
 competitors or  by new  market  entrants could  reduce  the demand  for  our
 existing products and services and we may be required to develop or  acquire
 new products and services.  Our  future success is dependent on our  ability
 to enhance our  existing products  and services in  a timely  manner and  to
 develop or acquire new products and services.   If we are unable to  develop
 or acquire new products and services  as planned, or fail to achieve  timely
 market acceptance of our new or enhanced products and services, we may incur
 unanticipated expenses, lose sales or fail to achieve anticipated revenues.

 Acquisitions may be  costly and difficult  to integrate.   We have  acquired
 several  businesses  and   will  continue  to   explore  possible   business
 combinations in the future.   We may  not  be able to successfully integrate
 acquired  companies.  We  may  encounter  problems in  connection  with  the
 integration of  new businesses  including:  financial control  and  computer
 system compatibility; unanticipated costs; unanticipated quality or customer
 problems with  acquired  products  or services;  diversion  of  management's
 attention; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers
 and customers; loss of key employees; and significant amortization  expenses
 related to identifiable intangible assets.  Without additional acquisitions,
 we may not  be able  to grow and  to develop  new products  and services  as
 quickly as we  have in  the past  to meet  competitive challenges.   If  our
 integration strategies fail, our  business, financial condition and  results
 of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

 If  our  strategic  relationship  with  IBM were  terminated, it  could have
 a negative impact  on  the  continuing  success of  our  business.  We  have
 developed a strategic relationship with IBM.  As part of this  collaborative
 relationship, we market and sell IBM hardware and equipment to our customers
 under an  IBM  Business Partner  Agreement  and resell  maintenance  on  IBM
 hardware products to our customers.  Much of our software is designed to  be
 compatible  with  the  IBM  hardware  that  is  run  by  a  majority of  our
 customers.  If IBM were to terminate or fundamentally  modify  our strategic
 relationship, our  relationship  with our  customers  and our  revenues  and
 earnings would  suffer.   We could  also lose  software market  share or  be
 required to redesign existing products or develop new products that would be
 compatible with the hardware used by our customers.

 Competition may  result in  price reductions  and decreased  demand for  our
 products and services.  We expect  competition in the markets we serve  will
 remain vigorous.  We compete on  the basis of product quality,  reliability,
 performance,  ease  of  use,  quality  of  support  and pricing.  We  cannot
 guarantee that we  will be able  to compete successfully  with our  existing
 competitors or with companies entering our  markets in the future.   Certain
 of our  competitors  have  strong  financial,  marketing  and  technological
 resources and, in some cases, a larger customer  base than we do.  They  may
 be able to adapt more quickly to  new or emerging technologies or to  devote
 greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services.

 The loss of key employees could adversely affect our business.  We depend to
 a significant  extent  on the  contributions  and abilities  of  our  senior
 management.  Our  Company has grown  significantly in recent  years and  our
 management remains concentrated in a small  number of key employees.  If  we
 lose one or more of our key employees, we  could suffer a loss of sales  and
 delays in new product development, and management resources would have to be
 diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss.  We do not  have
 employment agreements  with  any  of our  executive  officers;  however,  we
 currently have a management succession plan in place.

 Consolidation of  financial  institutions could  reduce  the number  of  our
 customers   and  potential  customers.   Our  primary  market  consists   of
 approximately 9,140 commercial banks (includes savings  & loans ) and  9,400
 credit  unions.  The number  of  commercial  banks  and  credit  unions  has
 decreased because of mergers  and acquisitions over the  last decade and  is
 expected to continue to  decrease as more  consolidation occurs, which  will
 reduce our number of  potential customers.   Because of this  consolidation,
 some of our  existing customers could  terminate, or refuse  to renew  their
 contracts with us and potential customers could break off negotiations  with
 us.

 The  services  we  provide  to  our  customers  are  subject  to  government
 regulation that could hinder our ability to develop portions of our business
 or impose additional constraints on the way we conduct our operations.   The
 financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal  and
 state regulation.  As a supplier of services to financial institutions, some
 of our  operations are  examined by  the Office  of the  Comptroller of  the
 Currency, the  Federal  Reserve  Board and  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance
 Corporation, among  other  regulatory  agencies.   These  agencies  regulate
 services we provide and the manner in which we operate, and we are  required
 to  comply  with  a broad  range  of applicable  laws  and  regulations.  In
 addition, existing  laws,  regulations, and  policies  could be  amended  or
 interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that has a negative impact
 on  our  existing operations or that  limits our future growth or expansion.
 Our customers  are also  regulated entities,  and the  form and  content  of
 actions by regulatory  authorities could determine  both the decisions  they
 make concerning the purchase of data  processing and other services and  the
 timing and implementation of these decisions.  The development of  financial
 services over the  Internet has  raised concerns  with respect  to the  use,
 confidentiality,  and security of  private customer information.  Regulatory
 agencies,  Congress  and   state  legislatures   are  considering   numerous
 regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and
 to require compliance by the industry with standards and policies that  have
 not been defined.

 Network or  Internet  security  problems could  damage  our  reputation  and
 business.  We rely on standard  network and Internet security systems,  most
 of which  we  license  from  third parties,  to  provide  the  security  and
 authentication  necessary to  effect secure transmission  of data.  Computer
 networks and the  Internet are vulnerable  to unauthorized access,  computer
 viruses and other disruptive  problems.  In  addition, advances  in computer
 capabilities, new discoveries in the field  of cryptography or other  events
 or developments may render our security measures inadequate.  Someone who is
 able  to  circumvent  security  measures  could  misappropriate  proprietary
 information or  cause  interruptions  in our  operations  or  those  of  our
 customers.  Security risks may result in liability to us and also may  deter
 financial institutions from purchasing our products.  We may need to  expend
 significant capital  or other  resources protecting  against the  threat  of
 security breaches or alleviating problems  caused by breaches.   Eliminating
 computer viruses  and  alleviating other  security  problems may  result  in
 interruptions, delays or cessation of service  to users, any of which  could
 harm our business.

 As technology becomes less expensive and  more advanced, purchase prices  of
 hardware  may  decline  and  our  revenues  and  profits  from   remarketing
 arrangements  may   decrease.   Computer  hardware  technology  is   rapidly
 developing.  Hardware  manufacturers are producing  less expensive and  more
 powerful equipment each year, and we expect this trend to continue into  the
 future.  As computer hardware becomes  less expensive, revenues and  profits
 derived from  our hardware  remarketing may  decrease and  become a  smaller
 portion of our revenues and profits.

 An  operational  failure  in  our  outsourcing  facilities could cause us to
 lose customers.  Damage  or destruction  that interrupts  our  provision  of
 outsourcing services could  damage our relationship  with certain  customers
 and may  cause us  to  incur substantial  additional  expense to  repair  or
 replace damaged equipment.  Although we  have installed back-up systems  and
 procedures to prevent  or reduce disruption,  we cannot assure  you that  we
 will not  suffer  a prolonged  interruption  of our  transaction  processing
 services.  In the event that an interruption of our network extends for more
 than several hours, we may experience  data loss or a reduction in  revenues
 by reason of such interruption.  In addition, a significant interruption  of
 service could have a  negative impact on our  reputation and could lead  our
 present and potential customers to choose service providers other than us.

 If others claim that we have  infringed their intellectual property  rights,
 we could be liable for significant damages.   We do not believe that any  of
 our products or services infringe the  proprietary rights of third  parties.
 We cannot be sure, however, that  others will not make infringement  claims,
 and we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against those  claims.
 We  anticipate that the number of  infringement claims will increase as  the
 number of software solutions and services increases and the functionality of
 our products and  services expands.  Any of  those claims,  whether with  or
 without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and  may
 not be resolved on terms favorable to us.

 Expansion of services to  non-traditional customers could  expose us to  new
 risks. Some  of our  recent acquisitions  include  business lines  that  are
 marketed outside our traditional,  regulated, and litigation-averse base  of
 financial institution customers.  These  non-regulated customers may  entail
 greater operational, credit and litigation risks  than we have faced  before
 and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs

 Competitive pressures in  our industry  or general  economic conditions  may
 require that  we  reduce  our  prices or  offer  other  favorable  terms  to
 customers on our products and services  which could result in lower  margins
 and reduce net income.  We compete with a variety of software vendors in all
 of our major  product lines.   Some of our  competitors may have  advantages
 over us due to  their size, product lines,  greater marketing resources,  or
 exclusive intellectual property rights.  If competitors offer more favorable
 pricing, payment or other  contractual terms, warranties, or  functionality,
 or if  general economic  conditions decline  such  that customers  are  less
 willing or able to pay the cost of our products, we may need to lower prices
 or offer other favorable terms in order to successfully compete.

 If requirements  relating to  the accounting  treatment for  employee  stock
 options are changed, we  may be forced to  change our business  practices or
 our earnings may  be affected.   We currently  account for  the issuance  of
 stock options under  APB Opinion  No. 25,  "Accounting for  Stock  issued to
 Employees."  Certain  proposals related to  accounting for the  grant of  an
 employee stock option  as an expense  are currently  under consideration  by
 accounting standards organizations  and governmental authorities.   If  such
 proposals are  adopted, our  earnings will  be negatively  impacted.   As  a
 result, we  may decide  to reduce  the number  of stock  options granted  to
 employees or to  grant options to  fewer employees.   This could affect  our
 ability to retain existing employees  and attract qualified candidates,  and
 also could increase the cash compensation we would have to pay them.

 Increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues may  decrease
 overall margins.  We continue to experience a trend of a greater  proportion
 of our  products being  sold as  outsourcing services  rather than  in-house
 licenses.  We  realize lower  margins on  service revenues  than on  license
 revenues.   Thus, if  service revenue  increases as  a percentage  of  total
 revenue, our gross margins would be  lower and our operating results may  be
 impacted.


 Item 2.     Properties

 We own  approximately 153  acres located  in Monett,  Missouri on  which  we
 maintain eight office  and shipping  &  receiving and maintenance buildings.
 We also  own buildings  in Houston,  Texas; Allen,  Texas; Albuquerque,  New
 Mexico;  Birmingham,  Alabama;  Angola,  Indiana;  Lenexa,  Kansas;  Shawnee
 Mission, Kansas; Rogers, Arkansas;  Oklahoma  City, Oklahoma and San  Diego,
 CA.  Our  owned facilities represent  approximately 692,000  square feet  of
 office space in  nine states.   We have 34  leased office  facilities in  21
 states, which total approximately 240,000 square feet.  All of the space  is
 utilized for normal business purposes.

 Of these facilities,  leased office space  totaling approximately 44,500  in
 one facility  is devoted  primarily to  serving  our credit  union  business
 segment, with the remainder of our leased and all owned facilities primarily
 devoted to serving our bank business segment.  We have purchased a  building
 in San Diego, CA with approximately  93,000 square feet, that when  occupied
 in  the  future,  will  replace  the  leased  building  in  San  Diego,   CA
 specifically for the credit union segment of our business.

 We own seven aircraft,  which are utilized for  business purposes.  Many  of
 our customers  are  located  in  communities that  do  not  have  an  easily
 accessible commercial airline service.   We primarily  use our airplanes  in
 connection with installation, sales of systems and internal requirements for
 day-to-day operations.   Transportation  costs  for installation  and  other
 customer services are billed to our customers.  We lease property, including
 real estate  and  related  facilities, at  the  Monett,  Missouri  municipal
 airport.


 Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

 We are subject to  various routine legal proceedings  and claims arising  in
 the ordinary course of business. We do not expect that the results in any of
 these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our business,
 financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 Item 6.   Selected Financial Data



 Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
           Results of Operations

 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the
 "Selected Financial  Data" and  the  consolidated financial  statements  and
 related notes included elsewhere in this report.

 OVERVIEW

 We provide  integrated computer  systems for  in-house and  outsourced  data
 processing  to  commercial   banks,  credit  unions   and  other   financial
 institutions.  We  have  developed and  acquired  banking and  credit  union
 application software  systems  that  we  market,  together  with  compatible
 computer hardware, to these  financial institutions.   We also perform  data
 conversion and software installation for  the implementation of our  systems
 and provide  continuing  customer support  services  after the  systems  are
 installed.  For  our customers who  prefer not to  make an up-front  capital
 investment in software and hardware, we  provide our full range of  products
 and services on an  outsourced basis through our  seven data centers and  17
 item-processing centers located throughout the United States.

 We derive revenues from three primary sources of revenue:

   - sales of software licenses;

   - support and service fees, which include installation services; and

   - hardware sales.

 Over the last five fiscal years, our revenues have grown from $239.8 million
 in fiscal 2000  to $467.4 million  in fiscal 2004.   Income from  continuing
 operations has grown from $34.4 million  in fiscal 2000 to $62.3 million  in
 fiscal 2004.  This  growth has  resulted primarily  from internal  expansion
 supplemented by strategic acquisitions, allowing  us to develop and  acquire
 new products and  services and expand  the number of  customers who use  our
 core software systems to approximately 2,340 as of June 30, 2004.

 Since the start of our fiscal year 2000, we have completed twelve  accretive
 acquisitions.  Eleven  of these acquisitions  were accounted  for using  the
 purchase method  of accounting  and  our consolidated  financial  statements
 include the  results of  operations of  the  acquired companies  from  their
 respective acquisition dates.  The  remaining acquisition was accounted  for
 using the pooling-of-interests method.

 License revenue represents  the sale  and delivery  of application  software
 systems contracted  with us  by the  customer.  We license  our  proprietary
 software products under standard  license agreements that typically  provide
 the customer  with  a  non-exclusive,  non-transferable  right  to  use  the
 software on  a  single  computer and  for  a  single  financial  institution
 location.  In  revenue arrangements with  multiple elements, the  components
 are  all  separately and independently priced  within the related contracts.
 Allocation of  revenue  is consistent  with  pricing when  each  product  or
 service is sold separately  establishing Vendor Specific Objective  Evidence
 ("VSOE").  Generally,  a deposit is  payable upon execution  of the  license
 agreement with additional  payments due  at specified  times after  contract
 signing.  We recognize software license revenue upon delivery and acceptance
 of the software and documentation.

 Support  and  services  fees   are  generated  from  installation   services
 contracted with us by the customer,  ongoing support services to assist  the
 customer in operating the  systems and to enhance  and update the  software,
 and from providing  outsourced data processing  services and  ATM and  debit
 card processing  services. We  recognize  installation services  revenue  as
 services are performed under hourly contracts  and at the completion of  the
 installations under fixed fee contracts.  Revenues from software support are
 generated pursuant to annual agreements and are recognized ratably over  the
 life of the agreements.  Outsourcing services are performed through data and
 item centers. Revenues from outsourced item and data processing and ATM  and
 debit card processing services are derived from monthly usage fees typically
 under five-year  service  contracts with  our  customers. We  recognize  the
 revenues under these contracts as services are performed.

 Cost of license fees represents the third party vendor costs associated with
 license fee revenue.

 Cost  of   services  represents   costs  associated   with  conversion   and
 installation efforts, ongoing support for our in-house customers,  operation
 of  our  data  and  item  centers  providing  services  for  our  outsourced
 customers, ATM  and debit  card processing  services, and  direct  operation
 costs.  These costs are recognized as they are incurred.

 We  have  entered   into  remarketing  agreements   with  several   hardware
 manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware and related services  to
 our  customers.   Revenues  from hardware  sales  are  recognized  when  the
 manufacturers ship the hardware directly to our customers.  Cost of hardware
 consists of the direct  and related costs of  purchasing the equipment  from
 the manufacturers and delivery to our customers.  These costs are recognized
 at the same time as the related revenue.

 We have two business  segments: bank systems and  services and credit  union
 systems and services.  The respective segments include all related  license,
 support and  service, and  hardware sales  along with  the related  cost  of
 sales.


 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003

 Fiscal year 2004  showed strong growth  in revenues and  improved gross  and
 operating margins, which allowed us to  leverage a 16% increase in  revenues
 to a 26% increase in net income.

 REVENUE - Revenues  increased  16% from  $404.6 million  in fiscal  2003  to
 $467.4 million in fiscal 2004.  Fiscal 2004 license revenue increased 30% to
 $62.6 million from $48.3 million.  Support and service revenue increased 20%
 to $311.3  million from  $260.5 million  in fiscal  2003.   In fiscal  2004,
 hardware revenue decreased by 2%, to $93.5 million from $95.9 million.

 License revenue grew by $14.3 million  dollars compared to last fiscal  year
 due  to  increased  delivery   of  software  relating   to  the  timing   of
 installations.  Support and service revenue, which includes outsourcing, in-
 house support,  ATM and  debit card  processing, and  installation  services
 increased by  $50.8  million  and contributed  to  67%  of  fiscal  revenues
 compared with 64%  in fiscal  2003.  The  increase reflects  an increase  of
 $23.8 million for in-house  support, a 19%  increase  from fiscal 2003.  In-
 house support  increased  due to  our  continued installation  of  core  and
 complementary products  during the  fiscal year,  for  which most  of  these
 customers  contract  for  ongoing  support  service,  beginning  upon  final
 installation.  Outsourcing services grew by $11.8 million, which reflects  a
 17% increase in fiscal 2004 due to growth in volume with existing  customers
 and installations  of new  customers  which led  to  expansion of  our  data
 centers.  ATM  and debit card  processing services realized  growth of  $9.6
 million for the  year with  an increase  of 36%.   We  began offering  these
 services to the  credit union segment  this year, which  contributed to  the
 growth.  Installation services  grew by $5.6 million  or 15% over the  prior
 year correlating  to the  increase of  license revenue.   Recurring  revenue
 (support and service revenue less installation services) increased to 57% of
 total revenue in fiscal 2004 from 55% of total fiscal 2003 revenue.

         Support and Services Revenue
         (in millions)                  Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003
                                        -----------------------------------
                                        Dollar Increase    Percent Increase
                                        ---------------    ----------------
         In-House Support                    $23.8               19%
         Outsourcing Services                $11.8               17%
         ATM and Debit Card Services          $9.6               36%
         Installation Services                $5.6               15%
                                             -----              ----
         Total Increase                      $50.8               20%
                                             =====              ====

 Hardware revenue remained relatively flat  year over year, while  decreasing
 to 20% of revenues compared with  24% of fiscal 2003 revenues primarily  due
 to the  increase in  our license  revenue and  expansion and  growth in  our
 support and service revenue for the year.

 COST  OF  SALES - Cost of  sales increased  11% for  the year,  from  $251.3
 million in fiscal 2003 to  $279.4 million in fiscal  2004.  Cost of  support
 and service increased 17%  to $207.7 million from  $178.3 million in  fiscal
 2003.  The increase is primarily due  to a 12% increase in employee  related
 expenses for  increased headcount  and a  24% increase  in depreciation  and
 amortization expense included in the cost  of support and service.  This  is
 due mainly to our  efforts to continue  improving operating  efficiencies by
 investing and upgrading technology  equipment.  Both  fiscal years' cost  of
 support and service  remained constant  at 44% of  total revenue.   Cost  of
 license increased 22%, from $3.9 million  in fiscal 2003 to $4.7 million  in
 fiscal 2004,  mainly due  to  obligations to  third  party vendors  for  the
 software we resell.  Cost of hardware  decreased 3% to $67.0 million  or 14%
 of total revenue in fiscal year 2004 from $69.1 million or 17% of revenue in
 2003 fiscal  year.   The decrease  in  cost of  hardware correlates  to  the
 decrease in hardware revenue.

 GROSS PROFIT - Gross profit increased  23% to $188.0 million in fiscal  2004
 from $153.3 million in fiscal 2003. The gross margin for fiscal 2004 was 40%
 compared to 38% for fiscal 2003.  Gross profit on license revenue  increased
 $13.5 million  or 30%  in fiscal  2004.   Gross  margin on  license  revenue
 remained  consistent  at  92%  for  both fiscal  years.   The  gross  profit
 improvement is  due  to  a  significant increase  in  the  delivery  of  the
 Company's  core and complementary software licenses.  For fiscal year  2004,
 delivery of third party license revenue and cost remained flat when compared
 with fiscal 2003.

 Gross profit  for support  and service  increased $21.4  million or  26%  in
 fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal  2003. Support and service gross  margin
 improved to 33%  this year  from 32% in  the prior  year.   The increase  is
 primarily due  to  increased volumes,  increased  number of  customers,  and
 continued  leveraging  of  resources  of  employees  and  equipment  in  our
 outsourcing and ATM/Debit card processing services.

 Hardware gross margin for fiscal year 2004 and fiscal 2003 remained even  at
 28%.

 OPERATING EXPENSES - Operating expenses increased 17% for the current  year,
 with the majority of  the increase generated  from research and  development
 expenses.  Research and development expenses increased 49% to $23.7  million
 for fiscal 2004, compared to $15.9 million for fiscal 2003.  The increase is
 primarily attributable to a 45% increase in employee related  expenses.  The
 increase includes standard salary  increases along with additional  employee
 headcount for  ongoing  development  of new  products  and  enhancements  to
 existing products in both segments of our business.

 Selling and  marketing  expenses increased  17%  to $36.0  million  in  2004
 compared to $30.7  million for fiscal  year 2003.  The increase  relates  to
 higher employee related expenses in fiscal  2004 compared with fiscal  2003,
 which is  relatively  in line  with  the growth  in  revenue.   General  and
 administrative expenses  remained  flat at  $29.5  million for  both  fiscal
 years.  This is due to overall cost control measures implemented  throughout
 the year.

 INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)  -  Interest income (expense) increased from  $0.5
 million in fiscal  2003 to  $0.9  million in  fiscal 2004.  Interest  income
 increased 60%  from $0.6  million to  $1.0 million  due to  higher  invested
 balances.  Interest expense decreased 3%  from $110,000 in fiscal year  2003
 to $107,000 in fiscal 2004.

 PROVISION FOR  INCOME TAXES  -  The provision  for  income taxes  was  $37.4
 million or 37.5% of income before income taxes in fiscal 2004 compared  with
 $28.4 million, or 36.5% of income before  income taxes in fiscal 2003.   The
 increase in the  percentage for  fiscal 2004 is  due to  changes in  various
 state tax laws and the allocation of income amongst states.

 NET INCOME  - Net  income increased  26% from  $49.4 million,  or $0.55  per
 diluted share in fiscal 2003 to $62.3 million, or $0.68 per diluted share in
 fiscal 2004.

 FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002

 Fiscal year 2003 was a profitable but  challenging year due to being one  of
 the most difficult markets the technology  industry has seen in more than  a
 decade. Revenue  was  relatively  flat  compared  to  the  prior  year  with
 decreased gross margins  primarily due to  a 7% increase  in cost of  sales,
 which resulted in a 13% decrease in net income

 REVENUE - Revenues increased 2% from $396.7 million in fiscal 2002 to $404.6
 million in fiscal 2003. Compared to fiscal 2002, license fees decreased 27%,
 support and service revenues increased 14%, and hardware sales decreased 5%.

 Reflecting the strength in new  outsourcing business, revenues from  support
 and services  continues to  grow,  increasing to  64%  of revenues  in  2003
 compared to 58% of 2002 revenues. The increase is composed of $10.8  million
 or 17% increase in outsourcing services,  $5.2 million or 24% growth in  ATM
 and debit card processing services, $16.4 million or 16% growth in  in-house
 support and,  a slight  decrease  of $0.6  million  or 2%  for  installation
 services.  Recurring revenue (support and service revenue less  installation
 services) increased to 55% of total revenue in fiscal 2003 from 47% of total
 fiscal 2002 revenue.

 Continued softness in banking core system sales negatively impacted revenues
 from license fees  and hardware sales  in 2003. For  the year, license  fees
 dropped 27% to  $48.3 million  or 12% of  total 2003  revenues, compared  to
 $66.6 million, or 17% of 2002 revenues.  The decrease is due to the  overall
 reduced number of software  licenses delivered during the  year in our  bank
 segment. Hardware revenue  decreased 5% to  $95.9 million or  24% of  fiscal
 2003  revenues  compared with $101.3 million or 26% of fiscal 2002 revenues.
 This decline is  primarily attributable to  the decrease  in software  sales
 which typically drives the sale of related hardware.

 COST OF SALES - Cost of sales increased 7% during the fiscal year, primarily
 due to  a 9%  increase in  employee  related expenses  included in  cost  of
 services.  Cost of license increased  55%, from $2.5 million in fiscal  2002
 to $3.9 million in fiscal 2003, primarily due to obligations to third  party
 vendors for  the software  we resell.   Cost  of services  increased 10%  to
 $178.3 million or 44% of revenue  in fiscal 2003 compared to $161.5  million
 or 41% of revenue in the fiscal 2002, which is in line with the increase  in
 revenue.  Cost of hardware decreased 3% from $71.4 million or 18% of revenue
 in year 2002 to $69.1 million or 17% of revenue in current 2003 fiscal year.

 GROSS PROFIT - Gross profit decreased 5% from $161.2 million in fiscal  2002
 to $153.3 million in fiscal  2003.  The total  gross margin for fiscal  2003
 was 38% compared  to 41% for  fiscal 2002.   Gross profit  on license  sales
 decreased $19.7 million or 31% and gross margin decreased from 96% in fiscal
 2002 to 92% in  fiscal 2003.  The  decrease in gross profit  was due to  the
 overall weakness in the capital goods market and the reduction in the margin
 is primarily due to  the decrease in license  revenue, which is our  highest
 margin revenue.

 Gross profit for  support and  services increased  $15.0 million  or 22%  in
 fiscal year  2003  compared to  fiscal  2002. Support  and  service  margins
 continue to strengthen to  32% this year from  29% in the  prior year.   The
 increase  is  primarily  due  to  increased  volumes,  increased  number  of
 customers, and  continued leveraging  of resources  in our  outsourcing  and
 ATM/Debit card processing services.

 Hardware gross margin for the current fiscal year 2003 was 28%, compared  to
 30% margin in fiscal  year 2002.   The decrease in  hardware margin for  the
 year is primarily attributable to the sales mix of products. In fiscal  2003
 our hardware  sales included  a higher  percentage of  servers and  personal
 computers  related  to  networks  than  in  2002.  Network  hardware  has  a
 significantly  lower  margin  than midrange  hardware  and  reader  sorters.
 Another contributing factor to  lower gross margin  has been reduced  vendor
 incentives in fiscal 2003.

 OPERATING EXPENSES - Operating expenses increased  2% for the current  year,
 with the majority of  the increase generated  from research and  development
 expenses. Research and development expenses went up by 27% to $15.9  million
 for fiscal 2003 as compared to $12.5 million for fiscal 2002.  The  increase
 is primarily attributable to a 27% increase in employee related expenses for
 ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products in
 both  segments  of  our  business.  Selling and  marketing  annual  expenses
 increased 4% to $30.7 million in  2003 compared to $29.4 million for  fiscal
 year 2002.  General  and  administrative expenses  decreased  10%  to  $29.5
 million this year from  $32.7 million in fiscal  year 2002, mainly due  from
 ongoing efforts to control expenses by management.

 INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)  -  Interest income (expense) decreased from  $1.8
 million in fiscal  2002 to  $0.5 million in  fiscal  2003.  Interest  income
 decreased 69% from $2.0 million to $0.6 million due to lower interest  rates
 on investments.  Interest expense decreased $81,000 from $191,000 in  fiscal
 year 2002 to $110,000  in fiscal 2003.   The decrease is  due to short  term
 borrowings being paid  off in January  2002, with  no additional  borrowings
 since that date.

 PROVISION FOR  INCOME TAXES  -  The provision  for  income taxes  was  $28.4
 million or 36.5% of income before income taxes in fiscal 2003, compared with
 $31.4 million, or 36%  of income before  income taxes in  fiscal 2002.   The
 increase in the tax  rate in the current  fiscal year is  due to changes  in
 effective state income tax rates.

 NET INCOME  - Net  income decreased  13%  from $57.1  million, or  $.62  per
 diluted share in fiscal 2002 to $49.4 million, or $.55 per diluted share  in
 fiscal 2003.

 Gross Profit Margin       40%        39%        42%

 Revenues in the bank systems and services business segment increased 11%  to
 $382.1 million in  fiscal 2004  from $343.1 million  in fiscal  2003.   This
 increase was primarily due to improved  license sales for most products  and
 continued growth  in support  and service  revenue.   Gross profit  in  this
 business segment increased  15% to  $154.6 million  or 40%  gross margin  in
 fiscal 2004 from $135.0 million or 39% gross margin for the year ended  June
 30, 2003.  The  increase in gross  profit is primarily  due to increases  in
 revenue combined with  improved procedures, leverage  of infrastructure  and
 overall cost controls.

 Revenues in the bank systems and services business segment increased 1% from
 $339.3 million  in fiscal  2002 to  $343.1 million  in fiscal  2003.   Gross
 profit in this  business segment  decreased 6%  from $143.6  million or  42%
 gross margin in fiscal 2002  to $135.0 million or  39% gross margin for  the
 year ended June 30, 2003.  This decline in gross profit is primarily due  to
 the industry trend of an overall decrease in capital spending for the fiscal
 year and is reflected by the  significant decrease in software and  hardware
 revenues offset somewhat by the increase  in services revenue. The  decrease
 in gross margin  is primarily due  to the significant  reduction in  license
 revenue, which is our highest margin revenue

 Gross Profit Margin       39%        30%        31%

 Revenues in the credit union systems and services business segment increased
 to $85.3  million  in  fiscal  2004  from  $61.5  million  in  fiscal  2003,
 representing  a 39% increase.  This increase was  primarily due to  improved
 license sales and  strong growth  in support  and service  revenue from  new
 services  introduced  this  year.  Gross  profit in  this  business  segment
 increased from $18.3 million  or 30% gross profit  margin in fiscal 2003  to
 $33.3 million or 39% gross profit margin  for the year ended  June 30, 2004.
 The credit  union  segment margin  growth  is primarily  due  to  additional
 products and  services  sold  which carry  a  higher  gross  profit  margin,
 continued leverage of existing resources, improved processes and  procedures
 combined with overall cost controls.

 Revenues  in  the  credit  union  systems  and  services  business   segment
 increased from $57.3  million  in  fiscal  2002  to  $61.5 million in fiscal
 2003, representing a  7%  increase.  Gross  profit in this  business segment
 increased from $17.7 million  or 31% gross profit  margin in fiscal 2002  to
 $18.3  million  or 30% gross profit margin for the year ended June 30, 2003.
 Despite the sluggish economy, the credit  union segment was able to  achieve
 growth in revenue and maintain a  consistent gross margin.  The increase  in
 revenue was due to  additional core customers during  the year and  expanded
 product offerings in this segment.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources

 We have historically generated positive cash  flow from operations and  have
 generally used existing  resources and  funds generated  from operations  to
 meet capital requirements.  We expect this trend to continue in the future.

 The Company's cash and cash equivalents  increased to $53.8 million at  June
 30, 2004, from $32.0 million at June 30, 2003.  Cash provided by  operations
 increased $13.9 million to $112.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30,
 2004  as  compared to $98.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003.
 The increase consists  of an  increase in net  income of  $12.9 million,  an
 increase in depreciation and  amortization expense of  $3.3 million, a  $2.4
 million decrease in deferred income taxes,  an increase in loss on  disposal
 of property and equipment of $2.3 million, and a decrease of $0.7 million in
 other expenses.  There was an  increase of $0.6  million in  the  change  of
 trade receivables, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued  expenses,
 plus an increase of $10.4 million in the change in accrued income taxes  and
 a decrease of $12.5 in the change in deferred revenues.

 Cash used in investing  activities for the fiscal  year ended June 2004  was
 $100.0 million,  which  included  capital  expenditures  of  $49.1  million,
 primarily  for  an  office  building  in  San  Diego,  CA,  a  new  facility
 in  Birmingham,  AL,   and  building  infrastructure  within   the  company.
 Acquisitions of four  businesses which  expanded our  product offerings  and
 expanded our potential market,  used $48.3 million,  while $4.4 million  was
 used for software development costs.  Financing activities generated cash of
 $9.0 million,  primarily  from the  proceeds  from issuance  of  stock  upon
 exercise of stock options less dividends paid of $13.4 million.

 On September 21,  2001, the Company's  Board of Directors  approved a  stock
 buyback of  the Company's  common stock  of up  to 3.0  million shares,  and
 approved an increase to 6.0 million shares on October 4, 2002.  The  buyback
 has been funded with cash from operations.   As of June 30, 2003,  3,012,933
 shares had been purchased for $49,218,870. No shares were repurchased during
 fiscal 2004.   During fiscal  2004 there  were 2,009,694  shares and  37,776
 shares reissued from treasury stock for the shares exercised in the employee
 stock option plan and  the employee stock purchase  plan, respectively.   At
 June 30, 2004, there were 315,651 shares remaining in treasury stock.

 During fiscal  2003, 501,740  shares and  60,249 shares  were reissued  from
 treasury stock for the  shares exercised in the  employee stock option  plan
 and the employee stock purchase plan, respectively.

 We currently have a bank credit line that provides for funding of up to $8.0
 million  and  bears interest  at the prime rate  (4 1/4 % at June 30, 2004).
 There were no outstanding amounts during the years  ended and as of June 30,
 2004 and 2003.

 Subsequent to June  30, 2004, the  Company's Board of  Directors declared  a
 cash dividend of $.04 per share on its common stock payable on September 21,
 2004, to stockholders of  record on September 8,  2004.  Current funds  from
 operations are adequate for this purpose.   The Board has indicated that  it
 plans to  continue  paying dividends  as  long as  the  Company's  financial
 picture continues to be favorable.

 Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments

 At  June  30,  2004,  the  Company's  total  off-balance  sheet  contractual
 obligations  were $10.9 million.  This balance consists  of $4.0 million  of
 long-term operating leases for various facilities  which expire from 2005 to
 2009 and the remaining  $6.9 million  is for purchase commitments related to
 property and equipment.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 Effective November 22, 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached
 a consensus  regarding  EITF Issue  No.  02-16, Accounting  by  a  Customer,
 Including a Reseller, for Cash Consideration  Received from a Vendor.   This
 consensus requires that payments from a vendor be classified as a  reduction
 to the price of the vendor's goods and taken as a reduction to cost of sales
 unless the payments are (1) a  reimbursement for costs incurred to sell  the
 product or (2)  a payment for  assets or services  provided.  The  consensus
 also requires that payments  from a vendor be  recognized as a reduction  to
 cost of  sales  on a  rational  and systematic  basis.   This  consensus  is
 effective for fiscal years beginning after  December 15, 2002 (July 1,  2003
 for JHA).  The  adoption of this consensus  on July 1, 2003  did not have  a
 material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or  results
 of operations.

 In January  and  December 2003,  the  Financial Accounting  Standards  Board
 ("FASB")  issued  Interpretation  No. 46  ("FIN  46")  and  No.  46, revised
 ("FIN 46R"),  Consolidation  of Variable Interest  Entities, ("VIE").  These
 statements, which address accounting for entities commonly known as special-
 purpose or  off-balance-sheet  entities, require  consolidation  of  certain
 interest or  arrangements  by  virtue of  holding  a  controlling  financial
 interest in  such  entities.   Certain  provisions  of FIN  46R  related  to
 interests in special-purposes entities were applicable for the period  ended
 March 31, 2004.  The  Company has considered the  application of FIN 46  and
 FIN 46R to certain business relationships,  and concluded that the  adoption
 of this new method of accounting for variable interest entities did not  and
 is not expected  to have a  material impact on  the consolidated results  of
 operations and financial position.

 In May 2003,  the FASB issued  Statement of  Financial Accounting  Standards
 ("SFAS")  No.  150,  Accounting  for  Certain  Financial  Instruments   with
 Characteristics of both Liabilities  and Equity.   SFAS No. 150  establishes
 standards for  how  an  issuer classifies  and  measures  certain  financial
 instruments with characteristics of both liabilities  and equity.  SFAS  No.
 150 requires classification  of a financial  instrument that  is within  its
 scope as a liability, or an  asset in some circumstances.   SFAS No. 150  is
 effective for financial instruments entered into  or modified after May  31,
 2003, and was  therefore effective for  the Company on  July 1,  2003.   The
 adoption of this standard  did not have a  material impact on the  Company's
 financial statements.

 In December  2003, the  Securities and  Exchange Commission  ("SEC")  issued
 Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 104, Revenue Recognition.  SAB No. 104
 supercedes SAB No. 101,  Revenue Recognition in  Financial Statements.   The
 primary purpose of SAB No. 104  is to rescind accounting guidance  contained
 in SAB No. 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements,  superceded
 as a result of the issuance of EITF Issue No. 00-21.  Additionally, SAB  No.
 104  rescinds  the  SEC's   Revenue  Recognition  in  Financial   Statements
 Frequently Asked Questions and Answers ("the  FAQ") issued with SAB No.  101
 that  has  been codified  in SEC  Topic 13,  Revenue  Recognition.  Selected
 portions of the  FAQ have been  incorporated into SAB  No. 104.   While  the
 wording of SAB No. 104 has changed to reflect the issuance of EITF Issue No.
 00-21, the  revenue recognition  principles of  SAB No.  101 remain  largely
 unchanged by the issuance of SAB No. 104.   The adoption of SAB No. 104  did
 not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

 Critical Accounting Policies

 We  prepare  our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance   with
 accounting  principles  generally  accepted   in  the  United  States.   The
 significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the  consolidated
 financial statements.   Certain of  these accounting  policies as  discussed
 below require  management to  make estimates  and assumptions  about  future
 events  that  could  materially  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,
 liabilities, revenues and expenses and  disclosure of contingent assets  and
 liabilities.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
 assumptions or conditions.

 We record  revenue in  accordance with  Statement  of Position  (SOP)  97-2,
 Software Revenue Recognition,  as amended.  We recognize revenue from  sales
 of hardware, software and services and from arrangements involving  multiple
 elements of each of the above.  Revenue for multiple element arrangements is
 recorded based on contractual amounts, which  are determined based upon  the
 price charged  when  sold  separately.   Revenue  is  not  recognized  until
 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee
 is  fixed  and  determinable,  and  collectibility  is  probable.  Sales  of
 hardware and equipment  are  recorded when title and risk of loss transfers.
 Licensing  revenues  are  recorded  upon  delivery  and  acceptance  of  the
 software.  Service fees for training and installation are recognized as  the
 services are  provided.   Support  revenues  are recorded  evenly  over  the
 related contract period.

 As discussed previously in  the overview, the  Company has established  VSOE
 separately for  all the  individual components  of licensing,  installation,
 support, and  hardware and  recognizes revenue  separately for  the  various
 components.  The components are all independently priced and consistent with
 pricing when  each element  is sold  separately.   There  are no  rights  of
 return, conditions of acceptance or price protections in our contracts.

 The calculation of  depreciation and amortization  expense is  based on  the
 estimated economic lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment and
 intangible assets,  which have   been  examined for  their useful  life  and
 determined that no impairment  exists.  We believe  it is unlikely that  any
 significant changes  to the  useful lives  of  our tangible  and  intangible
 assets will  occur in  the near  term, but  rapid changes  in technology  or
 changes in market  conditions could result  in revisions  to such  estimates
 that could materially  affect the  carrying value  of these  assets and  the
 Company's future consolidated operating results.  All long lived assets  are
 tested for valuation and potential impairment on a scheduled periodic basis.

 Forward Looking Statements

 Except  for  the  historical  information  contained  herein,  the   matters
 discussed in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
 and Results of Operations and other portions of this report contain forward-
 looking statements within the  meaning of federal  securities laws.   Actual
 results are  subject  to  risks  and  uncertainties,  including  both  those
 specific to the  Company and  those specific  to the  industry, which  could
 cause results to differ materially from  those contemplated.  The risks  and
 uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the matters detailed in "Risk
 Factors" in Item 1 of the Company's 2004 Form 10-K annual report filed  with
 the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Undue reliance should not be placed
 on the  forward-looking statements.   The  Company  does not  undertake  any
 obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements.

 Potential risks and uncertainties which  could adversely affect the  Company
 include: the  financial  health of  the  banking industry,  our  ability  to
 continue or effectively manage growth, adapting our products and services to
 changes  in  technology,  changes  in  our  strategic  relationships,  price
 competition, loss of key employees,  consolidation in the banking  industry,
 increased government  regulation,  network or  internet  security  problems,
 declining  computer  hardware  prices,  and  operational  problems  in   our
 outsourcing facilities.


 Item 7A.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

 Market risk refers to  the risk that a  change in the level  of one or  more
 market prices, interest rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or  other
 market factors  such as  liquidity,  will result  in  losses for  a  certain
 financial instrument or group  of financial instruments.   We are  currently
 exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and interest risk  on
 investments in U.S. government securities.  We actively monitor these  risks
 through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management.   We
 do not currently  use any derivative  financial instruments.   Based on  the
 controls in place, credit worthiness of  the customer base and the  relative
 size of these  financial instruments, we  believe the  risk associated  with
 these  instruments  will  not  have  a   material  adverse  effect  on   our
 consolidated financial position or results of operations.

 responsibility of  the  Company's  management.   Our  responsibility  is  to
 express an opinion on these consolidated  financial statements based on  our
 audits.

 We conducted our audits in accordance  with standards of the Public  Company
 Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we
 plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  the
 financial statements are free of material  misstatement.  An audit  includes
 examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and  disclosures
 in  the  financial  statements.   An  audit   also  includes  assessing  the
 accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,  as
 well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe
 that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 In our opinion,  such consolidated financial  statements present fairly,  in
 all material respects, the  financial position of  Jack Henry &  Associates,
 Inc. and Subsidiaries at June  30, 2004 and 2003,  and the results of  their
 operations and their cash flows  for each of the  three years in the  period
 ended June  30, 2004,  in conformity  with accounting  principles  generally
 accepted in the United States of America.

                JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
          (Amounts In Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Amounts)


 NOTE 1.  NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY

 Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. and Subsidiaries ("JHA" or the "Company") is a
 leading provider  of  integrated  computer systems  that  has  developed  or
 acquired several banking  and credit union  software systems. The  Company's
 revenues are predominately  earned by marketing  those systems to  financial
 institutions nationwide along with the computer equipment (hardware) and  by
 providing the conversion and software installation services for a  financial
 institution to utilize a JHA software  system. JHA also provides  continuing
 support and  services to  customers using  the  systems either  in-house  or
 outsourced.

 CONSOLIDATION

 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of JHA and all of
 its subsidiaries, which are wholly- owned, and all significant  intercompany
 accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

 STOCK OPTIONS

 As permitted under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")  No.
 123, Accounting for  Stock-Based Compensation ("SFAS  No.123"), the  Company
 has elected to follow  Accounting Principles Board  Opinion ("APB") No.  25,
 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees  ("APB No. 25"), in accounting  for
 stock-based  awards to employees.  Under APB No.  25, the Company  generally
 recognizes no compensation expense  with respect to  such awards, since  the
 exercise price of  the stock options  awarded are equal  to the fair  market
 value of the underlying security on the grant date.

 Pro forma  information  regarding  net income  and  earnings  per  share  is
 required in financial  statements for periods  beginning after December  15,
 2002, by SFAS  No. 148, Accounting  for Stock-Based  Compensation-Transition
 and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB  Statement No. 123, for awards  granted
 after December 31, 1994, as if the Company had accounted for its stock-based
 awards to employees under the  fair value method of  SFAS No. 123. The  fair
 value of the Company's stock-based awards  to employees was estimated as  of
 the date  of the  grant  using a  Black-Scholes  option pricing  model.  The
 Company's pro forma information is as follows:

 USE OF ESTIMATES

 The preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  accounting
 principles generally  accepted  in the  United  States of  America  requires
 management to  make  estimates  and assumptions  that  affect  the  reported
 amounts of  assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets  and
 liabilities as  of  the  date  of  the financial statements and the reported
 amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the reporting  period.  Actual
 results could differ from those estimates.

 REVENUE RECOGNITION

 In October  1997,  the  Accounting  Standards  Executive  Committee  of  the
 American  Institute  of  Certified   Public  Accountants  ("AcSEC")   issued
 Statement  of  Position  ("SOP")  97-2,  Software  Revenue Recognition.  The
 Company adopted  SOP  97-2 effective  July  1,  1998.   SOP  97-2  generally
 requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements
 to be allocated to  each element based  on the relative  fair values of  the
 elements.

 The Securities  and  Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  issued  Staff  Accounting
 Bulletin ("SAB") No. 104,  Revenue Recognition, on December  17, 2003.   SAB
 No. 104  provides the  SEC Staff's  views  on selected  revenue  recognition
 issues and was adopted by the Company in the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal
 year 2004.  The adoption of  SAB No. 104 did not  have a material effect  on
 the Company's consolidated financial statements.

 For multiple  element  arrangements,  the  Company  has  established  Vendor
 Specific Objective  Evidence  ("VSOE")  separately for  all  the  individual
 components of licensing, installation, support, and hardware and  recognizes
 revenue  separately  for  the  various components.  The components  are  all
 independently priced and consistent with pricing  when each element is  sold
 separately.  There are no rights of return, condition of acceptance or price
 protection in the Company's sales contracts.

 The Company's  various  sources  of  revenue  and  the  methods  of  revenue
 recognition are as follows:

      License - Licensing fees are recognized upon delivery and acceptance of
      the software. All software of the Company is sold unmodified.  Cost  of
      licenses purchased and remarketed  are reported as  cost of license  in
      cost of sales.  These revenues include reimbursements for out of pocket
      expenses incurred.

      Software installation and related services  -  Fees for these  services
      are recognized as the services are performed on hourly contracts and at
      completion  and  acceptance  on  fixed-fee  contracts.  These  revenues
      include reimbursements for out of pocket expenses incurred.

      Support and service - Fees from these contracts are recognized  ratably
      over the life of the in-house support or outsourcing service  contract.
      Regulatory  requirement  changes  and  technical  enhancements  to  the
      software are specifically referenced and included in the annual support
      contracts.

      Hardware - Revenues from sales of  hardware are recognized upon  direct
      shipment to the Company's customers from  the supplier. Costs of  items
      purchased  and  remarketed  are  reported as cost  of  hardware in cost
      of  sales.  Revenues  and related  costs  of  hardware maintenance  are
      recognized ratably over the life of the contract.

 RECLASSIFICATION

 Where appropriate, prior year's financial information has been  reclassified
 to conform to the current year's presentation.

 PREPAID COST OF PRODUCT

 Costs for remarketed hardware and software maintenance contracts, which  are
 prepaid, are recognized ratably over the life of the contract, generally one
 to five years, with the related revenue amortized from deferred revenues.

 DEFERRED REVENUES

 Deferred revenues consist primarily of prepaid annual software support  fees
 and prepaid hardware  maintenance fees. Hardware  maintenance contracts  are
 multi-year; therefore, the deferred  revenue and maintenance are  classified
 in  accordance  with  the terms  of  the  contract.  Software  and  hardware
 deposits received are also reflected as deferred revenues.

 COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

 The Company  capitalizes new  product development  costs incurred  from  the
 point at which  technological feasibility has  been established through  the
 point at  which the  product is  ready  for general  availability.  Software
 development costs that are capitalized are evaluated on a product-by-product
 basis annually and are assigned an estimated economic life based on the type
 of product,  market characteristics,  and maturity  of the  market for  that
 particular product.  The Company's amortization policy for these capitalized
 costs is to amortize  the costs in accordance  with SFAS No. 86,  Accounting
 for the  Costs  of  Computer  Software to  be  Sold,  Leased,  or  Otherwise
 Marketed.  Generally, these costs are initially amortized on a straight-line
 basis, and are monitored on a regular basis to assess that the  amortization
 method is still  appropriate and that  the remaining estimated  life of  the
 asset is reasonable (generally five to ten years).

 CASH EQUIVALENTS

 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three
 months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalents.

 INVESTMENTS

 The Company invests  its cash that  is not required  for current  operations
 primarily  in  U.S. government  securities and  money market  accounts.  The
 Company has the  positive intent  and ability  to hold  its debt  securities
 until maturity and accordingly, these securities are classified as  held-to-
 maturity and are  carried at historical  cost adjusted  for amortization  of
 premiums and accretion  of discounts.  Premiums and discounts are  amortized
 and accreted, respectively, to interest income using the level-yield  method
 over the  period  to  maturity. The  held-to-maturity  securities  typically
 mature in less than one year. Interest on investments in debt securities  is
 included in income when earned.

 The  amortized  cost  of  held-to-maturity  securities  is  $998 at June 30,
 2004 and  2003.  Fair market  values  of  these  securities did  not  differ
 significantly from amortized cost  due to the nature  of the securities  and
 minor interest rate fluctuations during the periods.

 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

 Property and equipment is stated at  cost and depreciated principally  using
 the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

 Intangible assets  consist  of goodwill,  customer  relationships,  computer
 software, and trade names  acquired in business  acquisitions.  The  amounts
 are amortized,  with the  exception of  goodwill and  trade names,  over  an
 estimated economic benefit period, generally five to twenty years, using the
 straight-line method.

 The Company reviews its long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets
 with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
 have indicated  that  the  carrying  amount  of  its  assets  might  not  be
 recoverable.  The Company evaluates goodwill and trade names for  impairment
 of value on an annual basis and between annual tests if events or changes in
 circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.

 COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

 Comprehensive income for each of the three years ended June 30, 2004  equals
 the Company's net income.

 BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

 In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosure About Segments of an  Enterprise
 and  Related  Information, the  Company's operations  are classified  as two
 business segments: bank systems  and services and  credit union systems  and
 services (see Note 13).  Revenue by type of product and service is presented
 on the face of the consolidated statements of income.  Substantially all the
 Company's revenues are derived from operations and assets located within the
 United States of America.

 COMMON STOCK

 On September 21,  2001, the Company's  Board of Directors  approved a  stock
 buyback of  the Company's  common stock  of up  to 3.0  million shares,  and
 approved an increase on October 4, 2002 to 6.0 million shares.  Through June
 30, 2004, 3,012,933 shares had been  purchased for $49,219.  No shares  were
 repurchased during fiscal 2004.  At June 30, 2003, 2,363,121 shares remained
 in treasury stock.  During fiscal  2004, 2,009,694 shares and 37,776  shares
 were reissued from treasury stock for shares exercised in the employee stock
 option plan and the employee stock purchase plan, respectively.  At June 30,
 2004, 315,651 shares remained in treasury stock.

 INCOME PER SHARE

 Per share information  is based  on the  weighted average  number of  common
 shares outstanding during the year.  Stock options have been included in the
 calculation  of income  per  diluted share to the  extent they are dilutive.
 The difference between basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding
 is the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options (see Note 10).

 INCOME TAXES

 Deferred tax liabilities and  assets are recognized for  the tax effects  of
 differences between  the financial  statement and  tax bases  of assets  and
 liabilities.  A valuation allowance would be established to reduce  deferred
 tax assets if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will  not
 be realized.

 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

 Effective November 22, 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached
 a consensus  regarding  EITF Issue  No.  02-16, Accounting  by  a  Customer,
 Including a Reseller, for Cash Consideration  Received from a Vendor.   This
 consensus requires that payments from a vendor be classified as a  reduction
 to the price of the vendor's goods and taken as a reduction to cost of sales
 unless the payments are (1) a  reimbursement for costs incurred to sell  the
 product or (2)  a payment for  assets or services  provided.  The  consensus
 also requires that payments  from a vendor be  recognized as a reduction  to
 cost of  sales  on a  rational  and systematic  basis.   This  consensus  is
 effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2002.  The  adoption
 of this consensus by JHA on July 1, 2003  did not have a material impact  on
 the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

 In January  and  December 2003,  the  Financial Accounting  Standards  Board
 ("FASB")  issued  Interpretation  No.  46  ("FIN  46")  and No. 46,  revised
 ("FIN 46R"),  Consolidation  of Variable Interest Entities, ("VIEs").  These
 statements, which address accounting for entities commonly known as special-
 purpose or  off-balance-sheet  entities, require  consolidation  of  certain
 interest or  arrangements  by  virtue of  holding  a  controlling  financial
 interest  in  such  entities.  Certain  provisions  of FIN  46R  related  to
 interests in special-purposes entities were applicable for the period  ended
 March 31, 2004.  The  Company has considered the  application of FIN 46  and
 FIN 46R to certain business relationships,  and concluded that the  adoption
 of this new method of accounting for variable interest entities did not have
 a material impact on  the consolidated results  of operations and  financial
 position.

 In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain  Financial
 Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities  and Equity.  SFAS  No.
 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures  certain
 financial  instruments with characteristics  of both liabilities and equity.
 SFAS  No. 150 requires  classification of  a financial  instrument  that  is
 within its scope as a  liability, or an asset  in some circumstances.   SFAS
 No. 150  is effective  for financial  instruments entered  into or  modified
 after May 31, 2003, and was therefore  effective for the Company on July  1,
 2003.  The adoption of this standard did  not have a material impact on  the
 Company's financial statements.


 NOTE 2: FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

 Fair values  for  held-to-maturity securities  are  based on  quoted  market
 prices.  For all other  financial instruments, including amounts  receivable
 or payable  and  short-term  borrowings, fair  values  approximate  carrying
 value, based on the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities and  the
 variability of the interest rates on the borrowings.


 NOTE 3: PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

 The classification of property and equipment, together with their estimated
 useful lives is as follows:

 Net operating  loss  carryforwards  of  $3,343  (from  acquisitions)  expire
 through the year 2019.  The  Company paid income taxes of $20,314,  $19,025,
 and $15,900 in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

 The Company's federal income tax returns for the years ended June 30, 1999 -
 June 30, 2001,  are  currently under  examination  by the  Internal  Revenue
 Service ("IRS").  In connection  with the examination of these returns,  the
 IRS is  proposing to  disallow research  &  experimentation  ("R&E") credits
 claimed on these returns.  The complete disallowance of these credits  would
 increase the Company's federal income tax liability by approximately  $1,500
 plus interest.  The Company believes that the R&E credits claimed  for these
 years are appropriate and is currently contesting the disallowance of  these
 credits.  While there can be no assurance that the Company would prevail  in
 contesting  any disallowance,  it believes the facts or the relevant tax law
 does  not support any such disallowance.  Consequently,  the Company has not
 accrued any liability in connection with this matter.


 NOTE 8: INDUSTRY AND SUPPLIER CONCENTRATIONS

 The Company  sells  its products  to  banks, credit  unions,  and  financial
 institutions throughout the  United States  and generally  does not  require
 collateral.  All  billings to customers  are due net  30 days  from date  of
 billing.  Reserves (which are insignificant  at June 30, 2004 and 2003)  are
 maintained for potential credit losses.

 In addition, the Company purchases most of its computer hardware and related
 maintenance for resale in relation to  installation of JHA software  systems
 from  one supplier.  There are  a limited number  of hardware suppliers  for
 these required materials.  If these relationships were terminated, it  could
 have a significant negative impact on the future operations of the Company.


 NOTE 9: STOCK OPTION PLANS

 The Company currently issues options under two stock option plans: the  1996
 Stock Option  Plan ("1996  SOP") and  the  Non-Qualified Stock  Option  Plan
 ("NSOP").

 1996 SOP

 The 1996  SOP was  adopted by  the  Company on  October  29, 1996,  for  its
 employees.  Terms and vesting periods  of the options are determined by  the
 Compensation Committee  of  the Board  of  Directors when  granted  and  for
 options outstanding include  vesting periods up  to four years.   Shares  of
 common stock are reserved for issuance under  this plan at the time of  each
 grant, which must be at or above fair market value of the stock at the grant
 date. The options terminate 30 days  after termination of employment,  three
 months after retirement, one year after death  or 10 years after grant.   In
 October 2002, the stockholders approved an  increase in the number of  stock
 options available from 13.0 million to 18.0 million shares.

 On April 11, 2003, the Company granted approximately 3,670,000 stock options
 to approximately  2,100  full  time  employees, or  94%  of  all  full  time
 employees as of that date.  The options were issued at the exercise price of
 $10.84 per share, which represented the fair market value of the stock as of
 that date and vest in two equal portions based on stock price performance or
 on specific dates.   The two  portions vested and  became fully  exercisable
 when the Company's common stock achieved  a closing market price of 125%  or
 more  and  150%  or  more,  respectively,  of  the  exercise  price  for  10
 consecutive  trading  days.  Such  options  fully vested  during  the  first
 quarter of fiscal  year 2004.  As of June  30, 2004,  there  were  2,373,706
 shares available for future grants under the plan from the 18,000,000 shares
 approved by the stockholders.

 NSOP

 The NSOP was adopted  by the Company  on October 31,  1995, for its  outside
 directors. Options are exercisable  beginning six months  after grant at  an
 exercise price equal to 100% of  the fair market value  of the stock at  the
 grant date.  The  options terminate upon surrender  of the option, upon  the
 expiration of one year following notification of a deceased optionee,  or 10
 years after grant.  1,200,000 shares of common stock have been reserved  for
 issuance under this plan with a maximum of 300,000 for each director.  As of
 June 30, 2004, there were 485,833  shares available for future grants  under
 the plan.

 5,972,949 shares for fiscal 2003, and  690,858 shares for fiscal 2002,  were

 income per common share amounts.


 NOTE 11:  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

 Employee Stock Purchase  Plan - The  Company established  an employee  stock
 purchase plan on January 1, 1996.  The plan allows the majority of employees
 the opportunity to directly purchase shares of the Company.  Purchase prices
 for all participants are based on the closing bid price on the last business
 day of the month.

 The Company has  two plans, the  Employee Stock Ownership  Plan (the  "ESOP"
 Plan) and the 401(k) Retirement Savings  Plan (the "Plan").  Both plans  are
 subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1975 ("ERISA")  as
 amended.

 Under the Plan, the Company matches 100% of full time employee contributions
 up to 5% of compensation subject to a maximum  of $5.  Employees must be  18
 years of age and be employed for at least six months.  Under the ESOP  plan,
 employees must be 21 years of  age and employed full  time for at least  six
 months.  Under the  ESOP Plan and the  Plan, the Company  has the option  of
 making a discretionary contribution; however, none has been made for any  of
 the three most recent  fiscal years.  The  total matching contributions  for
 the Plan were $4,487,  $4,139, and $3,862 for  fiscal 2004, 2003, and  2002,
 respectively.


 NOTE 12: BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

 PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS


 Fiscal 2004 Acquisitions

 On February 2, 2004, the Company acquired all of the common stock of  Yellow
 Hammer Software, Inc. ("YHS").  The purchase price for YHS was allocated  to
 the assets and liabilities acquired based  on then estimated fair values  at
 the acquisition  date, resulting  in the  allocation  of ($637)  to  working
 capital, $704  to capitalized  software, $1,200  to customer  relationships,
 $17,737 to goodwill  and $330  to trade names.   The  acquired goodwill  was
 allocated to the bank segment and is non-deductible for federal income tax.

 On February  19 and  April 1,  2004, the  Company acquired  specific  assets
 consisting of a  suite of Automated  Clearing House payment  products.   The
 purchase price was allocated as follows: ($39) to working capital, $4,837 to
 goodwill,  $1,000  to  customer  relationships,  and  $304  to   capitalized
 software.  The acquired  goodwill was allocated to  the bank segment and  is
 non-deductible for federal income tax.

 On May 1,  2004, the Company  acquired all of  the outstanding  stock of  e-
 ClassicSystems, Inc. ("e-Classic").   The purchase  price for e-Classic  was
 allocated to the  assets and liabilities  acquired based  on then  estimated
 fair values at the acquisition date, resulting in the allocation of ($7)  to
 working  capital,  $1,493   to  capitalized  software,   $990  to   customer
 relationships, $11,382 to goodwill, and $987 to deferred income tax  assets.
  The acquired  goodwill  was allocated  to  the  bank segment  and  is  non-
 deductible for federal income tax.

 On June 1, 2004, the Company acquired specific assets consisting of a  suite
 of regulatory  reporting  products.  The purchase  price  was  allocated  as
 follows: ($1,164) to working capital, $4,629 to goodwill, $3,852 to customer

 Fiscal 2003 Acquisitions

 On January  1, 2003,  the Company  acquired all  the outstanding  membership
 interests in National Bancorp  Data Services, LLC  ("NBDS").  NBDS  provides
 item processing  and  imaging  services to  financial  institutions  in  the
 greater Chicago, Illinois  area.  This  acquisition expanded the  geographic
 footprint for item processing centers and  expands the potential market  for
 outsourcing  customers.  The purchase price  for NBDS was  allocated to  the
 assets and liabilities acquired based on  then estimated fair values  at the
 acquisition date  resulting in  allocation of  $300 to  working capital  and
 $1,800 to goodwill.  The acquired goodwill was allocated to the bank segment
 and is non-deductible for federal income tax.

 On November  15,  2002, the  Company  acquired all  the  outstanding  shares

 processing software,  related  hardware,  and  services  to  smaller  credit
 unions, primarily those  with assets less  than  $50,000.  This  acquisition
 expanded the potential  market for the  Company, as  the Company's  existing
 core products were too expensive to sell to credit unions of this size.  The
 purchase price for CUSI was allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired
 based on then estimated fair values at the acquisition date.  This  resulted
 in an allocation of $97 to working capital, $2,408 to goodwill,  capitalized
 software of $1,222 and  customer contracts of $710.   The acquired  goodwill
 was allocated to the credit union segment and is non-deductible for  federal
 income tax.

 On January  1, 2002,  the Company  acquired all  the outstanding  shares  of
 Transcend Systems Group ("TSG")  for $7,300 in  cash and 117,738  restricted
 shares of  the  Company's  common  stock  valued  at  $2,400,  for  a  total
 consideration to the TSG  shareholders of $9,700.   As part of the  purchase
 price, the Company also advanced to TSG $850 for the repayment of bank  debt
 and  certain  TSG obligations  to its  shareholders.  TSG provides  customer
 relationship  management  software   and  related   services  to   financial
 institutions.  The purchase  price for TSG was  allocated to the assets  and
 liabilities acquired based on the estimated  fair values at the  acquisition
 date, resulting  in an  allocation of  $48 to  working capital,   $8,514  to
 goodwill,  $926 to capitalized software,  and  $1,100 to customer contracts.
 The acquired  goodwill  was  allocated  to the  bank  segment  and  is  non-
 deductible for federal income tax.

 On December 1,  2001, the  Company acquired  all the  outstanding shares  of
 System Legacy Solutions ("SLS").   SLS provides  technology to convert  data
 from  legacy systems  into  formats that can be  used by newer technologies.
 The purchase  price for  SLS was  allocated to  the assets  and  liabilities
 acquired based  on  the  estimated fair  values  at  the  acquisition  date,
 resulting in  allocation  of $2,473  to  goodwill and  $450  to  capitalized
 software.  The acquired  goodwill was allocated to  the bank segment and  is
 non-deductible for federal income tax.

 The acquisitions discussed above  were paid for  using cash from  operations
 and restricted  shares of  the Company's  Common  Stock.   The  accompanying
 consolidated financial statements do not  include any revenues and  expenses
 related to these acquisitions prior to their respective closing dates.   Pro
 Forma   results of  these acquisitions  were  not material,  therefore  such
 amounts have not been presented.

 Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures

 As of the end of the period covered by  this Annual Report on Form 10-K,  an
 evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the  participation
 of our management, including our Company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and
 Chief Financial  Officer  (CFO), of  the  effectiveness of  the  design  and
 operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act
 Rules 13a-15  and  15d-15.  Based  upon that  evaluation,  the CEO  and  CFO
 concluded that our  disclosure  controls  and procedures  are  effective  in
 timely alerting  them  to  material  information  relating  to  the  Company
 (including our consolidated  subsidiaries) required  to be  included in  our
 periodic SEC filings.

 During the  period  covered  by  this Annual  Report,  there  have  been  no
 significant changes in internal control over financial reporting or in other
 factors that  could significantly  affect  internal control  over  financial
 reporting, including  any  corrective  actions with  regard  to  significant
 deficiencies and material weaknesses.

 Attached as Exhibits 31.1  and 31.2 to this  Annual Report on Form 10-K  are
 certifications of the  CEO and the  CFO, which are  required  in accord with
 Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act).  This
 Controls and  Procedures section  includes  the information  concerning  the
 controls evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should  be read
 in conjunction with the certifications.
