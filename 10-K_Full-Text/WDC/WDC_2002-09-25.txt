PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Western Digital Corporation (the
“Company” or “Western Digital”) designs,
develops, manufactures and markets hard drives featuring
leading-edge technology. A hard drive is a storage device found
in most computers that stores data on one or more rotating
magnetic disks that provide fast access to data that must be
readily available to users of computers or other devices. The
Company’s hard drives are used in desktop personal
computers, servers, network attached storage devices, video game
consoles, digital video recording devices and satellite set-top
boxes. The Company’s hard drive products currently include
1.0-inch high, 3.5-inch form factor drives with capacities
ranging from 8 gigabytes (“GB”) to 200 GB, rotation
speeds of 5400 and 7200 revolutions per minute (“RPM”)
and the Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (“EIDE”)
interface. The Company sells its products worldwide to computer
manufacturers for inclusion in their computer systems or
subsystems and to distributors, resellers and retailers. The
Company’s hard drive products are currently manufactured in
Malaysia and Thailand. For geographical financial data, see the
Company’s consolidated financial statements and note 9
thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Industry

Desktop Personal Computer (“PC”)
Market.

According to TrendFOCUS, Inc.
(“TrendFOCUS”) quarterly reports for 2002 and calendar
year 2001, the desktop computer segment is the largest segment
of the worldwide personal computer market, accounting for
approximately 75% of global personal computer shipments in 2002.
As a result, according to TrendFOCUS, desktop computers were the
leading source of demand for hard drives, accounting for more
than 71% of all hard drive units shipped worldwide in 2002. Over
89% of Western Digital’s hard drive unit shipments in 2002
were sold to this market. Desktop personal computers for entry
level to experienced users are used in both commercial and
consumer environments. The demand for both hard drive capacity
and unit volume of hard drives continues to grow in part due to:

According to a March 2002 report published by
TrendFOCUS, the worldwide desktop PC hard drive market
(excluding emerging markets) was forecasted to grow from
approximately 142 million units in calendar year 2001 to
approximately 177 million units in calendar year 2005,
reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 6%.
Revenue growth is expected to be lower due to the impact of
severe price competition. TrendFOCUS also forecasted that
revenue from sales of desktop PC hard drives would grow from
approximately $13 billion in calendar year 2001 to
approximately $14 billion in calendar year 2005, reflecting a
compound annual growth rate of approximately 2%.

Desktop PC’s are used in a number of
environments, ranging from homes to businesses and multi-user
networks. Software applications are used on desktop PC’s
primarily for word processing, spreadsheet, desktop publishing,
database management, multimedia, entertainment and other related
applications. Hard drives store these software applications and
the data used by these software applications. Desktop PC’s
typically



utilize the EIDE interface for hard drives.
TrendFOCUS estimates that the average capacity sold per desktop
unit in calendar year 2001 was 29.1 GB, with 91% of all
shipments in excess of 10GB in the desktop segment.

The industry continues to supply increased
capacity per unit as users’ system needs increase and
technological and manufacturing advances continue to make higher
capacity drives more affordable. In the mainstream desktop PC
market, the Company believes that the rate of increase in
storage capacity per unit has outpaced the rate of increase in
user demand for such capacity in recent years. This will result
in the Company changing its product mix, with an increasing
percentage of lower capacity, lower cost hard drives
manufactured with fewer heads and disks per unit. The Company
believes that even though unit demand will increase, this
changing product mix will reduce the average selling price per
hard drive unit in the desktop PC market, unless the rate of
technology improvements decreases. In contrast to currently
established markets, the emerging use of hard drives to record
and play back audio and video content in the audio-video market
is expected to create demand for storage capacity at a rate that
may exceed the growth in demand for increased capacity in the
desktop PC market. Accordingly, the Company believes that
time-to-market, time-to-volume and time-to-quality leadership
with higher capacity drives at attractive price levels will
continue to be critical to its future success in serving this
market.

Since 1997, the PC industry has experienced an
increasing shift toward desktop PC’s priced below $1,000.
TrendFOCUS estimates that approximately 67% of all desktop
PC’s sold in 2002 were priced below $1,000. These systems
typically incorporate lower cost components and, consequently,
the average selling price for hard drives to this segment of the
desktop PC market has also declined.

The Company believes that two additional factors
are impacting the growth of the PC market. First, the Company
believes that the United States and Western European PC markets
are nearing saturation. In addition, the Company believes that
the cycle time in which existing PC owners replace their
PC’s has lengthened from two to three years to
approximately three to four years. For an additional discussion
of changes in the PC market, see Part II, Item 7, under the
heading “Risk factors related to the hard drive industry in
which we operate.”

Emerging Markets.

Future demand growth for desktop
computer hard drives also may be driven by new and emerging hard
drive markets, such as the audio-video, video game console and
tape replacement markets. According to a March 2002 report
published by TrendFOCUS, the non-desktop PC 3.5-inch form factor
hard drive market was forecasted to grow from approximately
4 million units in calendar year 2001 to approximately
93 million units in calendar year 2005, reflecting a
compound annual growth rate of approximately 118%. For an
additional discussion of the non-desktop PC hard drive market,
see Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk factors
related to the hard drive industry in which we operate.”

Audio-Video Markets.

Traditionally, home users have
“time shifted” television content by recording onto
video tape by using a video cassette recorder (“VCR”)
to view the content at a later time. This market is experiencing
the introduction of an alternative to VCRs, where the video tape
is being replaced by a hard drive that remains in the device.
These hard drive-based recorders, commonly called personal video
recorders (“PVRs”), offer the end-user additional
features that are not available using VCRs. Hard drive
technology makes it possible to simultaneously record and play
back content; to pause and skip forward and backward, while
recording during live broadcasts; and to rapidly access large
amounts of audio-video content.

Because the market for audio-video products using
hard drives has not yet developed, it is too early to project
the likely size and growth of such market. For further
discussion of this product development effort, see Part II,
Item 7, under the heading “Risk factors relating to
Western Digital particularly.”

Video Game Market.

According to TrendFOCUS, home electronic game devices that
include hard disk drives and that are played on home
entertainment systems had sales of approximately 2 million
units in calendar year 2001, with an expected compound growth
rate of approximately 82% through calendar year 2005. In
calendar year 2001, Microsoft introduced a new game system
called Xbox

TM

that uses a hard disk drive for game
use. Depending on the overall success of the current
Xbox

TM

architecture in the market and perceived
advantages due to incorporation of hard drive technology,
overall hard drive sales may continue to increase with sales of
Xbox

TM

and other potential manufacturers of game
consoles which integrate hard drives



into future designs. See Part II, Item 7,
under the heading “Risk factors related to the hard drive
industry in which we operate.”

Tape Replacement
Market.

Traditional disaster recovery
and back-up of enterprise data has been done primarily on tape
media used in tape libraries, which are devices that enable
rapid access to large volumes of data. During the past few
years, a new data back-up market opportunity has started to
develop with Integrated Drive Electronics (“IDE”)/
Advanced Technology Attachment (“ATA”) hard drives
augmenting tape media. This new trend, referred to as “disk
to disk back-up,” has become an emerging technology due to
both the ability of hard drives to back up data more quickly
than tape solutions and the overall cost reduction trend on IDE/
ATA class hard drives at a faster rate than tape cost reduction
trends. While an insignificant part of the overall market in
2002, the use of IDE/ ATA drives as back-up and disaster
recovery technology has seen significant attention and product
introductions.

Small Computer System Interface
(“SCSI”) Substitution.

In
certain circumstances, SCSI hard drives are being replaced by
IDE/ ATA hard drives in enterprise storage applications. The
Company believes that in calendar year 2002, approximately 10%
of the enterprise drive market will utilize IDE/ serial ATA hard
drives.

Other Market Opportunities.

The Company continuously evaluates
opportunities to apply its data storage core competencies beyond
traditional markets for hard drives. Currently, new business
opportunities are evaluated for their direct impact on the
Company’s ability to increase the sale of hard drives.
These opportunities include the design of hard drives for use in
consumer devices, such as gaming devices or PVRs, and for use in
higher-end computer applications, such as servers and server
appliances. The Company monitors the development of new markets
related to data or content storage and storage management, the
transfer, use and storage of digital content and the continuing
development of networking protocols, and may from time to time
offer new products or services to address appropriate new form
factors, interfaces or markets. Conversely, depending on the
development of such markets and the Company’s ability to
achieve its goals, the Company may, from time to time, withdraw
from certain markets.

Products

The Company’s WD Caviar® and WD
Protégé

TM

hard drive products are designed
to serve distinct portions of the desktop PC market. WD Caviar
is designed for the advanced performance segment of the desktop
PC market and the entry-level server market, and WD
Protégé is designed for the value segment of the
desktop PC market, the entry-level PC’s and the game
console market. In addition, the Company’s WD
Performer

TM

hard drive products are designed to serve
the emerging audio-video portion of the hard drive market.

Desktop PC and Entry-Level Server Hard Drive
Products.

The WD Caviar and WD
Protégé families currently consist of 1.0-inch high,
3.5-inch form factor products with capacities ranging from 8 GB
to 200 GB and rotation speeds of 5400 and 7200 RPM. These
products utilize the EIDE interface, providing high performance
while retaining ease of use and overall low cost of connection.
The type of EIDE interface currently used in all of the
Company’s hard drives is ATA/100, which signifies a burst
data transfer rate of 100 megabytes per second. The Company also
sells a line of external hard drives and related adapters which
are designed to accommodate external storage interfaces
including 1394/ FireWire/i.Link

TM

and Universal
Serial Bus 2.0. The 1394/ FireWire/i.Link

TM

interface
is a high speed interface that can be used to add additional
storage capacity to a computer.

The Western Digital product line generally
leverages a common platform for various products within product
families with different capacities to serve the differing market
needs. This platform strategy results in commonality of
components across different products within product families,
which reduces exposure to changes in demand, facilitates
inventory management and allows the Company to achieve lower
costs through economies of scale purchasing. This platform
strategy also enables computer manufacturer customers to
leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product
models. The Company expects to continue to utilize this platform
strategy as it develops products for the emerging market for
hard drives specifically designed for audio-video applications,
such as new digital video recording devices.



Non-PC Hard Drive Products.

The Company offers customized design
capabilities and unique hard drive technologies for consumer
applications; however, where practical, the Company intends to
leverage its existing product line architectures for the various
products for the audio-video market. The Company is currently
offering the WD Performer hard drive product line designed for
use in consumer audio-video applications. It also offers
products for the video game console market, such as the
Microsoft® Xbox

TM

. The Company is also
developing hard drives and products incorporating hard drive
technology for other consumer electronics products including
digital cable set-top boxes and audio-video jukeboxes.

Technology and Product Development

Hard drives are used to record, store and
retrieve digital data. Their performance attributes are
currently better than removable or floppy disks, optical disk
drives and tapes, and they are more cost effective than
semiconductor technology. The primary measures of hard drive
performance include:

All of the Company’s hard drive products
employ similar technology. The main components of the hard drive
are the head disk assembly and the printed circuit board. The
head disk assembly includes the head, media (disks), head
positioning mechanism (actuator) and spin motor. These
components are contained in a hard base plate protective package
in a contamination-controlled environment. The printed circuit
board includes both standard and custom integrated circuits, an
interface connector to the host computer and a power connector.

The head disk assembly is comprised of one or
more disks positioned around a spindle hub that rotates the
disks by a spin motor. Disks are made of a smooth substrate to
which a thin coating of magnetic materials is applied. Each disk
has a head suspended directly above it, which can read data from
or write data to the spinning disk. The sensor element of the
head, also known as the slider, is getting progressively
smaller, requiring more accurate manufacturing processes.

The integrated circuits on the printed circuit
board typically include a drive interface and a controller. The
drive interface receives instructions from the computer, while
the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and
controls the heads. The location of data on each disk is
logically maintained in concentric tracks which are divided into
sectors. The computer sends instructions to the controller to
read data from or write data to the disks based on track and
sector locations. Guided by instructions from the controller,
the head stack assembly is pivoted and swung across the disk by
a head actuator or motor until it reaches the selected track of
a disk, where the data is recorded or retrieved.

Industry standard interfaces are utilized to
allow the disk drive to communicate with the computer.
Currently, the primary interface for desktop PC’s is EIDE.
Increasingly, work station computers are using the EIDE
interface as well. As computer performance continues to improve,
the hard drive will need to deliver information faster than this
interface can handle. Accordingly, the Company believes that the
desktop



PC industry plans to transition to higher
speed interfaces such as “serial ATA” to handle
the higher data transfer rates. The Company is working to
develop products that will support these higher speed interfaces.

Storage capacity of the hard drive is determined
by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density, which
is a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the
recording surface of the disk. Areal density is generally
measured in megabits per square inch of disk surface. The higher
the areal density, the more information can be stored on a
single platter. As the areal density increases, fewer disks and/
or heads are required to achieve a given drive capacity, thus
reducing product costs through reduced component requirements.

Head technology is one of the variables affecting
areal density. Due to rapid technological changes, there have
been several generations of head technology in a relatively
short period of time. Currently, the desktop hard drive industry
uses magnetoresistive head technology, which allows
significantly higher storage capacities than the previously
utilized thin-film head technology. All of the Company’s
hard drive product offerings currently employ magnetoresistive
head technology.

Constant innovations in research and development
are essential to the Company’s ability to compete. Hard
drive providers are evaluating or implementing a number of
technological innovations designed to further increase hard
drive performance and reduce product costs, including
simplifying the electronic architecture by combining the
traditional controller, channel, microprocessor and
servo-interface management functions of traditional hard drive
microprocessors on a single integrated circuit. Moreover, to
consistently achieve timely introduction and rapid volume
production of new products, some hard drive providers, including
the Company, are striving to simplify their product design
processes by focusing on creating extendible core technology
platforms which utilize common firmware and mechanical designs
and reuse of manufacturing tooling and application-specific
integrated circuits across various product generations and
product lines.

For an additional discussion of technological
innovations, see Part II, Item 7, under the heading
“Risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which
we operate.”

Sales and Distribution

The Company sells its products globally to
computer manufacturers, distributors, resellers, systems
integrators and retailers. Manufacturers typically purchase
components such as hard drives and assemble them into the
computer systems they build. Distributors typically sell the
Company’s drives to small computer manufacturers, dealers,
system integrators and other resellers.

Manufacturers.

Sales
to manufacturers accounted for 54%, 48% and 55% of the
Company’s revenues in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
During 2002, the Company’s major computer manufacturer
customers included Dell, Fujitsu, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard,
Microsoft, NEC and Trigem. Occasionally, revenues from sales to
certain manufacturers account for more than 10% of the
Company’s revenues in a particular year. For example,
during 2002, sales to Dell and Hewlett-Packard (including sales
to Compaq Computer prior to its merger with Hewlett-Packard in
2002) accounted for 15% and 13% of revenues, respectively.
During 2001, sales to Dell and Compaq Computer accounted for 16%
and 12% of revenues, respectively. During 2000, sales to Compaq
Computer accounted for 21% of revenues. The Company believes
that its success depends on its ability to maintain and improve
its strong relationships with the leading computer
manufacturers. Since 2000, Western Digital, Maxtor (which merged
with Quantum in 2000) and Seagate have had the highest market
share with these manufacturers.

In 2002, the top ten desktop personal computer
manufacturers accounted for approximately 52% of all shipments
in the desktop PC market. As a result, maintaining customer
satisfaction with these leading computer manufacturers is
critical.

Computer manufacturers evaluate and select their
hard drive suppliers based on a number of factors, including
overall quality, storage capacities, performance
characteristics, price, service and support, ease of doing
business, and the supplier’s long-term financial stability.
They typically seek to qualify two or three providers for each
generation of hard drives, and once a computer manufacturer has
chosen its qualified hard



drive vendors for a given product, it generally
will purchase hard drives from those vendors for the life of
that product. To achieve success with computer
manufacturers’ qualifications, a hard drive supplier must
consistently offer hard drives featuring leading technology,
quality and high capacity per disk. Suppliers must quickly
achieve volume production of high quality and reliable hard
drives. To quickly achieve high volume production, a hard drive
supplier must have access to flexible, high-capacity,
high-quality manufacturing capabilities.

Many of the Company’s computer manufacturer
customers (also referred to as original equipment manufacturers
or “OEMs”) have adopted just-in-time inventory
management processes or supply chain business models that
combine “build-to-order” (computer manufacturer does
not build until there is a firm order) and “contract
manufacturing” (computer manufacturer contracts assembly
work to a contract manufacturer who purchases components and
assembles the computer based on the computer manufacturer’s
instructions). For certain key OEMs the Company maintains a base
stock of several weeks, on average, of current, finished goods
inventory in facilities located adjacent to the OEM’s
operations. Inventory at these locations usually includes minor
product customizations (such as labeling) for the related
computer manufacturer. If subsequent to its initial order the
computer manufacturer changes its requirements, inventory held
at these facilities can be sold to other computer manufacturers
or distributors “as is” or with minor modifications
(such as a change in labeling) at little or no additional cost.
Therefore, changes in an OEM’s requirements have minimal
impact on inventory valuation.

For an additional discussion of the need to adapt
to customers’ business models and maintain customer
satisfaction, refer to Part II, Item 7, under the
headings “Risk factors related to the hard drive industry
in which we operate” and “Risk factors related to
Western Digital particularly.”

Distributors.

The
Company uses a select group of distributors to sell its products
to small computer manufacturers, resellers, dealers and systems
integrators. The Company’s major distributor customers
include ASI, COS Distribution AG, eSys Distribution,
Genuine, Ingram Micro and Synnex. Distributors accounted for
approximately 39%, 45% and 38% of disk drive revenues for 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively. Distributors generally enter into
non-exclusive agreements for specific territories with the
Company for purchase and redistribution of product on a quick
turnover basis. Purchase orders are placed and revised on a
weekly basis. The Company grants certain of its distributors
price protection and limited rights to return product on an
inventory rotation basis.

Retailers.

The
Company sells its retail-packaged products directly to a select
group of major retailers such as computer superstores, warehouse
clubs and computer electronics stores, and authorizes sales
through distributors to smaller retailers. Major retailers to
whom the Company sells directly include Best Buy, Circuit City,
CompUSA, Fry’s Electronics and Sam’s Club. Retailers
accounted for approximately 7% of revenues for each of 2002,
2001 and 2000. The Company’s current retail customer base
is primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe. The retail
channel complements the Company’s other sales channels
while helping to build brand awareness for the Company and its
products. Retailers supply the aftermarket “upgrade”
sector in which end-users purchase and install products to
upgrade their computers. The Company grants certain of its
retailers price protection and limited rights to return product
on an inventory rotation basis. The Company also sells its
retail-packaged products through the Internet, at its website.

The Company maintains sales offices throughout
North America, Eastern and Western Europe, the Middle East,
Japan and Asia/ Pacific. Field application engineering is
provided to strategic computer manufacturer accounts, and
localized end-user technical support services are provided
within the United States, Canada and Europe. The Company’s
localized end-user technical support is currently supplied by
employees through telephone support and via the Company’s
website.

The Company’s international sales, which
include sales to foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies but do
not include sales to U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies,
represented 50%, 47% and 50% of revenues for 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively. Sales to international customers may be
subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic
operations, including exposure to tariffs, various trade
regulations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. See
Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk factors
relating to Western Digital particularly.”



For additional information concerning revenue
recognition, sales by geographic region and significant customer
information, see Notes 1 and 9, respectively, of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company’s marketing and advertising
functions are performed both internally and through an outside
firm. Advertising, worldwide packaging and marketing materials
are targeted to various reseller and end-user segments. Western
Digital utilizes both consumer media and, to a lesser extent,
trade publications. The Company has programs under which
qualifying distributors and retailers are reimbursed for certain
marketing expenditures. Western Digital also maintains customer
relationships by communicating with its resellers and providing
end-users with pre-sale and post-sale information and support
through its website.

Competition

In the desktop hard drive market, the Company has
competed primarily with Fujitsu, IBM, Maxtor, Quantum, Samsung
and Seagate. Over the last two years, Maxtor acquired the
hard drive business of Quantum, Fujitsu exited the desktop hard
drive market, and IBM exited the 5400 RPM segment of the
hard drive market, decreasing the number of major competitors.
In addition, IBM announced in April 2002 that it will sell its
hard drive business to a joint venture that is controlled by
Hitachi Data Systems.

The hard drive industry is intensely competitive,
with hard drive suppliers competing for sales to a limited
number of major customers. Hard drives manufactured by different
competitors are highly substitutable due to the industry mandate
of technical form, fit and function standards. Hard drive
manufacturers compete on the basis of product quality and
reliability, storage capacity, unit price, product performance,
production volume capabilities, delivery capability, leadership
in time-to-market, time-to-volume and time-to-quality, service
and support, and ease of doing business. The relative importance
of these factors varies between different customer and market
segments. The Company believes that it is generally competitive
in all of these factors.

Based on quarterly reports published by
TrendFOCUS in 2002 and calendar year 2001, the Company believes
that its market share of the 3.5-inch IDE/ ATA market during
2002 increased approximately 6%, from approximately 15% to
approximately 21%. In addition, the overall percentage of the
desktop market held by Maxtor, Seagate and Western Digital, the
top three desktop suppliers during 2002, increased from
approximately 74% to approximately 86%.

The Company believes that there are no
substantial barriers to entry for competitors to offer competing
products. Therefore, the Company believes that it cannot
differentiate its hard drive products solely on attributes such
as storage capacity, buffer size or time-to-market. Accordingly,
the Company also differentiates itself by designing and
incorporating into its hard drives desirable product performance
attributes, focusing on seek time, data transfer rates,
intelligent caching, failure prediction, remote diagnostics,
acoustics and data recovery. In addition, the Company emphasizes
non-product related attributes, including rapid response with
its computer manufacturer and distribution customers. Rapid
response requires accelerated design cycles, customer delivery,
production flexibility and timely service and support, which
contribute to customer satisfaction. The Company also relies on
the strength of the Western Digital brand name with value-added
resellers and solution providers to whom the Company sells its
hard drive products directly and indirectly. The Company
believes that trust in a manufacturer’s reputation and the
establishment of strategic relationships have become important
factors in the selection of a hard drive, particularly within
such a rapidly changing technology environment.

The desktop hard drive market is characterized by
several large competitors and short product life cycles;
therefore, it has traditionally been subject to periods of
sustained and severe price competition, and factors such as
time-to-market, time-to-volume and time-to-quality can have a
pronounced effect on the success of any particular product.

Advances in magnetic, optical or other data
storage technologies could result in competitive products that
have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than
the Company’s hard drive products. High-speed semiconductor
memory could compete with the Company’s hard drive products
in the future. Semiconductor memory is much faster than magnetic
disk drives, but currently is not competitive from a cost



standpoint. Flash memory, a nonvolatile
semiconductor memory, is currently much more costly and, while
it has higher “read” performance than hard drives, it
has lower “write” performance. Flash memory could
become competitive in the near future for applications requiring
less storage capacity than that provided by hard drives.

For an additional discussion of competition, see
Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk factors
related to the hard drive industry in which we operate.”

Service and Warranty

Western Digital generally warrants its newly
manufactured hard drives against defects in materials and
workmanship for a period of one to three years from the date of
sale. The Company’s warranty obligation is generally
limited to repair or replacement of the hard drive. The Company
has engaged third parties in China and Singapore to process and
test returned hard drives for the Company’s customers. In
addition, the Company has contracted with a third party in
Canada to process returned hard drives, and until recently had
engaged a third party to perform a similar service in the United
States. However, in July 2002, Western Digital assumed the
processing and testing of hard drives in the United States and
terminated the outsourcing of this function to the third party.
In 2003, the Company has engaged third parties in Korea and
Brazil to process and test returned hard drives. The Company has
contracts with third parties to refurbish or repair its products
at service facilities located in Singapore and Germany.

Manufacturing

To be competitive, Western Digital must
manufacture high quality hard drives with industry leading
time-to-volume production at competitive unit costs. The Company
strives to maintain manufacturing flexibility and high
manufacturing yields, while insisting that its suppliers provide
high-quality components at competitive prices. The critical
elements of Western Digital’s hard drive production are
high volume, low cost assembly and testing, and establishment
and maintenance of key vendor relationships. By establishing
partner relationships with its strategic component suppliers,
the Company believes it is able to access
“best-of-class” manufacturing quality without the
substantial capital investment associated with actual vertical
integration. In addition, the Company believes that its sourcing
strategy currently enables it to have the business flexibility
needed to select the highest quality low cost suppliers as
product designs and technologies evolve.

Hard drive manufacturing is a complex process
involving the assembly of precision components with narrow
tolerances and extensive testing to ensure reliability. The
assembly process occurs in a “clean room” environment
which demands skill in process engineering and efficient
utilization of the “clean room” layout in order to
reduce the high operating costs of this manufacturing
environment. The Company’s clean room manufacturing process
consists of modular production units, each of which contains a
number of work cells.

The Company produces hard drives in two plants,
one in Malaysia and one in Thailand. The Company continually
evaluates its manufacturing processes in an effort to increase
productivity, sustain and improve quality and decrease
manufacturing costs. For example, in order to improve efficiency
and reduce costs, the Company closed two manufacturing
facilities in Singapore during 1999 and 2000 and relocated its
hard drive production to Malaysia. During 2002, in response to
an increase in demand and in order to capitalize on the local
supplier base, the Company completed the acquisition of a
Thailand manufacturing facility. The Company continually
evaluates which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit
from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can
improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs. Currently,
the Company purchases all of the standard mechanical components
and micro controllers for its hard drives from external
suppliers.

For an additional discussion of manufacturing,
see Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk
factors relating to Western Digital particularly.”



Research and Development

The Company devotes substantial resources to
development of new products and improvement of existing
products. The Company focuses its engineering efforts on
coordinating its product design and manufacturing processes in
order to bring its products to market in a cost-effective and
timely manner. Research and development expenses for continuing
operations totaled $120.1, $113.4 and $150.7 million in
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

For a discussion of product development, see
Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk factors
related to the hard drive industry in which we operate.”

Materials and Supplies

The principal components currently used in the
manufacture of the Company’s hard drives are magnetic heads
and related head stack assemblies, media, controllers, spindle
motors and mechanical parts used in the head disk assembly. In
addition to custom semiconductor devices, the Company also uses
standard semiconductor components such as logic, memory and
microprocessor devices obtained from other manufacturers and a
wide variety of other parts, including connectors, cables, and
other interconnect technology.

Unlike some of its competitors, the Company
acquires all of the components for its products from third party
suppliers. In general, the Company tries to have multiple
suppliers for each of its component requirements. For example,
the Company currently buys giant magnetoresistive heads from
ALPS Electric Co., Ltd., Read-Rite Corporation and SAE
Magnetics Ltd. Media requirements are purchased from several
outside vendors including Fuji Electric Company Ltd.,
Komag, Showa Denko KK and Trace Storage Technology
Corporation; however, the Company has a volume purchase
agreement with Komag. Under this agreement, which expires in
April 2005, the Company is obligated to purchase a substantial
percentage of its requirements for hard disk media from Komag as
long as Komag’s prices, technology and quality remain
competitive. In August 2001, Komag announced its voluntary
filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, and in July 2002
announced that it had completed its bankruptcy reorganization.
Komag continued its operations during the Chapter 11
process. Komag Malaysia, a separate subsidiary which did not
file Chapter 11, is the manufacturing entity which supplies
Komag’s share of the Company’s media requirements.

Some custom integrated circuits are currently
sole-sourced from STMicroelectronics and IBM. The Company has a
volume purchase agreement with IBM to purchase the major portion
of its read channel chips at negotiated quantities and prices.
Because of their custom nature, these products require
significant design-in periods and long lead times. There has
been a trend in integrated circuit design toward increased
integration of various separate circuits. The Company expects
this trend to continue in the area of custom integrated circuits
for hard drives.

For an additional discussion of component
supplies, see Part II, Item 7, under the heading
“Risk factors relating to Western Digital
particularly.”

Backlog

Historically, a substantial portion of the
Company’s orders has been for shipments within 30 to
60 days of the placement of the order. The Company
generally negotiates pricing, order lead times, product support
requirements and other terms and conditions prior to receiving a
computer manufacturer’s first purchase order for a product.
Customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with
relatively short notice to the Company, with little or no cost
to the customer, or modified by customers to provide for
delivery at a later date. In addition, certain of the
Company’s sales to computer manufacturers are made under
just-in-time delivery contracts that do not generally require
firm order commitments by the customer until the time of sale.
Instead, the Company receives a periodic forecast of
requirements from the customer, and the customer is invoiced
upon shipment of the product from the just-in-time warehouse.
Therefore, backlog information as of the end of a particular
period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of the
Company’s revenue and profit and may not be comparable to
earlier periods.



Patents, Licenses and Proprietary
Information

The Company owns numerous patents and has many
patent applications in process. The Company believes that,
although its patents and patent applications have considerable
value, the successful manufacturing and marketing of its
products depends primarily upon the technical competence and
successful training of its personnel. Accordingly, the patents
held and applied for do not assure the Company’s future
success.

In addition to patent protection of certain
intellectual property rights, the Company considers elements of
its product designs and processes to be proprietary and
confidential. The Company believes that its nonpatented
intellectual property, particularly some of its process
technology, is an important factor in its success. Western
Digital relies upon non-disclosure agreements and contractual
provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect its
proprietary information. Despite these safeguards, there is a
risk that competitors may obtain and use such information. The
laws of foreign jurisdictions in which the Company conducts
business also may provide less protection for confidential
information than the United States.

The Company relies on certain technology that is
licensed from other parties in order to manufacture and sell its
products. The Company believes that it has adequate
cross-licenses and other agreements in place in addition to its
own intellectual property portfolio to compete successfully in
the hard drive industry.

For additional discussion of intellectual
property, see Part II, Item 7, under the heading
“Risk factors relating to Western Digital
particularly.”

Environmental Regulation

The Company is subject to a variety of
regulations in connection with its operations. It believes that
it has obtained or is in the process of obtaining all necessary
environmental permits for its operations.

Employees

As of June 28, 2002, the Company employed a
total of 9,550 employees worldwide. This represents an increase
in headcount of approximately 21% since June 29, 2001 and
an increase of approximately 30% since June 30, 2000. The
increase is primarily the result of the purchase of a
manufacturing facility in Thailand during 2002 in response to an
increase in unit sales. The Company employed
1,058 employees in the United States, 6,676 employees
in Malaysia, 1,716 employees in Thailand, 19 employees
in Singapore and 81 employees at its international sales
offices as of June 28, 2002.

Many of the Company’s employees are highly
skilled, and the Company’s continued success depends in
part upon its ability to attract and retain such employees.
Accordingly, the Company offers employee benefit programs which
it believes are at least equivalent to those offered by its
competitors. Despite these programs, the Company has, along with
most of its competitors, experienced difficulty at times in
hiring and retaining certain skilled personnel. When the Company
is unable to hire personnel in the ordinary course of business,
it uses third parties to help satisfy its personnel needs. In
addition, the Company has utilized consultants and contract
personnel to fill these needs until full-time employees could be
recruited. The Company has never experienced a work stoppage,
none of its domestic employees are represented by a labor
organization, and the Company considers its employee relations
to be good.

Item 2.

Properties

During December 2000, the Company relocated its
corporate headquarters from Irvine, California to Lake Forest,
California, signing a 10-year lease agreement for the Lake
Forest facility. The lease for the Irvine facility expired in
January 2001. The Company’s corporate headquarters houses
management, research and development, administrative and sales
personnel. The Company leases one facility in San Jose,
California for research and development activities. In addition,
the Company currently leases one facility in Irvine, California,
which was used in 2002 for research and development activities,
but which is currently used as a processing center and for light
manufacturing. The San Jose lease expires in July 2006 and the
Irvine lease expires in September 2010. Western Digital owns a
manufacturing facility in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and



acquired a smaller manufacturing facility in
Pathumthani, Thailand in January 2002. The Company also leases
office space in various other locations throughout the world
primarily for sales and technical support.

The Company believes its present facilities are
adequate for its current needs, although the process of
upgrading its facilities to meet technological and market
requirements is expected to continue. New manufacturing
facilities generally can be developed and become operational
within approximately nine to eighteen months should the Company
require such additional facilities.

During 2000, the Company sold approximately 34
acres of land in Irvine, California, upon which it had
previously planned to build a new corporate headquarters, for
$26 million (the approximate cost of the land). During
2000, the Company also sold its enterprise drive manufacturing
facility in Tuas, Singapore for $11.0 million (for a gain
of $3.1 million) and its Rochester, Minnesota enterprise
research and development facility for $29.7 million (for a
loss of $1.9 million).

Results of Operations

Summary of 2002,
2001 and 2000 Comparison

The following table sets forth, for the periods
indicated, items in the Company’s statements of operations
expressed as a percentage of total revenue. This table and the
following discussion exclude the results of the discontinued
businesses.

Net
Revenues

Consolidated net revenues were $2.2, $2.0 and
$2.0 billion in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The
increase in net revenues in 2002 from 2001 of $0.2 billion,
or 10.1%, was primarily due to an increase in unit shipments of
31%, partially offset by a 16% decrease in average selling
prices (“ASP’s”). The significant change in units
and ASP’s in 2002 from 2001 is primarily due to expansion
of the Company’s hard drive product line into lower-end
desktop PC and consumer electronics markets. Consolidated
net revenues in 2001 were flat with 2000, at approximately
$2.0 billion. Excluding $141.8 million of revenue in
2000 related to the Company’s discontinued small computer
system interface (“SCSI”) product line, revenue
increased $138.0 million or 7.6% in 2001. This improvement
was due to an increase in EIDE drive unit shipments of
approximately 19%, partially offset by a 10% decline
in ASP’s.

Gross
Profit

Gross profit was $281.6 million, or 13.1% of
revenue in 2002, $207.7 million, or 10.6% of revenue in 2001,
and $9.6 million, or 0.5% of revenue, in 2000. Gross profit
for 2000 included $72.5 million of special charges, of
which $34.8 million related to costs associated with
exiting the SCSI hard drive product line, and
$37.7 million related to costs to repair recalled drives.
Excluding special charges, gross profit was $82.1 million,
or 4.2% of revenue, for 2000. The increase in gross profit in
2002 from 2001 was primarily the result of more cost-effective
designs and higher unit volume, partially offset by lower
ASP’s. The increase in gross profit in 2001 from 2000
(excluding the 2000 special charges) was primarily the result of
higher volume and lower manufacturing costs due to 2000 expense
reduction efforts, partially offset by lower ASP’s.

Operating
Expenses

Research and development (“R&D”)
expense was $120.1, $113.4 and $150.7 million for 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in R&D expense in
2002 from 2001 of $6.7 million was due to increases in new
development programs and higher employee incentive payments,
partially offset by expense reduction



efforts. The decrease in 2001 from 2000 of
$37.3 million was primarily due to the Company’s exit
from the SCSI hard drive market during 2000 and expense
reduction efforts in its remaining hard drive operations.

Selling, general and administrative
(“SG&A”) expense was $110.8, $115.8 and
$127.0 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The
decrease in SG&A expense in 2002 from 2001 of
$5.0 million was primarily due to expense reduction
efforts, partially offset by higher employee incentive payments.
The decrease in 2001 from 2000 of $11.2 million was
primarily due to the Company’s exit from the SCSI hard
drive market in 2000 and expense reduction efforts in its
remaining hard drive operations.

Restructuring
Charges

During 2000, the Company initiated restructuring
actions to improve operational efficiency and reduce operating
expenses. These actions primarily consisted of a consolidation
of the Company’s Asian operations and termination of its
SCSI hard drive product line. Restructuring charges recorded in
connection with these actions totaled $85.8 million and
consisted of severance and outplacement costs, the retirement of
manufacturing equipment and information systems assets, and net
lease cancellation costs. Also recorded in connection with these
actions were special charges to cost of revenues of
$34.8 million for vendor settlements, incremental warranty,
and inventory write-downs associated with exiting the SCSI hard
drive product line.

Interest and
Other Income (Expense)

Net interest and other income (expense) was
$1.4, ($53.1) and $4.9 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. This includes net investment gains of
$4.8 million in 2002, investment write-offs and related
lease contingency accruals of $52.4 million in 2001, and
net investment gains of $14.8 million in 2000. Excluding
these nonrecurring items, net interest and other expense was
$3.4, $0.7 and $9.9 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The increase in net expense in 2002 (excluding
nonrecurring items) was primarily due to a decrease in interest
income as a result of lower interest rates. The decrease in net
expense in 2001 (excluding nonrecurring items) was primarily due
to lower interest expense on lower average debt balances
resulting from the payment in 2000 of an outstanding term loan
of $50.0 million and redemptions during 2000 and 2001 of
the Company’s 5.25% zero coupon convertible debentures.

Included in 2002’s net investment gains is a
$9.0 million recovery from the sale of the Company’s
remaining Komag investments to a third party. These investments
were part of the $52.4 million nonoperating charge recorded
to net interest and other expense during 2001 to adjust the
carrying value of equity investments in and notes receivable
from Komag and accruals of Komag contingent guarantees,
resulting from Komag’s announcement to file for
Chapter 11 reorganization.

Income Tax
Benefit

The Company’s 2002 net income tax benefit of
$1.1 million included a federal income tax refund of
$3.1 million for a loss carryback available as a result of
tax legislation enacted during the year. During 2001, the
Company did not record an income tax benefit, as no loss
carrybacks were available at that time. During 2000, the Company
recorded an income tax benefit of $19.5 million to adjust
its current and deferred tax accruals. The accruals were
established in prior years primarily for the unremitted income
of foreign subsidiaries. However, due to the significant
increase of net operating loss carryforwards and reevaluation of
the accruals after the substantial international restructurings
in 2000, the Company believed the accruals were no longer
necessary. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Discontinued
Operations

During 2002, the Company discontinued the
operations of new business ventures, including Connex, Inc.
(“Connex”), SANavigator, Inc.
(“SANavigator”) and Keen Personal Media, Inc.
(“Keen”). The Company sold substantially all of the
assets of its Connex and SANavigator businesses for a net gain
of $24.5 million and terminated the Keen operations. These
operating losses for the periods reported and the net gain
recognized on the sale of Connex and SANavigator have been
segregated from continuing operations and reported separately on
the statements of operations as discontinued operations.



Extraordinary
Item

During 2002, the Company issued 2.6 million
shares of common stock and paid $17.6 million in cash in
exchange for $72.4 million in face value of its convertible
debentures (with a book value of $31.6 million). During
2001, the Company issued 16.0 million shares of common
stock in exchange for $295.7 million in face value of its
convertible debentures (with a book value of
$120.3 million). During 2000, the Company issued
26.7 million shares of common stock in exchange for
$735.6 million in face value of its convertible debentures
(with a book value of $284.1 million). These redemptions
were private, individually negotiated transactions with certain
institutional investors. As a result of the redemptions, the
Company recognized an extraordinary loss of $0.1 million in
2002 and extraordinary gains of $22.4 and $166.9 million in
2001 and 2000, respectively (see also “New Accounting
Pronouncements”).

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company had cash and cash equivalents of
$223.7 million at June 28, 2002 and
$167.6 million at June 29, 2001. Net cash provided by
continuing operations was $82.8 million during 2002 as
compared to net cash used for continuing operations of
$58.8 million during 2001. This $141.6 million
improvement in cash provided by continuing operations consists
of a $79.7 million improvement in the Company’s net
income, net of non-cash items, and a $61.9 million decrease
in cash used to fund working capital requirements. These
improvements are due to significantly better operating
performance by the Company, including higher sales volume,
improved cost management, and a lower cash conversion cycle.

The Company’s cash conversion cycle, which
represents the sum of the number of days sales outstanding
(“DSO”) and days inventory outstanding
(“DIO”) less days payable outstanding
(“DPO”), was negative 9 days for 2002, a
2 day improvement over the prior year. Accounts receivable
at June 28, 2002 was higher than the prior year as a result
of higher fourth quarter revenue combined with longer average
collection days due to the elimination of certain early payment
discount programs. However, this increase in average collection
days was offset by improved inventory turns and longer payment
days with suppliers. The allowance for doubtful accounts
decreased to $7.6 million at June 28, 2002 from
$13.3 million at June 29, 2001 as a result of the
write-off of fully reserved accounts receivable balances which
management determined to be uncollectable.

Other uses of cash during 2002 included net
capital expenditures of $47.7 million, primarily for normal
replacement of existing assets and the purchase of assets for
the Company’s new manufacturing facility in Thailand, and
$17.6 million for debenture redemptions. Other sources of
cash during 2002 included $9.9 million received from the
sale of assets, $10.2 million received in connection with
stock option and warrant exercises and Employee Stock Purchase
Plan purchases, and $0.5 million received by the
Company’s subsidiary from minority investors.

Other uses of cash during 2001 included net
capital expenditures of $50.7 million, primarily to upgrade
the Company’s hard drive production capabilities and for
normal replacement of existing assets. Other sources of cash
during 2001 included proceeds of $15.0 million received upon the
sale of marketable equity securities, $110.5 million
received upon issuance of 23.5 million shares of the
Company stock under the Company’s equity facility and
$7.1 million received in connection with the stock option
exercises and Employee Stock Purchase Plan purchases.

The Company anticipates that capital expenditures
in 2003 will not be more than $65.0 million and will relate
to normal replacement of existing assets and expansion of the
Company’s new Thailand facility.

Discontinued operations provided net cash
proceeds of $18.2 million in 2002, including approximately
$36.7 million net proceeds from asset sales. This compares
to $39.5 million in net cash used to fund the operating,
investing and financing activities of the discontinued
operations for 2001.

The Company has zero coupon convertible
subordinated debentures due February 18, 2018 (the
“Debentures”). The Debentures are subordinated to all
senior debt; are redeemable at the option of the Company any
time after February 18, 2003 at the issue price plus
accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption; and
at the holder’s option, will be redeemed by the Company, as
of February 18, 2003,



February 18, 2008 or February 18, 2013,
or if there is a Fundamental Change (as defined in the Debenture
documents), at the issue price plus accrued original issue
discount to the date of redemption. The payment on those dates,
with the exception of a Fundamental Change, can be in cash,
stock or any combination, at the Company’s option. The
Debentures are convertible into shares of the Company’s
common stock at the rate of 14.935 shares per $1,000
principal amount at maturity. Since issuance of the Debentures
in 1998, the Company has redeemed Debentures with a book value
of $435.9 million and an aggregate principal amount at
maturity of $1.1 billion through the issuance of cash and/
or common stock. These redemptions were private, individually
negotiated transactions with certain institutional investors. As
of June 28, 2002, the remaining book value of the
Debentures was $86.2 million, the aggregate principal
amount at maturity was $193.5 million and the market value
was $83.0 million. Based on current forecasts that show the
Company continuing to generate positive cash flow from
operations, the Company now intends to satisfy the majority, if
not all, of its put obligations in cash instead of common stock.
Accordingly, the Debentures have been classified as a current
liability at June 28, 2002. Debentures not put to the
Company in February 2003, if any, will be reclassified as
long-term debt.

During 2001, the Company entered into a
three-year Senior Credit Facility, replacing a previous facility
that had matured on March 31, 2000. The Senior Credit
Facility provides up to $125 million in revolving credit
(subject to outstanding letters of credit and a borrowing base
calculation), matures on September 20, 2003 and is secured
by accounts receivable, inventory, 65% of the stock in its
foreign subsidiaries and other assets. At the option of the
Company, borrowings bear interest at either LIBOR (with option
periods of one to three months) or a base rate, plus a margin
determined by the borrowing base. The Senior Credit Facility
requires the Company to maintain certain amounts of tangible net
worth, prohibits the payment of cash dividends on common stock
and contains a number of other covenants. As of the date hereof,
there were no borrowings under the facility. However, the
Company has issued a $25 million standby letter of credit
under the facility to Cirrus Logic, Inc.
(“Cirrus”) concerning $25 million in disputed
accounts payable. These disputed accounts payable have been
recorded in the Company’s financial statements, but are
part of the Company’s litigation against Cirrus (see Note 5
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The availability
under the Senior Credit Facility has been reduced by a
corresponding amount of the outstanding letter of credit.

During 2001 and 2000, respectively, the Company
issued 23.5 and 24.6 million shares of common stock under
preexisting shelf registrations for net cash proceeds of $110.5
and $111.8 million. During 2002, no common stock was issued
under these shelf registrations and the Company withdrew them as
management determined they would not be utilized in the
foreseeable future.

At June 28, 2002, the Company had cash and
cash equivalents of $223.7 million, working capital of
$34.8 million (net of the Debentures) and
shareholders’ equity of $102.9 million. In addition,
the Company has a Senior Credit Facility providing up to
$125 million in revolving credit (subject to outstanding
letters of credit and a borrowing base calculation). The Company
believes its current cash and cash equivalents and its existing
credit facility will be sufficient to meet its working capital
needs through the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance
that the Senior Credit Facility will continue to be available to
the Company. Also, the Company’s ability to sustain its
working capital position is dependent upon a number of factors
that are discussed below under the headings “Risk factors
related to the hard drive industry in which we operate” and
“Risk factors relating to Western Digital
particularly.”

Commitments

The following is a summary of the Company’s
significant contractual cash obligations and commercial
commitments at June 28, 2002:

Convertible
Debentures

The Company has zero coupon convertible
subordinated debentures due February 18, 2018 (the
“Debentures”). For a description of the Debentures,
see the discussion under “Liquidity and Capital
Resources”.



Operating
Leases

The Company leases certain facilities and
equipment under long-term, non-cancelable operating leases which
expire at various dates through 2010. The following table
summarizes the future payments of these leases (in thousands):

Purchase
Orders

In the normal course of business, to reduce the
risk of component shortages, the Company enters into purchase
commitments with suppliers for the purchase of hard drive
components used to manufacture the Company’s products.
These commitments generally cover forecasted component supplies
needed for production during the next quarter, become payable
upon receipt of the components and may be non-cancelable
(cancellation charges may be significant). The Company’s
relationship with suppliers allows for some flexibility within
these commitments and quantities are subject to change as a
quarter progresses and the Company’s needs change.

Forward Exchange
Contracts

Although the majority of the Company’s
transactions are in U.S. Dollars, some transactions are
based in various foreign currencies. The Company purchases
short-term, forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets,
liabilities and commitments for operating expenses denominated
in foreign currencies. The Company does not purchase short-term
forward exchange contracts for trading purposes. As of
June 28, 2002, the Company had $5.0 million
outstanding of purchased foreign currency forward exchange
contracts. The contracts have maturity dates that do not exceed
three months. At June 28, 2002, the carrying value of the
contracts approximates fair value.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preceding discussion and analysis of the
Company’s results of operations is based on its
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the financial
statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the
reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities.
The Company has adopted accounting policies and practices that
are generally accepted in the industry in which it operates.
Following are the Company’s most critical accounting
policies that affect significant areas and involve
management’s judgment and estimates. If these estimates
differ materially from actual results, the impact to the
consolidated financial statements may be material.

Revenue and
Accounts Receivable

In accordance with standard industry practice,
the Company has agreements with resellers that provide price
protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of
published list price reductions. In addition the Company may
have agreements with resellers that provide for stock rotation
on slow-moving items and other incentive programs. In accordance
with current accounting standards, the Company recognizes
revenue upon shipment or delivery to resellers and records a
corresponding adjustment for estimated price protection and
other programs in effect until the resellers sell such inventory
to their customers. Adjustments are based on



anticipated price decreases, estimated amounts to
be reimbursed to qualifying customers, estimated future returns,
as well as historical pricing information.

The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful
accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing
the risk of uncollectibility based on insolvency, disputes or
other collection issues. In addition, the Company routinely
analyzes the different receivable aging categories and
establishes reserves based on the length of time receivables are
past due.

The Company records provisions against revenue
and cost of revenues for estimated sales returns in the same
period that the related revenues are recognized. The Company
bases these provisions on existing product return notifications
as well as historical returns by product type (see
“Warranty”).

Warranty

The Company records an accrual for estimated
warranty costs when revenue is recognized. Warranty covers cost
of repair or replacement of the hard drive, and the warranty
periods range from one to three years. The Company has
comprehensive processes with which to estimate accruals for
warranty, which include specific detail on hard drives in the
field by product type, historical field return rates and costs
to repair.

Inventory

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Inventory
write-downs are recorded for the valuation of inventory at the
lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market
conditions, estimates of future sales prices, inventory costs
and inventory balances.

The Company evaluates inventory balances for
excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by
analyzing backlog, estimated demand, inventory on hand, sales
levels and other information. The Company writes down inventory
balances for excess and obsolete inventory based on the analysis.

Litigation and
Other Contingencies

The Company applies Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for
Contingencies” to determine when and how much to accrue for
and disclose related to legal and other contingencies.
Accordingly, the Company accrues loss contingencies when
management, in consultation with its legal advisors, concludes
that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.

Deferred Tax
Assets

The Company’s deferred tax assets, which
consist primarily of net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards, are fully reserved due to management’s
determination that it is “more likely than not” that
these assets will not be realized. This determination is based
on the weight of available evidence, the most significant of
which is the Company’s loss history in the related tax
jurisdictions. Should this determination change in the future,
some amount of deferred tax assets could be recognized,
resulting in a tax benefit or a reduction of future tax expense.

New Accounting Pronouncements

During April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, “Rescission of
FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections”
(“SFAS 145”). SFAS 145 rescinds SFAS 4,
“Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of
Debt”, which required all gains and losses from
extinguishment of debt to be classified as an extraordinary
item. The Company will adopt SFAS 145 on June 29, 2002
at which time it will begin classifying gains and losses
resulting from the extinguishment of debt as other income and
expense, instead of extraordinary items. The adoption will not
have a net impact on the Company’s results of operations or
liquidity.

On September 11, 2002, the Emerging Issues
Task Force (“EITF”) reached a consensus on Issue
No. 02-15, “Determining Whether Certain Conversions of
Convertible Debt to Equity Securities are within



the Scope of FASB Statement No. 84, Induced
Conversions of Convertible Debt” (“FAS 84”).
The EITF deliberated this issue because of diversity in practice
in the accounting for conversions of convertible debt to equity
initiated by the debt holder. In practice, some registrants
accounted for these transactions following FAS 84 while
others followed Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 26,
“Early Extinguishment of Debt”
(“APB 26”). The EITF concluded that FAS 84
applies to conversions of convertible debt when the offer for
consideration in excess of the original conversion terms was
made by the bondholder. The EITF concluded that this guidance
should be followed for transactions entered into on or after
September 12, 2002. The Company’s previous
extinguishments of its convertible debentures involving the
issuance of stock have been accounted for under APB 26
whereby a gain on early extinguishment was recorded equal to the
excess of the net book value of the indebtedness over the fair
value of the consideration paid to extinguish the indebtedness.
Following the guidance in EITF Issue No. 02-15, similar
early extinguishments of the convertible debentures involving
stock initiated by the debt holder will give rise to a
conversion inducement expense equal to the fair value of the
shares issued in excess of those required to be issued upon the
exercise of the debenture conversion feature. The Company does
not expect EITF Issue No. 02-15 to have a significant
impact on the future results of operations because the Company
does not expect to use stock to make early extinguishments of
its convertible debentures.

Risk factors related to the hard drive
industry in which we operate

Our operating results depend on our being
    among the first-to-market and first-to-volume with our new
    products at a low cost.

To achieve consistent success with computer
manufacturer customers, we must be an early provider of next
generation hard drives featuring leading technology and high
quality. If we fail to:

our operating results would be adversely affected.

Product life cycles require continuous
    technical innovation associated with higher areal
    densities.

New products require higher areal densities (the
gigabyte of storage per disk) than previous product generations,
posing formidable technical challenges. Higher areal densities
require fewer heads and disks to achieve a given drive capacity,
which means that existing head technology must be improved to
accommodate more data on a single disk. Our failure to bring
these new products to market on time and at acceptable costs
would put us at a competitive disadvantage to companies that
achieve these results.

Short product life cycles make it difficult to
    recover the cost of development.

Over the past few years, hard drive areal density
has increased at a much more rapid pace than previously
experienced. This has significantly shortened product life
cycles since each generation of drives is more cost effective
than the previous one. Shorter product life cycles make it more
difficult to recover the cost of product development.

Short product life cycles and new products
    force us to continually qualify new products with our
    customers.

Due to short product life cycles and continuously
changing products, we must regularly engage in new product
qualification with our customers. To be considered for
qualification we must be among the leaders in time-to-market
with our new products. Once a product is accepted for
qualification testing, any failure or



delay in the qualification process can result in
our losing sales to that customer until the next generation of
products is introduced. The effect of missing a product
qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of
high volume computer manufacturers, most of which continue to
consolidate their share of the PC market. These risks are
increased because we expect cost improvements and competitive
pressures to result in declining sales and gross margins on our
current generation products.

Unexpected technology advances in the hard
    drive industry could harm our competitive position.

If one of our competitors were able to implement
a significant advance in head or disk drive technology that
enables a “step-change” increase in areal density that
permits greater storage of data on a disk, it could harm our
operating results.

Advances in magnetic, optical, semiconductor or
other data storage technologies could result in competitive
products that have better performance or lower cost per unit of
capacity than our products. If these products prove to be
superior in performance or cost per unit of capacity, we could
be at a competitive disadvantage to the companies offering those
products.

Our average selling prices are
    declining.

We expect that our average selling prices for
hard drives will continue to decline. Increases in areal density
mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks,
and therefore lower component cost. Because of the
competitiveness of the hard drive industry, lower costs
generally mean lower prices. This is true even for those
products that are competitive and introduced into the market in
a timely manner. Our average selling prices decline even further
when competitors lower prices to absorb excess capacity,
liquidate excess inventories, restructure or attempt to gain
market share.

The hard drive industry is highly competitive
    and characterized by rapid shifts in market share among the
    major competitors.

The price of hard drives has fallen over time due
to increases in supply, cost reductions, technological advances
and price reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess
inventories or attempting to gain market share. In addition,
rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and
profitability of sales of existing products and increase the
risk of inventory obsolescence. These factors, taken together,
result in significant and rapid shifts in market share among the
industry’s major participants. For example, during the
first quarter of 2000, the Company lost market share as a result
of a product recall. Similar losses in market share could
adversely affect our operating results.

Our prices and margins are subject to declines
    due to unpredictable end-user demand and oversupply of hard
    drives.

Demand for our hard drives depends on the demand
for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage
upgrades to existing systems. The demand for systems has been
volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on
the demand for hard drives in any given period. As a result, the
hard drive market tends to experience periods of excess
capacity, which typically lead to intense price competition.
During calendar year 2001 and the first half of calendar year
2002, the industry experienced weak PC demand in the U.S. and
other markets. If intense price competition occurs as a result
of weak demand, we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more
than expected, which could result in lower revenues and gross
profits.

Changes in the markets for hard drives require
    us to develop new products.

Over the past few years the consumer market for
desktop computers has shifted significantly towards lower priced
systems, especially those systems priced below $1,000. Although
we were late to market with a value line hard drive to serve the
low-cost PC market, we are now offering such value line products
at prices that we view as competitive. However, if we are not
able to continue to offer a competitively priced value line hard
drive for the low-cost PC market, our share of that market will
likely fall, which could harm our operating results.



The PC market is fragmenting into a variety of
computing devices and products. Some of these products, such as
Internet appliances, may not contain a hard drive. On the other
hand, many industry analysts expect, as do we, that as
broadcasting and communications are increasingly converted to
digital technology from the older, analog technology, the
technology of computers and consumer electronics and
communication devices will converge, and hard drives will be
found in many consumer products other than computers. For 2002,
more than 10% of our unit sales were for consumer products other
than computers, primarily gaming devices. If we are not
successful in using our hard drive technology and expertise to
develop new products for these emerging markets, it will likely
harm our operating results.

The market acceptance for hard disk drives in
    game consoles continues to be uncertain.

The use of hard disk drives in the game console
market is a fairly recent trend. Due to the price competitive
nature of the hard disk drive industry, with selling prices of
personal computers being substantially higher than game
consoles, game manufacturers may not have the ability to either
incorporate or continue to incorporate hard disk drives into
their overall architecture. In addition, current price reduction
demands from either current or future game console customers may
not make hard disk drive integration an attractive market for us
or other hard drive manufacturers.

We depend on our key personnel and skilled
    employees.

Our success depends upon the continued
contributions of our key personnel and skilled employees, many
of whom would be extremely difficult to replace. Worldwide
competition for skilled employees in the hard drive industry is
intense. We have lost a number of experienced hard drive
engineers over the past two years as a result of the loss of
retention value of their employee stock options (because of the
decrease in price of our common stock) and aggressive recruiting
of our employees. If we are unable to retain our existing key
personnel or skilled employees or hire and integrate new key
personnel or skilled employees, our operating results would
likely be harmed.

Risk factors relating to Western Digital
particularly

Loss of market share with a key customer could
    harm our operating results.

A majority of our revenue comes from a few
customers. For example, during 2002, sales to our top 10
customers accounted for approximately 58% of revenue. These
customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and
therefore can make substantial demands on us. Even if we
successfully qualify a product with a customer, the customer
generally is not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of
products from us and is able to terminate its relationship with
us at any time. Our ability to maintain strong relationships
with our principal customers is essential to our future
performance. If we lose a key customer, or if any of our key
customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to
reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs, our
operating results would likely be harmed. For example, this
occurred with our enterprise hard drive product line early in
the third quarter of 2000 and is one of the factors which led to
our decision to exit the enterprise hard drive market.

Dependence on a limited number of qualified
    suppliers of components could lead to delays, lost revenue or
    increased costs.

Because we do not manufacture any of the basic
components in our hard drives, an extended shortage of required
components or the failure of key suppliers to remain in
business, adjust to market conditions, or to meet our quality,
yield or production requirements could harm us more severely
than our competitors, some of whom manufacture certain of the
components for their hard drives, and could significantly harm
our operating results. A number of the components used by us are
available from only a single or limited number of qualified
outside suppliers. If a component is in short supply, or a
supplier fails to qualify or has a quality issue with a
component, we may experience delays or increased costs in
obtaining that component. In addition, if a component becomes
unavailable, we could suffer significant loss of revenue. For
example, we lost revenue in



September 1999 when we had to shut down our
Caviar product line production for approximately two weeks as a
result of a faulty power driver chip that was sole-sourced from
a third party supplier.

To reduce the risk of component shortages, we
attempt to provide significant lead times when buying these
components. As a result, we may have to pay significant
cancellation charges to suppliers if we cancel orders, as we did
in 1998 when we accelerated our transition to magnetoresistive
recording head technology, and as we did in 2000 as a result of
our decision to exit the enterprise hard drive market.

In April 1999, we entered into a three-year
volume purchase agreement with Komag under which we buy a
substantial portion of our media components from Komag. In
October 2001, we amended the Komag volume purchase agreement to
extend the initial term to six years. Similarly, in February
2001, we entered into a two-year volume purchase agreement with
IBM under which we buy a substantial portion of our read channel
chips from IBM. Effective June 2002, we amended the IBM volume
purchase agreement to extend the initial term through
December 31, 2003. These strategic relationships have
increased our dependence on each of Komag and IBM as a supplier.
Our future operating results may depend substantially on
Komag’s ability to timely qualify its media components in
our new development programs, and each of Komag’s and
IBM’s ability to supply us with these components or chips,
as the case may be, in sufficient volume to meet our production
requirements. A significant disruption in Komag’s ability
to manufacture and supply us with media components or IBM’s
ability to manufacture and supply us with read channel chips
could harm our operating results.

To develop new products we must maintain
    effective partner relationships with our strategic component
    suppliers.

Under our business model, we do not manufacture
any of the component parts used in our hard drives. As a result,
the success of our products depends on our ability to gain
access to and integrate parts that are “best in class”
from reliable component suppliers. To do so we must effectively
manage our relationships with our strategic component suppliers.
We must also effectively integrate different products from a
variety of suppliers, each of which employs variations on
technology which can impact, for example, feasible combinations
of heads and media components. We are currently engaged in
litigation with Cirrus, which until this year was the sole
source of read channel chips for our hard drives. As a result of
the disputes that gave rise to the litigation, our business
operations were at risk until another supplier’s read
channel chips could be designed into our products. Similar
disputes with other strategic component suppliers could
adversely affect our operating results.

We have only one primary high-volume
    manufacturing facility, and a secondary smaller facility, which
    subjects us to the risk of damage or loss of either
    facility.

The majority of our manufacturing volume comes
from one facility in Malaysia. During 2002, we acquired a
second, smaller manufacturing facility in Thailand. A fire,
flood, earthquake or other disaster, condition or event that
adversely affects either our Malaysia or Thailand facility or
ability to manufacture could result in a loss of sales and
revenue and harm our operating results.

Terrorist attacks may adversely affect our
    business and operating results.

The terrorist attacks on the United States on
September 11, 2001, the United States-led military response
to counter terrorism and the continued threat of terrorist
activity and other acts of war or hostility have created
uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have
significantly increased the political, economic and social
instability in some of the geographic areas in which the Company
operates. It is possible that further acts of terrorism may be
directed against the United States domestically or abroad and
such acts of terrorism could be directed against properties and
personnel of U.S.-owned companies such as ours.



Manufacturing our products abroad subjects us
    to numerous risks.

We are subject to risks associated with our
foreign manufacturing operations, including:

We have attempted to manage the impact of foreign
currency exchange rate changes by, among other things, entering
into short-term, forward exchange contracts. However, those
contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by
the issuer if currency controls are put in place, which occurred
in Malaysia during the first quarter of 1999. As a result of the
Malaysian currency controls, we are no longer hedging the
Malaysian currency risk. Currently, we hedge the Thai Baht and
British Pound Sterling.

The nature of our business and our reliance on
    intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects
    us to the risk of significant litigation.

The hard drive industry has been characterized by
significant litigation. This includes litigation relating to
patent and other intellectual property rights, product liability
claims and other types of litigation. We are currently
evaluating notices of alleged patent infringement or notices of
patents from patent holders. We also are a party to several
judicial and other proceedings relating to patent and other
intellectual property rights. If we conclude that a claim of
infringement is valid, we may be required to obtain a license or
cross-license, modify our existing technology or design a new
non-infringing technology. Such licenses or design modifications
can be extremely costly. We may also be liable for any past
infringement. If there is an adverse ruling against us in an
infringement lawsuit, an injunction could be issued barring
production or sale of any infringing product. It could also
result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost
profits or, if there is a finding of willful infringement,
treble damages. Any of these results would likely increase our
costs and harm our operating results.

Our reliance on intellectual property and
    other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these
    key ingredients of our business could be copied by
    competitors.

Our success depends, in significant part, on the
proprietary nature of our technology, including non-patentable
intellectual property such as our process technology. Despite
safeguards, to the extent that a competitor is able to reproduce
or otherwise capitalize on our technology, it may be difficult,
expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal
protection. Also, the laws of some foreign countries may not
protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the
laws of the United States. In addition to patent protection of
intellectual property rights, we consider elements of our
product designs and processes to be proprietary and
confidential. We rely upon employee, consultant and vendor
non-disclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a
system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary
information. However, any of our registered or unregistered
intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by
others in the industry, which might harm our operating results.



Inaccurate projections of demand for our
    product can cause large fluctuations in our quarterly
    results.

If we do not forecast total quarterly demand
accurately, it can have a material adverse effect on our
quarterly results. We typically book and ship a high percentage
(at times up to 58%) of our total quarterly sales in the third
month of the quarter, which makes it difficult for us to match
our production plans to customer demands. In addition, our
quarterly projections and results may be subject to significant
fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including:

Rapidly changing market conditions in the hard
    drive industry make it difficult to estimate actual
    results.

We have made and continue to make a number of
estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial
reporting. The rapidly changing market conditions with which we
deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our
estimates and assumptions. Key estimates and assumptions for us
include:

The market price of our common stock is
    volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been,
and may continue to be, extremely volatile. Factors such as the
following may significantly affect the market price of our
common stock:



•

developments with respect to patents or
    proprietary rights;

•

conditions and trends in the hard drive, data and
    content management, storage and communication industries; and

•

changes in financial estimates by securities
    analysts relating specifically to us or the hard drive industry
    in general.

In addition, general economic conditions may
cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume
fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the
stock prices of many high technology companies. These
fluctuations often appear to be unrelated to the operating
performance of the companies.

Securities class action lawsuits are often
brought against companies after periods of volatility in the
market price of their securities. A number of such suits have
been filed against us in the past, and should any new lawsuits
be filed, such matters could result in substantial costs and a
diversion of resources and management’s attention.

We may be unable to raise future capital
    through debt or equity financing.

Due to the risks described herein, in the future
we may be unable to maintain adequate financial resources for
capital expenditures, expansion or acquisition activity, working
capital and research and development. We have a credit facility,
which matures on September 20, 2003. If we decide to
increase or accelerate our capital expenditures or research and
development efforts, or if results of operations do not meet our
expectations, we could require additional debt or equity
financing. However, we cannot ensure that additional financing
will be available to us or available on acceptable terms. An
equity financing could also be dilutive to our existing
stockholders.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Disclosure About Foreign Currency
Risk

Although the majority of the Company’s
transactions are in U.S. Dollars, some transactions are based in
various foreign currencies. The Company purchases short-term,
forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign
currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities
and commitments for operating expenses denominated in foreign
currencies. The purpose for entering into these hedge
transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency
fluctuations on the results of operations. A majority of the
increases or decreases in the Company’s local currency
operating expenses are offset by gains and losses on the hedges.
The contracts have maturity dates that do not exceed three
months. The Company does not purchase short-term forward
exchange contracts for trading purposes.

Historically, the Company has focused on hedging
its foreign currency risk related to the Singapore Dollar, the
British Pound Sterling and the Malaysian Ringgit. With the
establishment of currency controls and the prohibition of
purchases or sales of the Malaysian Ringgit by offshore
companies, the Company discontinued hedging its Malaysian
Ringgit currency risk in 1999. Future hedging of this currency
will depend on currency conditions in Malaysia. As a result of
the closure of the Company’s Singapore operations in 2000,
the Company has also discontinued its hedging program related to
the Singapore Dollar. During the third quarter of 2002, the
Company purchased a manufacturing facility in Thailand and began
hedging the Thai Baht.



As of June 28, 2002, the Company had
outstanding the following purchased foreign currency forward
exchange contracts (in millions, except average contract rate):

In 2002, 2001 and 2000, total realized
transaction and forward exchange contract currency gains and
losses were not material to the consolidated financial
statements and the carrying value of the contracts approximated
fair value. Based on historical experience, the Company does not
expect that a significant change in foreign exchange rates would
materially affect the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

Interest Rate Risk

At June 28, 2002, the market value of the
Company’s 5.25% zero coupon convertible subordinated
debentures due in 2018 was approximately $83.0 million, compared
to the related book value of $86.2 million. The convertible
debentures will be repurchased by the Company, at the option of
the holder, as of February 18, 2003, February 18,
2008, or February 18, 2013, or if there is a Fundamental
Change (as defined in the Debenture documents), at the issue
price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of
redemption. The payment on those dates, with the exception of a
Fundamental Change, can be in cash, stock or any combination, at
the Company’s option.

Variable
Interest Rate Risk

At the option of the Company, borrowings under
the Senior Credit Facility would bear interest at either LIBOR
(with option periods of one to three months) or a base rate,
plus a margin determined by the borrowing base. This is the only
debt which does not have a fixed-rate of interest. At
June 28, 2002, there were no borrowings outstanding under
the Facility.

Fair
Value Risk

The Company owns approximately 1.0 million
shares of Vixel common stock. As of June 28, 2002, the
market value of the Vixel shares was $2.6 million. Changes
in the market value of the Vixel shares are recorded as
unrealized gains or losses in other comprehensive income
(shareholders’ equity). As of June 28, 2002, a
$2.6 million total accumulated unrealized gain has been
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. If the
Company sells any portion of this common stock, the related
unrealized gain or loss on the date of sale will become realized
and reflected as a gain or loss in the Company’s income
statement. As a result of market conditions, the market value of
the shares had declined from $2.6 million as of
June 28, 2002 to $1.5 million as of September 20,
2002. Due to market fluctuations, an additional decline in the
stock’s fair market value could occur.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

The Board of Directors

Western Digital Corporation:

We have audited the consolidated financial
statements of Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries as
listed in the accompanying index. In connection with our audits
of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited
the financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying
index. These consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and the financial statement
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Western Digital Corporation
and subsidiaries as of June 28, 2002 and June 29,
2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended
June 28, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion,
the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed its method of revenue
recognition with respect to certain sales commencing on
July 1, 2000.

Note
1.     Organization and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

Western Digital Corporation (“Western
Digital” or the “Company”) has prepared its
consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States and has
adopted accounting policies and practices which are generally
accepted in the industry in which it operates. Following are the
Company’s significant accounting policies:

Fiscal
Year

The Company has a 52 or 53-week fiscal year. In
order to align its manufacturing and financial calendars,
effective during the three months ended December 31, 1999,
the Company changed its fiscal calendar so that each fiscal
month ends on the Friday nearest to the last day of the calendar
month. Prior to this change, the Company’s fiscal month
ended on the Saturday nearest to the last day of the calendar
month. The change did not have a material impact on the
Company’s results of operations or financial position. The
2002, 2001 and 2000 fiscal years ended on June 28,
June 29, and June 30 respectively, and consisted of
52 weeks each. All general references to years relate to
fiscal years unless otherwise noted.

Basis
of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. The accounts of foreign
subsidiaries have been remeasured using the U.S. dollar as the
functional currency. As such, foreign exchange gains or losses
resulting from remeasurement of these accounts are reflected in
the results of operations. These foreign exchange gains and
losses were immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.
Monetary and nonmonetary asset and liability accounts have been
remeasured using the exchange rate in effect at each year end
and using historical rates, respectively. Income statement
accounts have been remeasured using average monthly exchange
rates.

Cash
Equivalents

The Company’s cash equivalents represent
highly liquid investments, primarily money market funds and
commercial paper, with original maturities of three months or
less.

Concentration
of Credit Risk

The Company designs, develops, manufactures and
markets hard drives to personal computer manufacturers,
resellers and retailers throughout the world. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’
financial condition and generally requires no collateral. The
Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses, and such
losses have historically been within management’s
expectations. The Company also has cash equivalent policies that
limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial
institution or investment instrument, and require that
investments be made only with financial institutions or in
investment instruments evaluated as highly credit-worthy.

Inventory
Valuation

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or
net realizable value. Cost is on a first-in, first-out basis for
raw materials and is computed on a currently adjusted standard
basis (which approximates first-in, first-out) for work in
process and finished goods.

Property
and Equipment

The cost of property and equipment is depreciated
over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The
majority of the Company’s property and equipment is being
depreciated over three years. Depreciation is



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

computed on a straight-line basis. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated
useful lives of the assets or the related lease terms.

Intangible
Assets

Intangible assets are included in other assets
and amortized over their expected useful lives or the lives of
the related products. The Company reviews identifiable
intangibles and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever
events or circumstances indicate the carrying amounts may not be
recoverable. If the sum of the expected future cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the
carrying amount of an asset, an impairment loss is recognized to
the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair
value.

Revenue
Recognition

The Company adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin
101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements”
(“SAB 101”), during its quarter ended
June 29, 2001. SAB 101 extends the point at which
revenue is recognized to include the transfer of the risks of
ownership. Generally, this occurs at the time of shipment for
the Company’s OEM customers, and at the time of delivery
for its reseller customers. Accordingly, the Company changed its
revenue recognition policy effective July 1, 2000 to
recognize revenue on certain product shipments upon delivery
rather than shipment. The accounting change resulted in a net
increase to revenues for 2001 of $13.1 million, of which
$16.9 million had previously been recorded in 2000. The
cumulative effect on prior years’ net loss of this
accounting change was $1.5 million.

In accordance with standard industry practice,
the Company’s agreements with certain resellers provide
price protection for inventories held by the resellers at the
time of published list price reductions and, under certain
circumstances, stock rotation for slow-moving items. Either
party may terminate these agreements upon written notice. In the
event of termination, the Company may be obligated to repurchase
a certain portion of the resellers’ inventory. The Company
recognizes revenue at the time of delivery to resellers and
accrues for estimated pricing adjustments and sales returns. Net
revenue recognized on sales to resellers was approximately $990,
$1,016 and $881 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Repurchases of reseller inventory were not
material in 2002, 2001 and 2000.

Warranty

The Company records an accrual for estimated
warranty costs as products are sold. Warranty covers cost of
repair or replacement of the hard drive during the warranty
period, which ranges from 1 to 3 years. The Company has
comprehensive processes with which to estimate accruals for
warranty, which include specific detail on hard drives in the
field by product type, historical field return rates and costs
to repair. Although the Company believes that it has the
continued ability to reasonably estimate warranty reserves,
unforeseeable changes in factors used to estimate the accrual
for warranty could occur. These unforeseeable changes could
cause a material change in the Company’s warranty accrual
estimate. Such a change would be recorded in the period in which
the change was identified.

Advertising
Expense

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Selling, general and administrative expenses of the Company
include advertising costs of $6.0, $7.4 and $9.0 million in
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Income
Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the
liability method, which provides that deferred tax assets and
liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the
financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the
Company’s assets and liabilities and expected benefits of
utilizing net operating loss (“NOL”)



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

carryforwards. The Company records a valuation
allowance where it is “more likely than not” that the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. The impact on deferred
taxes of changes in tax rates and laws, if any, are applied to
the years during which temporary differences are expected to be
settled and reflected in the consolidated financial statements
in the period of enactment (see Note 11).

Per
Share Information

The Company computes basic income (loss) per
share using the net income (loss) and the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
income (loss) per share is computed using the net income
(loss) and the weighted average number of common shares and
dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.
Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding employee
stock options, employee stock purchase plan shares, restricted
stock awards and common shares issuable upon conversion of the
convertible debentures.

As of June 28, 2002, June 29, 2001 and
June 30, 2000, 24.7 million, 23.3 million and
20.9 million shares, respectively, relating to the possible
exercise of outstanding stock options were not included in the
computation of diluted income (loss) per share. Also, for
the same periods, an additional 2.9 million,
4.0 million and 8.4 million shares, respectively,
issuable upon conversion of the convertible debentures were
excluded from the computation of diluted income (loss) per
share. The effects of these items were not included in the
computation of diluted income (loss) per share as their effect
would have been anti-dilutive.

Stock-Based
Compensation

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), establishes the
financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based
compensation plans. As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company
elected to continue accounting for stock-based employee
compensation plans in accordance with Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” and related interpretations (“APB Opinion
No. 25”) and to follow the pro forma net income
(loss), pro forma earnings (loss) per share, and
stock-based compensation plan disclosure requirements set forth
in SFAS 123 (see Note 6).

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents
approximates fair value for all periods presented because of the
short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The fair
value of the Company’s convertible debentures is estimated
by reference to quoted information from market sources. At
June 28, 2002, the market value of the Company’s
convertible debentures was approximately $83.0 million,
compared to the related carrying value of $86.2 million. At
June 29, 2001, the market value of the Company’s
convertible debentures was approximately $85.1 million,
compared to the related carrying value of $112.5 million.
The carrying amounts of all other financial instruments in the
consolidated balance sheets approximate fair values.

Investments

The Company’s investments in unrestricted,
marketable equity securities have been classified as
“available for sale”, are included in other current
assets, and are carried at fair value. The classification of a
security is determined at the acquisition date and reviewed
periodically. The Company regularly reviews the fair market
value of the available for sale securities and records an
unrealized gain or loss for any changes in the fair market
value. Unrealized gains or losses are shown as a component of
accumulated comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’
equity. Securities that are not classified as “available
for sale” are carried at the lower of cost or estimated
fair value. The Company periodically reviews its investments for
instances where fair value is less than cost to determine if the
decline in value is other than temporary. If the decline in
value is judged to be other than temporary, the cost basis of
the security is written down to fair value. The amount of



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

any write-down would be included in the results
of operations as a realized loss. Realized gains and losses
resulting from the sale of securities are determined using the
specific identification method.

Other
Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to
revenue, expenses, gains and losses that are recorded as an
element of shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net
income (loss). The Company’s other comprehensive income
(loss) is comprised of unrealized gains and losses on marketable
securities categorized as “available for sale” under
SFAS 115.

Subsidiary
Equity Transactions

During the periods presented, the Company’s
new venture subsidiary, SageTree, Inc. (“SageTree”),
received cash proceeds from unrelated parties in exchange for an
equity interest in SageTree. As a result of the sale of stock to
an unrelated party during 2002, the Company’s ownership
percentage of SageTree decreased to less than 50% and the
Company discontinued accounting for SageTree under the
consolidation method. At the time the stock was sold to the
unrelated party, the price was in excess of SageTree’s book
value and, therefore, the Company’s net investment in
SageTree increased. As SageTree was a newly formed development
stage company, the increase was reflected in shareholders’
equity as a “subsidiary equity transaction”, in
accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 84.

Foreign Exchange Contracts

Although the majority of the Company’s
transactions are in U.S. Dollars, some transactions are based in
various foreign currencies. The Company purchases short-term,
forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign
currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities
and commitments for operating expenses denominated in foreign
currencies. The purpose for entering into these hedge
transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency
fluctuations on the results of operations. As a result, a
majority of the increases or decreases in the Company’s
local currency operating expenses are offset by gains and losses
on the hedges. The contracts have maturity dates that do not
exceed three months. The Company does not purchase short-term
forward exchange contracts for trading purposes.

The Company applies the provisions of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“SFAS 133”), as amended by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 138, “Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, an
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”. SFAS 133, as
amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for
hedging activities. The Company had outstanding forward exchange
contracts with commercial banks for the British Pound Sterling
and the Thai Baht with values of $5.0 and $2.8 million, at
June 28, 2002 and June 29, 2001, respectively. The
Company has elected not to designate these forward exchange
contracts as accounting hedges and any changes in fair value
were recorded through the results of operations for the years
ended June 28, 2002 and June 29, 2001.

Use of Estimates

Company management has made estimates and
assumptions relating to the reporting of certain assets and
liabilities in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. These estimates and assumptions have been applied
using methodologies which are consistent throughout the periods
presented. However, actual results could differ from these
estimates.



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Reclassifications

Certain prior years’ amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

New Accounting Pronouncements

During April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, “Rescission of
FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections”
(“SFAS 145”). SFAS 145 rescinds SFAS 4,
“Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of
Debt”, which required all gains and losses from
extinguishment of debt to be classified as an extraordinary
item. The Company will adopt SFAS 145 on June 29, 2002 at which
time it will begin classifying gains and losses resulting from
the extinguishment of debt as other income and expense, instead
of extraordinary items. The adoption will not have a net impact
on the Company’s results of operations or liquidity.

On September 11, 2002, the Emerging Issues
Task Force (“EITF”) reached a consensus on Issue
No. 02-15, “Determining Whether Certain Conversions of
Convertible Debt to Equity Securities are within the Scope of
FASB Statement No. 84, Induced Conversions of Convertible
Debt” (“FAS 84”). The EITF deliberated this
issue because of diversity in practice in the accounting for
conversions of convertible debt to equity initiated by the debt
holder. In practice, some registrants accounted for these
transactions following FAS 84 while others followed Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 26, “Early Extinguishment
of Debt” (“APB 26”). The EITF concluded that
FAS 84 applies to conversions of convertible debt when the offer
for consideration in excess of the original conversion terms was
made by the bondholder. The EITF concluded that this guidance
should be followed for transactions entered into on or after
September 12, 2002. The Company’s previous extinguishments
of its convertible debentures involving the issuance of stock
have been accounted for under APB 26 whereby a gain on early
extinguishment was recorded equal to the excess of the net book
value of the indebtedness over the fair value of the
consideration paid to extinguish the indebtedness. Following the
guidance in EITF Issue No. 02-15, similar early
extinguishments of the convertible debentures involving stock
initiated by the debt holder will give rise to a conversion
inducement expense equal to the fair value of the shares issued
in excess of those required to be issued upon the exercise of
the debenture conversion feature. The Company does not expect
EITF Issue No. 02-15 to have a significant impact on the
future results of operations because the Company does not expect
to use stock to make early extinguishments of its convertible
debentures.

2.     Supplemental Financial Statement
Data (in thousands)

(1)

During the fourth quarter of 2001, as a result of
    Komag’s public announcement regarding its intention not to
    pay certain debt and interest amounts when due, and due to the
    market value trend of its common stock, the carrying amount of
    the equity investment in Komag was determined to have suffered
    an “other than temporary” decline in market value.
    Accordingly, the Company recorded nonoperating charges totaling
    $52.4 million to adjust the carrying values of equity
    investments in and notes receivable from Komag and to accrue for
    the contingent guarantees of the Komag equipment and facility
    leases. On August 24, 2001, Komag announced its voluntary
    Chapter 11 reorganization filing. During 2002, the Company
    sold its creditor position and remaining investments in Komag to
    an unrelated party for $9.0 million.

Note
3.     Convertible Debentures and Line
of Credit

Convertible Debentures

The Company has zero coupon convertible
subordinated debentures due February 18, 2018 (the
“Debentures”). The Debentures are subordinated to all
senior debt; are redeemable at the option of the Company any
time after February 18, 2003 at the issue price plus
accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption; and
at the holder’s option, will be redeemed by the Company, as
of February 18, 2003, February 18, 2008 or
February 18, 2013, or if there is a Fundamental Change (as
defined in the Debenture documents), at the issue price plus
accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption. The
payment on those dates, with the exception of a Fundamental
Change, can be in cash, stock or any combination, at the
Company’s option. Alternatively, a holder may choose to
convert debentures into shares of the Company’s common
stock at the rate of 14.935 shares per $1,000 principal amount
at maturity. Based on current forecasts, the Company now intends
to satisfy the majority, if not all, of its put obligations in
cash instead of common stock. Accordingly, the Debentures have
been classified as a current liability at June 28, 2002.
Debentures not put to the Company in February 2003, if any, will
be reclassified as long-term debt.

During 2002, the Company issued 2.6 million
shares of common stock and paid $17.6 million in cash in
exchange for Debentures with a book value of $31.6 million
and an aggregate principal amount at maturity of
$72.4 million. During 2001, the Company issued
16.0 million shares of common stock in exchange for
Debentures with a book value of $120.3 million and an
aggregate principal amount at maturity of $295.7 million.
During 2000, the Company issued 26.7 million shares of common
stock in exchange for Debentures with a book value of
$284.1 million and an aggregate principal amount at
maturity of $735.6 million. These redemptions were private,
individually negotiated transactions with certain institutional
investors and resulted in an extraordinary loss of $0.1 million
during 2002 and extraordinary gains of $22.4 and
$166.9 million during 2001 and 2000, respectively (see also
New Accounting Pronouncements under Note 1).

As of June 28, 2002, the book value of the
remaining outstanding Debentures was $86.2 million and the
aggregate principal amount at maturity was $193.5 million.
Debenture issuance costs are included in other assets and
amortized over the term of the Debentures. During 2002, 2001 and
2000, approximately $0.4, $2.4 and $7.1 million,
respectively, of unamortized issuance costs were netted against
the extraordinary gain in connection with the redemptions. As of
June 28, 2002 the balance of unamortized Debenture issuance
costs was $0.6 million.

Line of Credit

The Company has a three-year Senior Credit
Facility that provides up to $125 million in revolving
credit (subject to outstanding letters of credit and a borrowing
base calculation), matures on September 20, 2003 and is
secured by the Company’s accounts receivable, inventory,
65% of its stock in its foreign subsidiaries and other assets.
At the option of the Company, borrowings bear interest at either
LIBOR (with option periods of one to three months) or a base
rate, plus a margin determined by the borrowing base. The Senior
Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain certain amounts
of tangible net worth, prohibits the payment of cash dividends
on common stock and contains a number of other covenants. The
Senior Credit Facility replaced a previous facility that matured
on March 31, 2000. As of the date hereof, there were no
borrowings under the facility. However, the Company has issued a
$25 million standby letter of credit under the facility to
Cirrus Logic, Inc. (“Cirrus”) concerning
$25 million in disputed accounts payable. These disputed
accounts payable have been recorded in the Company’s
financial statements, but are part of the Company’s
litigation against Cirrus (see Note 5). The availability under
the Senior Credit Facility has been reduced by a corresponding
amount for the outstanding letter of credit.

Note 4.     Operating
Lease Commitments

The Company leases certain facilities and
equipment under long-term, non-cancelable operating leases which
expire at various dates through 2010. Rental expense under these
leases, including month-to-month rentals, was $11.7, $15.4 and
$17.8 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Future minimum rental payments under
non-cancelable operating leases as of June 28, 2002 are as
follows (in thousands):

Note 5.     Legal
Proceedings

The following discussion contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
These statements relate to the Company’s legal proceedings
described below. Litigation is inherently uncertain and may
result in adverse rulings or decisions. Additionally, the
Company may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments
that may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations or liquidity. In addition, the
costs of defending such litigation, individually or in the
aggregate, may be material, regardless of the outcome.
Accordingly, results could differ materially from those
projected in the forward-looking statements.

In the normal course of business, the Company is
subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims,
including proceedings under laws and government regulations
related to environmental, labor, product and other matters. The
ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial
impact with respect to these matters at June 28, 2002, is
subject to many uncertainties and is therefore not predictable
with assurance. While these matters could affect the operating
results of any one quarter when resolved in future periods,
management believes that, after final disposition, any monetary
liability or financial impact to the Company from these matters,
beyond that provided at June 28, 2002, would not be
material to the annual consolidated financial statements.
However, there can be no assurance with respect to such result.
Where deemed advisable, the Company may seek or extend licenses
or negotiate settlements. Although patent holders often offer
such licenses, no assurance can be given that in a particular
case a license will be offered or that the offered terms will be
acceptable to the Company.

In 1992, Amstrad plc (“Amstrad”)
brought suit against the Company in California State Superior
Court, County of Orange, alleging that disk drives supplied to
Amstrad by the Company in 1988 and 1989 were defective and
caused damages to Amstrad of not less than $186 million.
The suit also sought punitive damages. The Company denied the
material allegations of the complaint and filed cross-claims
against Amstrad. The case was tried, and in June 1999 the jury
returned a verdict in favor of Western Digital. Amstrad appealed
the judgment and the judgment awarding costs and attorney’s
fees to the Company. The Company and Amstrad have entered into a
settlement agreement settling all claims between them relating
to the litigation, and dismissals of the appeals will be entered
shortly.

In June 1994, Papst Licensing (“Papst”)
brought suit against the Company in the United States District
Court for the Central District of California, alleging
infringement by the Company of five disk drive motor patents
owned by Papst. In December 1994, Papst dismissed its case
without prejudice. In July 2002, Papst filed a new complaint
against the Company and several other defendants. The suit
alleges infringement by the



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company of seventeen of Papst’s patents
related to disk drive motors that the Company purchased from
motor vendors. Papst is seeking an injunction and damages. The
Company filed an answer on September 4, 2002, denying
Papst’s complaint. The Company intends to vigorously defend
the suit.

On July 5, 2001, the Company (and its
Malaysian subsidiary) filed suit against Cirrus Logic, Inc.
(“Cirrus”) in California Superior Court for the County
of Orange for breach of contract and other claims resulting from
Cirrus’ role as a strategic supplier of read channel chips
for the Company’s hard drives. The Company also stopped
making payments to Cirrus for past deliveries of chips and
terminated all outstanding purchase orders from Cirrus for such
chips. The Company’s complaint alleges that Cirrus’
unlawful conduct caused damages in excess of any amounts that
may be owing on outstanding invoices or arising out of any
alleged breach of the outstanding purchase orders. On August 20,
2001, Cirrus filed an answer and cross-complaint. Cirrus denied
the allegations contained in the Company’s complaint and
asserted counterclaims against the Company for, among other
things, the amount of the outstanding invoices and the
Company’s alleged breach of the outstanding purchase
orders. The disputed payable, which is included in the
Company’s balance sheet in accounts payable, is
approximately $27 million. Cirrus claims that the canceled
purchase orders, which are not reflected in the Company’s
financial statements, total approximately $26 million. On
October 9, 2001, the Court granted Cirrus’ Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings, with leave to amend, and on
November 8, 2001, the Company filed its First Amended
Complaint. Cirrus demurred to the First Amended Complaint, and
on December 18, 2001, the Court denied Cirrus’
demurrer. On November 2, 2001, Cirrus filed Applications
for Right to Attach Orders and for Writs of Attachment against
the Company and its Malaysian subsidiary in the amount of
$25.2 million as security for the approximately
$27 million allegedly owed for read-channel chips purchased
from Cirrus that is disputed by the Company. On
December 20, 2001, the Court granted Cirrus’
Applications but required Cirrus to post undertakings in the
amount of approximately $0.5 million on each Writ before
issuance. Pursuant to agreement with Cirrus, the Company posted
a letter of credit in the amount of $25.2 million in
satisfaction of the Writs. Discovery in the case is currently
underway, and the Company expects that it will continue for the
next several months.

Note
6.     Shareholders’
Equity

Equity
Facility

Under shelf registrations (the “equity
facility”) previously in effect with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the Company issued shares of common stock
to institutional investors for cash. Shares sold under the
equity facility were at the market price of the Company’s
common stock less a discount ranging from 2.75% to 4.25%. During
2002, the Company withdrew these shelf registrations. During
2001, the Company issued 23.5 million shares of common
stock under the equity facility for net cash proceeds of
approximately $110.5 million. During 2000, the Company
issued 24.6 million shares of common stock under the equity
facility for net cash proceeds of approximately $111.8 million.

Reserved for Issuance

The following table summarizes all shares of
common stock reserved for issuance at June 28, 2002 (in

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has an employee stock purchase plan
(“ESPP”) that operates in accordance with
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code whereby eligible
employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their
salary to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at
85% of the fair market value of common stock on the date of
grant or the exercise date, whichever is less. Approximately
1.6 million shares of common stock remain reserved for
issuance under this plan. Approximately 1,343,000, 1,199,000 and
1,236,000 shares were issued under this plan during 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

Stock
Option Plans

Western Digital’s Employee Stock Option Plan
(“Employee Plan”) is administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors (“Compensation
Committee”), which determines the vesting provisions, the
form of payment for the shares and all other terms of the
options. Terms of the Employee Plan require that the exercise
price of options be not less than the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of grant. Options granted generally
vest 25% one year from the date of grant and in twelve quarterly
increments thereafter and have a ten-year term. As of
June 28, 2002, options to purchase 8,547,233 shares of
common stock were exercisable and 10,553,315 shares were
available for grant under this plan. Pursuant to the terms of
the Employee Plan, participants are permitted to utilize
previously purchased common stock as consideration to purchase
additional common stock upon exercise of options or to exercise
on a cashless basis through the Company designated broker.

The Company has a Broad-Based Stock Incentive
Plan (the “Broad-Based Plan”) under which options to
purchase shares of common stock and stock awards may be granted
to employees of the Company and others. This plan is intended to
qualify as “broadly-based” under the New York Stock
Exchange shareholder approval policy. The Compensation Committee
determines the vesting provisions and other terms of the options
and stock. To date, the options granted vest either one year,
two years or four years from the date of grant. As of
June 28, 2002, options to purchase 6,213,949 shares of
common stock were exercisable and 1,695,716 shares were
available for grant as options or stock awards, under this plan.

Under the Broad-Based Plan, the Company issued to
certain employees 0.3 million and 1.3 million shares
of restricted stock during 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
stock vests on the second and third anniversary dates of the
grant provided that the recipient is still employed by the
Company. The aggregate market value (net of cancellations) of
the restricted stock at the dates of issuance was
$1.1 million and $4.4 million for 2002 and 2001,
respectively. These amounts have been recorded as deferred
compensation, a separate component of shareholders’ equity
(deficiency), and are being amortized over the three-year
vesting period.

The Company has a Stock Option Plan for
Non-Employee Directors (“Director Plan”) and has
reserved 2.6 million shares for issuance thereunder. The
Director Plan provides for initial option grants to new
directors of 75,000 shares per director and additional
grants of options to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock
per director each year upon their reelection as a director at
the annual shareholders’ meeting. Terms of the Director
Plan require that options have a ten-year term and that the
exercise price of options be not less than the fair market value
at the date of grant. Options granted generally vest 25% one
year from the date of grant and in twelve quarterly increments
thereafter and have a ten-year term. As of June 28, 2002,
options to purchase 630,941 shares of common stock were
exercisable and 1,038,876 shares were available for grant
under this plan.

Pro
Forma Information

Pro forma information regarding net income (loss)
and earnings (loss) per share is required by SFAS 123. This
information is required to be determined as if the Company had
accounted for its stock options (including shares issued under
the Stock Option Plans and the ESPP, collectively called
“options”) granted subsequent to July 1, 1995,
under the fair value method of that statement.



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The fair value of options granted in 2002, 2001
and 2000 reported below has been estimated at the date of grant
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions:

The following is a summary of the per share
weighted average fair value of stock options granted in the
years listed below:

The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 in
accounting for its stock option and ESPP plans and, accordingly,
no compensation expense has been recognized for the options in
the consolidated financial statements. Had the Company
determined compensation expense based on the fair value at the
grant date for its options under SFAS 123, the Company’s
net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share would have
been as indicated below (amounts in thousands except per share
data):

Stock
Purchase Rights

In 1989, the Company implemented a plan to
protect shareholders’ rights in the event of a proposed
takeover of the Company. Under the plan, each share of the
Company’s outstanding common stock carried one Right to
Purchase Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the
“Right”). The Right enabled the holder, under certain
circumstances, to purchase common stock of Western Digital or of
an acquiring company at a substantially discounted price ten
days after a person or group publicly announces it has acquired
or has tendered an offer for 15% or more of the Company’s
outstanding common stock. On September 10, 1998 the
Company’s Board of Directors approved the adoption of a new
Rights plan to replace the previous plan, which expired in
September 1998. The Rights under the 1998 plan were similar to
the rights under the 1989 plan except they were redeemable by
the Company at $.01 per Right and expired in 2008. In connection



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

with the establishment of a holding company
structure on April 6, 2001, the Company terminated the
Rights under the 1998 plan and adopted a new Rights plan. The
2001 plan is similar to the terminated 1998 plan, except that
the exercise price was reduced from $150.00 to $50.00 per share,
and the expiration date for the 2001 Rights plan was extended to
April 2011.

Note 7.     Savings
and Profit Sharing Plan

Effective July 1, 1991, the Company adopted
a Savings and Profit Sharing Plan, the Western Digital
Corporation Retirement Savings and Profit Sharing Plan (the
“Plan”). The Plan includes an employee 401(k) plan.
The Plan covers substantially all domestic employees, subject to
certain eligibility requirements. The Company may make annual
contributions to the 401(k) plan at the discretion of the Board
of Directors. For 2002, 2001 and 2000 the Company made
contributions to the 401(k) plan of $1.4 million,
$1.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively.

Note
8.     Restructurings

During 2000, the Company initiated restructuring
actions to improve operational efficiency and reduce operating
expenses. Charges related to these restructuring actions were
accrued in the periods in which executive management committed
to execute such actions. The restructuring actions taken in 2000
included the reorganization of worldwide operational and
management responsibilities, transfer of hard drive production
from Singapore to the Company’s manufacturing facility in
Malaysia, removal of property and equipment from service,
closure of the Company’s Singapore operations and closure
of its Rochester, Minnesota design center. These actions
resulted in a net reduction of worldwide headcount of
approximately 2,000, of which approximately 540 were management,
professional and administrative personnel and the remainder were
manufacturing employees. These employees were given legally
required notification and outplacement services. Restructuring
charges recorded in connection with these actions totaled
$85.8 million and consisted of severance and outplacement
costs of $28.7 million, the write-off of manufacturing
equipment and information systems assets of $56.3 million
(taken out of service and held for disposal), and net lease
cancellation and other costs associated with the closure of
$11.0 million. Reducing these charges was the favorable
settlement of lease commitments in Singapore of
$5.3 million, favorable settlement of 1999 restructuring
accruals of $1.8 million and a gain realized on the sale of
the Tuas, Singapore facility, closed during 1999 restructuring
actions, of $3.1 million. The restructuring effort was
substantially completed by June 30, 2000. Of the charges
related to the 2000 restructuring actions, approximately
$30.5 million was paid in 2000 and the remainder was paid
in 2001. Also paid in 2000 was the remainder of the 1999
restructuring of $0.2 million.

charges, the amounts paid and the ending accrual balances (in

June 29, 2001:

Note 9.     Business
Segment, International Operations and Major Customers

Segment
Information

As of June 28, 2002, the Company operated in
one segment, the hard drive business. The Company’s new
business ventures have been discontinued (see Note 10).

International
Operations

The Company’s operations outside the United
States include manufacturing facilities in Malaysia and Thailand
as well as sales offices throughout Europe and Asia. During 1999
and the first half of 2000, the Company also had manufacturing
facilities in Singapore. The following table summarizes
operations by geographic areas for the past three years. United
States revenues to unaffiliated customers include export sales
to international customers of $659.6, $512.6 and
$505.8 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Transfers between geographic areas are accounted
for at prices comparable to normal sales through outside
distributors. General and corporate expenses of $47, $50 and
$62 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000,



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

respectively, have been excluded in determining
operating income (loss) by geographic region. Asia revenues
and assets for the periods presented below consist primarily of
the Company’s Malaysian operations.

Major
Customers

During 2002, sales to Dell Computer accounted for
15% of the Company’s revenues and sales to Hewlett-Packard
(including sales to Compaq Computer prior to its merger with
Hewlett-Packard in 2002) accounted for 13% of the Company’s
revenues. During 2001, sales to Dell Computer accounted for 16%
of the Company’s revenues and sales to Compaq Computer
accounted for 12% of the Company’s revenues. During 2000
sales to Compaq Computer accounted for 21% of the Company’s
revenues.

Note
10.     Discontinued
Operations

The Company acquired Connex, Inc.
(“Connex”), a storage systems and solutions startup,
in 1999. SANavigator, Inc. (“SANavigator”) was formed
as a subsidiary of Connex in 2001 and developed and marketed
storage area network management software.

During 2000, the Company formed Keen Personal
Media, Inc. (“Keen PM”), to develop and sell
interactive personal video recorder and set-top box software,
services and hardware for broadband television content
management and commerce.

In 2002, the Company discontinued Connex,
SANavigator and Keen. The disposals have been accounted for as
discontinued operations and, accordingly, the consolidated
financial statements for all periods presented have been
reclassified. In August 2001, substantially all of the operating
assets of Connex were sold to



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Quantum Corporation for cash proceeds of
$11.0 million, and in September 2001 substantially all of
the operating assets of SANavigator were sold to McData
Corporation for cash proceeds of $29.8 million. These
transactions generated a gain of $24.5 million, net of
costs incurred from the measurement date of July 1, 2001
through the end of the period to shutdown the businesses. At
June 28, 2002, there were no remaining assets or
liabilities attributable to any of the new ventures. At
June 29, 2001, the net liabilities of discontinued
operations, totaling $2.1 million, were included with other
accrued expenses on the balance sheet and consisted principally
of individually immaterial amounts of inventories, prepaid
expenses, fixed assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses.

Note 11.     Income
Taxes

The domestic and international components of
income (loss) before income taxes are as follows (in
thousands):

The components of income tax benefit are as
follows (in thousands):

The tax benefits associated with employee
exercises of non-qualified stock options, disqualifying
dispositions of stock acquired with incentive stock options, and
disqualifying dispositions of stock acquired under the employee
stock purchase plan generally reduce taxes currently payable.
However, no tax benefits were recorded to additional paid-in
capital in 2002, 2001 and 2000 because their realization was not
believed to be “more likely than not”. Consequently, a
valuation allowance was recorded against the entire benefit.
Benefits to be recognized in the future related to stock option
deductions are approximately $20.0 million.

During 2002, the company received a refund of
U.S. federal income taxes of $3.1 million. This refund was
for alternative minimum taxes paid in prior years and was made
in accordance with legislation enacted during 2002. During 2000,
the Company reversed $19.5 million of tax accruals and
certain deferred tax amounts. These accruals were previously
established over time and primarily related to unremitted income
of foreign subsidiaries. However, based upon a review of the
Company’s tax positions after the substantial international
operations restructurings in 2000, and due to the significant
balances of net operating losses in recent years, the Company
believed these accruals were no longer necessary.

Income tax payments amounted to
$2.0 million, $1.5 million and $4.6 million in 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively.



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Temporary differences and carryforwards, which
give rise to a significant portion of deferred tax assets and
liabilities at June 28, 2002 and June 29, 2001 are as
follows (in thousands):

Reserves and accrued expenses not currently
deductible include the following (in thousands):

During 2002, the Company repatriated a
significant amount of prior years’ earnings of its foreign
subsidiaries. As a result, there was a significant reduction in
net operating loss carryforwards. The repatriation occurred
following the enactment in 2002 of favorable but temporary U.S.
tax law changes. Remaining net undistributed earnings from
foreign subsidiaries at June 28, 2002, on which no U.S. tax has
been provided, amounted to approximately $110 million. The
net undistributed earnings are intended to finance local
operating requirements. Accordingly, an additional United States
tax provision has not been made on these earnings.

The Company determines deferred taxes for each of
its tax-paying subsidiaries within each tax jurisdiction. The
deferred tax assets indicated above are attributable primarily
to tax jurisdictions where a history of earnings has not been
established. The taxable earnings in these tax jurisdictions are
also subject to volatility. Therefore, the Company believes a
valuation allowance is needed to reduce the deferred tax asset
to an amount that is “more likely than not” to be
realized.



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Reconciliation of the United States Federal
statutory rate to the Company’s effective tax rate is as
follows:

Certain income of selected subsidiaries is taxed
at substantially lower income tax rates as compared to local
statutory rates. The lower rates reduced income taxes and
improved the net income or loss by $29 million ($.15 per
diluted share), $30 million ($.18 per diluted share), and
$19 million ($.15 per diluted share) in 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively. These lower rates are in effect through
fiscal year 2004.

At June 28, 2002, the Company had Federal
and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$595 million and $432 million, respectively. In
addition, the Company had various Federal and state tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $44.2 million. The loss
carryforwards are available to offset future federal and state
taxable income through 2021 and 2006, respectively. The credit
carryforwards begin to expire in 2003.
