PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

We design, develop, manufacture and sell hard drives. A hard
    drive is a device that uses one or more rotating magnetic disks
    (“media”) to store and allow fast access to data. Hard
    drives are key components of computers, including desktop and
    notebook computers (“PCs”), data storage subsystems
    and many consumer electronic (“CE”) devices.

We sell our products worldwide to original equipment
    manufacturers (“OEMs”) and original design
    manufacturers (“ODMs”) for use in computer systems,
    subsystems or CE devices, and to distributors, resellers and
    retailers. Our hard drives are used in desktop computers,
    notebook computers, and enterprise applications such as servers,
    workstations, network attached storage, storage area networks
    and video surveillance equipment. Additionally, our hard drives
    are used in CE applications such as digital video recorders
    (“DVRs”), and satellite and cable set-top boxes
    (“STBs”). We also sell our hard drives as stand-alone
    storage products and integrate them into external casings,
    embedding application software and presenting them as
    WD

®

-branded
    external storage appliances for purposes such as personal data
    backup and portable or expanded storage of digital music,
    photographs, video and other data.

Hard drives provide non-volatile data storage, which means that
    the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the
    device. Our hard drives currently include 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch
    form factor drives, having capacities ranging from 40 gigabytes
    (“GB”) to 1 terabyte (“TB”), nominal
    rotation speeds of 5,400, 7,200 and 10,000 revolutions per
    minute (“RPM”), and offer interfaces including both
    Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (“EIDE”) and
    Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (“SATA”). We
    also embed our hard drives into
    WD

®

-branded
    external storage appliances that utilize interfaces such as USB
    2.0, external SATA,
    FireWire

tm

and Ethernet network connections. In addition, we recently
    announced a family of hard drives specifically designed to
    consume substantially less power than standard drives, utilizing
    our Green
    Power

tm

technology.

We manufacture hard drives and head stack assemblies
    (“HSAs”) in Malaysia and Thailand. We also design and
    manufacture most of our required magnetic heads in California
    and head gimbal assemblies (“HGAs”) in Thailand and we
    design in California and manufacture in Malaysia most of our
    required media and substrates. For geographical financial data,
    see Part II, Item 8, Note 6 in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

On September 5, 2007, we completed our acquisition (the
    “Acquisition”) of Komag, Incorporated
    (“Komag”) through a cash tender offer by State M
    Corporation (“State M”), our indirect wholly-owned
    subsidiary, for all outstanding shares of Komag’s common
    stock, which was followed by a merger of State M and Komag (the
    “Merger”) whereby Komag became an indirect
    wholly-owned subsidiary and changed its name to WD Media, Inc.
    The Acquisition has strengthened our production efficiencies and
    improved our access to and control of technology and competitive
    position in the worldwide hard drive industry, while enhancing
    our hard drive manufacturing process by integrating media. The
    aggregate purchase price for Komag was approximately
    $1 billion, consisting of cash paid for outstanding shares,
    transaction fees, severance and other employee-related equity
    payments.

Business
    Strategy

Our business strategy is to provide a broad selection of
    reliable, high quality hard drives at a low total cost of
    ownership and with high efficiency and speed. We believe this
    strategy helps accomplish the following:

•

distinguishes us in the dynamic and competitive hard drive
    industry;

•

provides great value to our customers; and

•

allows us to better achieve consistent financial performance,
    including strong returns on invested capital.

We have designed our business strategy to accommodate
    significant unit and revenue growth with relatively small
    increases in operating expenses and to consistently achieve high
    asset utilization.



Industry

We design, develop and manufacture hard drives for the desktop
    and mobile PC, enterprise, CE and branded product retail
    markets. We believe that growth in the sales of hard drives has
    continued to outpace the growth in the sales of all PCs as there
    were approximately 88% more hard drives sold in the market than
    PCs in calendar 2007, based on industry data. We believe the
    following factors continue to drive this accelerating growth of
    hard drive sales in addition to PC applications:

•

consumer use of hard drives for the playing, retention, and
    creation of digital content for personal use in the rapidly
    growing CE market;

•

growth of the external hard drive or branded products market,
    permitting the easy storage, portability and backup of digital
    data such as music, photographs, or video;

•

increased use of multiple hard drives in PCs for data backup and
    expanded storage capacity; and

•

increased use of multiple cost-optimized high performance hard
    drives in data-intensive applications such as Internet search
    engines and in hard drive intensive hosts for handheld computing
    devices.

Additionally, we believe that the demand for 2.5-inch hard
    drives has grown from approximately 16% of the overall hard
    drive market in calendar 2003 to 34% of the overall hard drive
    market in calendar 2007, driven principally by the fast-growing
    market for notebook computers.

These factors and our product expansion strategy have gradually
    increased our percentage of revenue derived from non-desktop
    sources. In 2008, 56% of our revenue was from non-desktop
    sources compared to 43% in 2007.

For an additional discussion of risks relating to the hard drive
    industry, please see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Desktop
    PC Market

The desktop PC market consists of the overall hard drive market
    for desktop computers. Individuals use desktop computers in
    homes, businesses and multi-user networks. Desktop computers use
    software applications for word processing, spreadsheet, desktop
    publishing, database management, multimedia, entertainment and
    for other needs. Hard drives store desktop computer operating
    system and application software, as well as the data used by the
    applications.

We believe that the demand for hard drives in the desktop PC
    market has grown in part due to:

•

the overall growth of desktop computer sales;

•

the increasing needs of businesses and individuals for increased
    storage capacity on their desktop computers;

•

the continuing development of software applications to manage
    multimedia content; and

•

the increasing use of broadband Internet, including content
    downloaded from the Internet onto desktop computer hard drives.

We believe several other factors affect the rate of desktop
    computer unit growth, including maturing desktop PC markets in
    North America and Western Europe, an increase in first-time
    buyers of desktop computers in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin
    America, and the lengthening of desktop computer replacement
    cycles.

Mobile PC
    Market

The mobile PC market consists primarily of notebook computers.
    Individuals use notebook computers both in and away from homes
    and businesses. Like desktop computers, notebook computers use
    software applications for various needs and hard drives store
    notebook operating system and application software, and the data
    used by the applications.

We believe that the demand for hard drives in the mobile PC
    market has grown in part due to:

•

the overall growth of notebook sales, including increased
    transition from desktop computers to notebook computers;

•

the increased mobility of the workforce;



•

the increasing needs of businesses and individuals for increased
    storage capacity on their notebook computers;

•

the continuing development of software applications to manage
    multimedia content; and

•

the increasing use of broadband Internet, including content
    downloaded from the Internet onto notebook hard drives.

We expect the mobile PC market to continue to grow faster than
    the desktop or enterprise markets in the next three years. As
    the mobile PC market continues to evolve to a higher volume
    market, we believe customers are placing increased emphasis on
    attributes such as quality, availability, reliability,
    execution, flexibility, and the competitive cost structures of
    their hard drive suppliers. These are the same attributes that
    have been emphasized for many years by customers in the
    high-volume desktop PC market.

Enterprise
    Market

The enterprise market for hard drives includes workstations,
    servers, network attached storage, storage area networks, other
    computing systems or subsystems, and video surveillance.
    Historically, hard drives for this market have utilized several
    interfaces, including the Small Computer Systems Interface
    (“SCSI”) and Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop
    (“FCAL”). Beginning in 2003, these traditional
    enterprise interfaces have been supplemented or have been
    replaced in certain storage applications by hard drives
    featuring the SATA interface technology, which is supported by
    industry standards, as well as by Serial Attached SCSI
    (“SAS”). SATA hard drives typically cost customers
    less than SCSI hard drives while offering higher capacities and
    maintaining similar reliability, scalability and performance.

We believe that enterprise uses of SATA hard drives will
    continue to increase. During the past few years, a new
    disk-based

back-up

application has emerged with high-capacity SATA hard drives
    augmenting SCSI hard drives, tape and optical media. This new
    application, popularly referred to as “near-line”
    storage, has created a growth market because hard drives back up
    or access data more quickly than tape or optical solutions, and
    quickly retrieve critical

back-up

or
    near-line data. The availability of SATA hard drive solutions,
    which are more cost effective than SCSI hard drives, promotes
    the increasing use of high-capacity hard drives in near-line
    storage applications. The low price per capacity of SATA drives
    has stimulated new applications such as video surveillance,
    video editing/broadcasting and medical imaging. These
    applications represent segments of a growing market for high
    capacity storage in non-computing imaging and multimedia
    professions.

Enterprise-class SATA drives are becoming commonplace for
    IT infrastructure applications such as databases, scientific
    computing, web content, web caching, web search engines and
    electronic mail. These applications have become an important
    market for high-capacity SATA hard drives. We believe that this
    market will consume a growing portion of the highest capacity
    hard drives in the next three years.

SAS is the next generation SCSI technology and is expected to
    replace SCSI drives over the next few years. SATA technology is
    compatible with SAS technology, enabling customers the
    flexibility of incorporating SATA hard drives in SAS storage
    systems. We believe the market transition from SCSI to SAS will
    add to the growth of the enterprise-class SATA market,
    which currently is estimated to be approximately 40% of the
    enterprise hard drive market.

High-performance applications such as blade servers are
    increasingly using 2.5-inch form factor hard drives, supplanting
    traditional 3.5-inch drives. Smaller form factors enable more
    drives per physical space for increased performance, higher
    capacity per square foot and lower power consumption. This trend
    demonstrates the fragmentation of the enterprise hard drive
    market and the need for application-specific enterprise-class
    hard drives.

Consumer
    Electronics Market

The use of hard drives in CE products has been a major growth
    area in recent years. Currently, the three largest segments of
    this market are:

•

video content in applications such as DVRs;

•

audio and video content in applications such as consumer
    handheld devices, including MP3 players; and

•

hard drives in game consoles.



Since 1999, DVRs have been available for use in home
    entertainment systems and they offer enhanced capabilities such
    as pausing live television, simplifying the process of recording
    and cataloging recorded television programs and quickly
    forwarding or returning to any section of a recorded television
    program. Additionally, digital video disk (“DVD”)
    recorders increasingly incorporate hard drives to allow for DVR
    functionality and faster recording of content onto removable
    DVDs. The market for these products favors larger capacity hard
    drives and continues to grow in Japan, North America and
    Europe. Additionally, the rest of Asia Pacific shows strong
    interest in this market. We believe growth in this market will
    continue to build demand for higher capacity hard drives.

The proliferation in the CE market of more sophisticated mobile
    devices including cell phones and MP3 players is driving the
    delivery of diverse content from hard drive intensive hosts. We
    believe this is one of the factors influencing increased sales
    of enterprise-class SATA drives. We also believe that
    multimedia handheld devices such as video cameras and
    high-resolution still cameras are enabling consumer production
    of expansive digital content that requires increasing amounts of
    small form-factor hard drive storage, as well as high-capacity
    desktop-class hard drives for editing, manipulation and
    long-term storage of such content.

Hard drives with 1.8-inch or 1.0-inch form factors primarily
    address the consumer handheld device and portable external
    storage markets. The majority of hard drives used in portable
    media players that play both digital audio and video content are
    1.8-inch form factors. Currently, we believe the markets for
    these handheld devices are better served by flash memory as
    opposed to rotating magnetic storage.

External
    Hard Drive Market

Most new PC systems include high-speed external interfaces, such
    as USB 2.0, external SATA,
    FireWire

tm

or Ethernet network connections, that permit users to supplement
    the storage space of their PC systems or home and small office
    networks with the use of external hard drives. Users store
    additional programs or multimedia content, and back up internal
    hard drives with external hard drives, as well as mobile
    external hard drives for mobility convenience. Although external
    hard drives are a small part of the overall hard drive market,
    we believe that sales of external hard drives will continue to
    grow. External storage can often be the easiest, quickest or
    only way of adding additional storage capacity to either a
    desktop or notebook computer. We believe there is an increasing
    consumer awareness of the need and value of securely storing
    personal digital content through backup applications and
    devices. In addition, there is opportunity for external storage
    as a way of expanding storage capacity in CE devices such as
    DVRs.

Other
    Market Opportunities

We regularly review opportunities to apply our knowledge of data
    storage technology to markets that we do not currently serve.
    Based on significant investments we made over the last five
    years, we believe we have the technology building blocks to
    increase our overall market penetration and be a full-line hard
    drive supplier. Consistent with our measured and deliberate
    approach to new market entries in the recent past, our approach
    to additional new markets will be based on a careful assessment
    of the risks, rewards, requirements and profit potential of such
    actions.

Products

We offer a broad line of hard drives designed for various
    markets. We market our hard drives under brand names including
    WD Caviar, WD Raptor, WD VelociRaptor, WD Scorpio, WD Elements,
    My Passport, My Book, My DVR Expander and GreenPower. These hard
    drives service the desktop, mobile, enterprise, CE and branded
    products markets, and can be found in products including desktop
    computers, notebook computers, enterprise storage, workstations,
    video surveillance equipment, networking products, DVRs, STBs
    and external storage appliances.

Desktop
    Hard Drive Products

The hard drives we design for the desktop PC market currently
    consist of 3.5-inch form factor products with capacities ranging
    from 40 GB to 1 TB. These products utilize either the EIDE or
    SATA interfaces, providing high performance while retaining ease
    of use and overall low cost of connection. The type of EIDE
    interface currently used in our hard drives is ATA/100, which
    signifies a burst data transfer rate of 100 megabytes per
    second, which is the maximum specified data transition that can
    be sustained under ideal conditions. The SATA interface
    available in the majority of our hard drives enable burst
    transfer rates of up to 300 megabytes per second.



Mobile
    Hard Drive Products

Our hard drives used in mobile products typically include
    2.5-inch form factor drives for notebook computers. Although the
    desktop PC market still accounts for a majority of hard drive
    sales, unit shipments of hard drives for notebook computers
    represent a growing share of the total. We entered the 2.5-inch
    mobile market in September 2004. We are now shipping our fifth
    generation of the WD
    Scorpio

®

product family, offering up to 320 GB of capacity. Our product
    expansion, including a recently announced high-performance hard

Research
    and Development

We devote substantial resources to development of new products
    and improvement of existing products. We focus our engineering
    efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing
    processes to bring our products to market in a cost-effective
    and timely manner. Research and development expenses totaled
    $464 million (excluding $49 million of in-process
    research and development acquired in the acquisition of Komag),
    $306 million and $297 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Technology
    and Product Development

Hard drives record, store and retrieve digital data. Performance
    attributes of hard drives, such as their ability to access and
    transmit data and storage capacity, are currently better than
    removable or floppy disks, optical hard drives and tapes, and
    they are more cost effective than semiconductor technology. The
    primary measures of hard drive performance include:

•

“Acoustics” — which is the sound power
    emitted during hard drive operation, commonly expressed in
    decibels, and perceived loudness due to sound pressure, commonly
    expressed in sones.

•

“Data transfer rate” — which is the
    sustained rate of data transfer to and from the disk, commonly
    expressed in megabits per second. One megabit equals one million
    bits.

•

“Seek time” — which is the time needed to
    position the heads over a selected track on the disk surface,
    commonly expressed in milliseconds.

•

“Spindle rotation speed” — which is the
    nominal rotation speed of the disks inside the hard drive,
    commonly expressed in RPM or latency. Spindle rotation speeds
    commonly stated as 5,400, 7,200 and 10,000 RPM are sometimes
    approximations.

•

“Storage capacity” — which is the amount of
    data that can be stored on the hard drive, commonly expressed in
    GB or TB. As defined in the hard drive industry, one GB equals
    one billion bytes and one TB equals one trillion bytes. A byte
    is a digital character, typically comprised of eight bits. A bit
    is a binary digit, the smallest unit of information in a digital
    system.

•

“Power Consumption” — which is the amount of
    electricity required to operate the drive, measured in watts.

All of our hard drive products employ similar technology. The
    main components of the hard drive are a Head-Disk-Assembly
    (“HDA”) and a Printed Circuit Board Assembly
    (“PCBA”). The HDA includes heads, media
    (“disks”), head positioning mechanism
    (“actuator”) and spindle motor. A rigid base and top
    cover contain these components in a contamination-controlled
    environment. The PCBA includes both standard and custom
    integrated circuits, an interface connector to the host computer
    and a power connector.

HDA: One or more disks positioned around a motor-driven spindle
    hub that rotates the disks comprise the disk-pack assembly. The
    disk is made up of a smooth substrate on which thin layers of
    magnetic materials are deposited. The HSA is comprised of a
    magnetic positioner, a pivot-arm module, on which the individual
    heads are mounted. Each disk has a head suspended directly above
    it, which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk.

PCBA: The integrated circuits on the printed circuit board
    typically include a drive interface and a controller. The drive
    interface receives instructions from the host computer, while
    the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and
    controls the heads. The location of data on each disk is
    logically maintained in concentric tracks divided into sectors.
    The host computer sends instructions to the controller to read
    data from or write data to the disks, based on



logical track and sector locations. Guided by instructions from
    the controller, the HSA pivots in an arc, across the disk until
    it reaches the selected track of a disk, where the data is
    recorded or retrieved.

Industry standard interfaces allow the hard drive to communicate
    with the computer. Currently, the primary interfaces for PCs are
    EIDE and SATA, and the primary interfaces for enterprise systems
    are SCSI, SATA, SAS and FCAL. As computer performance continues
    to improve, the hard drive will need to deliver information
    faster. We believe this will continue to drive the PC industry
    transition to higher speed interfaces, such as SATA and SAS, to
    facilitate the higher data transfer rates. We currently offer
    the SATA interface on our WD

The number of disks and each disk’s areal density, which is
    a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the
    recording surface of the disk, determines storage capacity of
    the hard drive. The higher the areal density, the more
    information can be stored on a single platter. Achieving a given
    drive capacity requires fewer disks and heads as the areal
    density increases, potentially reducing product costs over time
    through reduced component requirements. Beginning in June 2007,
    we began shipping 3.5-inch hard drives with 188 GB per platter
    areal density and 2.5-inch hard drives with 125 GB per platter
    areal density. In July 2007, we introduced the WD
    Caviar

®

GreenPower

tm

3.5-inch hard drive which has 250 GB per platter areal density.
    In October 2007, we introduced WD
    Scorpio

®

2.5-inch drives that employ 160 GB per platter technology. In
    January 2008, we began shipping a 3.5-inch hard drive platform
    with 320 GB per platter areal density and in June 2008, we began
    shipping our WD
    Caviar

®

family of drives at 333 GB per platter areal density. In April
    2008, we began shipping WD
    VelociRaptor

tm

hard drives, 2.5-inch 300 GB drives employing the highest
    shipping areal density in the industry at 290 gigabits per
    square inch.

Head technology is one of the key components affecting areal
    density. Historically, there have been rapid technological
    changes resulting in several generations of head technology in a
    relatively short time. However, in recent years the time has
    lengthened between changes in generations of head technology.
    The hard drive industry has essentially transitioned from the
    use of longitudinal magnetic recording (“LMR”) head
    technology for the head writer function to perpendicular
    magnetic recording (“PMR”) technology, which allows
    for significantly higher storage capacities. In addition, the
    industry has made the transition to tunnel-junction magneto
    resistive (“TMR”) technology for the head reader
    function. We have completed the transition to PMR and TMR in our
    2.5-inch products and in the majority of our 3.5-inch products.

With the transition to PMR, media plays a much more important
    role in achieving higher areal density. PMR demands a much
    tighter interaction and matching between head and media designs.
    The acquisition of Komag has enabled us to be vertically
    integrated in the two most important technology components of
    hard drives (heads and media), and has enabled us to achieve a
    more optimum design and utilization of these components.

We invest considerable resources in research and development,
    manufacturing infrastructure and capital equipment of head and
    media components, in order to secure our competitive position
    and cost structure.

The
    WD

®

product line generally leverages a common platform for various
    products within product families with different capacities to
    serve differing market needs. This platform strategy results in
    commonality of components across different products within
    product families and, in some cases, across product families,
    which reduces exposure to changes in demand, facilitates
    inventory management and allows us to achieve lower costs
    through purchasing economies. This platform strategy also
    enables our customers to leverage their qualification efforts
    onto successive product models.

Fiscal 2008 represented the sixth consecutive year of
    substantial growth in our research and development and capital
    spending to support our significant broadening of our product
    and technology portfolios. Over that six-year period, we have
    grown our investment spending 173% from $170 million in
    fiscal 2002 to $464 million in fiscal 2008. As a result of
    this investment activity, we continue to expand our business
    beyond the desktop PC market into newer markets or markets in
    which we have not previously participated. Such investments have
    allowed us to execute against our strategic objective of revenue
    diversification to address the growth of new applications for
    hard drives and fast-growing new market opportunities.

We are currently expanding our existing head wafer fabrication
    facilities in Fremont, California to accommodate our anticipated
    growth. The expansion will involve a process change to utilize

8-inch

wafers from

6-inch

wafers and will cost an estimated $280 million in the
    fiscal 2009 to 2010 timeframe. This will be in addition to our
    ongoing capital expenditures for hard drive and head assembly,
    and our anticipated capital expenditures for media development
    and manufacturing following our planned acquisition of Komag.

    innovations, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Sales and
    Distribution

We sell our products globally to OEMs, ODMs, distributors and
    retailers. OEMs purchase our hard drives, either directly or
    through a contract manufacturer such as an ODM, and assemble
    them into the computer or CE systems they build. Distributors
    typically sell our hard drives to non-direct customers such as
    small computer and CE manufacturers, dealers, systems
    integrators, online retailers and other resellers. Retailers
    typically sell our hard drive products directly to end-users
    through their storefront or online facilities.

Original
    Equipment Manufacturers

Sales to OEMs, which include sales through ODMs, accounted for
    51%, 48% and 54% of our hard drive revenue in 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. During 2008, no single customer accounted
    for 10%, or more, of our revenue. During 2007 and 2006, sales to
    Dell, Inc. accounted for 10% and 12%, respectively, of our
    revenue. We believe that our success depends on our ability to
    maintain and improve our strong relationships with the leading
    OEMs.

OEMs evaluate and select their hard drive suppliers based on a
    number of factors, including quality and reliability, storage
    capacities, performance characteristics, price, service and
    support, ease of doing business, and the supplier’s
    long-term financial stability. They typically seek to qualify
    two or more providers for each generation of hard drives, and
    once an OEM has chosen its qualified hard drive vendors for a
    given product, it generally will purchase hard drives from those
    vendors for the life of that product. To achieve success with
    OEM qualifications, a hard drive supplier must consistently
    offer hard drives featuring leading technology, quality and
    reliability at acceptable capacity per disk. Suppliers must
    quickly achieve volume production of each new generation of high
    quality and reliable hard drives, requiring access to flexible,
    high-capacity, high-quality manufacturing capabilities.

Many of our OEM customers utilize

just-in-time

inventory management processes or supply chain business models
    that combine “build-to-order,” in which they do not
    build until there is a firm order, and “contract
    manufacturing,” in which the OEM contracts assembly work to
    a contract manufacturer, such as an ODM, who purchases
    components and assembles the computer based on the OEM’s
    instructions. For certain OEMs, we maintain a base stock of
    finished goods inventory in facilities located near or adjacent
    to the OEM’s operations.

For an additional discussion of risks related to our need to
    adapt to our customers’ business models and maintain
    customer satisfaction, refer to Item 1A of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Distributors

We use a broad group of distributors to sell our products to
    non-direct customers such as small computer and CE
    manufacturers, dealers, systems integrators, online retailers
    and other resellers. Distributors accounted for approximately
    31%, 36% and 39% of our hard drive revenue for 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Distributors generally enter into
    non-exclusive agreements for specific territories with us for
    the purchase and redistribution of our products in specific
    territories. We grant our distributors limited price protection
    rights.

Retailers

We sell our branded products directly to a select group of major
    retailers such as computer superstores, warehouse clubs, online
    retailers, and computer electronics stores, and authorize sales
    through distributors to smaller retailers. Retailers accounted
    for approximately 18%, 16% and 7% of our hard drive revenue for
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our current retail customer
    base is primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe. The
    retail channel complements our other sales channels while
    helping to build brand awareness for WD and our products.
    Retailers supply end-users with products to upgrade their
    computers and externally store their data for backup or mobility
    purposes. We grant our retailers price protection and limited
    rights to return product on an inventory rotation basis. We also
    sell our branded products through our web site.



Sales and
    Marketing

We maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world
    including the major geographies of the Americas,
    Asia Pacific, Japan, Europe and the Middle East. Our
    international sales, which include sales to foreign subsidiaries
    of U.S. companies but do not include sales to
    U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies, represented 76%,
    68% and 68% of our revenue for 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Sales to international customers may be subject to
    certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations,
    including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations. For
    an additional discussion regarding the risks related to sales to
    international customers, see Item 1A of this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

For additional information concerning revenue recognition, sales
    by geographic region and significant customer information, see
    Part II, Item 8, Notes 1 and 6 in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

We perform our marketing and advertising functions internally
    and through outside firms. We target advertising, worldwide
    packaging and marketing materials to various reseller and
    end-user categories. We utilize both consumer media and trade
    publications. We have programs under which we reimburse
    qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing
    expenditures. We also maintain customer relationships by
    communicating with our resellers and providing end-users with
    information and support through our web site.

Competition

We compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives for use
    in desktop, notebook, enterprise, CE and external storage
    products. Our competitors in the hard drive market include
    ExcelStor Technology, Fujitsu Limited, Hitachi Global Storage
    Technologies, Samsung Electronics Incorporated, Seagate
    Technology and Toshiba Corporation.

The hard drive industry is intensely competitive, with hard
    drive suppliers competing for sales to a limited number of major
    customers. Hard drives manufactured by different competitors are
    highly substitutable due to the industry mandate of technical
    form, fit and function standards. Hard drive manufacturers
    compete on the basis of product quality and reliability, storage
    capacity, unit price, product performance, production volume
    capabilities, delivery capability, leadership in time-to-market,
    time-to-volume and time-to-quality, service and support and ease
    of doing business. The relative importance of these factors
    varies by customer and market. We believe that we are generally
    competitive in all of these factors.

We believe that there are no substantial barriers for existing
    competitors to offer competing products. Therefore, we believe
    that we cannot differentiate
    WD

®

hard drive products solely on attributes such as storage
    capacity, buffer size or time-to-market. Accordingly, we
    differentiate WD by focusing on operational excellence, high
    product quality and reliability, and designing and incorporating
    into our hard drives desirable product performance attributes.
    Such performance attributes include seek times, data transfer
    rates, intelligent caching, failure prediction, remote
    diagnostics, acoustics, error recovery, low operating
    temperature, low power consumption and optimized streaming
    capabilities.

In addition, we differentiate WD by emphasizing non-product
    related attributes, including rapid response to our customers.
    Rapid response requires accelerated design cycles, customer
    delivery, production flexibility and timely service and support,
    which contribute to customer satisfaction. We also rely on the
    strength of the WD brand name with value-added resellers,
    retailers and solution providers to whom we sell our hard drive
    products directly and indirectly. We believe that trust in a
    manufacturer’s reputation, its execution track record and
    the establishment of strategic relationships have become
    important factors in the selection of a hard drive, particularly
    in a rapidly changing technology environment.

Advances in magnetic, optical or other data storage technologies
    could result in competitive products with better performance or
    lower cost per unit of capacity than our products. We monitor
    the advantages, disadvantages and advances of the full array of
    storage technologies on an ongoing basis.

High-speed semiconductor memory competes with hard drive
    products in some applications, such as consumer handheld devices
    and portable external storage. Semiconductor memory is much
    faster in some applications than magnetic hard drives, but
    currently is not competitive in most applications using 3.5-inch
    and 2.5-inch form factor hard drives from a cost standpoint.
    Flash memory, a non-volatile semiconductor memory, is currently
    much more costly and, while it has



higher “read” performance attributes than hard drives,
    it has lower “write” performance attributes. Flash
    memory could become more competitive in the near future for
    additional applications requiring less storage capacity than
    that provided by hard drives. However, we believe that the
    traditional high-volume computing markets will remain the domain
    of 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch hard drives based on the hard drive
    industry’s attributes of reliability, availability and cost.

For an additional discussion of risks related to competition,
    see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Service
    and Warranty

We generally warrant our newly manufactured hard drives against
    defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from
    the date of manufacture depending on the type of product. Our
    warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or
    replacement of the hard drive. We have engaged third parties in
    various countries in multiple regions, including Africa, Asia
    Pacific, Australia, Europe, India, Latin America, the Middle
    East and North America to provide various levels of testing,
    processing

and/or

recertification of returned hard drives for our customers. In
    addition, we process, test and recertify returned hard drives at
    our facility in the United States.

Manufacturing

We believe that we have significant know-how, unique product
    manufacturing processes, execution skills and human resources to
    continue to be successful and have the ability to grow, as
    necessary, our manufacturing operations. To be competitive, we
    must manufacture high quality hard drives with industry leading
    time-to-volume production at competitive unit costs. We strive
    to maintain manufacturing flexibility, high manufacturing
    yields, reliable products, and high-quality components that we
    manufacture ourselves, while insisting that our suppliers
    provide high-quality components at competitive prices. The
    critical elements of our hard drive production are high volume,
    low cost assembly and testing, and establishment and maintenance
    of key supplier relationships. By establishing close
    relationships with our strategic component suppliers, we believe
    we access best-of-class technology and manufacturing quality. In
    addition, we believe that our sourcing strategy currently
    enables us to have the business flexibility needed to select the
    highest quality, low cost of ownership suppliers as product
    designs and technologies evolve.

Hard drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the
    assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and
    thorough testing. The assembly process occurs in a “clean
    room” environment that demands skill in process engineering
    and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs
    of this manufacturing environment. Our clean room manufacturing
    process consists of modular production units, each of which
    contains a number of work cells.

We manufacture hard drives in Malaysia and Thailand. We
    continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to
    increase productivity, sustain and improve quality and decrease
    manufacturing costs. We continually evaluate which steps in the
    manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how
    automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and
    reduce manufacturing costs.

We use our wafer fabrication facilities in Fremont, California
    and our slider fabrication facility in Bang Pa-In, Thailand, to
    design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and
    HGAs we include in the hard drives we manufacture.

We are currently expanding our head wafer fabrication facilities
    in Fremont, California and expect to complete the expansion in
    calendar 2009, which will provide us with adequate wafer
    fabrication capacity for the foreseeable future.

Following our acquisition of Komag, we also have media and
    substrate design and manufacturing facilities in Malaysia. We
    use these facilities to design and manufacture most of the media
    and substrates that we use in our products.

For an additional discussion of risks related to manufacturing,
    see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Materials
    and Supplies

The following products are the major components currently used
    in the manufacture of our hard drives:

•

magnetic heads and media;

•

suspensions with related HGAs and HSAs;



•

spindle motors;

•

custom and standard electronics such as system on chips, memory,
    motor controllers,

pre-amps

and
    printed circuit boards;

•

base and top covers; and

•

magnets and related voice coil motors.

We also use several other components in our hard drives such as
    seals, filters, plastic molded parts, capacitors, resistors,
    connectors and cables.

We design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads,
    media and substrates required for the hard drives we
    manufacture. We purchase a portion of these components from
    third party suppliers.

We acquire all of the remaining components for our products from
    third party suppliers. We generally retain multiple suppliers
    for each of our component requirements but in some instances use
    sole sources for business reasons.

We sole-source some components, such as custom integrated
    circuit devices for certain products from suppliers like Marvell
    Technology, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments. Because of
    their custom nature, these products require significant
    design-in periods and long lead times. There has been a trend in
    integrated circuit design toward increased integration of
    various separate circuits and we expect this trend to continue
    in custom integrated circuits for hard drives.

For an additional discussion of risks related to our component
    supplies, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Backlog

Historically, a substantial portion of our orders have been for
    shipments of hard drives within 30 to 60 days of the
    placement of the order. We generally negotiate pricing, order
    lead times, product support requirements and other terms and
    conditions before receiving a customer’s first purchase
    order for a product. Customers’ purchase orders typically
    may be canceled with relatively short notice to us, with little
    or no cost to the customer, or modified by customers to provide
    for delivery at a later date. In addition, we make many of our
    sales to OEMs under

just-in-time

delivery contracts that do not generally require firm order
    commitments by the customer until the time of sale. Instead, we
    receive a periodic forecast of requirements from the customer
    and invoice the customer upon shipment of the product from the

just-in-time

warehouse. Therefore, backlog information as of the end of a
    particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels
    of our revenue and profit and may not be comparable to earlier
    periods.

Patents,
    Licenses and Proprietary Information

We own numerous patents and have many patent applications in
    process. We believe that, although our patents and patent
    applications have considerable value, the successful
    manufacturing and marketing of our products depends primarily
    upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff.
    Accordingly, the patents held and applied for do not ensure our
    future success.

In addition to patent protection of certain intellectual
    property rights, we consider elements of our product designs and
    processes to be proprietary and confidential. We believe that
    our non-patented intellectual property, particularly some of our
    process technology, is an important factor in our success. We
    rely upon non-disclosure agreements and contractual provisions
    and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary
    information. Despite these safeguards, there is a risk that
    competitors may obtain and use such information. The laws of
    foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide
    less protection for confidential information than the United
    States.

We rely on certain technology that we license from other parties
    to manufacture and sell WD products. We believe that we have
    adequate cross-licenses and other agreements in place in
    addition to our own intellectual property portfolio to compete
    successfully in the hard drive industry. For additional
    discussion of risks related to our ownership and use of
    intellectual property, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



Environmental
    Regulation

We are subject to a variety of regulations in connection with
    our operations. We believe that we have obtained or are in the
    process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our
    operations. For additional discussion of risks related to
    environmental regulation, see Item 1A of this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

Employees

As of June 27, 2008, we employed a total of
    50,072 employees worldwide. This represents an increase in
    headcount of approximately 69% since June 29, 2007 and an
    increase of approximately 102% since June 30, 2006. Many of
    our employees are highly skilled, and our continued success
    depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such
    employees. Accordingly, we offer employee benefit programs,
    which we believe are, in the aggregate, competitive with those
    offered by our competitors. We and most of our competitors
    nevertheless have difficulty at times hiring and retaining
    certain skilled employees. We have engaged consultants and
    contract personnel to fill these needs until full-time employees
    could be recruited. We consider our employee relations to be
    good. For additional discussion of risks related to our skilled
    employees, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Declines
    in average selling prices (“ASPs”) in the hard drive
    industry could adversely affect our operating results.

The hard drive industry historically has experienced declining
    ASPs. Our ASPs tend to decline when competitors lower prices as
    a result of decreased costs or to absorb excess capacity,
    liquidate excess inventories, restructure or attempt to gain
    market share. Our ASPs also decline when there is a shift in the
    mix of product sales, and sales of lower priced products
    increase relative to those of higher priced products. When ASPs
    in the hard drive industry decline, our ASPs are also likely to
    decline, which adversely affects our operating results.

If we
    fail to anticipate or timely respond to changes in the markets
    for hard drives, our operating results could be adversely
    affected.

Over the past few years the consumer market for computers has
    shifted significantly towards lower priced systems. If we are
    not able to continue to offer a competitively priced hard drive
    for the low-cost PC market, our share of that market will likely
    fall, which could harm our operating results.

The market for hard drives is also fragmenting into a variety of
    devices and products. Many industry analysts expect, as do we,
    that, as content increasingly converts to digital technology
    from the older, analog technology, the technology of computers
    and consumer electronics will continue to converge, and hard
    drives will be found in many CE products other than computers.
    In addition, we expect that the consumer market for multi-media
    applications, including audio-video products, incorporating high
    capacity, and handheld consumer storage will continue to grow.
    However, because this market remains relatively new, accurate
    forecasts for future growth remain challenging.

Moreover, some devices, such as personal video recorders and
    digital video recorders, or some new PC operating systems which
    allow greater consumer choice in levels of functionality,
    therefore allowing for greater market differentiation, may
    require attributes not currently offered in our products,
    resulting in a need to develop new interfaces, form factors,
    technical specifications or hard drive features, increasing our
    overall operational expense without corresponding incremental
    revenue at this stage. If we are not successful in continuing to
    deploy our hard drive technology and expertise to develop new
    products for the emerging CE market, or if we are required to
    incur significant costs in developing such products, it may harm
    our operating results.

Our
    prices and margins are subject to declines due to unpredictable
    end-user demand and oversupply of hard drives.

Demand for our hard drives depends on the demand for systems
    manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to
    existing systems. The demand for systems has been volatile in
    the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand
    for hard drives in any given period. As a result, the hard drive
    market has experienced periods of excess capacity which can lead
    to liquidation of excess inventories and intense price
    competition. If intense price competition occurs, we may be
    forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected, which
    could result in lower revenue and gross margins.

Our
    failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for
    our products could adversely affect our business and financial
    results.

The hard drive industry faces difficulties in accurately
    forecasting market and customer demand for its products. The
    variety and volume of products we manufacture is based in part
    on these forecasts. If our forecasts exceed actual market
    demand, or if market demand decreases significantly from our
    forecasts, then we could experience periods of product
    oversupply and price decreases, which could impact our financial
    performance. If our forecasts do not meet actual market demand,
    or if market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts
    or beyond our ability to add



manufacturing capacity, then we may not be able to satisfy
    customer product needs, which could result in a loss of market
    share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands.

We also use forecasts in making decisions regarding investment
    of our resources. For example, as the hard drive industry
    transitions from the Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment
    (“PATA”) interface to the SATA interface, we may
    invest more resources in the development of products using the
    SATA interface. If our forecasts regarding the replacement of
    the PATA interface with the SATA interface are inaccurate, we
    may not have products available to meet our customers’
    needs.

In addition, although we receive forecasts from our customers,
    they are not generally obligated to purchase the forecasted
    amounts. In particular, sales volumes in the distribution and
    retail channels are volatile and harder to predict than sales to
    our OEM or ODM customers. We consider these forecasts in
    determining our component needs and our inventory requirements.
    If we fail to accurately forecast our customers’ product
    demands, we may have inadequate or excess inventory of our
    products or components, which could adversely affect our
    operating results.

Increases
    in areal density may outpace customers’ demand for storage
    capacity, which may lower the prices our customers are willing
    to pay for new products.

Historically, the industry has experienced periods of variable
    areal density growth rates. When the rate of areal density
    growth increases, the rate of increase may exceed the increase
    in our customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity.
    Furthermore, our customers’ demand for storage capacity may
    not continue to grow at current industry estimates as a result
    of developments in the regulation and enforcement of digital
    rights management or otherwise. These factors could lead to our
    customers’ storage capacity needs being satisfied with
    lower capacity hard drives at lower prices, thereby decreasing
    our revenue. As a result, even with increasing aggregate demand
    for storage capacity, our ASPs could decline, which could
    adversely affect our operating results.

Expansion
    into new hard drive markets may cause our capital expenditures
    to increase and if we do not successfully expand into new
    markets, our business may suffer.

To remain a significant supplier of hard drives, we will need to
    offer a broad range of hard drive products to our customers. We
    currently offer a variety of 3.5-inch hard drives for the
    desktop, enterprise, CE and external storage markets, and we
    also offer 2.5-inch form factor hard drives for the mobile, CE
    and external storage markets. However, demand for hard drives
    may shift to products in form factors or with interfaces that
    our competitors offer but which we do not. Expansion into other
    hard drive markets and resulting increases in manufacturing
    capacity requirements may require us to make substantial
    additional investments due in part because our operations are
    largely vertically integrated. If we fail to successfully expand
    into new hard drive markets with products that we do not
    currently offer, we may lose business to our competitors who
    offer these products.

If we
    fail to successfully manage our new product development or new
    market expansion, or if we fail to anticipate the issues
    associated with such development or expansion, our business may
    suffer.

While we continue to develop new products and look to expand
    into other hard drive markets, the success of our new product
    introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including our
    ability to anticipate and manage a variety of issues associated
    with these new products and new markets, such as:

•

difficulties faced in manufacturing ramp;

•

market acceptance;

•

effective management of inventory levels in line with
    anticipated product demand; and

•

quality problems or other defects in the early stages of new
    product introduction that were not anticipated in the design of
    those products.



Further, we need to identify how any of the hard drive markets
    into which we are expanding may have different characteristics
    from the markets in which we currently exist and properly
    address these differences. These characteristics may include:

•

demand volume growth rates;

•

demand seasonality;

•

product generation development rates;

•

customer concentrations;

•

warranty expectations and product return policies; and

•

cost, performance and compatibility requirements.

Our business may suffer if we fail to successfully anticipate
    and manage these issues associated with our product development
    and market expansion. For example, our branded products are
    designed to attach to and interoperate with a wide variety of PC
    and CE devices and therefore their functionality is reliant on
    the manufacturer of such devices, or the associated operating
    systems, enabling the manufacturer’s devices to operate
    with our branded products. If our branded products are not
    compatible with a wide variety of devices, or if device
    manufacturers design their devices so that our branded products
    cannot operate with them, and we cannot quickly and efficiently
    adapt our branded products to address these compatibility
    issues, our business could suffer.

Expanding
    into new hard drive markets exposes our business to different
    seasonal demand cycles, which in turn could adversely affect our
    operating results.

The CE and retail markets have different seasonal pricing and
    volume demand cycles as compared to the PC market. By expanding
    into these markets, we became exposed to seasonal fluctuations
    that are different from, and in addition to, those of the PC
    market. For example, because the primary customer for products
    such as our branded products are individual consumers, these
    markets experience a dramatic increase in demand during the
    winter holiday season. If we do not properly adjust our supply
    to new demand cycles such as this, we risk having excess
    inventory during periods of low demand and insufficient
    inventory during periods of high demand, therefore adversely
    affecting our operating results.

If we do
    not predict the size and demands of the market for 2.5-inch hard
    drives, our business may suffer.

To continue to increase the sale of our 2.5-inch hard drives in
    the mobile market, we must predict and successfully adapt to the
    differences between the desktop and mobile markets, such as
    different requirements, features and competitors. If we do not
    predict the size and demands of the markets for 2.5-inch hard
    drives, including the mobile market, our business may suffer.
    For example, if a market that traditionally has used 3.5-inch
    hard drives, such as the desktop PC market, shifts its volume
    demand to 2.5-inch hard drives at a faster rate than we
    anticipate, our ability to meet the demands of such market, as
    well as the mobile market, may be impaired, which may cause our
    business to suffer.

Selling
    to the retail market has become an important part of our
    business, and if we fail to maintain and grow our market share
    or gain market acceptance of our branded products, our operating
    results could suffer.

We sell our branded products directly to a select group of major
    retailers, for example, computer superstores and CE stores, and
    authorize sales through distributors to other retailers and
    online resellers. Our current retail customer base is primarily
    in the United States, Canada and Europe. We are facing increased
    competition from other companies for shelf space at a small
    number of major retailers that have strong buying power and
    pricing leverage. If we fail to successfully maintain a customer
    preference for
    WD

®

brand
    products or fail to successfully expand into multiple channels,
    our operating results may be adversely affected. We face strong
    competition in maintaining and trying to grow our market share
    in the retail market, particularly because of the relatively low
    barriers to entry in this market. For example, several
    additional hard drive manufacturers have recently disclosed
    plans to expand into the external storage market and as these
    companies attempt to gain market share, we may have difficulty
    in maintaining or growing our market share and there may be
    increased downward pressure on pricing. We will continue to
    introduce new products in the retail market that incorporate our
    disk drives; however, there can be no assurance that these
    products will gain market acceptance, and if they do not, our
    operating results could suffer.



Loss of
    market share with or by a key customer could harm our operating
    results.

During the year ended June 27, 2008, a large percentage of
    our revenue came from sales to our top 10 customers, which
    accounted for 47% of our revenue. These customers have a variety
    of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial
    demands on us, including demands on product pricing and on
    contractual terms, which often results in the allocation of risk
    to us as the supplier. Even if we successfully qualify a product
    with a customer, the customer generally is not obligated to
    purchase any minimum volume of products from us and may be able
    to cancel an order or terminate its relationship with us at any
    time. Our ability to maintain strong relationships with our
    principal customers is essential to our future performance. If
    we lose a key customer, if any of our key customers reduce their
    orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before
    we are able to reduce costs, if a customer is acquired by one of
    our competitors or if a key customer suffers financial hardship,
    our operating results would likely be harmed. In addition, if
    customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that
    our gross margins are diminished, we could decide not to sell
    our products to a particular customer, which could result in a
    decrease in our revenue.

Current
    or future competitors may gain a technology advantage or develop
    an advantageous cost structure that we cannot match.

It may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain
    an advantage in product technology, manufacturing technology, or
    process technology, which may allow them to offer products or
    services that have a significant advantage over the products and
    services that we offer. Advantages could be in capacity,
    performance, reliability, serviceability, or other attributes.

Higher capacity storage needs have typically been better served
    by magnetic hard drives than flash memory as hard drive
    manufacturers can offer better value at high capacities, while
    lower capacity needs have been successfully served by solid
    state storage such as flash memory technology. Advances in
    magnetic, optical, semiconductor or other data storage
    technologies could result in competitive products that have
    better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our
    products. If we fail to be cost competitive against flash
    memory, we could be at a competitive disadvantage to companies
    using semiconductor technology.

Further
    industry consolidation could provide competitive advantages to
    our competitors.

The hard drive industry has experienced consolidation over the
    past several years. Consolidation by our competitors may enhance
    their capacity, abilities and resources and lower their cost
    structure, causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage.
    Additionally, continued industry consolidation may lead to
    uncertainty in areas such as component availability, which could
    negatively impact our cost structure.

Sales in
    the distribution channel are important to our business, and if
    we fail to maintain brand preference with our distributors or if
    distribution markets for hard drives weaken, our operating
    results could suffer.

Our distribution customers typically sell to small computer
    manufacturers, dealers, systems integrators and other resellers.
    We face significant competition in this channel as a result of
    limited product qualification programs and a significant focus
    on price and availability of product. If we fail to remain
    competitive in terms of our technology, quality, service and
    support, our distribution customers may favor our competitors,
    and our operating results could suffer. We also face significant
    risk in the distribution market for hard drives. If the
    distribution market weakens as a result of a slowing PC growth
    rate, technology transitions or a significant change in consumer
    buying preference from white box to branded PCs, or we
    experience significant price declines due to oversupply in the
    distribution channel, then our operating results would be
    adversely affected.

The hard
    drive industry is highly competitive and can be characterized by
    significant shifts in market share among the major
    competitors.

The price of hard drives has fallen over time due to increases
    in supply, cost reductions, technological advances and price
    reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess
    inventories or attempting to gain market share. In addition,
    rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and
    profitability of sales of existing products and increase the
    risk of inventory obsolescence. We also face competition from
    other companies that produce alternative storage technologies
    like flash memory. These factors, taken together, may result in
    significant shifts in market share among the industry’s
    major participants. In addition, product recalls can lead to a
    loss of market share, which could adversely affect our operating
    results.



Some of
    our competitors with diversified business units outside the hard
    drive industry periodically sell hard drives at prices that we
    cannot profitably match.

Some of our competitors earn a significant portion of their
    revenue from business units outside the hard drive industry.
    Because they do not depend solely on sales of hard drives to
    achieve profitability, they periodically sell hard drives at
    lower prices and operate their hard drive business unit at a
    loss while still remaining profitable overall. In addition, if
    these competitors can increase sales of non-hard drive products
    to the same customers, they may benefit from selling their hard
    drives at low prices. Our operating results may be adversely
    affected if we cannot successfully compete with the pricing by
    these companies.

If we
    fail to qualify our products with our customers, they may not
    purchase any units of a particular product line, which would
    have a significant adverse impact on our sales.

We regularly engage in new product qualification with our
    customers. Once a product is accepted for qualification testing,
    failures or delays in the qualification process can result in
    our losing sales to that customer until the next generation of
    products is introduced. The effect of missing a product
    qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of
    high volume OEMs, which continue to consolidate their share of
    the PC and CE markets. If product life cycles lengthen, we may
    have a significantly longer period to wait before we have an
    opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer, which
    could harm our competitive position. These risks are increased
    because we expect cost improvements and competitive pressures to
    result in declining gross margins on our current generation
    products.

We are
    subject to risks related to product defects, which could result
    in product recalls and could subject us to warranty claims in
    excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than
    anticipated due to the unenforceability of liability
    limitations.

We warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to
    five years. We test our hard drives in our manufacturing
    facilities through a variety of means. However, there can be no
    assurance that our testing will reveal latent defects in our
    products, which may not become apparent until after the products
    have been sold into the market. Accordingly, there is a risk
    that product defects will occur, which could require a product
    recall. Product recalls can be expensive to implement and, if a
    product recall occurs during the product’s warranty period,
    we may be required to replace the defective product. In
    addition, a product recall may damage our relationship with our
    customers, and we may lose market share with our customers,
    including our OEM and ODM customers.

Our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions
    of liability for consequential damages and for misuse, improper
    installation, alteration, accident or mishandling while in the
    possession of someone other than us. We record an accrual for
    estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. We
    may incur additional operating expenses if our warranty
    provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues
    related to defects in our products. If these additional expenses
    are significant, it could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and operating results.

A low
    cost structure is critical to our operating results and
    increased costs may adversely affect our operating
    margin.

A low cost structure for our products, including critical
    components, labor and overhead, is critical to the success of
    our business, and our operating results depend on our ability to
    maintain competitive cost structures on new and established
    products. If our competitors are able to achieve a lower cost
    structure for manufacturing hard drives, and we are unable to
    match their cost structure, we could be at a competitive
    disadvantage to those competitors.

Shortages
    of commodity materials, price volatility, or use by other
    industries of materials used in the hard drive industry, may
    increase our cost structure.

There are costs for certain commodity materials, an increase of
    which increases our costs of manufacturing and transporting hard
    drives and key components. Shortages of materials such as
    stainless steel, aluminum, nickel, neodymium, ruthenium or
    platinum increase our costs and may result in lower operating
    margins if we are unable to find ways to mitigate these
    increased costs. For example, in advance of the 2008 Beijing
    Summer Olympics, in seeking to minimize pollution, the
    People’s Republic of China shut down factories within a
    specified radius of Beijing. These factory shut-downs may cause
    a future shortage in materials we use in nickel plating of
    magnetic media, causing prices to increase and adversely
    affecting our nickel plating costs. Additionally, perpendicular
    recording technology requires increased usage of precious metals
    such as ruthenium and platinum, the price of which may continue
    to be volatile, which



could adversely affect our operating margins. Furthermore, if
    other high volume industries increase their demand for materials
    such as these, our costs may further increase which could have
    an adverse effect on our operating margins. The volatility in
    the cost of oil also affects our transportation costs and may
    result in lower operating margins if we are unable to pass these
    increased costs through to our customers.

If we
    fail to maintain effective relationships with our major
    component suppliers, our supply of critical components may be at
    risk and our profitability could suffer.

We make most of our own heads and media for some of our product
    families; however, we do not manufacture many of the component
    parts used in our hard drives. As a result, the success of our
    products depends on our ability to gain access to and integrate
    parts that are “best in class” from reliable component
    suppliers. To do so, we must effectively manage our
    relationships with our major component suppliers. We must also
    effectively integrate different products from a variety of
    suppliers, each of which employs variations on technology, which
    can impact, for example, feasible combinations of heads and
    media components. In August 2003, we settled litigation with a
    supplier who previously was the sole source of read channel
    devices for our hard drives. As a result of the disputes that
    gave rise to the litigation, our profitability was at risk until
    another supplier’s read channel devices could be designed
    into our products. Similar disputes with other strategic
    component suppliers could adversely affect our operating results.

Violation
    of labor or environmental laws and practices by our suppliers or
    sub-suppliers could harm our business.

We expect our suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable
    laws and regulations, including labor and environmental laws,
    and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of
    conduct. While our internal operating guidelines promote ethical
    business practices, we do not control our suppliers or
    sub-suppliers or their labor or environmental practices. The
    violation of labor, environmental or other laws by any of our
    suppliers or sub-suppliers, or divergence of a supplier’s
    or sub-supplier’s labor or environmental practices from
    those generally accepted as ethical in the U.S., could harm our
    business by:

•

interrupting or otherwise disrupting the shipment of our product
    components;

•

damaging our reputation;

•

forcing us to find alternate component sources;

•

reducing demand for our products (for example, through a
    consumer boycott); or

•

exposing us to potential liability for our supplier’s or
    sub-supplier’s wrongdoings.

Dependence
    on a limited number of qualified suppliers of components and
    manufacturing equipment could lead to delays, lost revenue or
    increased costs.

Certain components are available from a limited number of
    suppliers, and we are sole sourced with some of these suppliers
    on certain products. Because we depend on a limited number of
    suppliers for certain hard drive components and manufacturing
    equipment, each of the following could significantly harm our
    operating results:

•

an increase in the cost of such components or equipment;

•

an extended shortage of required components or equipment;

•

consolidation of key suppliers, such as the acquisition of
    Brilliant Manufacturing Limited by Nidec Corporation, the
    acquisition of Agere Systems Inc. by LSI Corporation, the
    acquisition of Infineon Technologies’ hard drive
    semiconductor business by LSI Corporation, the acquisition of
    Alps Electric Co. Ltd.’s magnetic device division’s
    assets and related intellectual property by TDK Corp, and the
    acquisition of Magnecomp Precision Technology Public Company
    Limited by TDK Corp;

•

failure of a key supplier’s business process; or

•

failure of key suppliers to remain in business, to remain
    independent merchant suppliers, to adjust to market conditions,
    or to meet our quality, yield or production requirements.



If
    components and equipment that we use are available from only a
    limited number of suppliers or are in short supply, it may
    negatively impact our production and cause us to lose
    revenue.

Our future operating results may also depend substantially on
    our suppliers’ ability to timely qualify their components
    in our programs, and their ability to supply us with these
    components in sufficient volumes to meet our production
    requirements. A number of the components that we use are
    available from only a single or limited number of qualified
    outside suppliers, and may be used across multiple product
    lines. In addition, some of the components (or component types)
    used in our products are used in other devices, such as mobile
    telephones and digital cameras. If there is a significant
    simultaneous upswing in demand for such a component (or
    component type) from several high volume industries, resulting
    in a supply reduction, or a component is otherwise in short
    supply, or if a supplier fails to qualify or has a quality issue
    with a component, we may experience delays or increased costs in
    obtaining that component. If we are unable to obtain sufficient
    quantities of materials used in the manufacture of magnetic
    components, or other necessary components, we may experience
    production delays which could cause us loss of revenue. If a
    component becomes unavailable, we could suffer significant loss
    of revenue.

In addition, certain equipment we use in our manufacturing or
    testing processes is available only from a limited number of
    suppliers. Some of this equipment uses materials that at times
    could be in short supply. If these materials are not available,
    or are not available in the quantities we require for our
    manufacturing and testing processes, our ability to manufacture
    our products could be impacted, and we could suffer significant
    loss of revenue.

Contractual
    commitments with component suppliers may result in us paying
    increased charges and cash advances for such
    components.

To reduce the risk of component shortages, we attempt to provide
    significant lead times when buying components. As a result, we
    may be subject to cancellation charges if we cancel orders,
    which may occur when we make technology transitions or when our
    component needs change. In addition, we have entered into
    contractual commitments with component suppliers and may enter
    into contractual commitments with other component suppliers, in
    an effort to increase and stabilize the supply of those
    components, and enable us to purchase such components at
    favorable prices. Some of these commitments require or may
    require us to buy a substantial number of components from the
    supplier or make significant cash advances to the supplier;
    however, these commitments may not result in a satisfactory
    increase or stabilization of the supply of such components.

Failure
    by certain suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and
    manufacture components for our products may adversely affect our
    operations.

We rely on suppliers for various component parts that we
    integrate into our hard drives but do not manufacture ourselves,
    such as semiconductors, motors, flex circuits and suspensions.
    Some of these components must be specifically designed to be
    compatible for use in our products, and are only available from
    a limited number of suppliers with whom we are sole sourced for
    certain products. We are therefore dependent on the suppliers of
    these various components to be able and willing to dedicate
    adequate engineering resources to develop technology that can be
    successfully integrated with our products, and to manufacture
    these components efficiently. The failure of component suppliers
    to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture
    technology that can be integrated into our products may cause us
    to experience inability or delay in our manufacturing and
    shipment of hard drive products, or our expansion into new
    technology and markets, therefore adversely affecting our
    business and financial results.

There are
    certain additional capital expenditure costs and asset
    utilization risks to our business associated with our strategy
    to vertically integrate our operations.

Our vertical integration of head and media manufacturing
    resulted in a fundamental change in our operating structure, as
    we now manufacture heads and media for use in many of the hard
    drives we manufacture. Consequently, we make more capital
    investments than we would if we were not vertically integrated
    and carry a higher percentage of fixed costs than assumed in our
    prior financial business model. If the overall level of
    production decreases for any reason, and we are unable to reduce
    our fixed costs to match sales, our head or media manufacturing
    assets may face under-utilization that may impact our operating
    results. We are therefore subject to additional risks related to
    overall asset utilization,



including the need to operate at high levels of utilization to
    drive competitive costs and the need for assured supply of
    components that we do not manufacture ourselves.

In addition, we may incur additional risks, including:

•

failure to continue to leverage the integration of our media
    technology with our head technology;

•

insufficient third party sources to satisfy our needs if we are
    unable to manufacture a sufficient supply of heads or media;

•

third party head or media suppliers may not continue to do
    business with us or may not do business with us on the same
    terms and conditions we have previously enjoyed;

•

claims that our manufacturing of heads or media may infringe
    certain intellectual property rights of other companies; and

•

difficulties locating in a timely manner suitable manufacturing
    equipment for our head or media manufacturing processes and
    replacement parts for such equipment.

If we do not adequately address the challenges related to our
    head or media manufacturing operations, our ongoing operations
    could be disrupted, resulting in a decrease in our revenue or
    profit margins and negatively impacting our operating results.

If we are
    unable to timely and cost-effectively develop heads and media
    with leading technology and overall quality, our ability to sell
    our products may be significantly diminished, which could
    materially and adversely affect our business and financial
    results.

Under our business plan, we are developing and manufacturing a
    substantial portion of the heads and media used in some of the
    hard drive products we manufacture. Consequently, we are more
    dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and
    less able to take advantage of head and media technologies
    developed by other manufacturers. Technology transition for head
    and media designs is critical to increasing our volume
    production of heads and media. There can be no assurance,
    however, that we will be successful in timely and
    cost-effectively developing and manufacturing heads or media for
    products using future technologies. We also may not effectively
    transition our head or media design and technology to achieve
    acceptable manufacturing yields using the technologies necessary
    to satisfy our customers’ product needs, or we may
    encounter quality problems with the heads or media we
    manufacture. In addition, we may not have access to external
    sources of supply without incurring substantial costs which
    would negatively impact our business and financial results.

Changes
    in product life cycles could adversely affect our financial
    results.

If product life cycles lengthen, we may need to develop new
    technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any particular
    product to maintain competitive pricing for that product. If
    product life cycles shorten, it may result in an increase in our
    overall expenses and a decrease in our gross margins, both of
    which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition,
    shortening of product life cycles also make it more difficult to
    recover the cost of product development before the product
    becomes obsolete. Our failure to recover the cost of product
    development in the future could adversely affect our operating
    results.

If we
    fail to make the technical innovations necessary to continue to
    increase areal density, we may fail to remain
    competitive.

New products in the hard drive market typically require higher
    areal densities than previous product generations, posing
    formidable technical and manufacturing challenges. Higher areal
    densities require existing head and media technology to be
    improved or new technology developed to accommodate more data on
    a single disk. In addition, our introduction of new products
    during a technology transition increases the likelihood of
    unexpected quality concerns. Our failure to bring high quality
    new products to market on time and at acceptable costs may put
    us at a competitive disadvantage to companies that achieve these
    results.



A
    fundamental change in recording technology could result in
    significant increases in our operating expenses and could put us
    at a competitive disadvantage.

Historically, when the industry experiences a fundamental change
    in technology, any manufacturer that fails to successfully and
    timely adjust its designs and processes to accommodate the new
    technology fails to remain competitive. There are some
    technologies, such as current-perpendicular-to-plane
    (“CPP”) and heat assisted magnetic recording
    (“HAMR”), discrete track recording (“DTR”)
    and other similar potentially break through technology, that
    will represent revolutionary recording technologies if they can
    be implemented by a competitor on a commercially viable basis
    ahead of the industry, which could put us at a competitive
    disadvantage. As a result of these technology shifts, we could
    incur substantial costs in developing new technologies, such as
    heads, media, and tools to remain competitive. If we fail to
    successfully implement these new technologies, or if we are
    significantly slower than our competitors at implementing new
    technologies, we may not be able to offer products with
    capacities that our customers desire. For example, new recording
    technology requires changes in the manufacturing process of
    heads and media, which may cause longer production times and
    reduce the overall availability of media in the industry.
    Additionally, the new technology requires a greater degree of
    integration between heads and media which may lengthen our time
    of development of hard drives using this technology.
    Furthermore, as we attempt to develop and implement new
    technologies, we may become more dependent on suppliers to
    ensure our access to components that accommodate the new
    technology. These results would increase our operating costs,
    which may negatively impact our operating results.

The
    difficulty of introducing hard drives with higher levels of
    areal density and the challenges of reducing other costs may
    impact our ability to achieve historical levels of cost
    reduction.

Storage capacity of the hard drive, as manufactured by us, is
    determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal
    density. Areal density is a measure of the amount of magnetic
    bits that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk.
    Generally, the higher the areal density, the more information
    can be stored on a single platter. Historically, we have been
    able to achieve a large percentage of cost reduction through
    increases in areal density. Increases in areal density mean that
    the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same
    capacity and, therefore, may result in a lower component cost.
    However, because increasing areal density has become more
    difficult in the hard drive industry, such increases may require
    increases in component costs, and other opportunities to reduce
    costs may not continue at historical rates. Additionally,
    increases in areal density may require us to make further
    capital expenditures on items such as new testing equipment
    needed as a result of an increased number of GB per platter. Our
    inability to achieve cost reductions could adversely affect our
    operating results.

If we do
    not properly manage the technology transitions of our products,
    our operating results may be negatively affected.

Many of the markets in which we offer our products are
    undergoing technology transitions. For example, in order to
    handle higher data transfer rates, the PC and enterprise markets
    are transitioning from parallel interfaces, such as PATA and
    SCSI, to serial interfaces, such as SATA and SAS, respectively.
    We must effectively manage the transition of the features of our
    products to serial interfaces in order to remain competitive and
    cost effective. In the PC market, we currently offer PATA and
    SATA products and must timely and efficiently manage both our
    manufacture of PATA products through their end of life and our
    ramp of SATA products and features. If we fail to successfully
    manage the transition from parallel interfaces to serial
    interfaces, our operating results may suffer.

Our
    high-volume hard drive and media manufacturing facilities, and
    the manufacturing facilities of many of our suppliers, are
    concentrated in Asia, which subjects us to the risk of damage or
    loss of any of these facilities and localized risks to employees
    in these locations.

Our high-volume hard drive and media manufacturing facilities
    are in Malaysia and Thailand and the manufacturing facilities of
    many of our suppliers are in Asia. A condition or event such as
    political instability, civil unrest or a power outage, or a
    fire, flood, earthquake or other disaster that adversely affects
    any of these facilities or our ability to manufacture could
    limit the total volume of hard drives we are able to manufacture
    and result in a loss of sales and revenue and harm our operating
    results. Similarly, a localized health risk affecting our
    employees or the staff of our suppliers, such as a new pandemic
    influenza in Asia, could impair the total volume of hard drives
    that we are able to manufacture.



Our head
    manufacturing operations include a single wafer fabrication
    facility in California and a single head gimbal assembly
    facility in Thailand, and our media operations include four
    facilities in Malaysia, which subjects us to substantial risk of
    damage or loss if operations at any of these facilities are
    disrupted.

As we have previously discussed in public statements, our
    business plan presently contemplates that we will design and
    manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and media
    required for the hard drives we manufacture. We fabricate wafers
    in our Fremont, California facility, and the wafers are then
    sent to our Thailand facility for slider fabrication and wafer
    slicing and HGA assembly and testing. Additionally, we
    manufacture the majority of our media and substrates in four
    facilities in Penang, Johor and Sarawak, Malaysia. A fire,
    flood, earthquake or other disaster, condition or event such as
    a power outage that adversely affects any of these facilities
    would significantly affect supply of our heads or media, and
    limit our ability to manufacture hard drives which would result
    in a substantial loss of sales and revenue and a substantial
    harm to our operating results.

Our
    operating results will be adversely affected if we fail to
    optimize the overall quality, time-to-market and time-to-volume
    of new and established products.

To achieve consistent success with our customers, we must
    balance several key attributes such as time-to-market,
    time-to-volume, quality, cost, service, price and a broad
    product portfolio. Our operating results will be adversely
    affected if we fail to:

•

maintain overall quality of products in new and established
    programs;

•

produce sufficient quantities of products at the capacities our
    customers demand while managing the integration of new and
    established technologies;

•

develop and qualify new products that have changes in overall
    specifications or features that our customers may require for
    their business needs;

•

obtain commitments from our customers to qualify new products,
    redesigns of current products, or new components in our existing
    products;

•

obtain customer qualification of these products on a timely
    basis by meeting all of our customers’ needs for
    performance, quality and features;

•

maintain an adequate supply of components required to
    manufacture our products; or

•

maintain the manufacturing capability to quickly change our
    product mix between different capacities, form factors and spin
    speeds in response to changes in customers’ product demands.

Manufacturing
    and marketing our products abroad subjects us to numerous
    risks.

We are subject to risks associated with our foreign
    manufacturing operations and foreign marketing efforts,
    including:

•

obtaining requisite U.S. and foreign governmental permits
    and approvals;

•

currency exchange rate fluctuations or restrictions;

•

political instability and civil unrest;

•

limited transportation availability, delays, and extended time
    required for shipping, which risks may be compounded in periods
    of price declines;

•

higher freight rates;

•

labor problems;

•

trade restrictions or higher tariffs;

•

copyright levies or similar fees imposed in European and other
    countries:

•

exchange, currency and tax controls and reallocations;



•

increasing labor and overhead costs; and

•

loss or non-renewal of favorable tax treatment under agreements
    or treaties with foreign tax authorities.

Terrorist
    attacks may adversely affect our business and operating
    results.

The continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war
    or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial and
    insurance markets and have significantly increased the
    political, economic and social instability in some of the
    geographic areas in which we operate. Additionally, it is
    uncertain what impact the reactions to such acts by various
    governmental agencies and security regulators worldwide will
    have on shipping costs. Acts of terrorism, either domestically
    or abroad, could create further uncertainties and instability.
    To the extent this results in disruption or delays of our
    manufacturing capabilities or shipments of our products, our
    business, operating results and financial condition could be
    adversely affected.

Sudden
    disruptions to the availability of freight lanes could have an
    impact on our operations.

We ship the majority of our products to our various customers
    via air freight. The sudden unavailability of air cargo
    operations used to ship our products would impair our ability to
    deliver our products in a timely and efficient manner, which
    could adversely impact our operating results. We also ship a
    portion of our product via ocean freight, and events or
    conditions at shipping ports, such as labor difficulties or
    disputes, could also impact our operating results by impairing
    our ability to timely and efficiently deliver these products.

We are
    vulnerable to system failures, which could harm our
    business.

We are heavily dependent on our technology infrastructure, among
    other functions, to operate our factories, sell our products,
    fulfill orders, manage inventory and bill, collect and make
    payments. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption
    from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures,
    computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and other
    events. Our business is also subject to break-ins, sabotage and
    intentional acts of vandalism by third parties as well as
    employees. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems
    could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our
    business, which could harm our reputation and financial
    condition.

We may be
    unable to retain our key staff and skilled employees.

Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key
    staff and skilled employees, many of whom would be extremely
    difficult to replace. Worldwide competition for skilled
    employees in the hard drive industry is intense. Volatility or
    lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely
    affect our ability to retain key staff or skilled employees who
    have received equity compensation. If we are unable to retain
    our existing key staff or skilled employees, or hire and
    integrate new key staff or skilled employees, or if we fail to
    implement succession plans for our key staff, our operating
    results would likely be harmed.

The
    nature of our business and our reliance on intellectual property
    and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk of
    significant litigation.

The hard drive industry has been characterized by significant
    litigation. This includes litigation relating to patent and
    other intellectual property rights, product liability claims and
    other types of litigation. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy
    and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the
    results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in
    adverse rulings or decisions. We may enter into settlements or
    be subject to judgments that may, individually or in the
    aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition or operating results.

We evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices
    of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to
    time. If claims or actions are asserted against us, we may be
    required to obtain a license or cross-license, modify our
    existing technology or design a new non-infringing technology.
    Such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly.
    In addition, we may decide to settle a claim or action against
    us, which settlement could be costly. We may also be liable for
    any past infringement. If there is an adverse ruling against us
    in an infringement lawsuit, an injunction could be issued
    barring production or sale of any infringing product. It could
    also result in a damage award



equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or, if there is a
    finding of willful infringement, treble damages. Any of these
    results would increase our costs and harm our operating results.

Our
    reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary
    information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients
    of our business could be copied by competitors.

Our success depends, in significant part, on the proprietary
    nature of our technology, including non-patentable intellectual
    property such as our process technology. Despite safeguards, to
    the extent that a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise
    capitalize on our technology, it may be difficult, expensive or
    impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection. Also,
    the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our
    intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the
    United States. In addition to patent protection of intellectual
    property rights, we consider elements of our product designs and
    processes to be proprietary and confidential. We rely upon
    employee, consultant and vendor non-disclosure agreements and
    contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to
    protect our proprietary information. However, any of our
    registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be
    challenged or exploited by others in the industry, which might
    harm our operating results.

Environmental
    regulation costs could harm our operating results.

We may be subject to various state, federal and international
    laws and regulations governing the environment, including those
    restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic
    products and making producers of those products financially
    responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and
    disposal of certain products. Such laws and regulations have
    been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate. For
    example, the European Union has enacted the Restriction of the
    Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic
    Equipment (“RoHS”) directive, which prohibits the use
    of certain substances in electronic equipment, and the Waste
    Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”)
    directive, which obligates parties that place electrical and
    electronic equipment onto the market in the EU to put a clearly
    identifiable mark on the equipment, register with and report to
    EU member countries regarding distribution of the equipment, and
    provide a mechanism to take-back and properly dispose of the
    equipment. Similar legislation may be enacted in other locations
    where we manufacture or sell our products. We will need to
    ensure that we comply with such laws and regulations as they are
    enacted, and that our component suppliers also timely comply
    with such laws and regulations. If we fail to timely comply with
    the legislation, our customers may refuse to purchase our
    products, which would have a materially adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and operating results.

In connection with our compliance with such environmental laws
    and regulations, we could incur substantial costs and be subject
    to disruptions to our operations and logistics. In addition, if
    we were found to be in violation of these laws, we could be
    subject to governmental fines and liability to our customers. If
    we have to make significant capital expenditures to comply with
    environmental laws, or if we are subject to significant expenses
    in connection with a violation of these laws, our financial
    condition or operating results could suffer.

Fluctuations
    in currency exchange rates as a result of our international
    operations may negatively affect our operating
    results.

Because we manufacture our products abroad, our operating costs
    are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
    Further fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Thai Baht and
    of the Malaysian Ringgit may negatively impact our operating
    results.

The Thai Baht is a free floating currency while the Malaysian
    Ringgit exchange rate policy is one of a managed float. We have
    attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate
    changes by, among other things, entering into short-term,
    forward contracts. However, these contracts do not cover our
    full exposure and can be canceled by the issuer if currency
    controls are put in place. Currently, we hedge the Thai Baht,
    Malaysian Ringgit, Euro and British Pound Sterling with forward
    contracts.

If the U.S. dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most
    foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar equivalents of unhedged
    manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion
    of our production costs are foreign-currency denominated.
    Conversely, there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues
    since revenues are substantially U.S. dollar denominated.



Increases
    in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses
    and an increase in our operating costs.

Some of our OEM customers have adopted a subcontractor model
    that requires us to contract directly with companies, such as
    ODMs, that provide manufacturing services to our OEM customers.
    Because these subcontractors are generally not as well
    capitalized as our direct OEM customers, this subcontractor
    model exposes us to increased credit risks. Our agreements with
    our OEM customers may not permit us to increase our product
    prices to alleviate this increased credit risk. Additionally, as
    we attempt to expand our OEM and distribution channel sales into
    emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India and China, the
    customers in these regions may have relatively short operating
    histories, making it more difficult for us to accurately assess
    the associated credit risks. Any credit losses we may suffer as
    a result of these increased risks, or as a result of credit
    losses from any significant customer, would increase our
    operating costs, which may negatively impact our operating
    results.

Negative
    conditions in the credit markets could result in a decrease in
    sales and lower revenue in the distribution channel.

Many of our customers in the distribution channel rely on credit
    financing in order to purchase our products. If the recent
    negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our
    customers’ access to credit, product orders in the
    distribution channel may decrease which could result in lower
    revenue.

Inaccurate
    projections of demand for our product can cause large
    fluctuations in our quarterly results.

We often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in
    the third month of the quarter, which makes it difficult for us
    to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter.
    In addition, our quarterly projections and results may be
    subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of
    other factors including:

•

the timing of orders from and shipment of products to major
    customers;

•

our product mix;

•

changes in the prices of our products;

•

manufacturing delays or interruptions;

•

acceptance by customers of competing products in lieu of our
    products;

•

variations in the cost of components for our products;

•

limited availability of components that we obtain from a single
    or a limited number of suppliers;

•

competition and consolidation in the data storage industry;

•

seasonal and other fluctuations in demand for PCs often due to
    technological advances; and

•

availability and rates of transportation.

Rapidly
    changing conditions in the hard drive industry make it difficult
    to predict actual results.

We have made and continue to make a number of estimates and
    assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting.
    The highly technical nature of our products and the rapidly
    changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual
    results may differ significantly from our estimates and
    assumptions. These changes have impacted our financial results
    in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Key
    estimates and assumptions for us include:

•

price protection adjustments and other sales promotions and
    allowances on products sold to retailers, resellers and
    distributors;

•

inventory adjustments for write-down of inventories to lower of
    cost or market value (net realizable value);

•

reserves for doubtful accounts;

•

accruals for product returns;

•

accruals for warranty costs related to product defects;

•

accruals for litigation and other contingencies; and

•

liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits.



The
    market price of our common stock is volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue
    to be, extremely volatile. Factors such as the following may
    significantly affect the market price of our common stock:

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;

•

announcements of technological innovations by us or our
    competitors which may decrease the volume and profitability of
    sales of our existing products and increase the risk of
    inventory obsolescence;

•

new products introduced by us or our competitors;

•

periods of severe pricing pressures due to oversupply or price
    erosion resulting from competitive pressures or industry
    consolidation;

•

developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights;

•

conditions and trends in the hard drive, computer, data and
    content management, storage and communication industries;

•

growth rates that are lower than our previous high growth-rate
    periods;

•

changes in financial estimates by securities analysts relating
    specifically to us or the hard drive industry in
    general; and

•

macroeconomic conditions that affect the market generally.

In addition, general economic conditions may cause the stock
    market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from
    time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many
    high technology companies. These fluctuations often appear to be
    unrelated to the operating performance of the companies.

Securities class action lawsuits are often brought against
    companies after periods of volatility in the market price of
    their securities. A number of such suits have been filed against
    us in the past, and should any new lawsuits be filed, such
    matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of
    resources and management’s attention.

Negative
    conditions in the global credit markets may impair the liquidity
    of a portion of our investment portfolio.

Our long-term investments consist of auction-rate securities
    totaling $28 million as of June 27, 2008. The recent
    negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented
    some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction-rate
    securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale
    has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities.
    If the credit market does not improve, auctions for our invested
    amounts may fail. If an auction fails for securities in which we
    have invested, we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our
    auction-rate securities at par, should we need or desire to
    access the funds invested in those securities. In the event we
    need or desire to access these funds, we will not be able to do
    so until a future auction on these investments is successful or
    a buyer is found outside the auction process. If a buyer is
    found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par, we
    may incur a loss. For example, during the year ended
    June 27, 2008, the market values of some of the
    auction-rate securities we owned were impacted by the
    macro-economic credit market conditions and as a result, we
    recognized $10 million of other-than-temporary losses to
    mark the remaining investments to estimated market value.
    Further, rating downgrades of the security issuer or the
    third-parties insuring such investments may require us to adjust
    the carrying value of these investments through an additional
    impairment charge.

If our
    internal controls are found to be ineffective, our financial
    results or our stock price may be adversely affected.

Our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of
    June 27, 2008, in compliance with Section 404 of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective. We believe that we currently have
    adequate internal control procedures in place for future
    periods; however, if our internal control over financial
    reporting is found to be ineffective, investors may lose
    confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which
    may adversely affect our financial results or our stock price.

    Operations

Forward-Looking
    Statements

The following discussion and analysis contains
    forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal
    securities laws. You are urged to carefully review our
    description and examples of forward-looking statements included
    earlier in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

immediately prior to Part I, under the heading
    “Forward Looking Statements.” Forward-looking
    statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could
    cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed
    in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully
    review the disclosures we make concerning risks and other
    factors that may affect our business and operating results,
    including those made in Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

as well as our other reports filed with the SEC. You are
    cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
    statements, which speak only as of the date of this document. We
    do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to publish revised
    forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
    after the date of this document or to reflect the occurrence of
    unanticipated events.

Our
    Company

We design, develop, manufacture and sell hard drives. A hard
    drive is a device that uses one or more rotating magnetic disks
    (“media”) to store and allow fast access to data. Hard
    drives are key components of computers, including desktop and
    notebook computers (“PCs”), data storage subsystems
    and many consumer electronic (“CE”) devices.

We sell our products worldwide to original equipment
    manufacturers (“OEMs”) and original design
    manufacturers (“ODMs”) for use in computer systems,
    subsystems or CE devices, and to distributors, resellers and
    retailers. Our hard drives are used in desktop computers,
    notebook computers, and enterprise applications such as servers,
    workstations, network attached storage, storage area networks
    and video surveillance equipment. Additionally, our hard drives
    are used in CE applications such as digital video recorders
    (“DVRs”), and satellite and cable set-top boxes
    (“STBs”). We also sell our hard drives as stand-alone
    storage products and integrate them into external casings,
    embedding application software and presenting them as our own
    WD

®

-branded
    external storage appliances for purposes such as personal data
    backup and portable or expanded storage of music, photographs,
    video and other digital data.



Hard drives provide non-volatile data storage, which means that
    the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the
    device. Our hard drives currently include 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch
    form factor drives, having capacities ranging from 40 gigabytes
    (“GB”) to 1 terabyte (“TB”), nominal
    rotation speeds of 5,400, 7,200 and 10,000 revolutions per
    minute (“RPM”), and offer interfaces including both
    Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (“EIDE”) and
    Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (“SATA”). We
    also embed our hard drives into WD-branded external storage
    appliances that utilize interfaces such as USB 2.0, external
    SATA (“eSATA”),
    FireWire

tm

and Ethernet network connections. In addition, we recently
    announced a family of hard drives specifically designed to
    consume substantially less power than standard drives.

We manufacture hard drives and head stack assemblies
    (“HSAs”) in Malaysia and Thailand. We also design and
    manufacture most of our required magnetic heads in California
    and head gimbal assemblies (“HGAs”) in Thailand, and
    we design in California and manufacture in Malaysia most of our
    required media and substrates.

On September 5, 2007, we completed our acquisition (the
    “Acquisition”) of Komag, Incorporated
    (“Komag”) through a cash tender offer by State M
    Corporation (“State M”), our indirect wholly-owned
    subsidiary, for all outstanding shares of Komag’s common
    stock, which was followed by a merger of State M and Komag (the
    “Merger”) whereby Komag became an indirect
    wholly-owned subsidiary and changed its name to WD Media, Inc.
    The Acquisition has strengthened our production efficiencies and
    improved our access to and control of technology and competitive
    position in the worldwide hard drive industry, while enhancing
    our hard drive manufacturing process by integrating media. The
    aggregate purchase price for Komag was approximately
    $1 billion, consisting of cash paid for outstanding shares,
    transaction fees, severance and other employee-related equity
    payments.

Results
    of Operations

In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles, operating results for Komag prior to the date of the
    Acquisition (September 5, 2007), including the first two
    months of fiscal 2008 and the fiscal years 2007 and 2006, are
    not included in our operating results and are therefore not
    discussed. Accordingly, 2008 revenues and expenses reflect the
    addition of results from our media operations since the date of
    the Acquisition while the 2007 and 2006 results do not include
    operating results for Komag prior to the date of the
    Acquisition. This affects our discussion of changes in our
    revenues and expenses comparing these periods. In connection
    with the Acquisition, we incurred charges for in-process
    research and development and transition costs, which impacted
    our earnings in 2008.

Fiscal
    2008 Overview

In 2008, our net revenue increased by 48% to $8.1 billion
    on shipments of 133 million units as compared to
    $5.5 billion and 97 million units, respectively, in
    2007. In 2008, 56% of our hard drive revenue was derived from
    non-desktop sources including CE products, enterprise
    applications, notebook computers and retail sales as compared to
    43% in 2007. Gross margin percentage increased to 21.5% from
    16.5% in 2007 and operating income increased by
    $591 million to $1.0 billion. As a percentage of net
    revenue, operating income was 12.4% in 2008 compared to 7.6% in
    2007. Net income in 2008 was $867 million, or $3.84 per
    diluted share, compared to $564 million, or $2.50 per
    diluted share in 2007. We successfully completed our acquisition
    of Komag, and have completed the integration of the media
    operation, which is generating technology and cost contributions
    to the overall business.

Fiscal
    Year 2008 Compared to Fiscal Year 2007

Net Revenue.

Net revenue was $8.1 billion
    for 2008, an increase of 48% from 2007. Total unit shipments
    increased to 133 million as compared to 97 million for
    the prior year. This unit increase resulted from an increase in
    higher overall demand for hard drives and our continuing
    diversification into non-desktop markets, including mobile,
    consumer electronics, enterprise and branded products. For
    example, we shipped 37 million 2.5 inch drives to the
    mobile and branded markets in 2008 as compared to
    12 million units in 2007. Additionally, we shipped
    15 million units to the DVR market in 2008 as compared to
    10 million units in 2007. ASPs increased to $59 due to an
    improved mix of revenues by market category, improved product
    mix and more favorable demand/supply conditions. Changes in
    revenue by geography generally reflect normal fluctuations in
    market demand and competitive dynamics as well as an increase in
    mobile drives sold to Asia. Changes in revenue by channel are a
    result of increases in sales of mobile hard drives to



OEMs and an increase in sales of branded products due to the
    growing worldwide acceptance of our My
    Passport

®

and My
    Book

®

external digital storage appliances.

Gross Margin.

Gross margin for 2008 was
    $1.7 billion, an increase of $839 million, or 93% over
    the prior year. Gross margin percentage increased to 21.5% in
    2008 from 16.5% in 2007. The factors contributing to this
    increase were an improved mix of revenues by market category,
    improved product mix and more favorable demand/supply
    conditions. Our manufacturing throughput and costs also improved
    through operational efficiencies, higher utilization and a
    higher mix of products based on newer, more cost-effective
    technologies and the contribution of media operations.

Operating Expenses.

Total operating expenses,
    consisting of research and development (“R&D”)
    and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”),
    decreased to 8.5% of net revenue in 2008 compared to 8.9% in
    2007. R&D expense was $464 million in 2008, an
    increase of $158 million, or 52% over the prior year. This
    increase in R&D expense includes $75 million relating
    to the acquired media operations, $52 million related to
    product development to support new programs and $31 million
    in incentive and equity compensation. As a percentage of net
    revenue, R&D expense remained consistent at 5.7% in 2008
    compared to 5.6% in 2007. SG&A expense was
    $220 million in 2008, an increase of $41 million, or
    23%, as compared to 2007. This increase in SG&A expense
    includes $28 million for the expansion of sales and
    marketing to support new products and $13 million in higher
    incentive and equity compensation. As a percentage of net
    revenue, SG&A expense decreased to 2.7% in 2008 from 3.3%
    in 2007 primarily due to an increase in net revenue in 2008
    compared to 2007.

During 2008, we recorded a $49 million charge to operating
    expense related to an in-process research and development
    project acquired from Komag involving technology for higher
    recording densities on advanced perpendicular recording media.
    As these advanced products were not ready for commercial
    production and had no alternative future use, the fair value of
    the development effort did not qualify for capitalization and
    was immediately expensed. For additional information regarding
    acquired in-process research and development, see Part II,
    Item 8, Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Interest and Other Income (Expense).

Net
    interest and other expense was $25 million in 2008 compared
    to net interest and other income of $28 million in 2007.
    This decrease is a result of higher debt balances and realized
    and recognized losses on investments of $13 million.

Income Tax Expense (Benefit).

Income tax
    expense was $114 million in 2008 compared to an income tax
    benefit of $121 million in 2007. Tax provision as a
    percentage of income before taxes was 12% in 2008 compared to
    tax benefit as a percentage of income of 27% for 2007.
    Differences between the effective tax rates and the
    U.S. Federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax
    holidays and incentive programs and the current year generation
    of income tax credits. We have tax holidays in Malaysia and
    Thailand that expire at various times through 2022. In 2008,
    income tax expense also includes net charges of $75 million
    for taxes related to the license of certain intellectual
    property to a foreign subsidiary. In 2007, the tax provision was
    impacted by a favorable adjustment to the company’s
    valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of
    $126 million. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we reversed
    the remaining valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets
    based upon a determination that it was more likely than not that
    our deferred tax assets will be realized. The realization of the
    deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to
    generate sufficient earnings in certain jurisdictions in future
    years. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable
    may increase or decrease in subsequent periods based on
    fluctuating industry or company conditions.

We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (“FIN 48”), as of June 30, 2007. As a result
    of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognized no
    adjustment in the net liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
    The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the
    date of adoption of FIN 48 was $58 million, all of
    which would affect our effective tax rate if realized. During
    the year ended June 27, 2008, we recognized a
    $17 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits and recorded $32 million of liabilities for
    unrecognized tax benefits related to Komag. As of June 27,
    2008, we had approximately $107 million of unrecognized tax
    benefits which included the $32 million of gross
    unrecognized tax benefits related to Komag.



Fiscal
    Year 2007 Compared to Fiscal Year 2006

Net Revenue.

Net revenue was $5.5 billion
    for 2007, an increase of 26% from 2006. Total unit shipments
    increased to 97 million as compared to 73 million for
    the prior year. This unit increase resulted from an increase in
    our desktop PC market share, stronger overall demand for hard
    drives in the desktop PC market and our increasing focus on the
    non-desktop market, including mobile, CE, enterprise and branded
    products. For example, we shipped 12 million drives to the
    mobile market in 2007 as compared to 5 million units in
    2006. Additionally, we shipped 10 million units to the DVR
    market in 2007 as compared to 7 million units in 2006. ASPs
    declined to $57 due to normal technology price declines and a
    more competitive pricing environment in the notebook, desktop,
    and consumer electronics markets. Changes in revenue by
    geography generally reflect overall market demand fluctuations
    for hard drives. Changes in revenue by channel are a result of
    increases in sales of branded products due to the growing
    worldwide acceptance of our My
    Passport

®

and My
    Book

®

external digital storage appliances.

Gross Margin.

Gross margin for 2007 was
    $900 million, an increase of $71 million, or 9% over
    the prior year. Gross margin percentage decreased to 16.5% in
    2007 from 19.1% in 2006. The factors contributing to this
    decrease include normal technology price declines and a more
    competitive pricing environment in the notebook, desktop, and
    consumer electronics markets. In addition, gross margin in 2006
    benefited from a more favorable supply/demand balance.

Operating Expenses.

Total operating expenses,
    consisting of research and development (“R&D”)
    and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
    expenses, decreased to 8.9% of net revenue in 2007 compared to
    10.7% in 2006. R&D expense was $306 million in 2007,
    an increase of $9 million, or 3% over the prior year. The
    increase in R&D expense was primarily related to the
    development of new product platforms in support of our entry
    into new markets and expenditures for advanced head
    technologies, partially offset by a decrease of $2 million
    in variable incentive compensation programs. SG&A expense
    was $179 million in 2007, an increase of $13 million,
    or 8% as compared to 2006. The increase in SG&A expense was
    primarily due to an increase of $19 million in stock based
    compensation expense and other long-term employee incentive
    programs, offset by a $5 million decrease in software
    write-offs that occurred in 2006.

Interest and Other Income.

Net interest and
    other income was $28 million and $16 million in 2007
    and 2006, respectively. This increase in net interest income was
    primarily due to higher average invested cash and short-term
    investment balances.

Income Tax Benefit.

Income tax benefit was
    $121 million and $13 million in 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Tax benefit as a percentage of income before taxes
    was 27% and 3% for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Differences
    between the effective tax rates and the U.S. Federal
    statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays and incentive
    programs and reductions to our valuation allowance for deferred
    tax assets. We have tax holidays in Malaysia and Thailand that
    expire at various times through 2022. In addition to the tax
    holidays, the tax provision was impacted by favorable
    adjustments to the company’s valuation allowance for
    deferred tax assets of $126 and $22 million in 2007 and
    2006, respectively. These adjustments were based upon a
    determination that it was more likely than not that all or a
    portion of our deferred tax assets will be realized. In the
    fourth quarter of 2007, we reversed the remaining valuation
    allowance for our deferred tax assets based on the weight of
    available evidence including our history of cumulative pretax
    income and the increased likelihood of our ability to generate
    profits in the future. In 2006, we released a portion of the
    valuation allowance on deferred tax assets due to the difficulty
    at the time in accurately projecting income for periods of
    longer than two years given the cyclical nature of our industry.
    The realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily
    dependent on our ability to generate sufficient earnings in
    certain jurisdictions in future years. The amount of deferred
    tax assets considered realizable may increase or decrease in
    subsequent periods based on fluctuating industry or company
    conditions.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

We ended 2008 with total cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments of $1.1 billion, an increase of
    $200 million from June 29, 2007. Our investment policy
    is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and



liquidity while maximizing return through the full investment of
    available funds. The following table summarizes the results of
    our statements of cash flows for the three years ended
    June 27, 2008:

Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities during 2008 was
    $1.4 billion as compared to $618 million for 2007 and
    $368 million for 2006. Cash flow from operations consists
    of net income, adjusted for non-cash charges, plus or minus
    working capital changes. This represents our principal source of
    cash. Net cash provided by changes in working capital was
    $22 million for 2008 as compared to $78 million and
    $207 million used to fund working capital for 2007 and
    2006, respectively.

Our working capital requirements primarily depend upon the
    effective management of our cash conversion cycle, which
    measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash
    through sales. The following table summarizes the cash
    conversion cycle for the three years ended 2008:

Cash conversion cycle

(6

)

The decrease in the cash conversion cycle for 2008 was primarily
    due to our days in inventory (“DIOs”), which increased
    by 7 days from 2007. This increase was primarily due to an
    increase in our inventory

on-hand

as a
    result of our acquisition of Komag, which requires us to hold
    precious metals to be used in the production of recording media.
    The 1 day increase in days sales outstanding
    (“DSOs”) is primarily a result of changes in customer
    mix.

From time to time, we modify the timing of payments to our
    vendors. We make these modifications primarily to manage our
    vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows, including our
    cash balances. Generally, we make the payment modifications
    through negotiations with or by granting to or receiving from
    our vendors payment term accommodations.

Investing
    Activities

Net cash used in investing activities for 2008 was
    $1.3 billion as compared to $383 million for 2007 and
    $303 million for 2006. During 2008, cash used in investing
    activities consisted of $927 million for acquisitions and
    $615 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by
    cash provided by investments of $221 million. During 2007,
    cash used in investing activities consisted of $324 million
    for capital expenditures and $59 million for investments.
    The increase in capital expenditures in 2008 compared to 2007
    primarily consisted of the on-going conversion of our head wafer
    fabrication facilities to utilizing

8-inch

wafers from

6-inch

wafers, continued investment in advanced head technologies,
    increased capacity for our broadening and growing product
    portfolio and continued investment in media equipment as a
    result of the Acquisition. The increase in capital expenditures
    in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily a result of equipment
    purchased to support our investments in advanced head
    technologies, new product platforms and capacity for our
    broadening and growing product portfolio.



For 2009, we expect capital additions to be approximately
    $800 million. Depreciation and amortization for 2009 is
    expected to be approximately $475 million.

Our cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion are invested
    primarily in readily accessible, AAA rated institutional
    money-market funds, the majority of which are backed by the
    U.S. government. The carrying value of our investments in
    auction-rate securities was reduced from $203 million as of
    June 29, 2007 to $28 million as of June 27, 2008.
    The reduction resulted from the sale of these investments as
    well as an additional $10 million loss recognized as
    other-than-temporary losses on remaining investments. These
    securities are expected to be held until secondary markets
    become available and as a result have been reclassified to
    long-term investments as of June 27, 2008. These
    investments are currently accounted for as available-for-sale
    securities and recorded at fair value within other non-current
    assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair
    values of these investments are subject to fluctuation.
    Unrealized holding gains and losses are generally recorded in
    other comprehensive income. However, if a decline in fair value
    is determined to be other-than-temporary, the cost basis is
    written down to fair value through earnings. During 2008, we
    realized $3 million in losses on sales and recognized
    $10 million in other-than-temporary losses on these
    auction-rate securities.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities for 2008 was
    $326 million as compared to net cash used in financing
    activities for 2007 of $86 million. Net cash provided by
    financing activities was $1 million for 2006. The net cash
    provided by financing activities in 2008 consisted of
    $500 million in net proceeds from acquisition related debt
    (see “Contractual Obligations and Commitments” below),
    $250 million repayment of convertible debentures assumed in
    the Acquisition, $60 million provided by the issuance of
    common stock under employee plans, $60 million used to
    repurchase our common stock, $89 million provided by a tax
    benefit from employee stock plans and $13 million used to
    repay other long-term debt. The net cash used in financing
    activities in 2007 consisted of $73 million used for
    repurchases of our common stock and $43 million used for
    repayments of long-term debt, offset by $30 million
    provided by the issuance of common stock under employee plans.
    The net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 consisted
    of $78 million provided by the issuance of common stock
    options under employee plans, offset by $54 million used in
    repurchases of our common stock and $23 million used for
    repayments of long-term debt.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Other than facility and equipment lease commitments incurred in
    the normal course of business and certain indemnification
    provisions (see Capital Commitments below), we do not have any
    off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities,
    guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in
    transferred assets, or any obligation arising out of a material
    variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. We do not have
    any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not included in the
    consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we do not have
    an interest in, or relationships with, any special-purpose
    entities.

Long-Term
    Debt

On February 11, 2008, Western Digital Technologies, Inc.
    (“WDTI”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,
    entered into a five-year Credit Agreement (the “Credit
    Facility”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
    administrative agent, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as
    syndication agent, JP Morgan Securities Inc. and Citigroup
    Global Markets Inc., as arrangers, and Bank of America, N.A.,
    HSBC Bank USA, National Association and The Royal Bank of
    Scotland plc, as

co-documentation

agents, and lenders party thereto.

The Credit Facility provides for a $750 million unsecured
    loan consisting of a $500 million term loan facility and a
    $250 million revolving credit facility. The revolving
    credit facility includes borrowing capacity available for
    letters of credit and for short-term borrowings referred to as
    swingline. In addition, WDTI may elect to expand the Credit
    Facility by up to $250 million if existing or new lenders
    provide additional term or revolving commitments.

The $750 million available under the Credit Facility was
    borrowed on February 11, 2008 and was used, together with
    additional cash from the accounts of WDTI, to repay in full the
    $760 million previously borrowed under a bridge facility
    that had been used to fund the Acquisition. As of June 27,
    2008, the Company repaid the amounts borrowed under the
    revolving credit facility leaving $250 million available
    for future borrowings.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate
    equal to, at the option of WDTI, either (a) a LIBOR rate
    determined by reference to the cost of funds for Eurodollar
    deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing,
    adjusted for certain additional costs (the “Eurocurrency
    Rate”) or (b) a base rate determined by reference to
    the higher of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and
    (ii) the prime rate as announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank,
    N.A. (the “Base Rate”), in each case plus an
    applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under
    the term loan facility ranges from 1.25% to 1.50% with respect
    to borrowings at the Eurocurrency Rate and 0.0% to 0.125% with
    respect to borrowings at the Base Rate. The applicable margin
    for revolving loan borrowings under the revolving credit
    facility ranges from 0.8% to 1.125% with respect to borrowings
    at the Eurocurrency Rate and 0.0% to 0.125% with respect to
    borrowings at the Base Rate. The applicable margins for
    borrowings under the Credit Facility are determined based upon a
    leverage ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries calculated on
    a consolidated basis. The interest rate at June 27, 2008
    was 3.75%.

In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under
    the Credit Facility, WDTI is required to pay a facility fee to
    the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of
    the aggregate revolving commitments thereunder. The facility fee
    rate ranges from 0.20% to 0.375% per annum and is determined
    based upon a leverage ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries
    calculated on a consolidated basis. WDTI is also required to pay
    letter of credit fees (a) to the revolving credit facility
    lenders on the aggregate face amount of all outstanding letters
    of credit equal to an applicable margin in effect with respect
    to the Eurocurrency Rate borrowings under the revolving credit
    facility and (b) to the letter of credit issuer computed at
    a rate equal to 0.125% per annum on the face amount of the
    letter of credit, plus such letter of credit issuer’s
    customary documentary and processing fees and charges.

Beginning on June 30, 2009, WDTI is required under the term
    loan facility to make regularly scheduled payments of principal
    in quarterly installments equal to a percentage of the original
    principal amount of the term loan as follows: 3.75% per quarter
    for each of the four quarters ended June 30, 2009,
    September 30, 2009, December 31, 2009 and
    March 31, 2010, 5% per quarter for each of the four
    quarters ended June 30, 2010, September 30, 2010,
    December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011, 6.25% per
    quarter for each of the four quarters ended June 30, 2011,
    September 30, 2011, December 31, 2011 and
    March 31, 2012, and 10% per quarter for each of the three
    quarters ended June 30, 2012, September 30, 2012 and
    December 31, 2012, with the balance due and payable at
    maturity on February 11, 2013.

The Credit Facility requires WDTI to comply with a leverage
    ratio and an interest coverage ratio calculated on a
    consolidated basis for the Company and its subsidiaries. In
    addition, the Credit Facility contains customary covenants,
    including covenants that limit or restrict WDTI’s and its
    subsidiaries’ ability to: incur liens, incur indebtedness,
    make certain restricted payments, merge or consolidate and enter
    into certain speculative hedging arrangements. Upon the
    occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, the
    lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Credit Facility
    and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and
    payable. The Credit Facility specifies a number of events of
    default (some of which are subject to applicable grace or cure
    periods), including, among others, non-payment defaults,
    covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material
    indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults and material
    judgment defaults. As of June 27, 2008, WDTI was in
    compliance with all covenants.



The obligations of WDTI under the Credit Facility are guaranteed
    by the Company and WDTI’s wholly-owned subsidiary, WD Media.

Purchase
    Orders

In the normal course of business, we enter into purchase orders
    with suppliers for the purchase of hard drive components used to
    manufacture our products. These purchase orders generally cover
    forecasted component supplies needed for production during the
    next quarter, are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the
    components, and generally may be changed or canceled at any time
    prior to shipment of the components. In some cases, we may be
    obligated to pay for certain costs related to changes to, or
    cancellation of, a purchase order, such as costs incurred for
    raw materials or

work-in-process.

We have entered into long-term purchase agreements with various
    component suppliers, which contain minimum quantity
    requirements. However, the dollar amount of the purchases may
    depend on the specific products ordered, achievement of
    pre-defined quantity or quality specifications or future price
    negotiations. The estimated related minimum purchase
    requirements are included in “Purchase obligations” in
    the table above.

We enter into, from time to time, other long-term purchase
    agreements for components with certain vendors. Generally,
    future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and
    determinable as they depend on our overall unit volume
    requirements and are contingent upon the prices, technology and
    quality of the supplier’s products remaining competitive.
    These arrangements are not included under “Purchase
    obligations” in the table above. Please see Item 1A of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for a discussion of risks related to these commitments.

Forward
    Exchange Contracts

We purchase short-term, forward exchange contracts to hedge the
    impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying
    assets, liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and
    product costs denominated in foreign currencies. See
    Part II, Item 7A, under the heading “Disclosure
    About Foreign Currency Risk,” for our current forward
    exchange contract commitments.

Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, we may provide
    indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers,
    vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with
    respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to,
    losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, products or
    services to be provided by us, or from intellectual property
    infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have
    entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and
    certain of our officers that will require us, among other
    things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may
    arise by reason of their status or service as directors or
    officers. We maintain director and officer insurance, which may
    cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to
    indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances.

It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount
    under these indemnification agreements due to the limited
    history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and
    circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such
    indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss
    clauses. Historically, we have not incurred material costs as a
    result of obligations under these agreements.

Stock
    Repurchase Program

As announced on November 21, 2005, our Board of Directors
    previously authorized us to repurchase $250 million of our
    common stock in open market transactions. Since the inception of
    this stock repurchase program through June 27, 2008, we
    have repurchased 17 million shares for a total cost of
    $248 million (including commissions). In April 2008, our
    Board of Directors authorized a $500 million increase to
    repurchase our common stock in open market transactions through
    March 31, 2013. We expect stock repurchases to be funded
    principally by operating cash flows. We may continue to
    repurchase our stock as we deem appropriate and market
    conditions allow.

We believe our current cash, cash equivalents and other sources
    of cash will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs
    through the foreseeable future. Our ability to sustain our
    working capital position is subject to a number of risks that we
    discuss in Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of the
    financial statements requires the use of judgment and estimates
    that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets,
    liabilities and shareholders’ equity. We have adopted
    accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in
    the industry in which we operate. We believe the following are
    our most critical accounting policies that affect significant
    areas and involve judgment and estimates made by us. If these
    estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact
    to the consolidated financial statements may be material.

Revenue
    and Accounts Receivable

In accordance with standard industry practice, we have
    agreements with resellers that provide limited price protection
    for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list
    price reductions and other incentive programs. In accordance
    with current accounting standards, we recognize revenue upon
    delivery to OEMs, ODMs and resellers and record a reduction to
    revenue for estimated price protection and other programs in
    effect until the resellers sell such inventory to their
    customers. We base these adjustments on anticipated price
    decreases during the reseller holding period, estimated amounts
    to be reimbursed to qualifying customers, as well as historical
    pricing information. If end-market demand for hard drives
    declines significantly, we may have to increase sell-through
    incentive payments to resellers, resulting in an increase in our
    allowances, which could adversely impact operating results.

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing
    specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based
    on insolvency, disputes or other collection issues. In addition,
    we routinely analyze the different receivable aging categories
    and establish reserves based on a combination of past due
    receivables and expected future losses based primarily on our
    historical levels of bad debt losses. If the financial condition
    of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its
    inability to pay its accounts when due, or if our overall loss
    history changes significantly, an adjustment in our allowance
    for doubtful accounts would be required, which could affect
    operating results.

We establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for
    estimated sales returns in the same period that the related
    revenue is recognized. We base these provisions on existing
    product return notifications. If actual sales returns exceed
    expectations, an increase in the sales return accrual would be
    required, which could negatively affect operating results.

Warranty

We record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue
    is recognized. We generally warrant our products for periods of
    one to five years. Our warranty provision considers estimated
    product failure rates and trends, estimated repair or
    replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory
    claims related to product quality issues, if any. We use a
    statistical warranty tracking model to help with our estimates
    and we exercise judgment in determining the underlying
    estimates. Our statistical tracking model captures specific
    detail on hard drive reliability, such as factory test data,
    historical field return rates and costs to repair by product
    type. If actual product return trends, costs to repair returned
    products or costs of customer compensatory claims differ
    significantly from our estimates, our future results of
    operations could be materially affected. Our judgment is subject
    to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly
    introduced products because of limited field experience with
    those products upon which to base our warranty estimates. We
    review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in
    prior periods and which are still under warranty. Any changes in
    the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments
    that impact current period gross margin and income. Such changes
    are generally a result of differences between forecasted and
    actual return rate experience and costs to repair. For a summary
    of historical changes in estimates related to pre-existing
    warranty provisions, refer to Part II, Item 8,
    Note 4 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Inventory

We value inventories at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out and weighted average methods) or net realizable value.

Weighted-average

cost is calculated based upon the cost of precious metals at the
    time they are received by us. We have determined that it is less
    practicable to assign specific costs to individual units of
    precious metal and as such, we relieve our precious metals
    inventory based on the

weighted-average

cost of the inventory at the time the inventory is used in



production. The weighted average method of valuing precious
    metals does not materially differ from a first-in, first-out
    method. We record inventory write-downs for the valuation of
    inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by
    analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices
    as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances.

We evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and
    obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand,
    inventory on hand, sales levels and other information, and
    reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and
    obsolete inventory based on this analysis. Unanticipated changes
    in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in
    demand for one or more of our products, which may require a
    write down of inventory that could negatively affect operating
    results.

Litigation
    and Other Contingencies

We apply SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for
    Contingencies,” to determine when and how much to accrue
    for and disclose related to legal and other contingencies.
    Accordingly, we disclose contingencies deemed to be reasonably
    possible and accrue loss contingencies when, in consultation
    with our legal advisors, we conclude that a loss is probable and
    reasonably estimable (Refer to Part II, Item 8,
    Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K).

The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters
    involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. The
    actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from
    management’s estimates.

Income
    Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability
    method, which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities
    be recognized for temporary differences between the financial
    reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities
    and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss
    (“NOL”) and tax credit carryforwards. We record a
    valuation allowance where it is more likely than not that the
    deferred tax assets will not be realized. Each period we
    evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax
    assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record
    net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it
    is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be
    realized.

We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on
    the two-step process prescribed in FIN 48. To the extent a
    tax position does not meet a more-likely-than-not level of
    certainty, no benefit is recognized in the financial statements.
    If a position meets the more-likely-than-not level of certainty,
    it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest
    amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
    upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded
    for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in our provision
    for income taxes. The actual liability for unrealized tax
    benefit in any such contingency may be materially different from
    our estimates, which could result in the need to record
    additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or
    potentially adjust previously recorded liabilities for
    unrealized tax benefits.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We account for all stock-based compensation in accordance with
    the fair value recognition provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123(R)”). Under these provisions,
    stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date
    based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense
    over the vesting period. The fair values of all stock options
    granted are estimated using a binomial model, and the fair
    values of all Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)
    shares are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option
    pricing model. Both the binomial and the Black-Scholes-Merton
    models require the input of highly subjective assumptions. Under
    SFAS 123(R), we are required to use judgment in estimating
    the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be
    forfeited. If actual forfeitures differ significantly from the
    original estimate, stock-based compensation expense and our
    results of operations could be materially impacted.

New
    Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”).
    SFAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure
    assets and liabilities. It also responds to investors’
    requests for expanded information about the extent to which
    companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the
    information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair
    value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever
    other standards



require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair
    value. The standard does not expand the use of fair value in any
    new circumstances, but provides clarification on acceptable fair
    valuation methods and applications. SFAS 157 was effective
    for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal
    years, which is the first quarter of our fiscal year 2009. On
    November 14, 2007, the FASB provided a one year deferral
    for the adoption of SFAS 157 for non-financial assets and
    liabilities. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption
    of SFAS 157 will have on our consolidated financial
    statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159
    permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and
    financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses
    on items for which the fair value option has been elected are
    reported in earnings. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2007, which is the first
    quarter of our fiscal year 2009. We are currently evaluating the
    impact the adoption of SFAS 159 will have on our
    consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS 141(R)”). SFAS 141(R) establishes
    principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business
    recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
    identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. The statement also
    provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill
    acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain
    purchase and determines what information to disclose to enable
    users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and
    financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141(R)
    is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, which is the first
    quarter of our fiscal year 2010. We are currently evaluating the
    impact the adoption of SFAS 141(R) will have on our
    consolidated financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”
    (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 updates guidance
    regarding disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and
    hedging activities. It responds to constituents’ concerns
    that FASB Statement No. 133 does not provide adequate
    information about how derivative and hedging activities affect
    an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and
    cash flows. The disclosure of fair values of derivative
    instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format, as
    required by SFAS 161, should provide a more complete
    picture of the location in an entity’s financial statements
    of both the derivative positions existing at period end and the
    effect of using derivatives during the reporting period.
    SFAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years and interim period beginning after
    November 15, 2008, which is the first quarter of our fiscal
    year 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption
    of SFAS 161 will have on our consolidated financial
    statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Disclosure
    About Foreign Currency Risk

Although the majority of our transactions are in
    U.S. dollars, some transactions are based in various
    foreign currencies. We purchase short-term, forward exchange
    contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange
    fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities and
    commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated
    in foreign currencies. The purpose of entering into these hedge
    transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency
    fluctuations on our results of operations. The contract maturity
    dates do not exceed 12 months. We do not purchase
    short-term forward exchange contracts for trading purposes.
    Currently, we focus on hedging our foreign currency risk related
    to the Thai Baht, Malaysian Ringgit, Euro and the British Pound
    Sterling. Malaysian Ringgit contracts are designated as cash
    flow hedges. Euro and British Pound Sterling contracts are
    designated as fair value hedges. Thai Baht contracts are
    designated as both cash flow and fair value hedges. See
    Part II, Item 8, Note 1 in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.



As of June 27, 2008, we had outstanding the following
    purchased foreign currency forward exchange contracts (in
    millions, except weighted average contract rate):

Disclosure
    About Other Market Risks

Variable
    Interest Rate Risk

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate
    equal to, at the option of WDTI, either (a) a LIBOR rate
    determined by reference to the cost of funds for Eurodollar
    deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing,
    adjusted for certain additional costs (the “Eurocurrency
    Rate”) or (b) a base rate determined by reference to
    the higher of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and
    (ii) the prime rate as announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank,
    N.A. (the “Base Rate”), in each case plus an
    applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under
    the term loan facility ranges from 1.25% to 1.50% with respect
    to borrowings at the Eurocurrency Rate and 0.0% to 0.125% with
    respect to borrowings at the Base Rate. The applicable margin
    for revolving loan borrowings under the revolving credit
    facility ranges from 0.8% to 1.125% with respect to borrowings
    at the Eurocurrency Rate and 0.0% to 0.125% with respect to
    borrowings at the Base Rate. The applicable margins for
    borrowings under the Credit Facility are determined based upon a
    leverage ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries calculated on
    a consolidated basis. If either the base rate or LIBOR rate
    increase, our interest payments would also increase. A one
    percent increase in the variable rate of interest on the Credit
    Facility would increase interest expense by approximately
    $5 million annually.

Credit
    Market Risk

Our long-term investments consist of auction-rate securities
    totaling $28 million as of June 27, 2008. The recent
    negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented
    us from liquidating some of our holdings of auction-rate
    securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale
    has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities.
    If the credit market does not improve, auctions for our invested
    amounts may continue to fail. If this occurs, we may be unable
    to liquidate some or all of our auction-rate securities at par
    should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those
    securities prior to maturity of the underlying assets. In the
    event we need or desire to access these funds, we will not be
    able to do so until a future auction on these investments is
    successful or a buyer is found outside the auction process. If a
    buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at
    par, we may incur a loss. The market values of some of the
    auction-rate securities we owned were impacted by the
    macro-economic credit market conditions. Rating downgrades of
    the security issuer or the third-parties insuring such
    investments may require us to adjust the carrying value of these
    investments through an impairment charge. Based on our ability
    to access our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments,
    our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash,
    we do not anticipate these investments will affect our ability
    to execute our current business plan.

REPORT
    OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors

Western Digital Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 27,
    2008 and June 29, 2007, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, shareholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended June 27, 2008. In connection
    with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we
    have also audited the related financial statement schedule.
    These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    June 27, 2008 and June 29, 2007, and the results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended June 27, 2008, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
    in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries’ internal
    control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2008, based
    on criteria established in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report
    dated August 20, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

REPORT
    OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors

Western Digital Corporation:

We have audited Western Digital Corporation and
    subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as
    of June 27, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
    The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of June 27, 2008, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Western Digital Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of June 27, 2008 and June 29, 2007,
    the related consolidated statements of income,
    shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
    flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    June 27, 2008, and the related financial statement
    schedule, and our report dated August 20, 2008 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements
    and financial statement schedule.

Western Digital Corporation (the “Company” or

    device that stores data on one or more rotating magnetic disks
    to allow fast access to data. The Company’s hard drives are
    used in desktop computers, notebook computers, external storage
    devices, enterprise applications such as servers, workstations,
    network attached storage and storage area networks and in
    consumer electronics products such as personal/digital video
    recorders and satellite and cable set-top boxes. The Company
    sells its products worldwide to original equipment manufacturers
    and original design manufacturers for inclusion in computer
    systems or subsystems, and to distributors, resellers and
    retailers.

Western Digital has prepared its consolidated financial
    statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and has adopted
    accounting policies and practices which are generally accepted
    in the industry in which it operates. The Company’s
    significant accounting policies are summarized below.

Fiscal
    Year

The Company has a 52 or 53-week fiscal year. The 2008, 2007 and
    2006 fiscal years, which ended on June 27, 2008,
    June 29, 2007 and June 30, 2006, respectively,
    consisted of 52 weeks each.

Basis of
    Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
    intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
    consolidation. The accounts of foreign subsidiaries have been
    remeasured using the U.S. dollar as the functional
    currency. As such, gains or losses resulting from remeasurement
    of these accounts from local currencies into U.S. dollars
    are reflected in the results of operations. These gains and
    losses were immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.

On September 5, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition
    (the “Acquisition”) of Komag, Incorporated
    (“Komag”). The Acquisition is further described in
    Note 11 below. In connection with the Acquisition, Komag
    became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and
    changed its name to WD Media, Inc. (“WD Media”). WD
    Media’s results of operations since the date of the
    Acquisition are included in the consolidated financial
    statements. The consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
    including WD Media. All significant inter-company accounts and
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents represent highly
    liquid investments, primarily money market funds and commercial
    paper, with original maturities of three months or less.

Investments

The Company’s investments consist primarily of auction-rate
    securities, which are investments in bonds with original
    maturities greater than 90 days. The Company has classified
    these investments as “available for sale” securities
    under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 115 “Accounting for Certain
    Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” and are carried
    at fair value.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
    receivable, investments, accounts payable and accrued expenses
    approximate fair value for all periods presented because of the
    short-term maturity of these assets and liabilities or by using
    appropriate market information. The carrying amount of debt
    approximates fair value because of its variable interest rate.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets hard
    drives to computer manufacturers, resellers and retailers
    throughout the world. The Company performs ongoing credit
    evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and
    generally requires no collateral. The Company maintains
    allowances for potential credit losses, and such losses have
    historically been within management’s expectations. At any
    given point in time, the total amount outstanding from any one
    of a number of its customers may be individually significant to
    the Company’s financial results. At June 27, 2008 and
    June 29, 2007, the Company had reserves for potential
    credit losses of $8 million and $5 million,
    respectively, and net accounts receivable of $1.0 billion
    and $697 million, respectively. The Company also has cash
    equivalent and investment policies that limit the amount of
    credit exposure to any one financial institution or investment
    instrument and require that investments be made only with
    financial institutions or in investment instruments evaluated as
    highly credit-worthy.

Inventory
    Valuation

The Company values inventory at the lower of cost or net
    realizable value. Cost is determined primarily using the

first-in,

first-out method (“FIFO”) for the majority of its
    inventory and the weighted average method for its precious
    metals inventory acquired from Komag.

Weighted-average

cost is calculated based upon the cost of precious metals at the
    time they are received by the Company. As of June 27, 2008,
    78% of the inventory was valued using the FIFO method with the
    remainder valued using the weighted average method. Inventories
    as of June 29, 2007 were valued using the FIFO method only.
    Inventory write-downs are recorded to reduce the carrying value
    of inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value by
    analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices
    as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances. The
    Company evaluates inventory balances for excess quantities and
    obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand,
    inventory on hand, sales levels, and other information, and
    reduces inventory balances to net realizable value for excess
    and obsolete inventory based on this analysis.

Property
    and Equipment

The cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the
    estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The
    Company’s buildings are being depreciated over periods
    ranging from fifteen to thirty years. The majority of the
    Company’s equipment is being depreciated over periods of
    three to seven years. Depreciation is computed on a
    straight-line basis. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
    the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the
    related lease terms.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business
    Combinations” (“SFAS 141”), the total
    purchase price in a business combination is allocated to the
    fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
    their fair values at the acquisition date, with amounts
    exceeding the fair values being recorded as goodwill. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), goodwill is
    not amortized. Instead, it is tested for impairment on an annual
    basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The
    Company did not record any impairment of goodwill during 2008.

Other intangible assets consist primarily of purchased
    technology and customer relationships acquired in an
    acquisition. Acquired intangibles are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives
    included in Note 12. In accordance with SFAS No. 144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets”, long-lived assets are tested for recoverability
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
    carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company did not
    record any impairment of long-lived assets during 2008.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC Staff
    Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104,
    “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.” Under
    SAB No. 104, revenue is recognized when the title and
    risk of loss have passed to the customer, there is persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, or services
    have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
    collectability is reasonably assured. The Company establishes
    provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated
    sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is
    recognized based on existing product return notifications.

In accordance with standard industry practice, the Company has
    agreements with resellers that provide limited price protection
    for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list
    price reductions and other incentive programs. Either party may
    terminate these agreements upon written notice. In the event of
    termination, the Company may be obligated to repurchase a
    certain portion of the resellers’ inventory. The Company
    records a reduction to revenue for estimated price protection
    and other programs in effect until the resellers sell such
    inventory to their customers. These adjustments are based on
    anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period,
    estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers, as
    well as historical pricing information. If end-market demand for
    hard drives declines significantly, the Company may have to
    increase sell-through incentive payments to resellers, resulting
    in an increase in price protection allowances, which could
    adversely impact operating results. Net revenue recognized on
    sales to resellers was approximately $3.8 billion,
    $2.8 billion and $2.0 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Repurchases of reseller inventory were not
    material in 2008, 2007 or 2006.

Western Digital establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts
    by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk
    of loss based on insolvency, disputes or other collection
    issues. In addition, the Company routinely analyzes the
    different receivable aging categories and its bad debt loss
    history and establishes reserves based on a combination of past
    due receivables and expected future losses based primarily on
    the Company’s historical levels of bad debt losses. If the
    financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates
    resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due, or if
    the overall loss history of the Company changes significantly,
    an adjustment in the Company’s allowance for doubtful
    accounts would be required, which could affect operating results.

Warranty

The Company records an accrual for estimated warranty costs when
    revenue is recognized. The Company generally warrants its
    products for periods of one to five years. The warranty
    provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends,
    estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for
    customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues,
    if any. A statistical warranty tracking model is used to help
    with estimates and assists in exercising judgment in determining
    the underlying estimates. The statistical tracking model
    captures specific detail on hard drive reliability, such as
    factory test data, historical field return rates, and costs to
    repair by product type. If actual product return trends, costs
    to repair returned products or costs of customer compensatory
    claims differ significantly from estimates, future results of
    operations could be materially affected. Management’s
    judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with
    respect to newly introduced products because of limited field
    experience with those products upon which to base warranty
    estimates. Management reviews the warranty accrual quarterly for
    products shipped in prior periods and which are still under
    warranty. Any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual
    may result in adjustments that impact current period gross
    margin and income. Such changes are generally a result of
    differences between forecasted and actual return rate experience
    and costs to repair.

Advertising
    Expense

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Selling, general and
    administrative expenses of the Company include advertising costs
    of $3 million, $5 million and $6 million in 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

Income
    Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and
    liability method, which provides that deferred tax assets and
    liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the
    financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and
    liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating
    loss (“NOL”) and tax credit carryforwards. The Company
    records a valuation allowance where it is more likely than not
    that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Each period
    the Company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance for its
    deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowance so that
    the Company records net deferred tax assets only to the extent
    that it has concluded it is more likely than not that these
    deferred tax assets will be realized.

As a result of the implementation of FASB Interpretation
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109” (“FIN 48”), the Company
    recognized liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the
    two-step process prescribed in FIN 48. To the extent a tax
    position does not meet a more-likely-than-not level of
    certainty, no benefit is recognized in the financial statements.
    If a position meets the more-likely-than-not level of certainty,
    it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest
    amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
    upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded
    for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in the provision
    for income taxes. The actual liability for unrealized tax
    benefit in any such contingency may be materially different from
    the Company’s estimates, which could result in the need to
    record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or
    potentially adjust previously recorded liabilities for
    unrealized tax benefits.

Per Share
    Information

The Company computes basic income per common share using net
    income and the weighted average number of common shares
    outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is
    computed using net income and the weighted average number of
    common shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding
    during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares include
    outstanding employee stock options, rights to purchase shares of
    common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and
    restricted stock and stock unit awards.

The following table illustrates the computation of basic and
    diluted income per common share (in millions, except per share

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company accounts for all stock-based compensation in
    accordance with the fair value recognition provisions in
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123(R)”). Under the fair value recognition
    provisions of SFAS 123(R), stock-based compensation cost is
    measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and
    is recognized as expense over the vesting period. The fair
    values of all stock options granted are estimated using a
    binomial model, and the fair values of all Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) shares are estimated using the
    Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Both the binomial and
    the Black-Scholes-Merton models require the input of highly
    subjective assumptions. Under SFAS 123(R), the Company is
    required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stock-based
    awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual forfeitures
    differ significantly from the original estimate, stock-based
    compensation expense and the results of operations could be
    materially impacted.

Other
    Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to revenue, expenses,
    gains and losses that are recorded as an element of
    shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net income. The
    Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of
    unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency contracts.

Foreign
    Exchange Contracts

Although the majority of the Company’s transactions are in
    U.S. dollars, some transactions are based in various
    foreign currencies. The Company purchases short-term, forward
    exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency
    fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities and
    commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated
    in foreign currencies. The contracts have maturity dates that do
    not exceed 12 months. The Company does not purchase
    short-term forward exchange contracts for trading purposes.

The Company applies the provisions of SFAS No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities” (“SFAS 133”), as amended, which
    establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
    instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging
    activities. The Company had outstanding forward exchange
    contracts with commercial banks for Thai Baht, Malaysian
    Ringgit, British Pound Sterling and Euro with values of
    $1.3 billion and $493 million at June 27, 2008
    and June 29, 2007, respectively. Malaysian Ringgit
    contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. Euro and British
    Pound Sterling contracts are designated as fair value hedges.
    Thai Baht contracts include both cash flow and fair value hedges.

If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the
    effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative
    is initially deferred in other comprehensive income (loss), net
    of tax. These amounts are subsequently recognized into earnings
    when the underlying cash flow being hedged is recognized into
    earnings. Recognized gains and losses on foreign currency
    contracts entered into for manufacturing related activities are
    reported in cost of revenues. Hedge effectiveness is measured by
    comparing the hedging instrument’s cumulative change in
    fair value from inception to maturity to the underlying
    exposure’s terminal value. The Company has determined that
    all of its cash flow hedging instruments for all years presented
    were effective as defined under SFAS 133.

Fair value hedges are not designated as hedging instruments, and
    therefore, the change in the instrument’s fair value is
    recognized currently in earnings and is reported as a component
    of non-operating income. Changes in fair value on these
    contracts were not material to the consolidated financial
    statements for all years presented.

Use of
    Estimates

Company management has made estimates and assumptions relating
    to the reporting of certain assets and liabilities in conformity
    with U.S. GAAP. These estimates and assumptions have been
    applied using methodologies which are consistent throughout the
    periods presented. However, actual results could differ from
    these estimates.

New
    Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”).
    SFAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure
    assets and liabilities. It also responds to investors’
    requests for expanded information about the extent to which
    companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the
    information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair
    value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever
    other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be
    measured at fair value. The standard does not expand the use of
    fair value in any new circumstances, but provides clarification
    on acceptable fair valuation methods and applications.
    SFAS 157 was effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim
    periods within those fiscal years, which for the Company is the
    first quarter of fiscal year 2009. On November 14, 2007,
    the FASB provided a one year deferral for the adoption of
    SFAS 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities. The
    Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of
    SFAS 157 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159
    permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and
    financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses
    on items for which the fair value option has been elected are
    reported in earnings. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2007, which for the
    Company is the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. The Company is
    evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 159 will have on
    its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS 141(R)”). SFAS 141(R) establishes
    principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business
    recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
    identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. The statement also
    provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill
    acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain
    purchase and determines what information to disclose to enable
    users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and
    financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141(R)
    is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, which for the Company is
    the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. The Company is currently
    evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 141(R) will have
    on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”
    (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 updates guidance
    regarding disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and
    hedging activities. It responds to constituents’ concerns
    that FASB Statement No. 133 does not provide adequate
    information about how derivative and hedging activities affect
    an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and
    cash flows. The disclosure of fair values of derivative
    instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format, as
    required by SFAS 161, should provide a more complete
    picture of the location in an entity’s financial statements
    of both the derivative positions existing at period end and the
    effect of using derivatives during the reporting period.
    SFAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years and interim period beginning after
    November 15, 2008, which for the Company is the first
    quarter of fiscal year 2010. The Company is currently evaluating
    the impact the adoption of SFAS 161 will have on its
    consolidated financial statements.

Credit
    Facility

On February 11, 2008, Western Digital Technologies, Inc.
    (“WDTI”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,
    entered into a five-year Credit Agreement (the “Credit
    Facility”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
    administrative agent, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as
    syndication agent, JP Morgan Securities Inc. and Citigroup
    Global Markets Inc., as arrangers, and Bank of America, N.A.,
    HSBC Bank USA, National Association and The Royal Bank of
    Scotland plc, as co-documentation agents, and lenders party
    thereto.

The Credit Facility provides for a $750 million unsecured
    loan consisting of a $500 million term loan facility and a
    $250 million revolving credit facility. The revolving
    credit facility includes borrowing capacity available for
    letters of credit and for short-term borrowings referred to as
    swingline. In addition, WDTI may elect to expand the Credit
    Facility by up to $250 million if existing or new lenders
    provide additional term or revolving commitments.



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The $750 million available under the Credit Facility was
    borrowed on February 11, 2008 and was used, together with
    additional cash from the accounts of WDTI, to repay in full the
    $760 million previously borrowed under a bridge facility
    that had been used to fund the Acquisition. As of June 27,
    2008, the Company repaid the amounts borrowed under the
    revolving credit facility leaving $250 million available
    for future borrowings.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate
    equal to, at the option of WDTI, either (a) a LIBOR rate
    determined by reference to the cost of funds for Eurodollar
    deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing,
    adjusted for certain additional costs (the “Eurocurrency
    Rate”) or (b) a base rate determined by reference to
    the higher of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and
    (ii) the prime rate as announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank,
    N.A. (the “Base Rate”), in each case plus an
    applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under
    the term loan facility ranges from 1.25% to 1.50% with respect
    to borrowings at the Eurocurrency Rate and 0.0% to 0.125% with
    respect to borrowings at the Base Rate. The applicable margin
    for revolving loan borrowings under the revolving credit
    facility ranges from 0.8% to 1.125% with respect to borrowings
    at the Eurocurrency Rate and 0.0% to 0.125% with respect to
    borrowings at the Base Rate. The applicable margins for
    borrowings under the Credit Facility are determined based upon a
    leverage ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries calculated on
    a consolidated basis. The interest rate at June 27, 2008
    was 3.75%.

In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under
    the Credit Facility, WDTI is required to pay a facility fee to
    the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of
    the aggregate revolving commitments thereunder. The facility fee
    rate ranges from 0.20% to 0.375% per annum and is determined
    based upon a leverage ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries
    calculated on a consolidated basis. WDTI is also required to pay
    letter of credit fees (a) to the revolving credit facility
    lenders on the aggregate face amount of all outstanding letters
    of credit equal to an applicable margin in effect with respect
    to the Eurocurrency Rate borrowings under the revolving credit
    facility and (b) to the letter of credit issuer computed at
    a rate equal to 0.125% per annum on the face amount of the
    letter of credit, plus such letter of credit issuer’s
    customary documentary and processing fees and charges.

Beginning on June 30, 2009, WDTI is required under the term
    loan facility to make regularly scheduled payments of principal
    in quarterly installments equal to a percentage of the original
    principal amount of the term loan as follows: 3.75% per quarter
    for each of the four quarters ended June 30, 2009,
    September 30, 2009, December 31, 2009 and
    March 31, 2010, 5% per quarter for each of the four
    quarters ended June 30, 2010, September 30, 2010,
    December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011, 6.25% per
    quarter for each of the four quarters ended June 30, 2011,
    September 30, 2011, December 31, 2011 and
    March 31, 2012, and 10% per quarter for each of the three
    quarters ended June 30, 2012, September 30, 2012 and
    December 31, 2012, with the balance due and payable at
    maturity on February 11, 2013.

The Credit Facility requires WDTI to comply with a leverage
    ratio and an interest coverage ratio calculated on a
    consolidated basis for the Company and its subsidiaries. In
    addition, the Credit Facility contains customary covenants,
    including covenants that limit or restrict WDTI’s and its
    subsidiaries’ ability to: incur liens, incur indebtedness,
    make certain restricted payments, merge or consolidate and enter
    into certain speculative hedging arrangements. Upon the
    occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, the
    lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Credit Facility
    and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and
    payable. The Credit Facility specifies a number of events of
    default (some of which are subject to applicable grace or cure
    periods), including, among others, non-payment defaults,
    covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material
    indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults and material
    judgment defaults. As of June 27, 2008, WDTI was in
    compliance with all covenants.

The obligations of WDTI under the Credit Facility are guaranteed
    by the Company and WDTI’s wholly-owned subsidiary, WD Media.

Long-term
    Purchase Agreements

The Company has entered into long-term purchase agreements with
    various component suppliers. The commitments depend on specific
    products ordered and may be subject to minimum quality
    requirements and future price negotiations. For 2009, 2010,
    2011, 2012, 2013 and thereafter, the Company expects these
    commitments to total approximately $673 million,
    $4 million, $4 million, $4 million,
    $3 million and $7 million, respectively. In
    conjunction with these agreements, the Company has advanced
    approximately $36 million related to 2009 purchase
    commitments which is included in advances to suppliers as of
    June 27, 2008.

Note 5.  Legal
    Proceedings

In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to
    legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. Although the
    ultimate aggregate amount of probable monetary liability or
    financial impact with respect to these matters is subject to
    many uncertainties and is therefore not predictable with
    assurance, management believes that any monetary liability or
    financial impact to the Company from these matters or the
    specified matters below, individually and in the aggregate would
    not be material to the Company’s financial condition.
    However, there can be no assurance with respect to such

result, and monetary liability or financial impact to the
    Company from these legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims
    could differ materially from those projected.

After the Company announced on July 27, 2006 that it was
    conducting a company-initiated, voluntary review of its
    historical stock option grants, the following purported
    shareholder derivative actions were filed challenging conduct by
    certain of the Company’s current and former board members
    and officers in connection with various stock option grants:
    (1) In re Western Digital Corporation Derivative
    Litigation, United States District Court for the Central
    District of California (the “Federal Derivative
    Action”); and (2) In re State Court Western Digital
    Corporation Derivative Litigation, Superior Court of the State
    of California for the County of Orange (the “State
    Derivative Action”). The complaints in these actions
    asserted claims for accounting, breach of fiduciary duty

and/or

aiding and abetting, constructive fraud, waste of corporate
    assets, unjust enrichment, rescission, breach of contract,
    violation of the California Corporations Code, abuse of control,
    gross mismanagement, and constructive trust in connection with
    the Company’s option granting practices. The complaint in
    the Federal Derivative Action also alleged violations of
    Sections 10(b), 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange
    Act. The complaints sought unspecified monetary damages and
    other relief against the individual defendants and certain
    governance reforms affecting the Company. The Company was named
    solely as a nominal defendant in each action.

The parties in these actions executed a Stipulation of
    Settlement on March 21, 2008. The financial impact of the
    settlement was not material to the Company. The court in the
    Federal Derivative Action granted final approval of the
    settlement on June 9, 2008, and entered a judgment
    dismissing the action. Based on this judgment, the parties
    requested a voluntary dismissal of the State Derivative Action,
    which the court overseeing that action granted on July 29,
    2008.

On January 22, 2007, StorMedia Texas LLC filed a complaint
    against the Company and several other companies, including other
    disk drive manufacturers, for patent infringement in the Eastern
    District of Texas alleging infringement of U.S. Patent
    No. 6,805,891. The Company has entered a Settlement
    Agreement dated August 13, 2008, on behalf of the Company
    and its subsidiaries, including WD Media, Inc., the successor to
    the business of Komag, Inc., which disposes of this lawsuit in
    its entirety. The financial impact of the settlement was not
    material to the Company.

On October 9, 2007, the United States International Trade
    Commission (“ITC”) issued a notice of investigation In
    the Matter of Certain Hard Disk Drives, Components thereof, and
    Products Containing the Same regarding a complaint filed on
    September 10, 2007 by Steven F. Reiber and Mary L. Reiber
    (the “Reibers”). The complaint named as respondents
    the Company and several other companies, including certain other
    disk drive manufacturers and personal computer vendors. The
    Reibers also filed a complaint in the United States District
    Court for the Eastern District of California on
    September 10, 2007. On April 28, 2008 the Reibers
    dismissed the district court action without prejudice, and on
    May 13, 2008 the ITC investigation was terminated.

On June 20, 2008, Convolve, Inc. (“Convolve”),
    filed a complaint against the Company and two other companies
    for patent infringement in the Eastern District of Texas
    alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,314,473 and
    4,916,635 (the “Asserted Patents”) and is seeking
    unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. One of these
    patents allegedly relates to a method to reduce vibration and
    noise in physical systems, and the other allegedly relates to
    interface technology to select between certain modes of a disk
    drive’s operations relating to speed and noise. The United
    States Patent Office is currently reexamining the Asserted
    Patents in connection with a lawsuit involving Convolve and
    other parties and has issued preliminary rejections of both
    patents. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this
    matter.

Note 7.  Western
    Digital Corporation 401(k) Plan

The Company has adopted the Western Digital Corporation 401(k)
    Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan covers substantially all
    domestic employees, subject to certain eligibility requirements.
    The Company makes annual contributions to the Plan, subject to
    approval from the Board of Directors. For 2008, 2007 and 2006
    the Company made Plan contributions of $4 million per year.

Note 8.  Shareholders’
    Equity

Stock
    Incentive Plans

The Company has four stock-based incentive plans (collectively
    referred to as the “Stock Plans”): The 2004 amended
    and restated Performance Incentive Plan, the Employee Stock
    Option Plan, the Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan and the Stock
    Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Subsequent to the
    expiration of the Employee Stock Option Plan on
    November 10, 2004 and approval of the 2004 Performance
    Incentive Plan by the Company’s shareholders on
    November 18, 2004, no new awards are permitted under the
    Employee Stock Option Plan, the Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan
    or the Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors
    (collectively referred to as the “Prior Stock Plans”).
    As of June 27, 2008, options to purchase 3.5 million
    shares of the Company’s common stock remain outstanding
    under the Prior Stock Plans, of which 3.3 million shares
    were exercisable and less than 0.1 million shares of
    restricted stock remain unvested. Options granted under the
    Prior Stock Plans vested over periods from one to four years.
    Options granted under the Prior Stock Plans expire either five
    or ten years from the date of grant.

In November 2004, the Company’s shareholders approved the
    2004 Performance Incentive Plan. Subsequently, in November 2005,
    the Company’s shareholders approved an authorization for an
    additional 13 million shares. The types of



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

awards that may be granted under the 2004 Performance Incentive
    Plan include stock options, stock appreciation rights,
    restricted stock, stock bonuses and other forms of awards
    granted or denominated in the Company’s common stock or
    units of the Company’s common stock, as well as certain
    cash bonus awards. Persons eligible to receive awards under the
    2004 Performance Incentive Plan include officers or employees of
    the Company or any of its subsidiaries, directors of the Company
    and certain consultants and advisors to the Company or any of
    its subsidiaries. The vesting of awards under the Performance
    Incentive Plan is determined at the date of grant. Each award
    expires on a date determined at the date of grant; however, the
    maximum term of options, stock appreciation rights and other
    rights to acquire common stock under the 2004 Performance
    Incentive Plan is ten years after the grant date of the award.

As of June 27, 2008, the maximum number of shares of the
    Company’s common stock that are authorized for award grants
    under the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan is 22.6 million
    shares. Any shares subject to awards under the prior stock plans
    that are canceled, forfeited or otherwise terminate without
    having vested or been exercised, as applicable, will become
    available for other award grants under the 2004 Performance
    Incentive Plan. The 2004 Performance Incentive Plan will
    terminate on September 21, 2014 unless terminated earlier
    by the Company’s Board of Directors.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

During 2006, the Company adopted the Western Digital Corporation
    2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) whereby
    eligible employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 10%
    of their eligible compensation to purchase shares of the
    Company’s common stock at 95% of the fair market value of
    common stock on either the date of grant or on the exercise
    date, whichever is less. The date of grant of each offering
    period is June 1st or December 1st, except for
    the initial offering period, which began on December 15,
    2005. Each offering period is 24 months and consists of
    four exercise dates. If the fair market value of the common
    stock is less on a given exercise date than on the date of
    grant, employee participation in that offering period is
    terminated and re-enrollment in the new offering period occurs
    automatically. The Company’s ESPP operates in accordance
    with Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.

Stock-Based
    Compensation Expense

Effective July 2, 2005, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123(R)”) using the modified prospective
    method. SFAS 123(R) establishes the financial accounting
    and reporting standards for stock-based compensation plans. As
    required by SFAS 123(R), the Company recognized the cost
    resulting from all share-based payment transactions including
    shares issued under the Company’s stock option plans and
    employee stock purchase plans in the financial statements. The
    Company expensed $18 million, $18 million and
    $21 million related to stock-based compensation from stock
    options and ESPP shares in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As
    of June 27, 2008, total compensation cost related to
    unvested stock options granted to employees and ESPP shares, but
    not yet recognized, was $33 million and will be amortized
    on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of
    approximately 2.4 years.

The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference
    between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the
    quoted price of the Company’s common stock for those awards
    that have an exercise price currently below the quoted price. As
    of June 27, 2008, the Company had options outstanding to
    purchase an aggregate of 8.0 million shares with an
    exercise price below the quoted price of the Company’s
    stock resulting in an aggregate intrinsic value of
    $160 million. During 2008 and 2007, the aggregate intrinsic
    value of options exercised under the Company’s stock option
    plans was $76 million and $30 million, respectively,
    determined as of the date of exercise.

Deferred
    Stock Compensation

The Company granted approximately 0.9 million,
    1.8 million and 2.0 million shares of restricted stock
    and restricted stock unit awards during 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The restricted stock and restricted stock unit
    awards vest annually over periods from one to five years. The
    aggregate market value of the restricted stock at the date of
    issuance was $23 million, $36 million and
    $27 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These
    amounts have been recorded as deferred compensation and are
    being amortized to expense over the corresponding vesting
    periods. For

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

purposes of valuing these awards, the Company has assumed a
    forfeiture rate of zero based on a historical analysis
    indicating minimal forfeitures for these types of awards. The
    Company charged to expense $19 million, $29 million
    and $16 million related to restricted stock awards that
    were vested during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of
    June 27, 2008, the aggregate unamortized fair value of all
    unvested restricted stock awards was $42 million, which
    will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted
    average vesting period of approximately 2.3 years.

During 2005, the Company also awarded certain executives and
    other key employees 0.5 million restricted stock units with
    performance-based vesting (“Performance Shares”).
    However, during 2006, the Company canceled all outstanding
    Performance Shares. The impact of these awards, and subsequent
    cancellation, were not material to the consolidated financial
    statements.

Fair
    Value Disclosure — Binomial Model

The fair value of stock options granted during 2008, 2007 and
    2006 was estimated using a binomial option pricing model. The
    binomial model requires the input of highly subjective
    assumptions including the expected stock price volatility, the
    expected price multiple at which employees are likely to
    exercise stock options and the expected employee termination
    rate. The Company uses historical data to estimate option
    exercise, employee termination, and expected stock price
    volatility within the binomial model. The risk-free rate for
    periods within the contractual life of the option is based on
    the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of
    grant.

The fair value of stock options granted during the three years
    ended June 27, 2008 was estimated using the following

    Repurchase Program

As announced on November 21, 2005, the Company’s Board
    of Directors previously authorized the repurchase of
    $250 million of the Company’s common stock in open
    market transactions. During 2008, the Company repurchased
    2.3 million shares of common stock at a total cost of
    $60 million. Since the inception of the program, the
    Company has repurchased 16.6 million shares for a total
    cost of $248 million (including commissions). In April
    2008, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a
    $500 million increase to repurchase the Company’s
    common stock in open market transactions through March 31,
    2013. Stock repurchases are expected to be funded principally
    from operating cash flows. The Company may continue to
    repurchase its stock as it deems appropriate and market
    conditions allow.

Stock
    Purchase Rights

In 1989, the Company implemented a plan to protect
    shareholders’ rights in the event of a proposed takeover of
    the Company. Under the plan, each share of the Company’s
    outstanding common stock carried one Right to Purchase
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the
    “Right”). The Right enabled the holder, under certain
    circumstances, to purchase common stock of Western Digital or of
    an acquiring company at a substantially discounted price ten
    days after a person or group publicly announces it has acquired
    or has tendered an offer for 15% or more of the Company’s
    outstanding common stock. On September 10, 1998, the
    Company’s Board of Directors approved the adoption of a new
    Rights plan to replace the previous plan, which expired in
    September 1998. The Rights under the 1998 plan were similar to
    the rights under the 1989 plan except they were redeemable by
    the Company at $.01 per Right and expired in 2008. In connection
    with the establishment of a holding company structure on
    April 6, 2001, the Company terminated the Rights under the
    1998 plan and adopted a new Rights plan. The 2001 plan is
    similar to the terminated 1998 plan, except that the exercise
    price was reduced from $150.00 to $50.00 per share and the
    expiration date for the 2001 Rights plan was extended to April
    2011.

Remaining net undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries
    at June 27, 2008 on which no U.S. tax has been
    provided amounted to approximately $2.2 billion. The net
    undistributed earnings are intended to finance local operating
    requirements. Accordingly, an additional U.S. tax provision
    has not been made on these earnings. The tax liability for these
    earnings would approximate $803 million, if the Company
    repatriated the $2.2 billion in undistributed earnings from
    the foreign subsidiaries.

Deferred
    Taxes

Temporary differences and carryforwards, which give rise to a
    significant portion of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of
    June 27, 2008 and June 29, 2007 were as follows (in
    millions):

In addition to the deferred tax assets presented above, the

    June 29, 2007, respectively, including $11 million as
    of June 27, 2008 related to the Acquisition. The deductions
    related to stock based compensation resulted in a
    $19 million tax benefit and the use of NOL and credit
    carryforwards related to stock

based compensation resulted in a $70 million tax benefit
    during the year ended June 27, 2008. In accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS 123(R), shareholders equity was
    increased by $89 million during 2008 for these benefits.

Beginning in the year ended June 27, 2008, deferred tax
    assets are presented before any reduction for liabilities
    relating to unrecognized tax benefits. The increase to the
    deferred tax assets for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2008
    relates primarily to 1) the acquisition of Komag and its
    net deferred tax assets of $92 million and 2) the
    reclassification of $50 million of liabilities for
    unrecognized tax benefits that were previously recorded net in
    deferred tax assets.

As of the end of fiscal 2007, the Company determined that it is
    more likely than not that its net deferred tax assets will be
    realized. Accordingly, the Company eliminated its remaining
    valuation allowance which resulted in the recognition of
    additional net deferred tax assets of $125 million. The
    realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on
    the Company’s ability to generate sufficient earnings in
    certain jurisdictions in future years. The Company released the
    remainder of the valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets
    based on the weight of available evidence including the history
    of cumulative pretax income and the increased likelihood of the
    Company’s ability to generate profits in the future. The
    amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable may increase
    or decrease in subsequent periods based on fluctuating industry
    or Company conditions.

Tax
    Holidays and Carryforwards

A substantial portion of the Company’s manufacturing
    operations in Malaysia and Thailand operate under various tax
    holidays and tax incentive programs which will expire in whole
    or in part at various dates through 2022. Certain of the
    holidays may be extended if specific conditions are met. The net
    impact of these tax holidays and tax incentives was to increase
    the Company’s net earnings by $391 million ($1.73 per
    diluted share), $86 million ($0.38 per diluted share) and
    $81 million ($0.36 per diluted share) in 2008, 2007, and
    2006, respectively.

As of June 27, 2008, the Company had federal and state NOL
    carryforwards of approximately $185 million and
    $69 million, respectively. In addition, the Company had
    various federal and state tax credit carryforwards combined of
    approximately $157 million. The loss carryforwards
    available to offset future federal and state taxable income
    expire at various times from 2019 to 2026 and 2013 to 2017,
    respectively. Approximately $55 million of the credit
    carryforwards available to offset future taxable income expire
    at various times from 2009 to 2027. The remaining amount is
    available indefinitely. NOLs and credits relating to Komag are
    subject to limitations under Section 382 and 383 of the
    Internal Revenue Code. The Company does not expect these
    limitations to result in a reduction in the total amount of NOLs
    and credits ultimately realized.

Adoption
    of FIN 48

Effective as of June 30, 2007, the Company adopted the
    provisions of FIN 48. FIN 48 contains a two-step
    approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions
    accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
    “Accounting for



WESTERN

Income Taxes.” First, the tax position is evaluated for
    recognition by determining if it is more likely than not that
    the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of
    related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If the tax
    position is deemed “more-likely-than-not” to be
    sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the
    amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements.
    The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest
    amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
    upon ultimate settlement.

The adoption of FIN 48 at the beginning of fiscal year 2008
    did not result in an adjustment for unrecognized tax benefits.
    The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the
    date of adoption was $58 million which had previously been
    presented as a reduction to deferred tax assets of
    $47 million and an inclusion in other long term liabilities
    of $11 million as of June 29, 2007. With the exception
    of certain unrecognized tax benefits that are directly
    associated with the tax position taken, unrecognized tax
    benefits are now presented gross in the Company’s balance
    sheet. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
    benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain
    tax positions and are recorded in the provision for income
    taxes. As of the date of adoption of FIN 48, and at
    June 27, 2008, such interest and penalties were not
    material.

As of June 27, 2008 the Company had approximately
    $107 million of unrecognized tax benefits, which included
    $32 million of unrecognized tax benefits related to Komag.

The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts
    of unrecognized tax benefits for the year:

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at
    June 27, 2008 are $75 million of tax benefits that, if
    recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.

The Company files U.S. federal, U.S. state, and
    foreign tax returns. For federal tax returns, the Company is
    subject to examination for fiscal years 2004 through 2008. For
    state returns, with few exceptions, the Company is subject to
    tax examinations for 2003 through 2008. In foreign
    jurisdictions, with few exceptions, the Company is subject to
    examination for all years subsequent to fiscal 2000. The Company
    is no longer subject to examination by the Internal Revenue
    Service (“IRS”) for periods prior to 2004 and by the
    state taxing authorities for periods prior to 2003, although
    carry forwards generated prior to those periods may still be
    adjusted upon examination by the IRS or state taxing authority
    if they either have been or will be used in a future period.

The IRS is scheduled to commence an examination of the fiscal
    years ended 2006 and 2007 for the Company and calendar years
    2005 and 2006 for Komag in August 2008. Additionally, the
    Company’s French subsidiary is under examination by the
    local tax authorities for fiscal years 2003 through 2005.

Due to the risk that audit outcomes and the timing of audit
    settlements are subject to significant uncertainty, the
    Company’s current estimate of the total amounts of
    unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease for all
    open tax years. As of June 27, 2008, it is not possible to
    estimate the amount of change, if any, in the unrecognized tax
    benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve
    months. Any significant change in the amount of the
    Company’s unrecognized tax benefits would most likely
    result from additional information or settlements relating to
    the Company’s tax examination of uncertain tax positions.

Investments

As of June 27, 2008, the Company had investments of
    $3 million in U.S. government securities and
    $28 million in auction-rate securities primarily backed by
    insurance products. The auction-rate securities are expected to
    be held until secondary markets become available and as a result
    have been reclassified to long-term investments as of
    June 27, 2008. These investments are currently accounted
    for as available-for-sale securities and recorded at fair value
    within other non-current assets in the consolidated balance
    sheet. The estimated fair values of these investments are
    subject to fluctuation. Unrealized holding gains and losses are
    generally recorded in other comprehensive income. However, if a
    decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary,
    the cost basis is written down to fair value through earnings.
    During the year ended June 27, 2008, the Company realized
    $3 million in losses on sales and recognized
    $10 million in other-than-temporary impairment losses on
    these auction-rate securities.

Note 11.

Komag
    Acquisition

The Company completed the Acquisition on September 5, 2007
    through a cash tender offer by State M Corporation (“State
    M”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
    for all outstanding shares of Komag’s common stock, which
    was followed by a merger of State M and Komag whereby Komag
    became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and
    changed its name to WD Media. WD Media’s results of
    operations since the date of the Acquisition are included in the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Purchase
    Price Allocation

The aggregate purchase price for Komag was $1.0 billion,
    consisting of cash paid for outstanding shares, transaction
    fees, severance and other employee-related equity payments. The
    application of purchase accounting under SFAS No. 141,
    “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141”),
    requires that the total purchase price be allocated to the fair
    value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their
    fair values at the acquisition date, with amounts exceeding the
    fair values being recorded as goodwill. The allocation process
    requires an analysis and valuation of acquired assets, including
    fixed assets, deferred tax assets, technologies, customer
    contracts and relationships, trade names and liabilities
    assumed, including contractual commitments and legal
    contingencies. The values assigned to certain acquired assets
    and liabilities were finalized as of June 27, 2008.

The Company has identified and recorded the assets, including
    specifically identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities
    assumed from Komag at their estimated fair values as of the date
    of the Acquisition, and has allocated the residual value to
    goodwill.

    production of its products. Existing technology was valued using
    the Excess Earnings Method under the Income Approach. This
    approach reflects the present value of projected cash flows that
    a market participant would expect to generate from these
    technologies less charges related to the contribution of other
    assets to those cash flows. The fair value of the existing
    technology is being amortized to Cost of Revenue over the
    weighted average useful life of 9.7 years.

The fair value of customer substrate relationships was
    determined using the Excess Earnings Method under the Income
    Approach based on the estimated revenues to be derived from
    Komag’s customers. This approach reflects the present value
    of projected cash flows that a market participant would expect
    to generate from these customer substrate relationships less
    charges related to the contribution of other assets to those
    cash flows. The fair values of the customer substrate
    relationships are being amortized to Cost of Revenue over the
    weighted average useful life of 3.0 years.

In-Process
    Research and Development

Komag had an in-process research and development project
    associated with technology for higher recording densities on
    advanced perpendicular recording media. The project is expected
    to incorporate significant changes in the magnetic structure of
    the media to achieve higher recording density. As these advanced
    products were not ready for commercial production and had no
    alternative future use, the development effort did not qualify
    for capitalization. Accordingly, the Company recorded
    $49 million as a charge to research and development expense
    at the time of the Acquisition. Costs to complete the
    development of this technology were expected to approximate
    $5 million as of the acquisition date and utilize existing
    engineering personnel. This technology may be necessary to
    remain competitive with anticipated industry advances in areal
    recording densities for thin-film media. The in-process research
    and development was valued using the Excess Earnings Method
    under the Income Approach. This approach reflects the present
    value of projected cash flows that a market participant would
    expect to generate from these technologies less costs related to
    the contribution of other assets to those cash flows.

Debt
    Assumed

In connection with the Acquisition, the Company assumed
    $250 million face value of additional debt in the form of
    Convertible Subordinated Notes (the “Notes”) issued by
    Komag on March 28, 2007. In accordance with the terms of
    the Notes, the Acquisition constituted a “Fundamental
    Change” that allowed the holders of the Notes to obligate
    the Company, for a limited period of time, to purchase the Notes
    for an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
    Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest through the purchase
    date. The holders of the Notes tendered their Notes to the
    Company and on December 5, 2007, the Company paid
    $250 million plus accrued and unpaid interest to purchase
    the Notes.

Adverse/Favorable
    Leasehold Interests

In accordance with the guidance in SFAS 141, the Company
    analyzed its contractual facility lease to determine the fair
    value of the leasehold interest. An adverse leasehold position
    exists when the present value of the contractual rental



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

obligation is greater than the present value of the market
    rental obligation, and conversely for a favorable leasehold
    interest. The Company recorded a favorable leasehold interest
    aggregating $4 million, which has been classified within
    Other Non-current Assets in the purchase price allocation table.
    The $4 million is being amortized to Cost of Revenue and
    Operating Expenses over the remaining duration of the lease,
    which ends December 31, 2014.

Recognition
    of Liabilities in Connection with Komag Acquisition

Under

EITF 95-3,

“Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Business
    Combination”, the Company accrued certain exit costs
    aggregating $40 million, which relate to employee severance
    and the cash payment for equity related liabilities payable to
    Komag employees. The following table summarizes the
    Company’s exit activities in connection with the

As of June 27, 2008, the accrued exit costs of

Stock-Based
    Compensation

In connection with the Acquisition, each outstanding option to
    purchase shares of Komag’s common stock with an exercise
    price below $32.25 as of the date of the Acquisition was
    converted into a right to receive $32.25 in cash less the
    exercise price of the option. In addition, each share of Komag
    restricted common stock granted on or before September 5,
    2007 was converted into $32.25 in cash. These converted option
    and restricted stock awards are payable in cash according to
    their original vesting schedules. All shares of restricted stock
    and options remain subject to their original terms, including
    the terms and conditions of Komag’s Amended and Restated
    2002 Qualified Stock Plan, the applicable restricted stock and
    option agreement and the Merger Agreement. As of June 27,
    2008, the future expense for the converted Komag unvested
    options and restricted stock awards is $4 million to be
    paid in cash, which will be expensed based on individual award
    vesting terms through April 2010.

Pro Forma
    Financial Information

The unaudited financial information in the table below
    summarizes the combined results of operations of the Company and
    Komag prior to the Acquisition, on a pro forma basis, as though
    the companies had been combined as of July 1, 2006 for each
    period presented. The pro forma financial information presented
    includes adjustments to certain periods related to the fair
    value of acquired inventory and fixed assets, amortization
    charges from acquired intangible assets, stock-based
    compensation charges for unvested options and unvested
    restricted stock awards exchanged and to be paid in cash and the
    related tax effects of those adjustments. The pro forma
    financial information is presented for informational purposes
    only and is not indicative of the results of operations that
    would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at
    the beginning of the earliest period presented, nor does it

WESTERN

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(1)

The first quarter of 2008 included $60 million for taxes
    related to the license of intellectual property to subsidiaries
    and $49 million for acquired in-process research and
    development. The fourth quarter of 2008 included
    $15 million for taxes related to the license of
    intellectual property to subsidiaries.

(2)

The fourth quarter of 2007 included a $126 million benefit
    to income taxes from an adjustment to the valuation allowance
    for deferred income taxes. This benefit is net of an adjustment
    made in the fourth quarter to reduce the deferred tax asset and
    the related valuation allowance by approximately
    $21 million to correct the amount of state deferred tax
    asset recognized in prior periods. As both the deferred tax
    asset and the related valuation allowance were overstated in
    prior periods, there was no net effect to the total assets or
    net income as reported in those prior periods, or in the fourth
    quarter of 2007.

Changes

    Financial Disclosure

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As required by SEC

Rule 13a-15(b)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”), we carried out an evaluation, under
    the supervision and with the participation of our management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
    disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period
    covered by this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over
    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in
    reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
    and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable
    assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to
    permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts
    and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
    authorizations of our management and our directors; and
    (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
    of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial
    statements.

Our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework.

Based on this evaluation, our management
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm
    which audited the consolidated financial statements included in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

has issued an audit report on our internal control over
    financial reporting. See page 48 herein.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended June 27,
    2008 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations of Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and its
    Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure
    controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial
    reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control
    system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
    only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
    the control system are met. Further, the benefits of controls
    must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the
    inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
    controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
    and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These
    inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
    decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
    because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can
    be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
    collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
    the control. The design of any system of controls is also based
    in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
    events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
    succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
    conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a
    cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or
    fraud may occur and not be detected.
