PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Western Digital Corporation (the
“Company” or “Western Digital”) designs,
develops, manufactures and markets hard disk drives, one of the
key components found in most computers and data storage
subsystems. Hard disk drives are also found in a number of
consumer electronics (“CE”) devices. A hard disk drive
is a device that stores data on one or more rotating magnetic
disks to allow fast access to non-volatile data for computing
needs. The Company’s hard disk drives are used in desktop
personal computers (“PCs”), enterprise servers,
network attached storage devices, an expanding list of CE
products such as video game consoles, personal/digital video
recorders, satellite and cable set-top boxes, and as external
storage devices. The Company’s hard disk drive products
currently include 3.5-inch form factor drives with capacities
ranging from 8 gigabytes (“GB”) to 250 GB,
nominal rotation speeds of 5400, 7200 and 10,000 revolutions per
minute (“RPM”), and offer interfaces including
Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (“EIDE”), Serial
Advanced Technology Attachment (“SATA”), 1394/
FireWire/ i.Link

TM

and Universal Serial Bus
(“USB”). The Company sells its products worldwide to
computer manufacturers for inclusion in their computer systems
or subsystems, to CE manufacturers for inclusion into their
devices, and to distributors, resellers and retailers. The
Company’s hard disk drive products are currently
manufactured in Malaysia and Thailand. For geographical
financial data, see the Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements and Note 9 thereto included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. In this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, the Company refers to market data available from
TrendFOCUS, Inc. (“TrendFOCUS”) and Gartner/
Dataquest, Inc. (“Gartner”), both of which are leading
market research and analysis firms that provide data regarding
the hard disk drive industry.

Industry

Western Digital’s primary business focus is
the sale of hard disk drives to the desktop PC, enterprise and
CE markets.

Desktop PC Market.

Desktop PCs are used in a number of environments,
ranging from homes to businesses and multi-user networks.
Software applications are used on desktop PCs for word
processing, spreadsheet, desktop publishing, database
management, multimedia, entertainment and other related
applications. Hard disk drives store both software applications
and the data used by these software applications. The Company
believes that the demand for hard disk drives in the PC market
has grown in part due to:

TrendFOCUS estimates that the aggregate number of
desktop PCs sold during calendar year 2003 was 115 million
units and will increase to 152 million units in calendar
year 2008, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of
approximately 7%. The Company believes the rate of PC unit
growth is being influenced by several factors, including
maturing markets in North America and Western Europe, an
increase in first-time buyers in Eastern Europe and Asia, the
lengthening of PC replacement cycles and an increasing
preference for notebook systems. For an additional discussion of
changes in the PC market, see Part II, Item 7, under
the heading “Risk Factors That May Affect Future
Results.”

According to TrendFOCUS quarterly reports for
2004 and calendar year 2003, the desktop PC segment is the
largest market for hard disk drives, accounting for
approximately 65% of global hard disk drive shipments in 2004.
Approximately 90% of Western Digital’s hard disk drive unit
shipments in 2004 were to this market. TrendFOCUS estimates that
worldwide unit shipments of hard disk drives into this market
will grow from approximately 178 million units in calendar
year 2003 to approximately 232 million units in calendar
year 2007, and that revenue will grow from



approximately $12 billion to approximately
$14 billion during this period. This reflects compound
annual growth rates for unit shipments and revenues of
approximately 7% and 4%, respectively. Revenue growth is
expected to be lower than unit growth due to the ongoing trend
for lower cost PCs and competition within the industry. Although
the average selling prices (“ASPs”) of hard disk
drives are expected to continue to decline, the demand for
overall product quality and reliability continues to increase.

Most new desktop PC systems are equipped with
high-speed external interfaces, such as 1394/ FireWire/ i.Link
or USB. As a result, end users are able to supplement the
storage space of their PC systems with the use of external hard
disk drive products that connect via these high-speed
interfaces. These products are commonly used for storing
additional programs or multimedia content, or for backing up
internal hard disk drives.

Mobile Computing Market.

The mobile computing market, which includes
notebook computers, is expected to grow faster than any other PC
segment as performance and price continue to improve. TrendFOCUS
estimates that sales of notebook systems comprised approximately
28% of the combined market for desktop PCs and notebook systems
in 2003 and will increase to approximately 39% of the combined
market in 2008, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 22%.
Western Digital did not ship any hard disk drives to the mobile
PC market during 2004. However, the Company has announced
intentions to enter the mobile PC market with new, 2.5-inch form
factor product offerings before the end of calendar year 2004.

Enterprise Market.

The enterprise market for hard disk drives
focuses on customers that make workstations, servers, network
attached storage devices, storage area networks, and other
computing systems or subsystems. This market has been
traditionally served by hard disk drives that use the
small-computer-systems-interface (“SCSI”) standard.
Recently, however, SCSI hard disk drives are being replaced by
SATA and EIDE hard disk drives in certain enterprise storage
applications. SATA is an interface technology supported by
industry standards. SATA hard disk drives cost less than SCSI,
but offer improved reliability, scalability and performance over
EIDE hard disk drives in enterprise environments. TrendFOCUS
estimates that in calendar year 2004, approximately 30% of the
enterprise hard disk drive market will utilize EIDE or SATA hard
disk drives, and that this percentage will increase to 43% by
2007.

One example of growth in the enterprise market is
“near-line” storage. During the past few years, a new
disk-based back-up market has emerged with high-capacity EIDE
hard disk drives augmenting SCSI, tape and optical media. This
new trend, popularly referred to as “near-line”
storage, has become a growth market due to the ability of hard
disk drives to back-up or access data more quickly than tape or
optical solutions, and to quickly retrieve critical back-up or
near-line data. The increasing use of hard disk drives in
near-line storage applications is also being enhanced by the
availability of EIDE hard disk drive solutions, which are more
cost competitive as compared to SCSI hard disk drives.

In addition, EIDE drives are also being used in
unique clustering applications for databases, scientific
computation, web caching and electronic mail. This segment has
become a significant market for large capacity EIDE hard disk
drives, and the Company believes that this segment will continue
to consume a significant and growing portion of the
Company’s highest capacity hard disk drives.

According to a May 2004 report published by
TrendFOCUS, the market for enterprise and other non-desktop PC
applications of 3.5-inch form factor hard disk drives is
forecasted to grow from approximately 33 million units in
calendar year 2003 to approximately 83 million units in
calendar year 2007, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of
approximately 26%. For an additional discussion of the
non-desktop PC hard disk drive market, see Part II,
Item 7, under the heading “Risk Factors That May
Affect Future Results.”

Consumer Electronics Market.

Since 1999, hard disk drive-based recorders of
audio and video content have been available for use in home
entertainment systems. Commonly called personal video recorders
(“PVRs”) or digital video recorders
(“DVRs”), these consumer devices offer the end-user
enhanced features such as pausing live television, simplifying
the process of recording and cataloging recorded television
programs and quickly forwarding or rewinding to any section of a
recorded television program. In addition, hard disk drives are
being increasingly incorporated into DVD recorders to allow for
PVR/DVR functionality and faster recording of content onto
removable DVDs. New devices are being developed that generate,
store



and play audio, video, graphic images and other
multimedia content. Gartner forecasts that unit shipments of
hard disk drives into the audio-video market will grow from
approximately 10 million units in calendar year 2003 to
approximately 58 million units in calendar year 2008,
reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 42%. For further
discussion of the audio-video market, see Part II,
Item 7, under the heading “Risk Factors That May
Affect Future Results.”

Another segment of the CE market is the inclusion
of hard disk drives in electronic game devices. According to
TrendFOCUS, home electronic game devices that include hard disk
drives had sales of approximately 10 million units in
calendar year 2003, with an expected compound annual growth rate
of approximately 14% through calendar year 2008. For an
additional discussion of the video game market, see
Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk Factors
That May Affect Future Results.”

Other Market Opportunities.

The Company continuously evaluates opportunities
to apply its knowledge of data storage technology beyond current
markets for hard disk drives. New business opportunities are
evaluated for their direct impact on the Company’s ability
to increase the sale of hard disk drives. The Company monitors
the development of new markets related to data or content
storage and may, from time to time, offer new products or
services to address appropriate new form factors, interfaces or
markets. Conversely, depending on the development of such
markets and the Company’s ability to achieve its goals, the
Company may, from time to time, withdraw from certain markets.

Products

The Company offers a broad line of hard disk
drives designed for various market segments. Western
Digital’s products are marketed under the WD Caviar®,
WD Protégé® and WD Raptor® brand names, and
each product line is designed for a particular market segment.
The Company’s WD Caviar and WD Protégé hard disk
drive products are designed to serve distinct portions of the
desktop PC market. WD Caviar hard disk drives are designed for
the advanced performance segment of the desktop PC market and
the server and external storage markets, and WD

The WD Caviar and WD
Protégé hard disk drive families currently consist of
3.5-inch form factor products with capacities ranging from 8 GB
to 250 GB and nominal rotation speeds of 5400 and 7200 RPM.
These products utilize either the EIDE or SATA interfaces,
providing high performance while retaining ease of use and
overall low cost of connection. The type of EIDE interface
currently used in a majority of the Company’s hard disk
drives is ATA/100, which signifies a burst data transfer rate of
100 megabytes per second. The SATA interface available in
certain of the Company’s WD Caviar Special
Edition

TM

hard disk drives enable transfer rates as
high as 150 megabytes per second. The Company also sells a
line of external hard disk drives and related adapters that are
designed to accommodate external storage interfaces including
1394/ FireWire/i.Link and USB. The 1394/ FireWire/ i.Link

additional external, portable storage capacity to desktop and
laptop computers.

Mobile Hard Disk Drive
Products.

Hard disk drives used in
mobile products typically include 2.5-, 1.8- or 1.0-inch form
factor drives. Although the desktop PC market accounts for a
majority of hard disk drive sales, unit shipments of hard disk
drives for the mobile market are increasing. TrendFOCUS
forecasts that unit sales of hard disk drives to the mobile
market will grow from approximately 50 million in calendar
year 2003 to approximately 128 million in calendar year
2007, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately
26%. The Company has announced intentions to enter the 2.5-inch
mobile market before the end of calendar year 2004. In addition,
the Company has indicated its plans to develop and bring to
market smaller form factor drives.

Consumer Electronics
Products.

The Company offers design
capabilities and hard disk drive technologies for consumer
applications. The Company currently offers hard disk drive
products designed for use in consumer audio-video applications
such as PVRs and DVRs. It also offers products for the video
game console market, and provides hard disk drives for other
consumer electronics products.

Technology and Product Development

Hard disk drives are used to record, store and
retrieve digital data. Their performance attributes are
currently better than removable or floppy disks, optical hard
disk drives and tapes, and they are more cost effective than
semiconductor technology. The primary measures of hard disk
drive performance include:

All of the Company’s hard disk drive
products employ similar technology. The main components of the
hard disk drive are the head disk assembly and the printed
circuit board. The head disk assembly includes the head, media
(disks), head positioning mechanism (actuator) and spin motor.
These components are contained in a hard base plate protective
package in a contamination-controlled environment. The printed
circuit board includes both standard and custom integrated
circuits, an interface connector to the host computer and a
power connector.

The head disk assembly is comprised of one or
more disks positioned around a spindle hub that rotates the
disks by a spin motor. Disks are made of a smooth substrate to
which a thin coating of magnetic materials is applied. Each disk
has a head suspended directly above it, which can read data from
or write data to the spinning disk.

The integrated circuits on the printed circuit
board typically include a drive interface and a controller. The
drive interface receives instructions from the computer, while
the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and
controls the heads. The location of data on each disk is
logically maintained in concentric tracks that are divided into
sectors. The computer sends instructions to the controller to
read data from or write data to the disks based on track and
sector locations. Guided by instructions from the controller,
the head stack assembly is pivoted and swung across the disk by
a head actuator or motor until it reaches the selected track of
a disk, where the data is recorded or retrieved.

Industry standard interfaces are utilized to
allow the hard disk drive to communicate with the computer.
Currently, the primary interface for desktop PCs is EIDE, and
the primary interface for enterprise systems is SCSI. As
computer performance continues to improve, the hard disk drive
will need to deliver information faster than these interfaces
can handle. The Company believes that the desktop PC industry
plans to transition to higher speed interfaces, such as SATA, to
handle the higher data transfer rates. The Company currently
offers its WD Caviar Special Edition SATA hard disk



drive, a 7200 RPM drive featuring capacities
as large as 250 GB and designed for the high-end PC,
workstation, server, and external storage markets. The Company
believes that SATA is also becoming a more popular interface in
the enterprise market. Western Digital currently offers its
WD Raptor hard disk drive, a 10,000 RPM
enterprise-class drive with the SATA interface, and the WD
Caviar RAID Edition hard disk drive, a 7200 RPM drive
manufactured to enterprise-class standards and available with a
SATA interface. The Company is working to develop additional
products that will support these higher speed interfaces.

Storage capacity of the hard disk drive, as
manufactured by Western Digital, is determined by the number of
disks and each disk’s areal density, which is a measure of
the amount of data that can be stored on the recording surface
of the disk. The higher the areal density, the more information
can be stored on a single platter. As the areal density
increases, fewer disks and/or heads are required to achieve a
given drive capacity, thus reducing product costs through
reduced component requirements.

Head technology is one of the variables affecting
areal density. Historically, there have been rapid technological
changes, resulting in several generations of head technology in
a relatively short period of time. However, in recent years the
time has lengthened between changes in generations of head
technology. Currently, the desktop hard disk drive industry uses
giant magnetoresistive head technology, which allows
significantly higher storage capacities than the previously
utilized thin-film head technology. All of the Company’s
hard disk drive product offerings currently employ giant
magnetoresistive head technology.

The Western Digital product line generally
leverages a common platform for various products within product
families with different capacities to serve the differing market
needs. This platform strategy results in commonality of
components across different products within product families,
which reduces exposure to changes in demand, facilitates
inventory management and allows the Company to achieve lower
costs through economies of scale purchasing. This platform
strategy also enables computer manufacturer customers to
leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product
models. The Company expects to continue to utilize this platform
strategy as it continues to develop products for the emerging
market for hard disk drives specifically designed for
audio-video applications, such as digital video recording
devices.

Constant innovations in research and development
are essential to the Company’s ability to compete. Hard
disk drive providers, including Western Digital, are evaluating
or implementing a number of technological innovations designed
to further increase hard disk drive performance and reduce
product costs.

For an additional discussion of technological
innovations, see Part II, Item 7, under the heading
“Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results.”

Sales and Distribution

The Company sells its products globally to system
manufacturers, distributors, resellers, systems integrators and
retailers. Manufacturers typically purchase components such as
hard disk drives and assemble them into the computer systems
they build. Distributors typically sell the Company’s
drives to small computer manufacturers, dealers, systems
integrators and other resellers.

Original Equipment Manufacturers
(“OEMs”).

Sales to OEMs
accounted for 51%, 52%, and 54% of the Company’s revenue in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2004, the
Company’s major OEM customers included Dell, Fujitsu,
Gateway (including sales to E-Machines prior to its acquisition
by Gateway in March 2004), Hewlett-Packard and IBM. Typically,
revenue from sales to certain OEMs account for more than 10% of
the Company’s revenue. For example, during 2004, sales to
Dell accounted for 14% of the Company’s revenue. During
2003, sales to Dell and Hewlett-Packard (including sales to
Compaq Computer after its merger with Hewlett-Packard in 2002)
accounted for 20% and 13% of revenue, respectively. During 2002,
sales to Dell and Hewlett-Packard (including sales to Compaq
computer prior to its merger with Hewlett-Packard in 2002)
accounted for 15% and 13% of revenue, respectively. The Company
believes that its success depends on its ability to maintain and
improve its strong relationships with the leading computer
manufacturers. Since 2000, Seagate Technology, Western Digital,
and Maxtor (which merged with Quantum in 2000) have had the
highest market share with these manufacturers.

System manufacturers evaluate and select their
hard disk drive suppliers based on a number of factors,
including overall quality and reliability, storage capacities,
performance characteristics, price, service and support, ease of
doing



business, and the supplier’s long-term
financial stability. They typically seek to qualify two or more
providers for each generation of hard disk drives, and once a
computer manufacturer has chosen its qualified hard disk drive
vendors for a given product, it generally will purchase hard
disk drives from those vendors for the life of that product. To
achieve success with system manufacturers’ qualifications,
a hard disk drive supplier must consistently offer hard disk
drives featuring leading technology, quality, reliability and
acceptable capacity per disk. Suppliers must quickly achieve
volume production of high quality and reliable hard disk drives.
To quickly achieve high volume production, a hard disk drive
supplier must have access to flexible, high-capacity,
high-quality manufacturing capabilities.

Many of the Company’s OEM customers utilize
just-in-time inventory management processes or supply chain
business models that combine “build-to-order”
(computer manufacturer does not build until there is a firm
order) and “contract manufacturing” (computer
manufacturer contracts assembly work to a contract manufacturer
who purchases components and assembles the computer based on the
computer manufacturer’s instructions). For certain key OEMs
the Company maintains a base stock of finished goods inventory
in facilities located near or adjacent to the OEM’s
operations.

For an additional discussion of the need to adapt
to customers’ business models and maintain customer
satisfaction, refer to Part II, Item 7, under the
heading “Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results.”

Distributors.

The
Company uses a select group of distributors to sell its products
to small computer manufacturers, resellers, dealers and systems
integrators. During 2004, the Company’s major distributor
customers included ASI, Bell, eSys Distribution, Ingram Micro,
and Tech Data. Distributors accounted for approximately 42%,
40%, and 39% of the Company’s revenue for 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. Distributors generally enter into
non-exclusive agreements for specific territories with the
Company for purchase and redistribution of product. The Company
grants its distributors limited price protection and stock
rotation rights.

Retailers.

The
Company sells its retail-packaged products directly to a select
group of major retailers such as computer superstores, warehouse
clubs and computer electronics stores, and authorizes sales
through distributors to smaller retailers. During 2004, major
retailers to whom the Company sold directly included Best Buy,
Circuit City, Comp USA, Fry’s Electronics, and OfficeMax.
Retailers accounted for approximately 7%, 8%, and 7% of the
Company’s revenue for each of 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The Company’s current retail customer base is
primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe. The retail
channel complements the Company’s other sales channels
while helping to build brand awareness for the Company and its
products. Retailers supply the aftermarket “upgrade”
and data back-up sectors in which end-users purchase and install
products to upgrade their computers and externally store their
data for back-up purposes. The Company grants certain of its
retailers price protection and limited rights to return product
on an inventory rotation basis. The Company also sells its
retail-packaged products through the Internet, at its web site.

The Company maintains sales offices throughout
North America, Eastern and Western Europe, the Middle East,
Japan and Asia/ Pacific. Field application engineering is
provided to strategic computer manufacturer accounts, and
localized end-user technical support services are provided
within the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia. The
Company’s localized end-user technical support is currently
supplied by employees and a third party provider through
telephone support, and via the Company’s web site.

The Company’s international sales, which
include sales to foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies but
do not include sales to U.S. subsidiaries of foreign
companies, represented 63%, 59%, and 50% of the Company’s
revenue for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Sales to
international customers may be subject to certain risks not
normally encountered in domestic operations, including exposure
to tariffs, various trade regulations and fluctuations in
currency exchange rates. See Part II, Item 7, under
the heading “Risk Factors That May Affect Future
Results.”

For additional information concerning revenue
recognition, sales by geographic region and significant customer
information, see Notes 1 and 9 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The Company’s marketing and advertising
functions are performed both internally and through outside
firms. Advertising, worldwide packaging and marketing materials
are targeted to various reseller and end-user segments. Western
Digital utilizes both consumer media and, to a lesser extent,
trade publications. The Company has programs under which
qualifying distributors and retailers are reimbursed for certain
marketing expenditures. Western Digital also maintains customer
relationships by communicating with its resellers and providing
end-users with pre-sale and post-sale information and support
through its web site.



Competition

The Company competes primarily with manufacturers
of 3.5-inch hard disk drives for desktop, enterprise and CE
systems. The Company’s competitors in the hard disk drive
market include Seagate Technology, Maxtor, Fujitsu, Hitachi
Global Storage Technologies, and Samsung. Over the last four
years, the hard disk drive industry has experienced
consolidation, decreasing the number of major competitors. In
particular, Maxtor acquired the hard disk drive business of
Quantum, Fujitsu exited the desktop hard disk drive market, and
IBM sold its hard disk drive business to Hitachi Global Storage
Technologies.

The hard disk drive industry is intensely
competitive, with hard disk drive suppliers competing for sales
to a limited number of major customers. Hard disk drives
manufactured by different competitors are highly substitutable
due to the industry mandate of technical form, fit and function
standards. Hard disk drive manufacturers compete on the basis of
product quality and reliability, storage capacity, unit price,
product performance, production volume capabilities, delivery
capability, leadership in time-to-market, time-to-volume and
time-to-quality, service and support, and ease of doing
business. The relative importance of these factors varies
between different customer and market segments. The Company
believes that it is generally competitive in all of these
factors.

The Company believes that the markets in which it
competes, and those in which it plans to enter in the near
future, such as the mobile market, are at or approaching high
volume mass market, where market acceptance and consumer demand
for products are strong. This represents a significant change in
the industry. In prior years, the mobile, handheld and
enterprise markets were relatively small with low volumes and
high prices. As these markets continue to grow, consumers will
demand lower cost points for the products that utilize these
drives. As a result, it will be necessary for suppliers to offer
high quality, reliable products at low cost to be able to
effectively compete. The Company believes that its model enables
it to deliver products with superior quality and reliability at
a low cost.

The Company believes that there are no
substantial barriers for existing competitors to offer competing
products. Therefore, the Company believes that it cannot
differentiate its hard disk drive products solely on attributes
such as storage capacity, buffer size or time-to-market.
Accordingly, the Company differentiates itself by focusing on
high product quality and reliability, and designing and
incorporating into its hard disk drives desirable product
performance attributes, such as seek time, data transfer rates,
intelligent caching, failure prediction, remote diagnostics,
acoustics and data recovery. In addition, the Company emphasizes
non-product related attributes, including rapid response with
its customers. Rapid response requires accelerated design
cycles, customer delivery, production flexibility and timely
service and support, which contribute to customer satisfaction.
The Company also relies on the strength of the Western Digital
brand name with value-added resellers and solution providers to
whom the Company sells its hard disk drive products directly and
indirectly. The Company believes that trust in a
manufacturer’s reputation and the establishment of
strategic relationships have become important factors in the
selection of a hard disk drive, particularly within such a
rapidly changing technology environment.

Advances in magnetic, optical or other data
storage technologies could result in competitive products that
have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than
the Company’s hard disk drive products. High-speed
semiconductor memory could compete with the Company’s hard
disk drive products in the future. Semiconductor memory is much
faster than magnetic hard disk drives, but currently is not
competitive from a cost standpoint. Flash memory, a non-volatile
semiconductor memory, is currently much more costly and, while
it has higher “read” performance than hard disk
drives, it has lower “write” performance. Flash memory
could become competitive in the near future for applications
requiring less storage capacity than that provided by hard disk
drives.

For an additional discussion of competition, see
Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk Factors
That May Affect Future Results.”

Service and Warranty

Western Digital generally warrants its newly
manufactured hard disk drives against defects in materials and
workmanship for a period of one to five years from the date of
sale. The Company’s warranty obligation is generally
limited to repair or replacement of the hard disk drive. The
Company has engaged third parties in Australia, Brazil, Canada,
China, Germany, Hungary, India, Korea, Russia, Singapore, and
the United Arab Emirates to provide various levels of testing,
processing and/or recertification of returned hard disk drives
for the Company’s customers. In addition, the Company
processes, tests and recertifies returned hard disk drives at
its own facility in the United States.



Manufacturing

To be competitive, Western Digital must
manufacture high quality hard disk drives with industry leading
time-to-volume production at competitive unit costs. The Company
strives to maintain manufacturing flexibility and high
manufacturing yields, while insisting that its suppliers provide
high-quality components at competitive prices. The critical
elements of Western Digital’s hard disk drive production
are high volume, low cost assembly and testing, and
establishment and maintenance of key vendor relationships. By
establishing partner relationships with its strategic component
suppliers, the Company believes it is able to access
“best-of-class” manufacturing quality. In addition,
the Company believes that its sourcing strategy currently
enables it to have the business flexibility needed to select the
highest quality low cost suppliers as product designs and
technologies evolve.

Hard disk drive manufacturing is a complex
process involving the assembly of precision components with
narrow tolerances and thorough testing. The assembly process
occurs in a “clean room” environment that demands
skill in process engineering and efficient utilization of the
“clean room” layout in order to reduce the high
operating costs of this manufacturing environment. The
Company’s clean room manufacturing process consists of
modular production units, each of which contains a number of
work cells.

The Company produces hard disk drives in two
plants, one in Malaysia and one in Thailand. The Company
continually evaluates its manufacturing processes in an effort
to increase productivity, sustain and improve quality and
decrease manufacturing costs. For example, in order to improve
efficiency and reduce costs, the Company closed two
manufacturing facilities in Singapore during 1999 and 2000 and
relocated its hard disk drive production to Malaysia. During
2002, in response to an increase in demand and in order to
capitalize on the local supplier base, the Company completed the
acquisition of a Thailand manufacturing facility. The Company
continually evaluates which steps in the manufacturing process
would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing
processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing
costs.

In July 2003, the Company purchased substantially
all of the assets of Read-Rite Corporation, formerly one of the
Company’s suppliers of heads, including its wafer
fabrication equipment in Fremont, California and its slider
fabrication facility in Bang Pa-In, Thailand. The Company uses
these facilities to design and manufacture a substantial portion
of the head gimbal assemblies (“HGAs”) and head stack
assemblies (“HSAs”) for use in hard disk drives it
manufactures.

For an additional discussion of manufacturing,
see Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk
Factors That May Affect Future Results.”

Research and Development

The Company devotes substantial resources to
development of new products and improvement of existing
products. The Company focuses its engineering efforts on
coordinating its product design and manufacturing processes in
order to bring its products to market in a cost-effective and
timely manner. Research and development expenses for continuing
operations totaled $201 million, $135 million and
$120 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

For further discussion of product development,
see Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk
Factors That May Affect Future Results.”

Materials and Supplies

The principal components currently used in the
manufacture of the Company’s hard disk drives are magnetic
heads and related HSAs, media, controllers, spindle motors and
mechanical parts used in the head disk assembly. In addition to
custom semiconductor devices, the Company also uses standard
semiconductor components such as logic, memory and
microprocessor devices obtained from other manufacturers and a
wide variety of other parts, including connectors, cables, and
other interconnect technology.

The Company designs and manufactures a
substantial portion of the heads required for the hard disk
drives it manufactures. The Company also purchases a portion of
these components from third party suppliers. During 2004, the
Company bought giant magnetoresistive heads from ALPS Electric
Co., Ltd. and TDK Corporation’s subsidiary, SAE Magnetics
Ltd.



The Company acquires all of the remaining
components for its products from third party suppliers. The
Company tries to have multiple suppliers for each of its
component requirements. For example, during 2004, the
Company’s media requirements were purchased from several
outside vendors including Komag, Showa Denko KK and Trace
Storage Technology Corporation. The Company has a volume
purchase agreement with Komag under which the Company is
obligated to purchase a percentage of its requirements for hard
disk media from Komag as long as Komag’s prices, technology
and quality remain competitive.

Although the Company tries to have multiple
suppliers for each of its component requirements, some
components are currently sole-sourced. For example, some custom
integrated circuit devices are currently sole-sourced from
STMicroelectronics, IBM and Marvell Semiconductor, Inc. The
Company has entered into volume purchase agreements with IBM and
Marvell to purchase custom integrated circuit devices at
negotiated quantities and prices. Because of their custom
nature, these products require significant design-in periods and
long lead times. There has been a trend in integrated circuit
design toward increased integration of various separate
circuits. The Company expects this trend to continue in the area
of custom integrated circuits for hard disk drives.

For an additional discussion of component
supplies, see Part II, Item 7, under the heading
“Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results.”

Backlog

Historically, a substantial portion of the
Company’s orders has been for shipments within 30 to
60 days of the placement of the order. The Company
generally negotiates pricing, order lead times, product support
requirements and other terms and conditions prior to receiving a
computer manufacturer’s first purchase order for a product.
Customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with
relatively short notice to the Company, with little or no cost
to the customer, or modified by customers to provide for
delivery at a later date. In addition, many of the
Company’s sales to OEMs are made under just-in-time
delivery contracts that do not generally require firm order
commitments by the customer until the time of sale. Instead, the
Company receives a periodic forecast of requirements from the
customer, and the customer is invoiced upon shipment of the
product from the just-in-time warehouse. Therefore, backlog
information as of the end of a particular period is not
necessarily indicative of future levels of the Company’s
revenue and profit and may not be comparable to earlier periods.

Patents, Licenses and Proprietary
Information

The Company owns numerous patents and has many
patent applications in process. The Company believes that,
although its patents and patent applications have considerable
value, the successful manufacturing and marketing of its
products depends primarily upon the technical and managerial
competence of its personnel. Accordingly, the patents held and
applied for do not assure the Company’s future success.

In addition to patent protection of certain
intellectual property rights, the Company considers elements of
its product designs and processes to be proprietary and
confidential. The Company believes that its non-patented
intellectual property, particularly some of its process
technology, is an important factor in its success. Western
Digital relies upon non-disclosure agreements and contractual
provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect its
proprietary information. Despite these safeguards, there is a
risk that competitors may obtain and use such information. The
laws of foreign jurisdictions in which the Company conducts
business also may provide less protection for confidential
information than the United States.

The Company relies on certain technology that is
licensed from other parties in order to manufacture and sell its
products. The Company believes that it has adequate
cross-licenses and other agreements in place in addition to its
own intellectual property portfolio to compete successfully in
the hard disk drive industry.

For additional discussion of intellectual
property, see Part II, Item 7, under the heading
“Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results.”

Environmental Regulation

The Company is subject to a variety of
regulations in connection with its operations. It believes that
it has obtained or is in the process of obtaining all necessary
environmental permits for its operations.



Employees

As of July 2, 2004, the Company employed a
total of 17,376 employees worldwide. This represents an increase
in headcount of approximately 51% since June 27, 2003 and
an increase of approximately 82% since June 28, 2002. The
increase is primarily the result of the Company’s
acquisition of Read-Rite’s assets in July 2003 and the
purchase of a manufacturing facility in Thailand during 2002 in
response to an increase in unit sales.

Many of the Company’s employees are highly
skilled, and the Company’s continued success depends in
part upon its ability to attract and retain such employees.
Accordingly, the Company offers employee benefit programs, which
it believes are at least equivalent to those offered by its
competitors. Despite these programs, the Company has, along with
most of its competitors, experienced difficulty at times in
hiring and retaining certain skilled personnel. When the Company
is unable to hire personnel in the ordinary course of business,
it uses third parties to help satisfy its personnel needs. In
addition, the Company has utilized consultants and contract
personnel to fill these needs until full-time employees could be
recruited. The Company has never experienced a work stoppage,
none of its domestic employees are represented by a labor
organization, and the Company considers its employee relations
to be good.

Business Overview

Western Digital designs, develops, manufactures
and markets hard disk drives for digital information storage.
The Company’s hard disk drives are used in desktop PCs,
enterprise servers, network attached storage devices, an
expanding list of CE products such as video game consoles,
personal/digital video recorders and satellite and cable set-top
boxes, and as external storage devices. Western Digital markets
its hard disk drives directly to PC manufacturers, including
large, brand name PC manufacturers such as Dell and Hewlett
Packard; to CE manufacturers; and to distributors, resellers and
retailers that serve a wide range of end users. Unless otherwise
noted, all references to market share and industry data included
in this discussion are according to the Gartner report published
in April of 2004.

Western Digital builds hard disk drives in
assembly facilities in Malaysia and Thailand. The Company also
builds hard disk drive components such as printed circuit board
assemblies and head stack assemblies in its Malaysia and
Thailand facilities. In July 2003, the Company acquired head
manufacturing facilities in California and Thailand, and
currently produces a significant portion of its head
requirements. Western Digital procures other components from
industry-leading technology companies, many of which work with
the Company from design and development through manufacturing.

Currently, eight hard disk drive vendors compete
in the $22 billion-a-year hard disk drive market, compared
to fifteen vendors in calendar year 2000. According to Gartner
quarterly reports published in 2004 and calendar year 2003,
Western Digital, Seagate Technology, Maxtor Corporation, and
Hitachi Global Storage Technologies supplied approximately 80%
of the total hard disk drive market during 2004.

The Company focuses on providing quality
products, superior customer service and flexibility by managing
its technology deployment, manufacturing, cost, delivery,
quality and reliability. Western Digital believes that its low
cost business model allows it to access leading-edge component
technologies and cost-saving innovations while minimizing
investment expenditures.

Western Digital’s growth will be influenced
greatly by developments in the PC hard disk drive market.
Gartner estimates that unit shipments of hard disk drives in the
desktop PC market will grow by approximately 4% per year
through calendar year 2008. The Company has increased its
resources to address certain fast-growing geographic markets
such as Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Russia. The
Company’s revenue in Asia during 2004 increased to 29% of
total revenue as compared to 22% of total revenue for 2003.
Gartner estimates that demand for desktop PC hard disk drives in
Asia will increase 12% per year through calendar year 2008.

Because CE demand for hard disk drives is
relatively new, with many consumer applications currently
employing similar hard disk drive technology as is found in
desktop PCs, Western Digital presently believes it can expand
shipments into this developing market. As this market develops,
additional investments by the Company may be required. Gartner
estimates that unit shipments of 3.5-inch form factor hard disk
drives in CE markets will grow by approximately 26% per
year through calendar year 2008.

The Company is also pursuing new revenue
opportunities in non-PC, information technology (“IT”)
applications through its application of the SATA interface. The
SATA interface contains many of the same benefits of
SCSI — the predominant interface currently used in
most enterprise hard disk drive applications — at a
lower cost. TrendFOCUS estimates that 43% of enterprise hard
disk drive unit shipments will use the EIDE or SATA interface by
calendar year 2007.

In addition to the CE and SATA growth
opportunities, the Company has plans to enter the mobile hard
disk drive market in calendar year 2004 to provide hard disk
drives for notebook PCs. Gartner forecasts that unit sales of
2.5-inch form factor hard disk drives to the mobile computing
market will grow from an estimated 47 million in calendar
year 2003 to approximately 97 million in calendar year
2008, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately
15%.



Fiscal 2004 Overview

According to quarterly reports for 2004 and
calendar year 2003 from Gartner, the desktop hard disk drive
market increased by approximately 17% based on unit shipments.
Based on quarterly reports published by Gartner in 2004 and
calendar 2003, the Company believes that its market share in
desktop hard disk drives increased to 24% from 23% in 2003.
While Western Digital’s unit shipments grew by 22% in 2004,
the average selling price of its hard disk drives declined by 8%
due to aggressive pricing pressures and mix of products.

In 2004, Western Digital’s net revenue
increased by 12%, to $3.0 billion, on unit shipments of
48.3 million. However, in 2004, gross margin decreased to
15.2% from 16.3% in 2003 primarily as a result of aggressive
pricing pressures. In addition, the Company incurred
approximately $50 million of start-up expenses and other
charges related to the acquisition of substantially all the
assets of Read-Rite Corporation (“Read-Rite”) in July
2003. These factors offset the ongoing positive contribution of
the Company’s newly acquired head manufacturing operations.
As a result, operating income decreased by $31.9 million,
to $154.9 million, and operating margins decreased to 5.1%
as a percentage of net revenue, compared with 6.9% in 2003. For
2005, the Company expects incremental benefits from its
integrated head operations; however, it is not clear whether
this will be enough to offset any continued downward pressure on
gross margin caused by competitive pricing. Western Digital
generated $190.0 million in cash flow from operations in
2004 and finished the year with $377.8 million in cash and
cash equivalents, a decrease of $15.4 million from the
prior year’s balance.

Read Rite Asset Acquisition

In June 2003, Read-Rite, then one of the
Company’s suppliers of magnetic recording heads, commenced
voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings. On
July 31, 2003, Western Digital purchased substantially all
of the assets of Read-Rite, including its wafer fabrication
equipment in Fremont, California and manufacturing facility in
Bang Pa-In, Thailand. The cost of the acquisition was
$172.0 million and consisted of cash consideration of
$94.8 million, assumed debt obligations of the Thailand
operations of approximately $60.2 million, direct costs of
the acquisition and other miscellaneous assumed obligations
totaling $17.0 million. Proceeds from a $50 million
term loan were used to repay obligations assumed as a result of
the acquired head manufacturing operations in Thailand.

Western Digital’s acquisition of the head
manufacturing operations represented a fundamental change in the
Company’s operating structure as the Company is now
manufacturing heads for use in its hard disk drives. Previously,
the Company purchased all of its recording head requirements
from external suppliers, including Read-Rite. The Company
acquired the Read-Rite assets for the following reasons:

Taking the asset acquisition into consideration,
the Company expects its long-term financial business model to
benefit from a higher gross margin percentage, offset by higher
research and development expenses, than it otherwise would have
had without the acquisition. The gross margin percentage
improvement will result from lower cost of sales, as the Company
develops the ability to manufacture heads at a lower cost than
what it would have otherwise paid external suppliers. This is
expected to result in higher operating income than it otherwise
would have had without the acquisition.

The Company began realizing these net financial
benefits in 2004. However, these benefits were offset by
downward pressures on gross margins caused by an aggressive
pricing environment. The incremental benefits from an integrated
head manufacturing operation are expected to increase as the
Company continues to ramp its head manufacturing capability. The
Company is currently satisfying a substantial portion of its
head requirements through its own head manufacturing operations.

As a result of integrating the head manufacturing
operations, the Company carries a higher percentage of fixed
costs than assumed in its prior financial business model. For
example, depreciation expense for the head manufacturing
operations is expected to be between $15 million and
$20 million per quarter by the end of 2005.



Capital expenditures and working capital
investments required to support the head manufacturing
operations will increase when compared to the Company’s
prior financial business model. For example, capital
expenditures related to the head manufacturing operations are
expected to average between $80 million and
$100 million on an annual basis after initial capital
investments are completed. Also, inventory turns are expected to
decrease to between 17 and 19 from the Company’s historical
average of between 20 and 22.

The Company accounted for this transaction as an
asset acquisition. The estimated fair value of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed are as follows:

As of the date of the acquisition, Read-Rite had
two in-process research and development (“IPR&D”)
projects: 120 gigabyte per platter and 160 gigabyte per platter
products. The fair value allocated to these projects as part of
the acquisition was $17.8 million and $7.8 million,
respectively. The multi-period excess earnings method, a
discounted cash flow income approach, was used to determine the
value allocated to the IPR&D. The rate utilized to discount
the cash flows to their present values was based on the weighted
average cost of capital and an additional risk premium based on
an analysis of the technology and the IPR&D stages of
completion. Based on these factors, 27% was used as the annual
discount rate. These acquired IPR&D projects had not reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use.
Accordingly, the Company recorded the $25.6 million as a
charge to research and development expense at the time of the
acquisition.

Results of Operations

Summary of 2004, 2003 and 2002
    Comparison

The following table sets forth, for the periods
indicated, summary information from the Company’s
statements of income (in millions).

Net
Revenue

Net revenue was $3.0 billion for 2004, an
increase of 12%, or $328 million, from 2003. Total unit
shipments increased to 48.3 million for the year as
compared to 39.7 million from the prior year as a result of
an increase in market share and overall demand for hard disk
drives in the desktop PC market. This growth in units was
partially offset by a $5 per unit decline in average
selling prices (“ASPs”) to $63 per unit for 2004
from $68 per unit in 2003.

Revenue by geographic region for 2004 was 41%
from the Americas, 30% from Europe and 29% from Asia, compared
to 48%, 30% and 22%, respectively, for 2003. These changes
reflect the Company’s continued focus on revenue growth in
emerging geographic markets.



Revenue by sales channel for 2004 was 51% from
OEMs, 42% from distributors and 7% from the retail channel,
compared to 52%, 40% and 8%, respectively, for 2003. The
distribution of revenue by sales channel has remained relatively
consistent for the past several quarters.

Net revenue increased $567 million or 26% in
2003 from 2002. This increase in net revenue was primarily due
to the Company’s improved market share as well as an
increase in demand for hard disk drives in the PC market. Unit
shipments increased to 39.7 million in 2003 from
29.1 million in 2002, partially offset by a decrease in
ASPs to $68 per unit in 2003 from $74 per unit in 2002.

Gross Margin

For 2004, gross margin percentage decreased to
15.2% from 16.3% for 2003. The decrease in gross margin
percentage over the prior year was primarily the result of
aggressive pricing pressures. The Company anticipates that
competitive pricing pressure may continue to adversely affect
gross margin percentages in 2005. Also contributing to the
decrease in the gross margin percentage were start-up expenses
and other charges totaling $18.1 million incurred during
the first quarter of 2004 relating to the Company’s head
manufacturing operations acquired in July 2003. Western Digital
was able to partially offset the impact of these pricing
conditions and start-up related costs with the ongoing accretive
benefit of its head manufacturing operations. For 2003, gross
margin percentage increased to 16.3% from 13.1% for 2002. This
increase in gross margin percentage was primarily a result of a
more moderate pricing environment, manufacturing efficiencies
associated with higher unit volume and continuing cost reduction
efforts, offset by an $18.5 million charge related to the
Cirrus Logic, Inc. litigation settlement.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses, consisting of research
and development (“R&D”) and selling, general and
administrative (“SG&A”), were 10.1% of net revenue
in 2004 as compared to 9.4% of net revenue in 2003 and 10.7% of
net revenue in 2002.

R&D expense was $201 million,
$135 million and $120 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The increase of $66 million in R&D
expense in 2004 from 2003 was primarily related to head-design,
mobile and enterprise platform development, as well as the
charge of $26 million incurred during the first quarter of
2004 for acquired IPR&D, offset by reduced employee
incentive payments. The $26 million charge related to
IPR&D projects acquired from Read-Rite that had not reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. As
of July 2, 2004, progress on these projects was consistent
with management’s original estimates, including the costs
incurred towards completion and projected release dates. The
increase of $15 million in R&D in 2003 over 2002 was
due to increases in new development programs and higher employee
incentive payments, partially offset by expense reduction
efforts.

SG&A expense was $106 million,
$121 million and $111 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The $15 million decrease in SG&A expense
in 2004 from 2003 was primarily due to a reduction in employee
incentive programs and reductions in baseline spending. The
$10 million increase in SG&A expense in 2003 from 2002
was primarily related to higher incentive payments resulting
from improved operational results.

The Company will continue to manage its operating
expense structure in line with its operating profit objectives.

Interest and Other Income

Net interest and other income was
$0.3 million, $2.9 million and $1.4 million in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This includes net investment
gains of $4.4 million in 2003 and $5.4 million in
2002. Excluding these items, net interest and other income
(expense) was $0.3 million, ($1.5) million and
($4.0) million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
increase in net interest income over the past two years was
primarily due to the Company’s redemption of its
convertible debentures during the third quarter of 2003,
resulting in lower interest expense as compared to 2002.

Income Tax Expense (Benefit)

Income tax expense was $3.9 million in 2004
as compared to $7.6 million in 2003 and an income tax
benefit of $1.1 million in 2002. The decrease in the income
tax expense of $3.7 million in 2004 primarily related to
lower overall



earnings and a more favorable mix of earnings
within certain tax jurisdictions. Differences between the
effective tax rate for 2004 of 2.5%, as compared to the
U.S. federal statutory rate, are primarily due to tax
holidays in Malaysia and Thailand that expire at various points
in time ranging from 2005 to 2014. The 2003 increase in the
income tax expense of $8.7 million from 2002 is primarily
related to higher overall earnings in 2003 and the
non-recurrence of certain tax benefits realized in 2002. The
Company’s 2002 net income tax benefit of
$1.1 million included a federal income tax refund of
$3.1 million for a loss carryback available as a result of
tax legislation enacted during that year.

Discontinued Operations

During 2002, the Company discontinued the
operations of new business ventures, including Connex, Inc.
(“Connex”), SANavigator, Inc.
(“SANavigator”) and Keen Personal Media, Inc.
(“Keen”). The Company sold substantially all of the
assets of its Connex and SANavigator businesses in 2002 for a
net gain of $24.5 million and terminated the Keen
operations. The 2002 operating losses for the new ventures and
the net gain recognized on the sale of Connex and SANavigator
have been excluded from continuing operations and reported
separately on the statements of income as discontinued
operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company had cash and cash equivalents of
$378 million at July 2, 2004 and $393 million at
June 27, 2003. Net cash provided by operating activities
during 2004 was $190 million as compared to
$278 million for 2003. Net cash flows from operating
activities primarily resulted from net income. This represents
the Company’s principal source of cash. Operating cash
flows were impacted by net cash used to fund working capital
requirements of $89 million for 2004, an increase of
$116 million from 2003. The increase in net cash used to
fund working capital requirements was primarily due to a higher
accounts receivable balance associated with changes in the
Company’s mix of customers, higher work in process
inventory associated with the head manufacturing operations and
the payment of a $45 million litigation settlement.

The Company’s working capital requirements
depend upon the effective management of the Company’s cash
conversion cycle. The cash conversion cycle, which consisted of
39 days sales outstanding (“DSO”) plus
20 days inventory outstanding (“DIO”) less
61 days payable outstanding (“DPO”), was negative
two days for 2004 as compared to negative nine days for 2003.
The increase in the cash conversion cycle was due to higher
DSO’s as a result of changes in the Company’s mix of
customers and higher DIO’s as a result of the longer
production cycle associated with the head manufacturing
operations. These increases were partially offset by an increase
in DPO’s. The Company expects its financial business model
will continue to generate a negative cash conversion cycle going
forward.

Net cash used in investing activities for 2004
was $227 million as compared to $59 million for 2003.
The 2004 investing activities consisted of $95 million for
the Read-Rite asset acquisition and $132 million of net
capital expenditures. The 2003 investing activities related
primarily to net capital expenditures. The increase in net
capital expenditures was primarily for assets purchased to
upgrade the Company’s head manufacturing capabilities,
increase desktop hard disk drive production capabilities and for
the normal replacement of existing assets. For 2005, capital
expenditures are expected to increase to approximately
$250 million. The increase in capital expenditures is
expected to consist primarily of investments in mobile hard disk
drive manufacturing capacity, continued expansion of head
manufacturing operations and IT infrastructure upgrades. The
Company expects to use planned capital lease facilities to
offset up to $100 million of its capital expenditures.
Approximately $19 million of capital leases were completed
in 2004.

Net cash provided by financing activities for
2004 was $21 million as compared to net cash used by
financing activities of $50 million for 2003. The net cash
provided by financing activities in 2004 consisted primarily of
$24 million received upon issuance of common stock under
employee plans and $14 million of net proceeds from
long-term debt, partially offset by $16 million used in the
Company’s stock repurchase program. The net cash used by
financing activities for the year ended 2003 consisted primarily
of $88 million used for redemption of the Company’s
remaining convertible debentures, partially offset by
$44 million received upon issuance of common stock under
employee plans.



Capital Commitments

The following is a summary of the Company’s
significant contractual cash obligations and commercial
commitments at July 2, 2004 (in millions):

Long-Term Debt

On September 19, 2003, the Company entered
into a new $125 million five-year credit facility
(“Senior Credit Facility”) replacing the facility that
matured on September 20, 2003. The new Senior Credit
Facility provides up to $75 million (subject to outstanding
letters of credit and a borrowing base calculation) in revolving
credit and a term loan of $50 million. Both the term loan
and revolving credit facility mature on September 19, 2008,
and are secured by the Company’s accounts receivable,
inventory, 65% of its stock in its foreign subsidiaries and
other assets. At the option of the Company, borrowings bear
interest at either LIBOR (with option periods of one to three
months) or a base rate, plus a margin. The Senior Credit
Facility requires the Company to maintain certain levels of
income, prohibits the payment of cash dividends on common stock,
and contains a number of other covenants. The Company was in
compliance with all such covenants at July 2, 2004. The
$50 million term loan was funded on September 22, 2003
and requires quarterly principal payments of $3 million
beginning in October 2004. The Company used the proceeds from
the term loan to repay obligations incurred as a result of the
Read-Rite asset acquisition (see Note 3, “Read-Rite
Asset Acquisition” included in the Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements). At July 2, 2004 there
were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility and
$71 million was available.

Purchase Orders

In the normal course of business to reduce the
risk of component shortages, the Company enters into purchase
orders with suppliers for the purchase of hard disk drive
components used to manufacture the Company’s products.
These purchase orders generally cover forecasted component
supplies needed for production during the next quarter, become
payable upon receipt of the components, and generally may be
changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the
components. In some cases we may be obligated to pay for certain
costs related to changes to, or cancellation of, a purchase
order, such as costs incurred for raw materials or work in
process. The Company has entered into long-term purchase
agreements for components with certain vendors such as Komag,
IBM, and Marvell. Future purchases under these agreements are
not fixed and determinable as they depend on the Company’s
overall unit volume requirements and are contingent upon the
prices, technology and quality of the supplier’s products
remaining competitive. These arrangements are not included under
“Purchase Obligations” in the table above. See below
under the heading “Risk Factors That May Affect Future
Results” for a discussion of these commitments.

Forward Exchange Contracts

The Company purchases short-term, forward
exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency
fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities and
commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated
in foreign currencies. See Part II, Item 7A, under the
heading “Disclosure About Foreign Currency Risk,” for
the Company’s current forward exchange contract commitments.

Stock Repurchase Program

The Company announced a stock repurchase program
on May 5, 2004. Under the program, the Company may purchase
on the open market up to $100 million of its common stock
depending on market conditions and other



corporate considerations. Stock repurchases are
expected to be funded by operating cash flow. Some of the
repurchased shares will offset the dilutive impact of common
stock issued under employee stock option and share purchase
programs. During the fourth quarter of 2004 the Company
repurchased 1.9 million shares of its common stock at a
total cost of approximately $16.0 million. During 2005, the
Company may continue to opportunistically repurchase its stock
as market conditions allow. For example, during August 2004, the
Company repurchased an additional 2.1 million shares of
common stock at a total cost of $15.0 million.

The Company believes its current cash and cash
equivalents will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs
through the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that
the Senior Credit Facility or lease financing will continue to
be available to the Company. Also, the Company’s ability to
sustain its working capital position is dependent upon a number
of factors that are discussed below under the heading “Risk
Factors That May Affect Future Results.” The Company
currently anticipates that it will continue to utilize its
liquidity and cash flows to improve the efficiency and
capability of its existing hard disk drive and head
manufacturing operations.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company has prepared the accompanying
consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. The
preparation of the financial statements requires the use of
judgment and estimates that affect the reported amounts of
revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. The Company has
adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally
accepted in the industry in which it operates. The Company
believes the following are its most critical accounting policies
that affect significant areas and involve management’s
judgment and estimates. If these estimates differ significantly
from actual results, the impact to the consolidated financial
statements may be material.

Revenue and Accounts Receivable

In accordance with standard industry practice,
the Company has agreements with resellers that provide price
protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of
published list price reductions. In addition, the Company may
have agreements with resellers that provide for stock rotation
on slow-moving items and other incentive programs. In accordance
with current accounting standards, the Company recognizes
revenue upon shipment or delivery to resellers and records a
reduction to revenue for estimated price protection and other
programs in effect until the resellers sell such inventory to
their customers. Adjustments are based on anticipated price
decreases during the reseller holding period, estimated amounts
to be reimbursed to qualifying customers, as well as historical
pricing information. If end-market demand for hard disk drives
declines significantly, the Company may have to increase
sell-through incentive payments to resellers, resulting in an
increase in price protection allowances, which could adversely
impact operating results.

The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful
accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing
the risk of loss based on insolvency, disputes or other
collection issues. In addition, the Company routinely analyzes
the different receivable aging categories and its bad debt loss
history and establishes reserves based on a combination of past
due receivables and expected future losses. If the financial
condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in
their inability to pay their accounts when due, an increase in
the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts would be
required, which could negatively affect operating results.

The Company records provisions against revenue
and cost of revenue for estimated sales returns in the same
period that the related revenue is recognized. The Company bases
these provisions on existing product return notifications as
well as historical returns by product type (see
“Warranty”). If actual sales returns exceed
expectations, an increase in the sales return provision would be
required, which could negatively affect operating results.

Warranty

The Company records an accrual for estimated
warranty costs when revenue is recognized. Warranty covers costs
of repair or replacement of the hard disk drive over the
warranty period, which generally ranges from one to five years.
The Company has comprehensive processes with which to estimate
accruals for warranty, which include specific detail on hard
disk drives in the field by product type, historical field
return rates and costs to repair. If actual product return rates
or costs to repair returned products increase above
expectations, an increase in the warranty provision would be
required, which could negatively affect operating results.



Inventory

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Inventory
write-downs are recorded for the valuation of inventory at the
lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market
conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to
inventory costs and inventory balances.

The Company evaluates inventory balances for
excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by
analyzing backlog, estimated demand, inventory on hand, sales
levels and other information, and writes down inventory balances
for excess and obsolete inventory based on the analysis.
Unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could
result in a decrease in demand for one or more of the
Company’s products, which may require an increase in
inventory write-downs that could negatively affect operating
results.

Litigation and Other Contingencies

The Company applies Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for
Contingencies,” to determine when and how much to accrue
for and disclose related to legal and other contingencies.
Accordingly, the Company accrues loss contingencies when
management, in consultation with its legal advisors, concludes
that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. (Refer to
Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, Note 6 “Legal Proceedings” included
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The ability to predict
the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments,
estimates and inherent uncertainties. The actual outcome of such
matters could differ materially from management’s estimates.

Deferred Tax Assets

The Company’s deferred tax assets, which
consist primarily of net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards, are fully reserved due to management’s
determination that it is more likely than not that these assets
will not be realized. This determination is based on the weight
of available evidence, the most significant of which is the
Company’s loss history in the related tax jurisdictions.
Should this determination change in the future, some amount of
deferred tax assets could be recognized, resulting in a tax
benefit or a reduction of future tax expense.

Risk Factors That May Affect Future
Results

Declines in ASPs in the hard disk drive
    industry adversely affect our operating results.

The hard disk drive industry has experienced
declining ASP’s. Although the rate of decline has moderated
in recent years, there can be no assurance that this trend will
continue. In fact, during the fourth quarter of 2004, ASPs
decreased significantly. Increases in areal density mean that
the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same
capacity and, therefore, a lower component cost. Because of the
competitiveness of the hard disk drive industry, lower costs
generally mean lower prices. This is true even for those
products that are competitive and introduced into the market in
a timely manner. Our ASPs decline even further when competitors
lower prices as a result of decreased costs or to absorb excess
capacity, liquidate excess inventories, restructure or attempt
to gain market share.

Our operating results depend on optimizing
    time-to-market and time-to-volume, overall quality, and costs of
    new and established products.

To achieve consistent success with our customers
who manufacturer computers, systems and consumer electronic
devices, we must balance several key attributes: time-to-market,
time-to-volume, quality, cost, service, price and a broad
product portfolio. If we fail to:



•

qualify these products with key customers on a
    timely basis by meeting all of our customers’ needs for
    performance, quality and features, or

•

consistently meet stated quality requirements on
    delivered products,

our operating results would be adversely affected.

Product life cycles in the desktop hard disk
    drive market require continuous technical innovation associated
    with higher areal densities.

New products in the desktop hard disk drive
market may require higher areal densities than previous product
generations, posing formidable technical and manufacturing
challenges. Higher areal densities require existing head
technology to be improved or new technology developed to
accommodate more data on a single disk. In addition, our
introduction of new products during a technology transition
increases the likelihood of unexpected quality concerns. Our
failure to bring high quality new products to market on time and
at acceptable costs may put us at a competitive disadvantage to
companies that achieve these results. In addition, technology
improvements may require us to reduce the price on existing
products to remain competitive.

Increases in areal density may outpace
    customers’ demand for storage capacity.

The rate of increase in areal density may be
greater than the increase in our customers’ demand for
aggregate storage capacity. This could lead to our
customers’ storage capacity needs being satisfied with more
lower-cost single-surface drives, thereby decreasing our
revenue. As a result, even with increasing aggregate demand for
storage capacity, our ASPs could decline, which could adversely
affect our results of operations.

Product life cycles influence our financial
    results.

Product life cycles have been extending since the
middle of calendar year 2002 due in large part to a decrease in
the rate of hard disk drive areal density growth. However, there
can be no assurance that this trend will continue. If longer
product life cycles continue, we may need to develop new
technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any particular
product in order to maintain competitive pricing for such
product. This may result in an increase in our overall expenses
and a decrease in our gross margins, both of which could
adversely affect our operating results. If product life cycles
shorten, it may be more difficult to recover the cost of product
development before the product becomes obsolete. Although we
believe that the current rate of growth in areal density is
lower than in the past several years and will continue to
decrease in the near term, we expect that areal density will
continue to increase. Our failure to recover the cost of product
development in the future could adversely affect our operating
results.

If we fail to qualify our products with our
    customers, they may not purchase any units of a particular
    product line, which would have a significant adverse impact on
    our sales.

We regularly engage in new product qualification
with our customers. To be considered for qualification, we must
be among the leaders in time-to-market with our new products.
Once a product is accepted for qualification testing, failures
or delays in the qualification process can result in our losing
sales to that customer until the next generation of products is
introduced. The effect of missing a product qualification
opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume
computer manufacturers, most of which continue to consolidate
their share of the PC market. If product life cycles continue to
be extended due to a decrease in the rate of areal density
growth, we may have a significantly longer period to wait before
we have an opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer,
which could harm our competitive position. These risks are
increased because we expect cost improvements and competitive
pressures to result in declining gross margins on our current
generation products.

Unexpected technology advances in the hard
    disk drive industry could harm our competitive
    position.

If one of our competitors were able to implement
a significant advance in head or hard disk drive technology that
enables a “step-change” increase in areal density that
permits greater storage of data on a disk, it could put us at a
competitive disadvantage and harm our operating results.



Advances in magnetic, optical, semiconductor or
other data storage technologies could result in competitive
products that have better performance or lower cost per unit of
capacity than our products. If these products prove to be
superior in performance or cost per unit of capacity, we could
be at a competitive disadvantage to the companies offering those
products.

A fundamental change in recording technology
    could result in significant increases in our operating expenses
    and could put us at a competitive disadvantage.

Currently the hard disk drive industry uses giant
magnetoresistive head technology, which allows significantly
higher storage capacities than the previously utilized thin-film
head technology. However, the industry is developing new
recording technologies that may enable greater recording
densities than currently available using magnetoresistive head
technology, including perpendicular, current
perpendicular-to-plane, and tunneling junction technology. If
the industry experiences a fundamental shift in recording
technology, hard disk drive manufacturers would need to timely
adjust their designs and processes to accommodate the new
technology in order to remain competitive. As a result, we could
incur substantial costs in developing new technologies, media,
and tools to remain competitive. We may also become more
dependent on suppliers to ensure our access to components that
accommodate the new technology. These results would increase our
operating costs, which may negatively impact our operating
results.

The hard disk drive industry is highly
    competitive and characterized by rapid shifts in market share
    among the major competitors.

The price of hard disk drives has fallen over
time due to increases in supply, cost reductions, technological
advances and price reductions by competitors seeking to
liquidate excess inventories or attempting to gain market share.
In addition, rapid technological changes often reduce the volume
and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the
risk of inventory obsolescence. These factors, taken together,
result in significant and rapid shifts in market share among the
industry’s major participants. In addition, product recalls
can lead to a loss of market share, which could adversely affect
our operating results.

Our prices and margins are subject to declines
    due to unpredictable end-user demand and oversupply of hard disk
    drives.

Demand for our hard disk drives depends on the
demand for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage
upgrades to existing systems. The demand for systems has been
volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on
the demand for hard disk drives in any given period. As a
result, the hard disk drive market has experienced periods of
excess capacity, which has led to intense price competition. If
intense price competition occurs, we may be forced to lower
prices sooner and more than expected, which could result in
lower revenue and gross margins.

Changes in the markets for hard disk drives
    require us to develop new products.

Over the past few years the consumer market for
desktop computers has shifted significantly towards lower priced
systems. According to data released by TrendFOCUS in November
2003, systems priced below $600 comprised the fastest growing
segment of the desktop computer market. If we are not able to
offer a competitively priced hard disk drive for the low-cost PC
market, our share of that market will likely fall, which could
harm our operating results.

The market for hard disk drives is also
fragmenting into a variety of devices and products. Many
industry analysts expect, as do we, that as communications are
increasingly converted to digital technology from the older,
analog technology, the technology of computers and consumer
electronics will continue to converge, and hard disk drives will
be found in many consumer products other than computers. For
example, although general market acceptance remains in its early
stages, the use of hard disk drives has expanded into the game
console market. Microsoft and Sony currently incorporate a hard
disk drive into their video game systems. However, there can be
no assurance that these companies will continue incorporating a
hard disk drive into their game consoles, or that the market for
these products will grow.

In addition, we expect that the consumer market
for audio-video products incorporating a hard disk drive will
continue to grow. However, because this market remains
relatively new, although overall growth has been strong,
accurate forecasts for future growth remain challenging.
Moreover, some of the devices, such as personal video recorders
and digital video recorders, may require attributes not
currently offered in our products, which may result in a need to
expend capital, increasing our overall operational expense. If
we are not successful in using our hard disk drive technology and



expertise to develop new products for the
emerging consumer electronics market, or if we are required to
incur significant costs in developing such products, it may harm
our operating results.

If we do not successfully expand into new hard
    disk drive market segments, our business may suffer.

To remain a significant supplier of hard disk
drives, we will need to offer a broad range of hard disk drive
products to our customers. We currently offer a variety of
3.5-inch form factor hard disk drives for the desktop computer
market. However, demand for hard disk drives may shift to
products in smaller form factors, which we do not currently
offer, but which some of our competitors offer. In addition, the
enterprise and desktop PC industries are transitioning to higher
speed interfaces such as SATA to handle higher data transfer
rates. We currently offer SATA products; however, the transition
of technology and the introduction of new products is
challenging and creates risks. While we continue to develop new
products and look to expand into non-desktop applications such
as consumer electronics and mobile products, the success of our
new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors,
including difficulties faced in manufacturing ramp, market
acceptance, effective management of inventory levels in line
with anticipated product demand, and the risk that our new
products will have quality problems or other defects in the
early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the
design of those products. If we fail to successfully develop and
manufacture new products, customers may decrease the amount of
our products that they purchase, and we may lose business to our
competitors who offer these products or who use their dominance
in the enterprise or mobile market to encourage sales of desktop
hard disk drives.

We depend on our key personnel and skilled
    employees.

Our success depends upon the continued
contributions of our key personnel and skilled employees, many
of whom would be extremely difficult to replace. Worldwide
competition for skilled employees in the hard disk drive
industry is intense. Volatility or lack of positive performance
in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain
key personnel or skilled employees who have been granted stock
options. If we are unable to retain our existing key personnel
or skilled employees, or hire and integrate new key personnel or
skilled employees, our operating results would likely be harmed.

Loss of market share with a key customer could
    harm our operating results.

A majority of our revenue comes from a few
customers. For example, during 2004, sales to our top 10
customers accounted for 51% of revenue, as compared to 55% of
revenue for 2003. These customers have a variety of suppliers to
choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us.
Even if we successfully qualify a product with a customer, the
customer generally is not obligated to purchase any minimum
volume of products from us and is able to terminate its
relationship with us at any time. Our ability to maintain strong
relationships with our principal customers is essential to our
future performance. If we lose a key customer, or if any of our
key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us
to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs, our
operating results would likely be harmed. In addition, if
customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that
our gross margins are diminished, we could decide not to sell
our products to a particular customer, which could result in a
decrease in our revenue.

Dependence on a limited number of qualified
    suppliers of components and manufacturing equipment could lead
    to delays, lost revenue or increased costs.

Because we depend on a limited number of
suppliers for certain hard disk drive components and
manufacturing equipment, an increase in the cost of such
components or equipment, an extended shortage of required
components or equipment, or the failure of key suppliers to
remain in business, adjust to market conditions, or to meet our
quality, yield or production requirements could significantly
harm our operating results. A number of the components used by
us are available from only a single or limited number of
qualified outside suppliers, and there is continued attrition
and consolidation in our supplier base. In addition, some of the
components (or component types) used in our products are used in
other devices, such as mobile telephones and digital cameras. If
there is a significant simultaneous upswing in demand for such a
component (or component type) from several high volume
industries, resulting in a supply reduction, or a component is
otherwise in short supply, or if a supplier fails to qualify or
has a quality issue with a component, we may experience delays
or increased costs in obtaining that component. In addition, if
a component becomes unavailable, we could suffer significant
loss of revenue.



To reduce the risk of component shortages, we
attempt to provide significant lead times when buying these
components. As a result, we may be subject to cancellation
charges if we cancel orders, which may occur when we make
technology transitions.

In some cases, not only are we dependent on a
limited number of suppliers, but we also have entered into
contractual commitments that require us to buy a substantial
number of components from certain suppliers. For example, we
have entered into a volume purchase agreement with Komag for the
purchase of media components, and volume purchase agreements
with IBM and Marvell for the purchase of read channel devices.
Our future operating results may depend substantially on
Komag’s ability to timely qualify their components in our
programs, and each of Komag’s, IBM’s, and
Marvell’s ability to supply us with these components in
sufficient volume to meet our production requirements. A
significant disruption in any of these suppliers’ ability
to manufacture and supply us with the components could harm our
operating results.

In addition, certain equipment we use in our
manufacturing or testing processes is available only from a
limited number of suppliers. Some of this equipment uses
materials that at times could be in short supply. If these
materials are not available, or are not available in the
quantities we require for our manufacturing and testing
processes, our ability to manufacture our products could be
impacted, and we could suffer significant loss of revenue.

If we are unable to timely and
    cost-effectively develop heads with leading technology and
    overall quality, our ability to sell our products may be
    significantly diminished, which could materially and adversely
    affect our business and financial results.

As a result of our head manufacturing operations,
we are developing and manufacturing a substantial portion of the
heads used in the hard disk drives we manufacture. Consequently,
we are more dependent upon our own development and execution
efforts and less able to take advantage of head technologies
developed by other head manufacturers. There can be no
assurance, however, that we will be successful in timely and
cost-effectively developing and manufacturing heads for products
using perpendicular recording technology, or other future
technologies. We also may not achieve acceptable manufacturing
yields using such technologies necessary to satisfy our
customers’ product needs, or we may encounter quality
problems with the heads we manufacture. In addition, we may not
have access to external sources of supply without incurring
substantial costs. If we fail to develop new technologies in a
timely manner, or if we encounter quality problems with the
heads we manufacture, and if we do not have access to external
sources of supply that incorporate new technologies, we would
have a competitive disadvantage to companies that are successful
in this regard, and our business and financial results could
suffer.

We will experience additional costs and risks
    in connection with our head manufacturing operations.

Our acquisition of head manufacturing assets
represented a fundamental change in our operating structure, as
we are now manufacturing heads for use in the hard disk drives
we manufacture. Consequently, we carry a higher percentage of
fixed costs than assumed in our prior financial business model.
If the overall level of production decreases for any reason, our
head manufacturing assets may face under-utilization that may
impact our results of operations. We are therefore subject to
additional risks related to overall asset utilization, including
the need to operate at high levels of utilization to drive
competitive costs, and the need for assured supply of
components, especially hard disk drive media, that is optimized
to work with our heads.

Moreover, capital expenditures and working
capital investments required to support the head manufacturing
operations, including research and development expenses and
expenses necessary to investigate new recording technologies to
extend technology, will increase.

In addition, we may incur additional costs,
expenses and risks, including:

•

we may not have sufficient head sources in the
    event that we are unable to manufacture a sufficient supply of
    heads to satisfy our needs;

•

third party head suppliers may not deal with us
    or may not deal with us on the same terms and conditions we have
    previously enjoyed;



If we do not adequately address the challenges
related to our head manufacturing operations, our ongoing
operations could be disrupted, resulting in a decrease in our
revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating
results.

To develop new products, we must maintain
    effective partner relationships with our major component
    suppliers.

Under our business model, we do not manufacture
any of the component parts used in our hard disk drives, other
than heads as a result of our acquisition of head manufacturing
assets in July 2003. As a result, the success of our products
depends on our ability to gain access to and integrate parts
that are “best in class” from reliable component
suppliers. To do so, we must effectively manage our
relationships with our major component suppliers. We must also
effectively integrate different products from a variety of
suppliers, each of which employs variations on technology, which
can impact, for example, feasible combinations of heads and
media components. In August 2003 we settled litigation we were
engaged in with Cirrus Logic, Inc., a supplier who previously
was the sole source of read channel devices for our hard disk
drives. As a result of the disputes that gave rise to the
litigation, our profitability was at risk until another
supplier’s read channel devices could be designed into our
products. Similar disputes with other strategic component
suppliers could adversely affect our operating results.

Our failure to timely and efficiently
    transition our enterprise resource planning software from the
    version we currently use to a new version could adversely affect
    our business and financial results.

We use enterprise resource planning software in
the operation of our business and maintenance of business and
financial data related to our daily operations. We are in the
process of upgrading this software and we anticipate
transitioning to new enterprise resource planning software
during the next year. We may experience unexpected difficulties
in transitioning to the new software, including difficulties
related to the failure or inefficient operation of the new
software. Such difficulties or failures could result in our
inability to access business and financial information stored on
the system or the loss of such information. Any inability to
access, or loss of, such information could affect our daily
operations, including our ability to ship products and invoice
our customers, which could have a significant adverse impact on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Some of our customers have adopted a
    subcontractor model that increases our credit risk and could
    result in an increase in our operating costs.

Some of our computer manufacturer customers (also
referred to as OEMs) have adopted a subcontractor model that
requires us to contract directly with companies that provide
manufacturing services to our OEM customers. Because these
subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our
direct OEM customers, this subcontractor model exposes us to
increased credit risks. Our agreements with our OEM customers
may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate
this increased credit risk. Any credit losses we may suffer as a
result of this increased risk would increase our operating
costs, which may negatively impact our operating results.

We have two high-volume hard-drive
    manufacturing facilities and two facilities supporting our head
    manufacturing operations, which subjects us to the risk of
    damage or loss of any of these facilities.

Our hard disk drives are manufactured in
facilities in Malaysia and in Thailand. In addition, following
our acquisition of head manufacturing assets in July 2003, we
are operating a head wafer fabrication and research and



development facility in Fremont, California and a
slider fabrication, HGA and HSA assembly, and research and
development facility in Thailand. A fire, flood, earthquake or
other disaster, condition or event that adversely affects any of
these facilities or our ability to manufacture could result in a
loss of sales and revenue and harm our operating results.

Terrorist attacks may adversely affect our
    business and operating results.

The terrorist attacks on the United States on
September 11, 2001, the United States-led military response
to counter terrorism and the continued threat of terrorist
activity and other acts of war or hostility, including the war
in Iraq, have created uncertainty in the financial and insurance
markets and have significantly increased the political, economic
and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which
we operate. Further acts of terrorism, either domestically or
abroad, could create further uncertainties and instability. To
the extent this results in disruption or delays of our
manufacturing capabilities or shipments of our products, our
business, operating results and financial condition could be
adversely affected.

Manufacturing our products abroad subjects us
    to numerous risks.

We are subject to risks associated with our
foreign manufacturing operations, including:

Because we manufacture our products abroad, our
operating costs are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates. Further fluctuations in the exchange rate of the
Thai Baht, a floating currency, or a determination by the
Malaysian government to repeg the Malaysian Ringgit or convert
it to a floating currency, could result in an increase in our
operating costs, which may negatively impact our operating
results.

We have attempted to manage the impact of foreign
currency exchange rate changes by, among other things, entering
into short-term, forward exchange contracts. However, those
contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by
the issuer if currency controls are put in place. As a result of
the Malaysian currency controls, we are no longer hedging the
Malaysian currency risk. Currently, we hedge the Thai Baht,
British Pound Sterling and the Euro.

There has been a trend toward a weakening
U.S. dollar relative to most foreign currencies. If this
trend continues the U.S. dollar equivalents of unhedged
manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion
of our production costs are foreign-currency denominated.
Conversely, there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues
since revenues are substantially U.S. dollar denominated.

Unforeseen environmental costs could harm our
    operating results.

We may be subject to various state, federal and
international laws and regulations governing the environment,
including those restricting the presence of certain substances
in electronic products and making producers of those products
financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling
and disposal of certain products. Such laws and regulations have
been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate,
including various European Union member countries. Similar
legislation may be enacted in other locations where we
manufacture or sell our products.

We could incur substantial costs in connection
with our compliance with such environmental laws and
regulations, and we could also be subject to governmental fines
and liability to our customers if we were to violate these laws.
If we



have to make significant capital expenditures to
comply with environmental laws, or if we are subject to
significant capital expenses in connection with a violation of
these laws, our financial condition or operating results could
suffer.

The nature of our business and our reliance on
    intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects
    us to the risk of significant litigation.

The hard disk drive industry has been
characterized by significant litigation. This includes
litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property
rights, product liability claims and other types of litigation.
Litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal
business operations. Moreover, the results of litigation are
inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or
decisions. We may enter into settlements or be subject to
judgments that may, individually or in the aggregate, have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
results of operations.

We are currently evaluating notices of alleged
patent infringement or notices of patents from patent holders.
We also are a party to several judicial and other proceedings
relating to patent and other intellectual property rights. If
claims or actions are asserted against us, we may be required to
obtain a license or cross-license, modify our existing
technology or design a new non-infringing technology. Such
licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly. We may
also be liable for any past infringement. If there is an adverse
ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit, an injunction
could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing
product. It could also result in a damage award equal to a
reasonable royalty or lost profits or, if there is a finding of
willful infringement, treble damages. Any of these results would
likely increase our costs and harm our operating results.

Our reliance on intellectual property and
    other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these
    key ingredients of our business could be copied by
    competitors.

Our success depends, in significant part, on the
proprietary nature of our technology, including non-patentable
intellectual property such as our process technology. Despite
safeguards, to the extent that a competitor is able to reproduce
or otherwise capitalize on our technology, it may be difficult,
expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal
protection. Also, the laws of some foreign countries may not
protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the
laws of the United States. In addition to patent protection of
intellectual property rights, we consider elements of our
product designs and processes to be proprietary and
confidential. We rely upon employee, consultant and vendor
non-disclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a
system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary
information. However, any of our registered or unregistered
intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by
others in the industry, which might harm our operating results.

We are subject to risks related to product
    defects, which could result in product recalls and could subject
    us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or
    which are greater than anticipated due to the unenforceability
    of liability limitations.

We generally warrant our products for one to five
years. We test our hard disk drives in our manufacturing
facilities through a variety of means. However, there can be no
assurance that our testing will reveal latent defects in our
products, which may not become apparent until after the products
have been sold into the market. Accordingly, there is a risk
that product defects will occur, which could require a product
recall. Product recalls can be expensive to implement and, if a
product recall occurs during the product’s warranty period,
we may be required to replace the defective product. In
addition, a product recall may damage our relationship with our
customers, and we may lose market share with our customers,
including our OEM customers.

The standard warranties used by us contain limits
on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages
and for negligent or improper use of the products. We record an
accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is
recognized. We may incur additional operating expenses if our
warranty provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving
issues related to defects in our products. If these additional
expenses are significant, it could adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.



Inaccurate projections of demand for our
    product can cause large fluctuations in our quarterly
    results.

We often ship a high percentage (at times in
excess of 50%) of our total quarterly sales in the third month
of the quarter, which makes it difficult for us to forecast our
financial results prior to the end of the quarter. In addition,
our quarterly projections and results may be subject to
significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other
factors including:

Rapidly changing market conditions in the hard
    disk drive industry make it difficult to estimate actual
    results.

We have made and continue to make a number of
estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial
reporting. The rapidly changing market conditions with which we
deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our
estimates and assumptions. Key estimates and assumptions for us
include:

The market price of our common stock is
    volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been,
and may continue to be, extremely volatile. Factors such as the
following may significantly affect the market price of our
common stock:



•

conditions and trends in the hard disk drive,
    data and content management, storage and communication
    industries; and

•

changes in financial estimates by securities
    analysts relating specifically to us or the hard disk drive
    industry in general.

In addition, general economic conditions may
cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume
fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the
stock prices of many high technology companies. These
fluctuations often appear to be unrelated to the operating
performance of the companies.

Securities class action lawsuits are often
brought against companies after periods of volatility in the
market price of their securities. A number of such suits have
been filed against us in the past, and should any new lawsuits
be filed, such matters could result in substantial costs and a
diversion of resources and management’s attention.

We may be unable to raise future capital
    through debt or equity financing.

Due to the risks described herein, in the future
we may be unable to maintain adequate financial resources for
capital expenditures, expansion or acquisition activity, working
capital and research and development. We have a credit facility,
which matures on September 19, 2008, and planned capital
lease facilities. If we decide to increase or accelerate our
capital expenditures or research and development efforts, or if
results of operations do not meet our expectations, we could
require additional debt or equity financing. However, we cannot
ensure that additional financing will be available to us or
available on acceptable terms. An equity financing could also be
dilutive to our existing stockholders.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Disclosure About Foreign Currency
Risk

Although the majority of the Company’s
transactions are in U.S. Dollars, some transactions are
based in various foreign currencies. The Company purchases
short-term, forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets,
liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product
costs denominated in foreign currencies. The purpose of entering
into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations on the results of operations. The
resulting impact from these hedge contracts is to offset a
majority of the currency gains and losses in the Company’s
local currency operating expenses. The contract maturity dates
do not exceed six months. The Company does not purchase
short-term forward exchange contracts for trading purposes.
Currently, the Company focuses on hedging its foreign currency
risk related to the Thai Baht, the British Pound Sterling, and
the Euro.

As of July 2, 2004, the Company had
outstanding the following purchased foreign currency forward
exchange contracts (in millions, except weighted average
contract rate):

*

Expressed in units of foreign currency per dollar.

In 2004, 2003 and 2002, total realized
transaction and forward exchange contract currency gains and
losses were not material to the consolidated financial
statements.



Disclosure About Other Market Risks

Variable Interest Rate Risk

At the option of the Company, borrowings under
the Senior Credit Facility would bear interest at either LIBOR
(with option periods of one to three months) or a base rate,
plus a margin. If LIBOR or the base rate increases, the
Company’s interest payments could also increase. At
July 2, 2004 the Company had a $50 million term loan
outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility. A one percent
increase in the variable rate of interest on the Senior Credit
Facility would increase interest expense by approximately
$0.5 million annually.

Note 1.

Organization and Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies

Western Digital Corporation (“Western
Digital” or the “Company”) has prepared its
consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States and has
adopted accounting policies and practices which are generally
accepted in the industry in which it operates. Following are the
Company’s significant accounting policies:

Fiscal Year

The Company has a 52 or 53-week fiscal year. The
2004, 2003 and 2002 fiscal years ended on July 2,
June 27 and June 28 respectively. The year ended
July 2, 2004 consisted of 53 weeks and the years ended
June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002 consisted of
52 weeks each. All references to years relate to fiscal
years unless otherwise noted.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. The accounts of foreign
subsidiaries have been remeasured using the U.S. dollar as
the functional currency. As such, foreign exchange gains or
losses resulting from remeasurement of these accounts are
reflected in the results of operations. These foreign exchange
gains and losses were immaterial to the consolidated financial
statements. Monetary and nonmonetary asset and liability
accounts have been remeasured using the exchange rate in effect
at each year-end and using historical rates, respectively.
Income statement accounts have been remeasured using average
monthly exchange rates.

Cash Equivalents

The Company’s cash equivalents represent
highly liquid investments, primarily money market funds and
commercial paper, with original maturities of three months or
less.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company designs, develops, manufactures and
markets hard disk drives to personal computer manufacturers,
resellers and retailers throughout the world. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’
financial condition and generally requires no collateral. The
Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses, and such
losses have historically been within management’s
expectations. At any given point in time, the total amount
outstanding from any one of a number of our customers may be
individually significant to our financial results. At
July 2, 2004 and June 27, 2003, the Company had
reserves for potential credit losses of $6.1 million and
$5.2 million, respectively. The Company also has cash
equivalent policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to
any one financial institution or investment instrument and
require that investments be made only with financial
institutions or in investment instruments evaluated as highly
credit-worthy.

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or
net realizable value. Cost is on a first-in, first-out basis for
raw materials and is computed on a currently adjusted standard
basis (which approximates first-in, first-out) for work in
process and finished goods.

Property and Equipment

The cost of property and equipment is depreciated
over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The
majority of the Company’s property and equipment is being
depreciated over periods of three and five years. Depreciation
is computed on a straight-line basis. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the
assets or the related lease terms.



WESTERN DIGITAL
CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, “Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements”
(“SAB 101”). Under SAB 101 revenue is
recognized when the title and risk of loss have passed to the
customer, there is persuasive evidence of arrangement, delivery
has occurred, or services have been rendered, the sales price is
determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue
is recognized at the time of shipment for the Company’s
original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”)
customers, and at the time of delivery for its reseller
customers.

In accordance with standard industry practice,
the Company has agreements with resellers that provide price
protection for inventories held by the resellers at the time of
published list price reductions. In addition, the Company may
have agreements with resellers that provide for stock rotation
on slow-moving items and other incentive programs. Either party
may terminate these agreements upon written notice. In the event
of termination, the Company may be obligated to repurchase a
certain portion of the resellers’ inventory. The Company
records a reduction to revenue for estimated price protection
and other programs in effect until the resellers sell such
inventory to their customers. Adjustments are based on
anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period,
estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers, as
well as historical pricing information. If end-market demand for
hard disk drives declines significantly, the Company may have to
increase sell-through incentive payments to resellers, resulting
in an increase in price protection allowances, which could
adversely impact operating results. Net revenue recognized on
sales to resellers was approximately $1.5 billion,
$1.3 billion and $1.0 billion for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Repurchases of reseller inventory were not
material in 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Warranty

The Company records an accrual for estimated
warranty costs as products are sold. Warranty covers costs of
repair or replacement of the hard disk drive over the warranty
period, which ranges from one to five years and is recorded in
the accompanying balance sheet as current or long-term based
upon when the expenditure is expected to occur. The Company has
comprehensive processes with which to estimate accruals for
warranty, which include specific detail on hard disk drives in
the field by product type, historical field return rates and
costs to repair. Although the Company believes that it has the
continued ability to reasonably estimate warranty reserves,
unforeseeable changes could cause a material change in the
Company’s warranty accrual estimate. Such a change would be
recorded in the period in which the change was identified.

Advertising Expense

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Selling, general and administrative expenses of the Company
include advertising costs of $1.5 million,
$3.4 million and $6.0 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the
asset and liability method, which provides that deferred tax
assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences
between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the
Company’s assets and liabilities and expected benefits of
utilizing net operating loss (“NOL”)
carryforwards. The Company records a valuation allowance where
it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not
be realized. The impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax
rates and laws, if any, are applied to the years during which
temporary differences are expected to be settled and reflected
in the consolidated financial statements in the period of
enactment.

Per Share Information

The Company computes basic income per share using
the net income and the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is
computed using the net income and the weighted average number of
common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding
during the period. Dilutive



WESTERN DIGITAL
CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

potential common shares include outstanding
employee stock options, employee stock purchase plan shares and
restricted stock awards.

For the years ended July 2, 2004,
June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002, 14.7 million,
19.9 million and 24.7 million shares, respectively,
relating to the possible exercise of outstanding stock options
were not included in the computation of diluted income per
share. Also, for the year ended June 28, 2002 an additional
2.9 million shares, issuable upon conversion of the
convertible debentures, were excluded from the computation of
diluted income per share. The effects of these items were not
included in the computation of diluted income per share as their
effect would have been anti-dilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), establishes the
financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based
compensation plans. As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company
elected to continue accounting for stock-based employee
compensation plans in accordance with Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” and related interpretations (“APB Opinion
No. 25”) and to follow the pro forma net income, pro
forma earnings per share, and stock-based compensation plan
disclosure requirements set forth in SFAS 123. The
following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
earnings per share for each of the past three fiscal years and
illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as
if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions
of SFAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation.

The pro forma earnings per share information is
estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
Black-Scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair
value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and
are fully transferable. This model also requires the input of
highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility and expected period until options are exercised (see

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents
approximates fair value for all periods presented because of the
short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying
amounts of all other financial instruments in the consolidated
balance sheets approximate fair values.

Other Comprehensive Income

Other comprehensive income refers to revenue,
expenses, gains and losses that are recorded as an element of
shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net income. The
Company’s other comprehensive income is comprised of
unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency contracts and
marketable securities categorized as “available for
sale” under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 115 “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities.”

Foreign Exchange Contracts

Although the majority of the Company’s
transactions are in U.S. Dollars, some transactions are
based in various foreign currencies. The Company purchases
short-term, forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets,
liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product
costs denominated in foreign currencies. The contracts have
maturity dates that do not exceed six months. The Company does
not purchase short-term forward exchange contracts for trading
purposes.

The Company applies the provisions of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“SFAS 133”), as amended by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, “Accounting
for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”
and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities.” SFAS 133, as amended,
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging
activities. The Company had outstanding forward exchange
contracts with commercial banks for the Thai Baht, British Pound
Sterling and Euro with values of $173.7 million and
$35.8 million at July 2, 2004 and June 27, 2003,
respectively. Changes in fair value on these contracts were not
material to the consolidated financial statements for all years
presented.

Use of Estimates

Company management has made estimates and
assumptions relating to the reporting of certain assets and
liabilities in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. These estimates and assumptions have been applied
using methodologies, which are consistent throughout the periods
presented. However, actual results could differ from these
estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior years’ amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

During 2002, the Company sold its creditor

Note
3.     Read-Rite Asset
Acquisition

In June 2003, Read-Rite Corporation
(“Read-Rite”), then one of the Company’s
suppliers of magnetic recording heads, commenced voluntary
Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings. On July 31, 2003,
Western Digital purchased substantially all of the assets of
Read-Rite, including its wafer fabrication equipment in Fremont,
California and manufacturing facility in Bang Pa-In, Thailand.
The cost of the acquisition was $172.0 million and
consisted of cash consideration of $94.8 million, assumed
debt obligations of the Thailand operations of approximately
$60.2 million and direct costs of the acquisition and other
miscellaneous assumed obligations totaling $17.0 million.
The Company accounted for this transaction as an asset
acquisition. The estimated fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed are as follows:



WESTERN DIGITAL
CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of the date of the acquisition, Read-Rite had
two in-process research and development (“IPR&D”)
projects: 120 gigabyte per platter and 160 gigabyte per platter
products. The fair value allocated to these projects as part of
the acquisition was $17.8 million and $7.8 million,
respectively. The multi-period excess earnings method, a
discounted cash flow income approach, was used to determine the
value allocated to the IPR&D. The rate utilized to discount
the cash flows to their present values was based on the weighted
average cost of capital and an additional risk premium based on
an analysis of the technology and the IPR&D stages of
completion. Based on these factors, 27% was used as the annual
discount rate. These acquired IPR&D projects had not reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use.
Accordingly, the Company recorded the $25.6 million as a
charge to research and development expense at the time of the
acquisition.

Approximately $38.8 million of the purchase
price related to purchased technology, which is being amortized
over a weighted average period of three years. During the fiscal
year ended July 2, 2004, the Company recorded
$13.2 million of amortization expense related to these
intangible assets. Amortization expense is estimated to be
$14.4 million, $4.4 million, $3.4 million and
$3.4 million for fiscal years 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008,
respectively.

Note 4.

Short-term Borrowings and
    Long-term Debt

Short-term borrowings and long-term debt
consisted of the following (in millions):

Line of Credit

On September 19, 2003, the Company entered
into a new $125 million five-year credit facility
(“Senior Credit Facility”) replacing the facility that
matured on September 20, 2003. The new Senior Credit
Facility provides up to $75 million in revolving credit
(subject to outstanding letters of credit and a borrowing base
calculation) and a term loan of $50 million. Both the term
loan and revolving credit facility mature on September 19,
2008, and are secured by the Company’s accounts receivable,
inventory, 65% of its stock in its foreign subsidiaries and
other assets. At the option of the Company, borrowings bear
interest at either LIBOR (with option periods of one to three
months) or a base rate, plus a margin. The Senior Credit
Facility requires the Company to maintain certain levels of
income, prohibits the payment of cash dividends on common stock,
and contains a number of other covenants. The Company was in
compliance with all such covenants at July 2, 2004. The
$50 million term loan was funded on September 22, 2003
and requires quarterly principal payments of $3 million
beginning in October 2004. The Company used the proceeds from
the term loan to repay obligations incurred as a result of the
Read-Rite asset acquisition (see Note 3). At July 2,
2004 there were no borrowings under the revolving credit
facility and $71 million was available.

Convertible
Debentures

During 2003, the Company redeemed its remaining
outstanding 5.25% zero coupon convertible subordinated
debentures due February 18, 2018 (the
“Debentures”) and paid $88.3 million in cash and
issued 0.1 million shares of common stock. The book value
of the redeemed Debentures was $88.6 million, and the
aggregate principal amount at maturity was $193.5 million.
During 2002, the Company paid $17.6 million in cash and
issued 2.6 million shares of common stock in exchange for
Debentures with a book value of $31.6 million and an
aggregate principal amount at maturity of $72.4 million.
The 2002 redemptions were private, individually negotiated
transactions with certain institutional investors.

Note 5.     Commitments
and Contingencies

Lease
Commitments

The Company leases certain facilities and
equipment under long-term, non-cancelable operating and capital
leases. The Company’s operating leases consist of leased
property and equipment that expire at various dates through
2012. Rental expense under these operating leases, including
month-to-month rentals, was $14.9 million,
$11.4 million and $11.7 million in 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. The Company’s capital leases consist of
leased equipment. These leases have maturity dates through
June 30, 2007 and interest rates averaging 4.6%. Future
minimum lease payments under operating and capital leases that
have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess
of one year at July 2, 2004 are as follows (in millions):

Product
Warranty Liability

The Company records a provision for estimated
warranty costs as products are sold to cover the cost of repair
or replacement of the hard disk drive during the warranty
period. This provision is based on estimated future returns
within the warranty period and costs to repair, using historical
field return rates by product type and current average repair
cost. Changes in the warranty provision were as follows (in
millions):

The warranty provision includes amounts
classified in non-current liabilities of $10.4 million at
July 2, 2004 and $11.9 million at June 27, 2003.

Note 6.     Legal
Proceedings

On August 22, 2003, the Company and Cirrus
Logic, Inc. reached a settlement of litigation filed in
California Superior Court for the County of Orange involving
alleged breach of contract and other claims resulting from
Cirrus’ role as a strategic supplier of read channel
devices for the Company’s hard disk drives. The parties
subsequently executed a formal written settlement agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on October 16,
2003, the Company made a one-time payment to Cirrus of
$45.0 million in exchange for a mutual release of claims.
The letter of credit previously posted by the Company also has
been released. Western Digital had previously recorded an
obligation totaling approximately $26.5 million related to
the disputed payables. The difference of approximately
$18.5 million between the settlement amount and the amount
previously recorded was included in cost of sales for the fourth
quarter and year ended June 27, 2003. Formal dismissals of
claims were entered with the Court in this matter on
October 22, 2003.

In June 1994, Papst Licensing (“Papst”)
brought suit against the Company in the United States District
Court for the Central District of California, alleging
infringement by the Company of five hard disk drive motor
patents owned by Papst. In December 1994, Papst dismissed its
case without prejudice. In July 2002, Papst filed a new
complaint against the Company and several other defendants. The
suit alleges infringement by the Company of seventeen of
Papst’s patents related to hard disk drive motors that the
Company purchased from motor vendors. Papst is seeking an
injunction and damages. The Company filed an answer on
September 4, 2002, denying Papst’s complaint. On
December 11, 2002, the lawsuit was transferred to the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Louisiana and included in the consolidated pre-trial proceedings
occurring there. The lawsuit was stayed pending the outcome of
certain other related litigation. The Company believes that the
outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse impact
on the Company’s financial statements. The Company intends
to vigorously defend the suit.

In the normal course of business, the Company is
subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims.
Although the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or
financial impact with respect to these matters, including the
matter described in the preceding paragraph, is subject to many
uncertainties and is therefore not predictable with assurance,
management believes that any monetary liability or financial
impact to the Company from these matters, individually and in
the aggregate, beyond that provided at July 2, 2004, would
not be material to the Company’s financial condition.
However, there can be no assurance with respect to such result,
and monetary liability or financial impact to the Company from
these legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims could differ
materially from those projected.

Note 7.     Shareholders’
Equity

Stock
Option Plans

Western Digital’s Employee Stock Option Plan
(“Employee Plan”) is administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors (“Compensation
Committee”), which determines the vesting provisions, the
form of payment for the shares and all other terms of the
options. Terms of the Employee Plan require that the exercise
price of options be not less than the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of grant. Options granted generally
vest 25% one year from the date of grant and in twelve quarterly
increments thereafter and have a ten-year term. As of
July 2, 2004, options to purchase 9.1 million
shares of common stock were exercisable and 3.9 million
shares were available for grant under this plan. Pursuant to the
terms of the Employee Plan, participants are permitted to
utilize previously purchased common stock as consideration to
purchase additional common stock upon exercise of options or to
exercise on a cashless basis through the Company-designated
broker.

The Company has a Broad-Based Stock Incentive
Plan (the “Broad-Based Plan”) under which options to
purchase shares of common stock and stock awards may be granted
to employees of the Company and others. This plan is intended to
qualify as “broadly-based” under the New York Stock
Exchange shareholder approval policy. The Compensation Committee
determines the vesting provisions and other terms of the options
and stock. To date, the options granted vest either one-year,
two years or four years from the date of grant. As of
July 2, 2004, options to purchase 6.0 million
shares



WESTERN DIGITAL
CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of common stock were exercisable and
0.9 million shares were available for grant as options or
stock awards under this plan.

Under the Broad-Based Plan, the Company issued to
certain employees 0.1 million and 0.2 million (net of
cancellations) shares of restricted stock during 2004 and 2002,
respectively. No shares of restricted stock were issued in 2003.
The stock issued in 2004 vests on the third, fourth, and fifth
anniversary dates of the grant and the stock issued in 2002
vests on the second and third anniversary dates of the grant,
provided that the recipient is still employed by the Company.
The aggregate market value (net of cancellations) of the
restricted stock at the dates of issuance was $1.3 million
and $1.1 million for 2004 and 2002, respectively. These
amounts have been recorded as deferred compensation, a separate
component of shareholders’ equity, and are being amortized
over the corresponding vesting periods.

The Company has a Stock Option Plan for
Non-Employee Directors (“Director Plan”) and has
reserved 2.6 million shares for issuance thereunder. The
Director Plan provides for initial option grants to new
directors of 75,000 shares per director and additional
grants of options to purchase 10,000 shares of common
stock per director each year upon their reelection as a director
at the annual shareholders’ meeting. Terms of the Director
Plan require that options have a ten-year term and that the
exercise price of options be not less than the fair market value
at the date of grant. Options granted generally vest 25% one
year from the date of grant and in twelve quarterly increments
thereafter and have a ten-year term. As of July 2, 2004,
options to purchase 0.7 million shares of common stock were
exercisable and 0.8 million shares were available for grant
under this plan.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has an employee stock purchase plan
(“ESPP”) that operates in accordance with
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code whereby eligible
employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their
salary to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at
85% of the fair market value of common stock on the date of
grant or the exercise date, whichever is less. Approximately
5.4 million shares of common stock remain reserved for
issuance under this plan. Approximately 2.2 million,
2.1 million and 1.3 million shares were issued under
this plan during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The following is a summary of the per share
weighted average fair value of stock options granted in the

Stock
Purchase Rights

In 1989, the Company implemented a plan to
protect shareholders’ rights in the event of a proposed
takeover of the Company. Under the plan, each share of the
Company’s outstanding common stock carried one Right to
Purchase Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the
“Right”). The Right enabled the holder, under certain
circumstances, to purchase common stock of Western Digital or of
an acquiring company at a substantially discounted price ten
days after a person or group publicly announces it has acquired
or has tendered an offer for 15% or more of the Company’s
outstanding common stock. On September 10, 1998 the
Company’s Board of Directors approved the adoption of a new
Rights plan to replace the previous plan, which expired in
September 1998. The Rights under the 1998 plan were similar to
the rights under the 1989 plan except they were redeemable by
the Company at $.01 per Right and expired in 2008. In
connection with the establishment of a holding company structure
on April 6, 2001, the Company terminated the Rights under
the 1998 plan and adopted a new Rights plan. The 2001 plan is
similar to the terminated 1998 plan, except that the exercise
price was reduced from $150.00 to $50.00 per share, and the
expiration date for the 2001 Rights plan was extended to April
2011.

The Western Digital
    Corporation 401(k) Plan

Effective July 1, 1991, the Company adopted
the Western Digital Corporation 401(k) Plan (the
“Plan”) formerly known as the Western Digital
Corporation Retirement Savings and Profit Sharing Plan. The Plan
covers substantially all domestic employees, subject to certain
eligibility requirements. The Company may make annual
contributions to the 401(k) plan at the discretion of the Board
of Directors. For 2004, 2003 and 2002 the Company made
contributions to the 401(k) plan of $2.9 million,
$1.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively.

Discontinued
    Operations

The Company acquired Connex, Inc.
(“Connex”), a storage systems and solutions startup,
in 1999. SANavigator, Inc. (“SANavigator”) was formed
as a subsidiary of Connex in 2001 and developed and marketed
storage area network management software.

During 2000, the Company formed Keen Personal
Media, Inc. (“Keen PM”), to develop and sell
interactive personal video recorder and set-top box software,
services and hardware for broadband television content
management and commerce.

In 2002, the Company discontinued Connex,
SANavigator and Keen. The disposals have been accounted for as
discontinued operations and, accordingly, the consolidated
financial statements for all periods presented have been
reclassified. In August 2001, substantially all of the operating
assets of Connex were sold to Quantum Corporation for cash
proceeds of $11.0 million, and in September 2001
substantially all of the operating assets of SANavigator were
sold to McData Corporation for cash proceeds of
$29.8 million. These transactions generated a gain of
$24.5 million, net of costs incurred from the measurement
date of July 1, 2001 through the end of the period to

Income Taxes

The domestic and international components of
income (loss) before income taxes are as follows (in millions):

The components of the income tax expense
(benefit) are as follows (in millions):

The tax benefits associated with employee
exercises of non-qualified stock options, disqualifying
dispositions of stock acquired with incentive stock options, and
disqualifying dispositions of stock acquired under the employee
stock purchase plan generally reduce taxes currently payable.
However, no tax benefits were recorded to additional paid-in
capital in 2004, 2003 and 2002 because their realization was not
believed to be more likely than not. Consequently, a valuation
allowance was recorded against the entire benefit. Benefits
which may be recognized in the future related to stock option
deductions are approximately $43.6 million.

During 2002, the company received a refund of
U.S. federal income taxes of $3.1 million. This refund
was for alternative minimum taxes paid in prior years and was
made in accordance with legislation enacted during 2002.

Temporary differences and carryforwards, which
give rise to a significant portion of deferred tax assets and
liabilities at July 2, 2004 and June 27, 2003 are as
follows (in millions):



WESTERN DIGITAL

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Reserves and accrued expenses not currently
deductible include the following (in millions):

Remaining net undistributed earnings from foreign
subsidiaries at July 2, 2004 on which no U.S. tax has
been provided, amounted to approximately $401.3 million.
The net undistributed earnings are intended to finance local
operating requirements. Accordingly, an additional United States
tax provision has not been made on these earnings.

The Company determines deferred taxes for each of
its tax-paying subsidiaries within each tax jurisdiction. The
deferred tax assets indicated above are attributable primarily
to tax jurisdictions where a history of earnings has not been
established. The taxable earnings in these tax jurisdictions are
subject to volatility. Therefore, the Company believes a
valuation allowance is needed to reduce the deferred tax asset
to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

Reconciliation of the United States federal
statutory rate to the Company’s effective tax rate is as
follows:

Certain income of selected subsidiaries is taxed
at substantially lower income tax rates as compared to local
statutory rates. The lower rates reduced income taxes and
improved net income by $54.9 million ($0.25 per
diluted share), $33.6 million ($0.16 per diluted
share) and $29.3 million ($0.15 per diluted share) in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These lower rates are in
effect in Thailand through 2011 and in Malaysia through 2014.

At July 2, 2004, the Company had federal and
state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$603.0 million and $490.5 million, respectively. These
loss carryforwards are available to offset future federal and
state taxable income through 2022 and 2014, respectively. In
addition, the Company had various federal and state tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $47.5 million. Approximately
$23.5 million of these credit carryforwards are available
to offset future taxable income through 2024, and the remaining
$24.0 million are available indefinitely.

Controls and
    Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and
evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and management is
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures.

As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), the
Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of the Company’s management,
including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on the foregoing, the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective
to provide reasonable assurance that the Company would meet its
disclosure obligations.

There has been no change in the Company’s
internal controls over financial reporting during the

affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.

the consolidated financial statements or related Notes.

Separate financial statements of the Company have
been omitted as the Company is primarily an operating company
and its subsidiaries are wholly or majority owned and do not
have minority equity interests and/or indebtedness to any person
other than the Company in amounts which together exceed 5% of
