PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

We design, develop, manufacture and sell hard drives. A hard
    drive is a device that uses one or more rotating magnetic disks
    (“magnetic media”) to store and allow fast access to
    data. Hard drives are key components of computers, including
    desktop and notebook computers (“PCs”), data storage
    subsystems and many consumer electronic (“CE”) devices.

We sell our products worldwide to original equipment
    manufacturers (“OEMs”) and original design
    manufacturers (“ODMs”) for use in computer systems,
    subsystems or CE devices, and to distributors, resellers and
    retailers. Our hard drives are used in desktop computers,
    notebook computers, and enterprise applications such as servers,
    workstations, network attached storage, storage area networks
    and video surveillance equipment. Additionally, our hard drives
    are used in CE applications such as digital video recorders
    (“DVRs”), and satellite and cable set-top boxes
    (“STBs”). We also sell our hard drives as stand-alone
    storage products and integrate them into finished enclosures,
    embedding application software and offering the products as
    WD

®

-branded

    external storage appliances for personal data backup and
    portable or expanded storage of digital music, photographs,
    video and other digital data.

Hard drives provide non-volatile data storage, which means that
    the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the
    device. Our hard drives currently include 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch
    form factor drives, having capacities ranging from 40 gigabytes
    (“GB”) to 2 terabytes (“TB”), nominal
    rotation speeds up to 10,000 revolutions per minute
    (“RPM”), and offer interfaces including both Enhanced
    Integrated Drive Electronics (“EIDE”) and Serial
    Advanced Technology Attachment (“SATA”). We also embed
    our hard drives into
    WD

®

-branded

    external storage appliances using interfaces such as USB 2.0,
    external SATA,
    FireWire

tm

and Ethernet network connections with capacities of 160 GB up to
    8 TB. In addition, we offer a family of hard drives specifically
    designed to consume substantially less power than standard
    drives, utilizing our WD GreenPower
    Technology

tm

.

In the second quarter of 2009, we began to design, develop,
    manufacture and sell media players. A media player is a device
    that connects to a user’s television or home theater system
    and plays digital movies, music and photos from any of our
    WD

®

-branded

    external hard drives or other USB mass storage devices. We sell
    our media players worldwide to resellers and retailers under our
    WD

®

brand.

In the third quarter of 2009, with the acquisition of
    SiliconSystems, Inc. (“SiliconSystems”), we began to
    design, develop, manufacture and sell solid-state drives. A
    solid-state drive is a storage device that uses semiconductor,
    non-volatile media, rather than magnetic disks and magnetic
    heads, to store and allow fast access to data. We sell our
    solid-state drives worldwide to OEMs and distributors for use in
    the embedded systems market which includes
    network-communications, industrial, embedded-computing, medical,
    military, aerospace, media-appliance and data-streaming
    applications.

Business
    Strategy

Our business strategy is to provide a broad selection of
    reliable, high quality hard drives at a low total cost of
    ownership and with high efficiency and speed. We believe this
    strategy helps accomplish the following:

•

distinguishes us in the dynamic and competitive hard drive
    industry;

•

provides great value to our customers;

•

allows us to better achieve consistent financial performance,
    including strong returns on invested capital; and

•

provides continued diversification of our hard drive product set
    and entry into additional markets such as solid-state drives and
    media players.

We have designed our business strategy to accommodate
    significant unit and revenue growth with relatively small
    increases in operating expenses and to consistently achieve high
    asset utilization.



Industry

We design, develop and manufacture hard drives for the desktop
    and mobile PC, enterprise, CE and branded product retail
    markets. We believe that growth in the sales of hard drives has
    continued to outpace the growth in the sales of all PCs as there
    were approximately 84% more hard drives sold in the market than
    PCs in calendar 2008, based on industry data. We believe the
    following factors continue to drive this accelerating growth of
    hard drive sales in addition to PC applications:

•

consumer use of hard drives for the playing, retention and
    creation of digital content for personal use in the rapidly
    growing CE market;

•

growth of the external hard drive or branded products market,
    permitting the easy storage, portability and backup of digital
    data such as music, photographs or video;

•

increased use of multiple hard drives in PCs for data backup and
    expanded storage capacity; and

•

increased use of multiple cost-optimized high performance hard
    drives in data-intensive applications such as Internet search
    engines and in hard drive intensive hosts for handheld computing
    devices.

Additionally, we believe that the demand for 2.5-inch hard
    drives has grown from approximately 16% of the overall hard
    drive market in calendar 2003 to 41% of the overall hard drive
    market in calendar 2008, driven by the fast-growing markets for
    notebook and netbook computers, game consoles and external
    storage.

We design, develop and manufacture solid-state drives for the
    embedded systems market which includes network-communications,
    industrial, embedded-computing, medical, military, aerospace,
    media appliance and data streaming applications. We believe that
    the growth rate of solid-state drives will be significant over
    the next four years, with particular opportunities for growth in
    the enterprise storage, netbooks, and embedded systems markets.

We also design, develop and manufacture
    WD

®

-branded

    media players for the retail market. We believe there is a
    growing need for consumers to play their stored digital content
    on their television or home theater system in connection with
    the growing trend in the digitization of rich content and data.

These factors and our product expansion strategy have gradually
    increased our percentage of revenue derived from non-desktop
    sources. In 2009, 62% of our revenue was from non-desktop
    sources compared to 56% in 2008.

For an additional discussion of risks relating to the hard drive
    industry, please see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Desktop
    PC Market

The desktop PC market consists of the overall hard drive market
    for desktop computers. Individuals use desktop computers in
    homes, businesses and multi-user networks. Desktop computers use
    software applications for word processing, spreadsheet, desktop
    publishing, database management, multimedia, entertainment and
    for other needs. Hard drives store desktop computer operating
    system and application software, as well as the data used by the
    applications.

We believe that the demand for hard drives in the desktop PC
    market has grown in part due to:

•

the overall growth of desktop computer sales;

•

the increasing needs of businesses and individuals for increased
    storage capacity on their desktop computers;

•

the continuing development of software applications to manage
    multimedia content; and

•

the increasing use of broadband Internet, including content
    downloaded from the Internet onto desktop computer hard drives.

We believe several other factors affect the rate of desktop
    computer unit growth, including growth of notebook and netbook
    computers, maturing desktop PC markets in North America and
    Western Europe, an increase in first-time buyers of desktop
    computers in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, and the
    lengthening of desktop computer replacement cycles.



Mobile PC
    Market

The mobile PC market consists primarily of notebook and netbook
    computers. Individuals use mobile computers both in and away
    from homes and businesses. Like desktop computers, mobile
    computers use software applications for various needs and hard
    drives store notebook operating system and application software,
    and the data used by the applications.

We believe that the demand for hard drives in the mobile PC
    market has grown in part due to:

•

the overall growth of mobile sales, including increased
    transition from desktop computers to mobile computers;

•

the increased mobility of the workforce;

•

the increasing needs of businesses and individuals for increased
    storage capacity on their notebook computers;

•

the continuing development of software applications to manage
    multimedia content; and

•

the increasing use of broadband Internet, including content
    downloaded from the Internet onto notebook hard drives.

We expect the mobile PC market to continue to grow faster than
    the desktop or enterprise markets in the next three years. As
    the mobile PC market continues to evolve to a higher volume
    market, we believe customers are placing increased emphasis on
    attributes such as quality, availability, reliability,
    execution, flexibility, capacity, performance, power and the
    competitive cost structures of their hard drive suppliers. These
    are the same attributes that have been emphasized for many years
    by customers in the high-volume desktop PC market.

Enterprise
    Market

The enterprise market for hard drives includes workstations,
    servers, network attached storage, storage area networks, other
    computing systems or subsystems, and video surveillance.
    Historically, hard drives for this market have utilized several
    interfaces, including the Small Computer Systems Interface
    (“SCSI”) and Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop
    (“FC-AL”). Beginning in 2003, these traditional
    enterprise interfaces have been supplemented or replaced in
    certain storage applications by hard drives featuring the Serial
    Attached SCSI (“SAS”) interface technology, which is
    supported by industry standards, as well as by SATA. SATA hard
    drives typically cost customers less than SCSI hard drives while
    offering higher capacities and maintaining similar reliability,
    scalability and performance.

We believe that enterprise uses of SATA hard drives will
    continue to increase. During the past few years, a new
    disk-based

back-up

application has emerged with high-capacity SATA hard drives
    augmenting SCSI and SAS hard drives, tape and optical media.
    This new application, popularly referred to as
    “near-line” storage, has created a growth market
    because hard drives back up or access data more quickly than
    tape or optical solutions, and quickly retrieve critical

back-up

or
    near-line data. The availability of SATA hard drive solutions,
    which are more cost effective than SCSI and SAS hard drives,
    promotes the increasing use of high-capacity hard drives in
    near-line storage applications. The low price per capacity of
    SATA drives has stimulated new applications such as video
    surveillance, video editing/broadcasting and medical imaging.
    These applications represent segments of a growing market for
    high capacity storage in non-computing imaging and multimedia
    professions.

Enterprise-class SATA drives are becoming commonplace for
    IT infrastructure applications such as databases, scientific
    computing, web content, web caching, web search engines and
    electronic mail. These applications have become an important
    market for high-capacity SATA hard drives. We believe that this
    market will consume a growing portion of the highest capacity
    hard drives in the next three years.

SAS is the next generation SCSI technology and has been
    replacing SCSI drives over the past few years. SATA technology
    is compatible with SAS technology, enabling customers the
    flexibility of incorporating SATA hard drives in SAS storage
    systems. We believe the market transition from SCSI to SAS has
    added to the growth of the enterprise-class SATA market,
    which currently is estimated to be approximately 47% of the
    enterprise hard drive market.

High-performance server applications, including blade servers,
    are increasingly using 2.5-inch form factor hard drives,
    supplanting traditional 3.5-inch drives. Smaller form factors
    enable more drives per physical space for increased



performance, higher capacity per square foot and lower power
    consumption. This trend demonstrates the fragmentation of the
    enterprise hard drive market and the need for
    application-specific enterprise-class hard drives.

Consumer
    Electronics Market

The use of hard drives in CE products has been a major growth
    area in recent years. Currently, the three largest segments of
    this market are:

•

video content in applications such as DVRs;

•

audio and video content in applications such as consumer
    handheld devices, including MP3 players; and

•

hard drives in game consoles.

Since 1999, DVRs have been available for use in home
    entertainment systems and they offer enhanced capabilities such
    as pausing live television, simplifying the process of recording
    and cataloging recorded television programs and quickly
    forwarding or returning to any section of a recorded television
    program. Additionally, digital video disk (“DVD”)
    recorders increasingly incorporate hard drives to allow for DVR
    functionality and faster recording of content onto removable
    DVDs. The market for these products favors larger capacity hard
    drives and continues to grow in Japan, North America and Europe.
    Additionally, the rest of Asia Pacific shows strong interest in
    this market. We believe growth in this market will continue to
    build demand for higher capacity hard drives.

The proliferation in the CE market of more sophisticated mobile
    devices including cell phones and MP3 players is driving the
    delivery of diverse content from hard drive intensive hosts. We
    believe this is one of the factors influencing increased sales
    of enterprise-class SATA drives. We also believe that
    multimedia handheld devices such as video cameras and
    high-resolution still cameras are enabling consumer production
    of expansive digital content that requires increasing amounts of
    small form-factor hard drive storage, as well as high-capacity
    desktop-class hard drives for editing, manipulation and
    long-term storage of such content.

Hard drives with 1.8-inch or 1.0-inch form factors primarily
    address the consumer handheld device and portable external
    storage markets. The majority of hard drives used in portable
    media players that play both digital audio and video content are
    1.8-inch form factors. Currently, we believe the markets for
    these handheld devices are better served by flash memory as
    opposed to rotating magnetic storage.

External
    Hard Drive Market

Most new PC systems include high-speed external interfaces, such
    as USB 2.0, external SATA,
    FireWire

tm

or Ethernet network connections, that permit users to supplement
    the storage space of their PC systems or home and small office
    networks with the use of external hard drives. Users store
    additional programs or multimedia content, and back up internal
    hard drives with external hard drives, as well as mobile
    external hard drives for mobility convenience. Although external
    hard drives are a small part of the overall hard drive market,
    we believe that sales of external hard drives will continue to
    grow. External storage can often be the easiest, quickest or
    only way of adding additional storage capacity to either a
    desktop or notebook computer. We believe there is an increasing
    consumer awareness of the need and value of securely storing
    personal digital content through backup applications and
    devices. In addition, there is opportunity for external storage
    as a way of expanding storage capacity in CE devices such as
    DVRs. We also believe there is a growing need for media players
    that enable consumers to play digital movies, music and photos,
    otherwise limited to being viewed on computer screens, from USB
    mass storage devices on their television or home theater system.

Solid-State
    Drive Market

The solid-state drive market consists primarily of solid-state
    drives constructed with semiconductor, non-volatile media that
    retains data even when power is not applied using either
    single-level cell or multilevel cell NAND media. Our solid-state
    drive products are currently used in the embedded systems market
    which includes network-communications, industrial,
    embedded-computing, medical, military, aerospace, media
    appliance and data streaming applications.

We believe that the demand for solid-state drives in certain
    markets has grown in part due to:

•

the increasing performance, measured by input/output per second,
    in enterprise applications;



•

the increasing low entry cost applications in the netbook
    markets;

•

the increasing premium performance applications in the desktop
    and notebook markets; and

•

the increasing requirements of the embedded systems market for
    high durability and long life cycles.

We expect the solid-state drive market to grow faster on a
    compounded annual growth rate basis than the hard drive market
    over the next four years.

Other
    Market Opportunities

We regularly review opportunities to apply our knowledge of data
    storage technology to markets that we do not currently serve.
    Based on significant investments we made over the last five
    years, we believe we have the technology building blocks to
    increase our overall market penetration and be a full-line hard
    drive supplier. Consistent with our measured and deliberate
    approach to new market entries in the recent past, our approach
    to additional new markets will be based on a careful assessment
    of the risks, rewards, requirements and profit potential of such
    actions.

Desktop
    Hard Drive Products

The hard drives we design for the desktop PC market currently
    consist of 3.5-inch form factor products with capacities ranging
    from 40 GB to 2 TB. These products utilize either the EIDE or
    SATA interfaces, providing high performance while retaining ease
    of use and overall low cost of connection. The type of EIDE
    interface currently used in our hard drives is ATA/100, which
    signifies a burst data transfer rate of 100 megabytes per
    second, which is the maximum specified data transition that can
    be sustained under ideal conditions. The SATA interface
    available in the majority of our hard drives enables burst
    transfer rates of up to 3 gigabits (Gb) per second.

Mobile
    Hard Drive Products

Our hard drives used in mobile products typically include
    2.5-inch form factor drives for notebook computers. Although the
    desktop PC market still accounts for a majority of hard drive
    sales, unit shipments of hard drives for notebook computers
    represent a growing share of the total. We entered the 2.5-inch
    mobile market in September 2004. We are now shipping our seventh
    generation of the WD
    Scorpio

®

product family, offering up to 1 TB of capacity. Our product
    expansion, including a high-performance hard drive spinning at
    7,200 RPM and producing ultra-high capacities for specific
    applications with a three platter platform, has enabled us to
    provide customers with a full-line of 2.5-inch mobile drives and
    helped us enhance our market position in this fast-growing
    market.

Research
    and Development

We devote substantial resources to development of new products
    and improvement of existing products. We focus our engineering
    efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing
    processes to bring our products to market in a cost-effective
    and timely manner. Research and development expenses totaled
    $509 million, $464 million and $306 million in
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Fiscal 2009 represented the eighth consecutive year of
    substantial growth in our research and development spending to
    support our significant broadening of our product and technology
    portfolios. Over that eight-year period, we grew our research
    and development spending 350% from $113 million in fiscal
    2001 to $509 million in fiscal 2009. As a result of this
    investment activity, we continue to expand our business beyond
    the desktop PC market into newer markets or markets in which we
    have not previously participated. Such investments have allowed
    us to execute against our strategic objective of revenue
    diversification to address the growth of new applications for
    hard drives and fast-growing new market opportunities.

Technology
    and Product Development

Hard drives record, store and retrieve digital data. Performance
    attributes of hard drives, such as their ability to access and
    transmit data and storage capacity, are currently better than
    removable or floppy disks, optical hard drives and tapes, and
    they are more cost effective than semiconductor technology. The
    primary measures of hard drive performance include:

•

“Acoustics” — which is the sound power
    emitted during hard drive operation, commonly expressed in
    decibels, and perceived loudness due to sound pressure, commonly
    expressed in sones.

•

“Data transfer rate” — which is the
    sustained rate of data transfer to and from the disk, commonly
    expressed in gigabits per second. One gigabit equals one billion
    bits.

•

“Seek time” — which is the time needed to
    position the heads over a selected track on the disk surface,
    commonly expressed in milliseconds.

•

“Spindle rotation speed” — which is the
    nominal rotation speed of the disks inside the hard drive,
    commonly expressed in RPM or latency. Spindle rotation speeds
    commonly stated as 5,400, 7,200 and 10,000 RPM are sometimes
    approximations.

•

“Storage capacity” — which is the amount of
    data that can be stored on the hard drive, commonly expressed in
    GB or TB. As defined in the hard drive industry, one GB equals
    one billion bytes and one TB equals one trillion bytes. A byte
    is a digital character, typically comprised of eight bits. A bit
    is a binary digit, the smallest unit of information in a digital
    system.

•

“Power Consumption” — which is the amount of
    electricity required to operate the drive, measured in watts.

All of our hard drive products employ similar technology. The
    main components of the hard drive are a Head-Disk-Assembly
    (“HDA”) and a Printed Circuit Board Assembly
    (“PCBA”). The HDA includes heads, magnetic media
    (“disks”), head positioning mechanism
    (“actuator”) and spindle motor. A rigid base and top
    cover contain these components in a contamination-controlled
    environment. The PCBA includes both standard and custom
    integrated circuits, an interface connector to the host computer
    and a power connector.

HDA: One or more disks positioned around a motor-driven spindle
    hub that rotates the disks comprise the disk-pack assembly. The
    disk is made up of a smooth substrate on which thin layers of
    magnetic materials are deposited. The head stack assembly
    (“HSA”) is comprised of a magnetic positioner, a
    pivot-arm module, on which the individual heads



are mounted. Each disk has a head suspended directly above it,
    which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk.

PCBA: The integrated circuits on the printed circuit board
    typically include a drive interface and a controller. The drive
    interface receives instructions from the host computer, while
    the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and
    controls the heads. The location of data on each disk is
    logically maintained in concentric tracks divided into sectors.
    The host computer sends instructions to the controller to read
    data from or write data to the disks, based on logical track and
    sector locations. Guided by instructions from the controller,
    the HSA pivots in an arc, across the disk until it reaches the
    selected track of a disk, where the data is recorded or
    retrieved.

Industry-standard interfaces allow the hard drive to communicate
    with the computer. Currently, the primary interfaces for PCs are
    EIDE (Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment, or
    “PATA”) and SATA, and the primary interfaces for
    enterprise systems are SATA, SCSI, SAS, and FC-AL. As computer
    performance continues to improve, the hard drive will need to
    deliver information faster. We believe this will continue to
    drive the PC industry transition to higher speed interfaces,
    such as SATA and SAS, to facilitate the higher data transfer
    rates. We currently offer the SATA interface on our WD
    Caviar

    families.

The number of disks and each disk’s areal density (track
    density multiplied by bit density), which is a measure of the
    amount of data that can be stored on the recording surface of
    the disk per unit area, determines storage capacity of the hard
    drive. The higher the areal density, the more information can be
    stored on a single platter. Achieving a given drive capacity
    requires fewer disks and heads as the areal density increases,
    potentially reducing product costs over time through reduced
    component requirements. In January 2009, we began shipping our
    WD
    Caviar

®

3.5-inch family of drives at 500 GB per platter (approximately
    400 gigabits per square inch) areal density. In July 2009, we
    began shipping our WD
    Scorpio

®

Blue

tm

2.5-inch 1 TB drives at 333 GB per platter (approximately 525
    gigabits per square inch) areal density.

Head technology is one of the key components affecting areal
    density. Historically, there have been rapid technological
    changes resulting in several generations of head technology in a
    relatively short time. However, in recent years the time has
    lengthened between changes in generations of head technology.
    The hard drive industry has transitioned from the use of
    longitudinal magnetic recording (“LMR”) head
    technology for the head writer function to perpendicular
    magnetic recording (“PMR”) technology, which allows
    for significantly higher storage capacities. In addition, the
    industry has made the transition to tunnel-junction magneto
    resistive (“TMR”) technology for the head reader
    function. We have completed the transition to PMR and TMR across
    all of our product platforms.

With the transition to PMR, magnetic media plays a much more
    important role in achieving higher areal density. PMR demands a
    much tighter interaction and matching between head and magnetic
    media designs. We are vertically integrated in the two most
    important technology components of hard drives (heads and
    magnetic media), which has enabled us to achieve a more optimum
    design and utilization of these components.

We invest considerable resources in research and development,
    manufacturing infrastructure and capital equipment of head and
    magnetic media components, in order to secure our competitive
    position and cost structure.

Solid-state drives record, store and retrieve digital data
    without any moving parts. Attributes, such as fast read/write
    speeds, low power consumption and robust durability offer
    greater performance than hard drives in some storage
    applications but are currently much more costly per gigabyte and
    are available in much lower capacity points than hard drives.
    The main components of a solid-state drive are the

system-on-chip

and semiconductor media. The capacity, measured in megabytes or
    gigabytes, of a solid-state drive is based on the total number
    of megabits or gigabits of semiconductor media in the
    solid-state drive. Industry-standard storage interface
    protocols, such as SATA,

PATA/EIDE/CF

and USB 2.0, allow the solid-state drive to communicate with the
    host system.

The
    WD

®

product lines generally leverage a common platform for various
    products within product families with different capacities to
    serve differing market needs. This platform strategy results in
    commonality of components across different products within
    product families and, in some cases, across product families,
    which reduces exposure to changes in demand, facilitates
    inventory management and allows us to achieve lower costs
    through purchasing economies. This platform strategy also
    enables our customers to leverage their qualification efforts
    onto successive product models.

    innovations, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Sales and
    Distribution

We sell our products globally to OEMs, ODMs, distributors and
    retailers. OEMs purchase our products, either directly or
    through a contract manufacturer such as an ODM, and assemble
    them into the computer or CE systems they build. Distributors
    typically sell our products to non-direct customers such as
    small computer and CE manufacturers, dealers, systems
    integrators, online retailers and other resellers. Retailers
    typically sell our products directly to end-users through their
    storefront or online facilities.

Original
    Equipment Manufacturers

Sales to OEMs, which include sales through ODMs, accounted for
    54%, 51% and 48% of our net revenue in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. For 2009 and 2007, sales to Dell Inc. accounted
    for 10% of our net revenue. For 2008, no single customer
    accounted for 10%, or more, of our net revenue. We believe that
    our success depends on our ability to maintain and improve our
    strong relationships with the leading OEMs.

OEMs evaluate and select their hard drive and solid-state drive
    suppliers based on a number of factors, including quality and
    reliability, storage capacities, performance characteristics,
    price, service and support, ease of doing business, and the
    supplier’s long-term financial stability. They typically
    seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of
    products, and once an OEM has chosen its qualified vendors for a
    given product, it generally will purchase products from those
    vendors for the life of that product. To achieve success with
    OEM qualifications, a supplier must consistently offer products
    featuring leading technology, quality and reliability at
    acceptable capacity. Suppliers must quickly achieve volume
    production of each new generation of high quality and reliable
    hard drives or solid-state drives, requiring access to flexible,
    high-capacity, high-quality manufacturing capabilities.

Many of our OEM customers utilize

just-in-time

inventory management processes or supply chain business models
    that combine

“build-to-order,”

in which they do not build until there is a firm order, and
    “contract manufacturing,” in which the OEM contracts
    assembly work to a contract manufacturer, such as an ODM, who
    purchases components and assembles the computer based on the
    OEM’s instructions. For certain OEMs, we maintain a base
    stock of finished goods inventory in facilities located near or
    adjacent to the OEM’s operations.

For an additional discussion of risks related to our need to
    adapt to our customers’ business models and maintain
    customer satisfaction, refer to Item 1A of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Distributors

We use a broad group of distributors to sell our products to
    non-direct customers such as small computer and CE
    manufacturers, dealers, systems integrators, online retailers
    and other resellers. Distributors accounted for approximately
    26%, 31% and 36% of our net revenue for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Distributors generally enter into non-exclusive
    agreements for specific territories with us for the purchase and
    redistribution of our products in those territories. We grant
    our distributors limited price protection rights.

Retailers

We sell our branded products directly to a select group of major
    retailers such as computer superstores, warehouse clubs, online
    retailers, and computer electronics stores, and authorize sales
    through distributors to smaller retailers. Retailers accounted
    for approximately 20%, 18% and 16% of our net revenue for 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. Our current retail customer base is
    primarily in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada and
    Europe. The retail channel complements our other sales channels
    while helping to build brand awareness for WD and our products.
    Retailers supply end-users with our products to upgrade their
    computers, externally store their data for backup or mobility
    purposes and play their stored digital content on their
    television or home theater systems. We grant our retailers price
    protection and limited rights to return product on an inventory
    rotation basis. We also sell our branded products through our
    web site.



Sales and
    Marketing

We maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world
    including the major geographies of the Americas, Asia Pacific,
    Europe and the Middle East. Our international sales, which
    include sales to foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies but
    do not include sales to U.S. subsidiaries of foreign
    companies, represented 80%, 76% and 68% of our net revenue for
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Sales to international
    customers may be subject to certain risks not normally
    encountered in domestic operations, including exposure to
    tariffs and various trade regulations. For an additional
    discussion regarding the risks related to sales to international
    customers, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

For additional information concerning revenue recognition, sales
    by geographic region and major customer information, see
    Part II, Item 8, Notes 1 and 6 in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

We perform our marketing and advertising functions internally
    and through outside firms. We target advertising, worldwide
    packaging and marketing materials to various reseller and
    end-user categories. We utilize both consumer media and trade
    publications. We have programs under which we reimburse
    qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing
    expenditures. We also maintain customer relationships by
    communicating with our resellers and providing end-users with
    information and support through our web site.

Competition

We compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives for use
    in desktop, notebook, enterprise, CE and external storage
    products. Our competitors in the hard drive market include
    companies such as Fujitsu Limited (which has announced that the
    transfer of its hard drive business to Toshiba has been delayed
    until September 2009), Hitachi Global Storage Technologies,
    Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., Seagate Technology and Toshiba
    Corporation.

The hard drive industry is intensely competitive, with hard
    drive suppliers competing for sales to a limited number of major
    customers. Hard drives manufactured by different competitors are
    highly substitutable due to the industry mandate of technical
    form, fit and function standards. Hard drive manufacturers
    compete on the basis of product quality and reliability, storage
    capacity, unit price, product performance, production volume
    capabilities, delivery capability, leadership in

time-to-market,

time-to-volume

and

time-to-quality,

service and support and ease of doing business. The relative
    importance of these factors varies by customer and market. We
    believe that we are generally competitive in all of these
    factors.

We believe that there are no substantial barriers for existing
    competitors to offer competing products. Therefore, we believe
    that we cannot differentiate
    WD

®

hard drive products solely on attributes such as storage
    capacity, buffer size or

time-to-market.

Accordingly, we differentiate WD by focusing on operational
    excellence, high product quality and reliability, and designing
    and incorporating into our hard drives desirable product
    performance attributes. Such performance attributes include seek
    times, data transfer rates, intelligent caching, failure
    prediction, remote diagnostics, acoustics, error recovery, low
    operating temperature, low power consumption and optimized
    streaming capabilities.

In addition, we differentiate WD by emphasizing non-product
    related attributes, including rapid response to our customers.
    Rapid response requires accelerated design cycles, customer
    delivery, production flexibility and timely service and support,
    which contribute to customer satisfaction. We also rely on the
    strength of the WD brand name with value-added resellers,
    retailers and solution providers to whom we sell our hard drive
    products directly and indirectly. We believe that trust in a
    manufacturer’s reputation, its execution track record and
    the establishment of strategic relationships have become
    important factors in the selection of a hard drive, particularly
    in a rapidly changing technology environment.

Advances in magnetic, optical or other data storage technologies
    could result in competitive products with better performance or
    lower cost per unit of capacity than our products. We monitor
    the advantages, disadvantages and advances of the full array of
    storage technologies on an ongoing basis.

High-speed semiconductor media competes with hard drive products
    in some applications, such as consumer handheld devices and
    portable external storage. Semiconductor media is much faster in
    some applications than magnetic hard drives, but currently is
    not competitive in most applications using 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch
    form factor hard drives



from a cost standpoint. Flash memory, a non-volatile
    semiconductor media, is currently much more costly and, while it
    has higher “read” performance attributes than hard
    drives, it has lower “write” performance attributes.
    Flash memory could become more competitive in the near future
    for additional applications requiring less storage capacity than
    that provided by hard drives. However, we believe that the
    traditional high-volume computing markets will remain the domain
    of 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch hard drives based on the hard drive
    industry’s attributes of reliability, availability and cost.

Our competitors in the external hard drive market include
    companies such as EMC Corporation, Hitachi Global Storage
    Technologies, LaCie Group, Melco Holdings Inc. and Seagate
    Technology. Our competitors in the solid-state drive market
    include companies such as Intel Corporation, Micron Technology,
    Inc., Smart Modular Technologies, Inc., STEC, Inc., and Samsung
    Electronics Co. Ltd.

For an additional discussion of risks related to competition,
    see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Service
    and Warranty

We generally warrant our newly manufactured products against
    defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from
    the date of manufacture depending on the type of product. Our
    warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or
    replacement. We have engaged third parties in various countries
    in multiple regions, including Africa, Asia Pacific, Australia,
    Europe, India, Latin America, the Middle East and North America
    to provide various levels of testing, processing

and/or

recertification of returned products for our customers. In
    addition, we receive and service returned hard drives at our
    U.S. facility.

Manufacturing

We believe that we have significant know-how, unique product
    manufacturing processes, execution skills and human resources to
    continue to be successful and have the ability to grow, as
    necessary, our manufacturing operations. To be competitive, we
    must manufacture high quality hard drives with industry leading

time-to-volume

production at competitive unit costs. We strive to maintain
    manufacturing flexibility, high manufacturing yields, reliable
    products, and high-quality components that we manufacture
    ourselves, while insisting that our suppliers provide
    high-quality components at competitive prices. The critical
    elements of our hard drive production are high volume, low cost
    assembly and testing, and establishment and maintenance of key
    supplier relationships. By establishing close relationships with
    our strategic component suppliers, we believe we access

best-of-class

technology and manufacturing quality. In addition, we believe
    that our sourcing strategy currently enables us to have the
    business flexibility needed to select the highest quality, low
    cost of ownership suppliers as product designs and technologies
    evolve.

Hard drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the
    assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and
    thorough testing. The assembly process occurs in a “clean
    room” environment that demands skill in process engineering
    and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs
    of this manufacturing environment. Our clean room manufacturing
    process consists of modular production units, each of which
    contains a number of work cells.

We manufacture hard drives in Malaysia and Thailand. We
    continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to
    increase productivity, sustain and improve quality and decrease
    manufacturing costs. We continually evaluate which steps in the
    manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how
    automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and
    reduce manufacturing costs.

We use our wafer fabrication facilities in Fremont, California
    and our slider fabrication facility in Bang Pa-In, Thailand, to
    design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and
    head gimbal assemblies (“HGAs”) we include in the hard
    drives we manufacture. We have deferred the completion of
    converting our head wafer fabrication facilities in Fremont,
    California to utilize

8-inch

wafers from

6-inch

wafers as a result of macroeconomic conditions.

We also have magnetic media and substrate design and
    manufacturing facilities in Malaysia. We use these facilities to
    design and manufacture most of the magnetic media and substrates
    that we use in our products.

We leverage the efficiencies of contract manufacturers when
    strategically advantageous.

For an additional discussion of risks related to manufacturing,
    see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

    connectors and cables.

We design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads,
    magnetic media and substrates required for the hard drives we
    manufacture. We purchase a portion of these components from
    third party suppliers. We acquire all of the remaining
    components for our products from third party suppliers.

The major components used in the manufacture of our solid-state
    drives, the semiconductor media and

system-on-chip,

and in our media player, the controller, are acquired from third
    party suppliers.

We generally retain multiple suppliers for each of our component
    requirements but in some instances use sole sources for business
    reasons.

For an additional discussion of risks related to our component
    supplies, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Backlog

A substantial portion of our orders are generally for shipments
    within 30 to 60 days of the placement of the order. We
    generally negotiate pricing, order lead times, product support
    requirements and other terms and conditions before receiving a
    customer’s first purchase order for a product.
    Customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with
    relatively short notice to us, with little or no cost to the
    customer, or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a
    later date. In addition, we make many of our sales to OEMs under

just-in-time

delivery contracts that do not generally require firm order
    commitments by the customer until the time of sale. Instead, we
    receive a periodic forecast of requirements from the customer
    and invoice the customer upon shipment of the product from the

just-in-time

warehouse. Therefore, backlog information as of the end of a
    particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels
    of our revenue and profit and may not be comparable to earlier
    periods.

Patents,
    Licenses and Proprietary Information

We own numerous patents and have many patent applications in
    process. We believe that, although our patents and patent
    applications have considerable value, the successful
    manufacturing and marketing of our products depends primarily
    upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff.
    Accordingly, the patents held and applied for do not ensure our
    future success.

In addition to patent protection of certain intellectual
    property rights, we consider elements of our product designs and
    processes to be proprietary and confidential. We believe that
    our non-patented intellectual property, particularly some of our
    process technology, is an important factor in our success. We
    rely upon non-disclosure agreements and contractual provisions
    and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary
    information. Despite these safeguards, there is a risk that
    competitors may obtain and use such information. The laws of
    foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide
    less protection for confidential information than the U.S.

We rely on certain technology that we license from other parties
    to manufacture and sell WD products. We believe that we have
    adequate cross-licenses and other agreements in place in
    addition to our own intellectual property portfolio



to compete successfully in the hard drive industry. For
    additional discussion of risks related to our ownership and use
    of intellectual property, see Item 1A of this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

Environmental
    Regulation

We are subject to a variety of regulations in connection with
    our operations. We believe that we have obtained or are in the
    process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our
    operations. For additional discussion of risks related to
    environmental regulation, see Item 1A of this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

Employees

As of July 3, 2009, we employed a total of
    45,991 employees worldwide. This represents a decrease in
    headcount of approximately 8% since June 27, 2008 and an
    increase of approximately 56% since June 29, 2007. Many of
    our employees are highly skilled, and our continued success
    depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such
    employees. Accordingly, we offer employee benefit programs,
    which we believe are, in the aggregate, competitive with those
    offered by our competitors. We and most of our competitors
    nevertheless have difficulty at times hiring and retaining
    certain skilled employees. We have engaged consultants and
    contract personnel to fill these needs until full-time employees
    could be recruited. We consider our employee relations to be
    good. For additional discussion of risks related to our skilled
    employees, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Negative
    worldwide economic conditions could continue to result in a
    decrease in our sales and revenue and an increase in our
    operating costs, which could continue to adversely affect our
    business and operating results.

If the current worldwide economic downturn continues, many of
    our direct and indirect customers may delay or reduce their
    purchases of our products and systems containing our products.
    In addition, many of our customers in each of the OEM,
    distribution and retail channels rely on credit financing in
    order to purchase our products. If the negative conditions in
    the global credit markets prevent our customers’ access to
    credit, product orders in these channels may decrease, which
    could result in lower revenue. Likewise, if our suppliers face
    challenges in obtaining credit, in selling their products or
    otherwise in operating their businesses, they may become unable
    to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products. These
    actions could result in reductions in our revenue, increased
    price competition and increased operating costs, which could
    adversely affect our business, results of operations and
    financial condition.

Negative
    worldwide economic conditions could prevent us from accurately
    forecasting demand for our products, which could adversely
    affect our operating results or market share.

The current negative worldwide economic conditions and market
    instability make it increasingly difficult for us, our customers
    and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand
    trends, which could cause us to produce excess products that can
    depress product prices, increase our inventory carrying costs
    and result in obsolete inventory. Alternatively, this
    forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of products, or
    materials used in our products, that could result in an
    inability to satisfy demand for our products and a loss of
    market share. For a further discussion of these risks, please
    see the risk factor below entitled “

Our failure to
    accurately forecast market and customer demand for our products
    could adversely affect our business and financial results or
    operating efficiencies.”

Negative
    global economic conditions increase the risk that we could
    suffer unrecoverable losses on our customers’ accounts
    receivable, which would adversely affect our financial
    results.

We extend credit and payment terms to some of our customers. In
    addition to ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’
    financial condition, we traditionally seek to mitigate our
    credit risk by purchasing credit insurance on certain of our
    accounts receivable balances; however, as a result of the
    current negative worldwide economic conditions, we may find it
    increasingly difficult to be able to insure these accounts
    receivable. We could suffer significant losses if a customer
    whose accounts receivable we have not insured, or have
    underinsured, fails and is unable to pay us. Additionally, if
    global economic conditions worsen, the risk increases that if a
    customer whose accounts receivable we have insured fails, the
    financial condition of the insurance carrier for such customer
    account may have also deteriorated such that it cannot cover our
    loss. A significant loss of an accounts receivable that we
    cannot recover through credit insurance would have a negative
    impact on our financial results.



If the
    worldwide economic downturn worsens, we may have to take
    additional steps to align our cost structure with demand, which
    could result in increased impairment charges and have a negative
    impact on our operating results.

As we previously announced, we committed to a business
    restructuring plan intended to realign our cost structure with a
    softer demand environment. If the worldwide economic downturn
    worsens and demand were to soften further, we may be forced to
    execute additional restructuring activities to realign our cost
    structure with softening demand. Additional restructuring
    activities could result in impairment charges and other expenses
    in excess of what we anticipated when we previously announced
    our restructuring plan, either of which could adversely impact
    our results of operations or financial condition.

If our
    long-lived assets or goodwill become impaired, it may adversely
    affect our operating results.

If the current worldwide economic downturn continues, it could
    result in circumstances, such as a sustained decline in our
    stock price and market capitalization or a decrease in our
    forecasted cash flows such that they are insufficient,
    indicating that the carrying value of our long-lived assets or
    goodwill may be impaired. If we are required to record a
    significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial
    statements because an impairment of our long-lived assets or
    goodwill is determined, our results of operations will be
    adversely affected.

Declines
    in average selling prices (“ASPs”) in the hard drive
    industry could adversely affect our operating results.

Historically, the hard drive industry has experienced declining
    ASPs. Our ASPs tend to decline when competitors lower prices as
    a result of decreased costs or to absorb excess capacity,
    liquidate excess inventories, restructure or attempt to gain
    market share. Our ASPs also decline when there is a shift in the
    mix of product sales, and sales of lower priced products
    increase relative to those of higher priced products. When ASPs
    in the hard drive industry decline, our ASPs are also likely to
    decline, which adversely affects our operating results.

If we
    fail to anticipate or timely respond to changes in the markets
    for hard drives, our operating results could be adversely
    affected.

During past economic downturns, as well as over the past few
    years, the consumer market for computers has shifted
    significantly towards lower priced systems, and we therefore
    expect this trend to continue in light of the current negative
    worldwide macroeconomic conditions. If we are not able to
    continue to offer a competitively priced hard drive for the
    low-cost PC market, our share of that market will likely fall,
    which could harm our operating results. The market for hard
    drives is also fragmenting into a variety of devices and
    products. Many industry analysts expect, as do we, that as
    content increasingly converts to digital technology from the
    older analog technology, the technology of computers and
    consumer electronics will continue to converge, and hard drives
    may be found in many products other than computers, such as
    various CE devices. Accurately forecasting for future
    requirements of these new markets remains challenging.

Moreover, some devices such as personal video recorders and
    digital video recorders, or some new PC operating systems which
    allow greater consumer choice in levels of functionality and
    therefore greater market differentiation, may require attributes
    not currently offered in our products, resulting in a need to
    develop new interfaces, form factors, technical specifications
    or product features, increasing our overall operational expense
    without corresponding incremental revenue at this stage. If we
    are not successful in continuing to deploy our hard drive
    technology and expertise to develop new products for emerging
    markets such as the CE market, or if we are required to incur
    significant costs in developing such products, it may harm our
    operating results.

Our
    prices and margins are subject to declines due to unpredictable
    end-user demand and oversupply of hard drives.

Demand for our hard drives depends on the demand for systems
    manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to
    existing systems. The demand for systems has been volatile in
    the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand
    for hard drives in any given period. As a result, the hard drive
    market has experienced periods of excess capacity which can lead
    to liquidation of excess inventories and intense price
    competition. If intense price competition occurs, we may be
    forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected, which
    could result in lower revenue and gross margins.



Our
    failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for
    our products could adversely affect our business and financial
    results or operating efficiencies.

The data storage industry faces difficulties in accurately
    forecasting market and customer demand for its products. The
    variety and volume of products we manufacture is based in part
    on these forecasts. If our forecasts exceed actual market
    demand, or if market demand decreases significantly from our
    forecasts, then we could experience periods of product
    oversupply and price decreases, which could impact our financial
    performance. If our forecasts do not meet actual market demand,
    or if market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts
    or beyond our ability to add manufacturing capacity, then we may
    not be able to satisfy customer product needs, which could
    result in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to
    meet customer demands.

Although we receive forecasts from our customers, they are not
    generally obligated to purchase the forecasted amounts. Sales
    volumes in the distribution and retail channels are volatile and
    harder to predict than sales to our OEM or ODM customers. We
    consider these forecasts in determining our component needs and
    our inventory requirements. If we fail to accurately forecast
    our customers’ product demands, we may have inadequate or
    excess inventory of our products or components, which could
    adversely affect our operating results.

In order to efficiently and timely meet the demands of many of
    our OEM customers, we position our products in multiple
    strategic locations based on the amounts forecasted by such
    customers. If an OEM customer’s actual product demands
    decrease significantly from its forecast, then we may incur
    additional costs in relocating the products that have not been
    purchased by the OEM. This could result in a delay in our
    product sales and an increase in our operating costs, which may
    negatively impact our operating results.

Increases
    in areal density may outpace customers’ demand for storage
    capacity, which may lower the prices our customers are willing
    to pay for new products or put us at a disadvantage to competing
    technologies.

Historically, the industry has experienced periods of variable
    areal density growth rates. When the rate of areal density
    growth increases, the rate of increase may exceed the increase
    in our customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity.
    Furthermore, our customers’ demand for storage capacity may
    not continue to grow at current industry estimates as a result
    of developments in the regulation and enforcement of digital
    rights management, the emergence of processes such as cloud
    computing, data deduplication and storage virtualization, or
    otherwise. These factors could lead to our customers’
    storage capacity needs being satisfied at lower prices with
    lower capacity hard drives or solid-state storage products that
    we do not offer, thereby decreasing our revenue or putting us at
    a disadvantage to competing storage technologies. As a result,
    even with increasing aggregate demand for storage capacity, our
    ASPs could decline, which could adversely affect our operating
    results.

Our entry
    into additional storage markets increases the complexity of our
    business, and if we are unable to successfully adapt our
    business processes as required by these new markets, we will be
    at a competitive disadvantage and our ability to grow will be
    adversely affected.

As we expand our product line to sell into additional storage
    markets, the overall complexity of our business increases at an
    accelerated rate and we must make necessary adaptations to our
    business model to address these complexities. For example, as we
    have previously disclosed, we have been investing in technology
    to develop and support a product line to sell to mainstream
    enterprise market customers. In addition to requiring
    significant capital expenditures, our entry into the mainstream
    enterprise market adds complexity to our business that requires
    us to effectively adapt our business and management processes to
    address the unique challenges and different requirements of the
    mainstream enterprise market, while maintaining a competitive
    operating cost model. If we fail or are delayed in our attempts
    to enter into the mainstream enterprise storage market, we will
    remain at a competitive disadvantage to the companies that serve
    this market and our ability to continue our growth will be
    negatively affected.

Expansion
    into new hard drive markets may cause our capital expenditures
    to increase, and if we do not successfully expand into new
    markets, our business may suffer.

To remain a significant supplier of hard drives, we will need to
    offer a broad range of hard drive products to our customers. We
    currently offer a variety of 3.5-inch or 2.5-inch hard drives
    for the desktop, mobile, enterprise, CE and external storage
    markets. However, demand for hard drives may shift to products
    in form factors or with interfaces that



our competitors offer but which we do not. Expansion into other
    hard drive markets and resulting increases in manufacturing
    capacity requirements may require us to make substantial
    additional investments in part because our operations are
    largely vertically integrated now that we manufacture heads and
    magnetic media for use in many of the hard drives we
    manufacture. If we fail to successfully expand into new hard
    drive markets with products that we do not currently offer, we
    may lose business to our competitors who offer these products.

If we
    fail to successfully manage our new product development or new
    market expansion, or if we fail to anticipate the issues
    associated with such development or expansion, our business may
    suffer.

While we continue to develop new products and look to expand
    into new markets, the success of our new product introductions
    depends on a number of factors, including our ability to
    anticipate and manage a variety of issues associated with these
    new products and new markets, such as:

•

difficulties faced in manufacturing ramp;

•

market acceptance;

•

effective management of inventory levels in line with
    anticipated product demand; and

•

quality problems or other defects in the early stages of new
    product introduction that were not anticipated in the design of
    those products.

Further, we need to identify how any of the new markets into
    which we are expanding may have different characteristics from
    the markets in which we currently exist and properly address
    these differences. These characteristics may include:

•

demand volume requirements;

•

demand seasonality;

•

product generation development rates;

•

customer concentrations;

•

warranty expectations and product return policies; and

•

cost, performance and compatibility requirements.

Our business may suffer if we fail to successfully anticipate
    and manage these issues associated with our product development
    and market expansion. For example, our branded products are
    designed to attach to and interoperate with a wide variety of PC
    and CE devices, and therefore their functionality relies on the
    manufacturer of such devices, or the associated operating
    systems, enabling the manufacturer’s devices to operate
    with our branded products. If our branded products are not
    compatible with a wide variety of devices, or if device
    manufacturers design their devices so that our branded products
    cannot operate with them, and we cannot quickly and efficiently
    adapt our branded products to address these compatibility
    issues, our business could suffer.

Expanding
    into new markets exposes our business to different seasonal
    demand cycles, which in turn could adversely affect our
    operating results.

The CE and retail markets have different seasonal pricing and
    volume demand cycles as compared to the PC market. By expanding
    into these markets, we became exposed to seasonal fluctuations
    that are different from, and in addition to, those of the PC
    market. For example, because the primary customer for our
    branded products are individual consumers, this market has
    historically experienced a dramatic increase in demand during
    the winter holiday season. If we do not properly adjust our
    supply to these new demand cycles, we risk having excess
    inventory during periods of low demand and insufficient
    inventory during periods of high demand, which could adversely
    affect our operating results.



Selling
    to the retail market is an important part of our business, and
    if consumer spending continues to decrease, or if we fail to
    maintain and grow our market share or gain market acceptance of
    our branded products, our operating results could
    suffer.

Selling branded products is an important part of our business,
    and as our branded products revenue increases as a portion of
    our overall revenue, our success in the retail market becomes
    increasingly important to our operating results. If consumer
    spending continues to decrease as a result of the current
    worldwide economic downturn, our operating results could suffer
    because of the increased importance of our branded products
    business.

We sell our branded products directly to a select group of major
    retailers, such as computer superstores and CE stores, and
    authorize sales through distributors to other retailers and
    online resellers. Our current retail customer base is primarily
    in the U.S., Canada and Europe. We are facing increased
    competition from other companies for shelf space at a small
    number of major retailers that have strong buying power and
    pricing leverage. If we are unable to maintain effective working
    relationships with major retailers and online resellers, our
    competitive position in the branded product market may suffer
    and our operating results may be adversely affected. In
    addition, if customers no longer maintain a preference for
    WD

®

brand

    products or if we fail to successfully expand into multiple
    channels, our operating results may be adversely affected.

Additionally, we face strong competition in maintaining and
    trying to grow our market share in the retail market,
    particularly because of the relatively low barriers to entry in
    this market. For example, several additional hard drive
    manufacturers have recently disclosed plans to expand into the
    external storage market, and as these companies attempt to gain
    market share, we may have difficulty in maintaining or growing
    our market share and there may be increased downward pressure on
    pricing. We will continue to introduce new products in the
    retail market that incorporate our disk drives; however, there
    can be no assurance that these products will gain market
    acceptance, and if they do not, our operating results could
    suffer.

Loss of
    market share with or by a key customer, or consolidation among
    our customer base, could harm our operating results.

During the year ended July 3, 2009, a large percentage of
    our revenue, 48%, came from sales to our top 10 customers. These
    customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and
    therefore can make substantial demands on us, including demands
    on product pricing and on contractual terms, which often results
    in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier. Even if we
    successfully qualify a product with a customer, the customer is
    not generally obligated to purchase any minimum volume of
    products from us and may be able to cancel an order or terminate
    its relationship with us at any time. Our ability to maintain
    strong relationships with our principal customers is essential
    to our future performance. If we lose a key customer, if any of
    our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require
    us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs, if a
    customer is acquired by one of our competitors or if a key
    customer suffers financial hardship, our operating results would
    likely be harmed.

Additionally, if there is consolidation among our customer base,
    our customers may be able to command increased leverage in
    negotiating prices and other terms of sale, which could
    adversely affect our profitability. In addition, if, as a result
    of increased leverage, customer pressures require us to reduce
    our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished, we could
    decide not to sell our products to a particular customer, which
    could result in a decrease in our revenue. Consolidation among
    our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our
    products, replacement of our products by the combined entity
    with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders, each
    of which could harm our operating results.

Current
    or future competitors may gain a technology advantage or develop
    an advantageous cost structure that we cannot match.

It may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain
    an advantage in product technology, manufacturing technology, or
    process technology, which may allow them to offer products or
    services that have a significant advantage over the products and
    services that we offer. Advantages could be in capacity,
    performance, reliability, serviceability, or other attributes.
    We may be at a competitive disadvantage to any companies that
    are able to gain these advantages.



Further
    industry consolidation could provide competitive advantages to
    our competitors.

The hard drive industry has experienced consolidation over the
    past several years. Consolidation by our competitors may enhance
    their capacity, abilities and resources and lower their cost
    structure, causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage.
    Additionally, continued industry consolidation may lead to
    uncertainty in areas such as component availability, which could
    negatively impact our cost structure.

Sales in
    the distribution channel are important to our business, and if
    we fail to maintain brand preference with our distributors or if
    distribution markets for hard drives weaken, our operating
    results could suffer.

Our distribution customers typically sell to small computer
    manufacturers, dealers, systems integrators and other resellers.
    We face significant competition in this channel as a result of
    limited product qualification programs and a significant focus
    on price and availability of product. If we fail to remain
    competitive in terms of our technology, quality, service and
    support, our distribution customers may favor our competitors,
    and our operating results could suffer. We also face significant
    risk in the distribution market for hard drives. If the
    distribution market weakens as a result of a slowing PC growth
    rate, technology transitions or a significant change in consumer
    buying preference from white box to branded PCs, or if we
    experience significant price declines due to oversupply in the
    distribution channel, then our operating results would be
    adversely affected.

The hard
    drive industry is highly competitive and can be characterized by
    significant shifts in market share among the major
    competitors.

The price of hard drives has fallen over time due to increases
    in supply, cost reductions, technological advances and price
    reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess
    inventories or attempting to gain market share. In addition,
    rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and
    profitability of sales of existing products and increase the
    risk of inventory obsolescence. These factors, taken together,
    may result in significant shifts in market share among the
    industry’s major participants. In addition, product recalls
    can lead to a loss of market share, which could adversely affect
    our operating results.

Some of
    our competitors with diversified business units outside the hard
    drive industry may over extended periods of time sell hard
    drives at prices that we cannot profitably match.

Some of our competitors earn a significant portion of their
    revenue from business units outside the hard drive industry.
    Because they do not depend solely on sales of hard drives to
    achieve profitability, they may sell hard drives at lower prices
    and operate their hard drive business unit at a loss over an
    extended period of time while still remaining profitable
    overall. In addition, if these competitors can increase sales of
    non-hard drive products to the same customers, they may benefit
    from selling their hard drives at lower prices. Our operating
    results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully
    compete with the pricing by these companies.

If we
    fail to qualify our products with our customers or if product
    life cycles lengthen, it may have a significant adverse impact
    on our sales and margins.

We regularly engage in new product qualification with our
    customers. Once a product is accepted for qualification testing,
    failures or delays in the qualification process can result in
    delayed or reduced product sales, reduced product margins caused
    by having to continue to offer a more costly current generation
    product, or lost sales to that customer until the next
    generation of products is introduced. The effect of missing a
    product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited
    number of high volume OEMs, which continue to consolidate their
    share of the storage markets. Likewise, if product life cycles
    lengthen, we may have a significantly longer period to wait
    before we have an opportunity to qualify a new product with a
    customer, which could reduce our profits because we expect
    declining gross margins on our current generation products as a
    result of competitive pressures.

We are
    subject to risks related to product defects, which could result
    in product recalls and could subject us to warranty claims in
    excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than
    anticipated due to the unenforceability of liability
    limitations.

We warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to
    five years. We test our hard drives in our manufacturing
    facilities through a variety of means. However, there can be no
    assurance that our testing will reveal latent



defects in our products, which may not become apparent until
    after the products have been sold into the market. Accordingly,
    there is a risk that product defects will occur, which could
    require a product recall. Product recalls can be expensive to
    implement and, if a product recall occurs during the
    product’s warranty period, we may be required to replace
    the defective product. In addition, a product recall may damage
    our relationship with our customers, and we may lose market
    share with our customers, including our OEM and ODM customers.

Our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions
    of liability for consequential damages and for misuse, improper
    installation, alteration, accident or mishandling while in the
    possession of someone other than us. We record an accrual for
    estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. We
    may incur additional operating expenses if our warranty
    provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues
    related to defects in our products. If these additional expenses
    are significant, it could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and operating results.

A
    competitive cost structure is critical to our operating results,
    and increased costs may adversely affect our operating
    margin.

A competitive cost structure for our products, including
    critical components, labor and overhead, is critical to the
    success of our business, and our operating results depend on our
    ability to maintain competitive cost structures on new and
    established products. If our competitors are able to achieve a
    lower cost structure that we are unable to match, we could be at
    a competitive disadvantage to those competitors.

Shortages
    of commodity materials, price volatility, or use by other
    industries of materials used in the hard drive industry, may
    increase our cost structure.

Increases in the cost for certain commodity materials may
    increase our costs of manufacturing and transporting hard drives
    and key components. Shortages of materials such as stainless
    steel, aluminum, nickel, neodymium, ruthenium or platinum
    increase our costs and may result in lower operating margins if
    we are unable to find ways to mitigate these increased costs.
    For example, perpendicular recording technology requires
    increased usage of precious metals such as ruthenium and
    platinum, the price of which may continue to be volatile, which
    could adversely affect our operating margins. Furthermore, if
    other high volume industries increase their demand for materials
    such as these, our costs may further increase, which could have
    an adverse effect on our operating margins. The volatility in
    the cost of oil also affects our transportation costs and may
    result in lower operating margins if we are unable to pass these
    increased costs through to our customers.

If we
    fail to maintain effective relationships with our major
    component suppliers, our supply of critical components may be at
    risk and our profitability could suffer.

We make most of our own heads and magnetic media for some of our
    product families; however, we do not manufacture many of the
    component parts used in our hard drives. As a result, the
    success of our products depends on our ability to gain access to
    and integrate parts from reliable component suppliers. To do so,
    we must effectively manage our relationships with our major
    component suppliers. We must also effectively integrate
    different products from a variety of suppliers, each of which
    employs variations on technology, which can impact, for example,
    feasible combinations of heads and magnetic media components.
    For example, in August 2003, we settled litigation with a
    supplier who previously was the sole source of read channel
    devices for our hard drives. As a result of the disputes that
    gave rise to the litigation, our profitability was at risk until
    another supplier’s read channel devices could be designed
    into our products. Similar disputes with other strategic
    component suppliers could adversely affect our operating results.

Violation
    of labor or environmental laws and practices by our suppliers or

sub-suppliers

could harm our business.

We expect our suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable
    laws and regulations, including labor and environmental laws,
    and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of
    conduct. While our internal operating guidelines promote ethical
    business practices, we do not control our suppliers or

sub-suppliers

or their labor or environmental practices. The violation of
    labor, environmental or other laws by any of our suppliers or

sub-suppliers,

or divergence of a supplier’s or

sub-supplier’s

labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted
    as ethical in the U.S., could harm our business by:

•

interrupting or otherwise disrupting the shipment of our product
    components;



•

damaging our reputation;

•

forcing us to find alternate component sources;

•

reducing demand for our products (for example, through a
    consumer boycott); or

•

exposing us to potential liability for our supplier’s or

sub-supplier’s

wrongdoings.

Dependence
    on a limited number of qualified suppliers of components and
    manufacturing equipment could lead to delays, lost revenue or
    increased costs.

Certain components are available from a limited number of
    suppliers, and we are sole sourced with some of these suppliers
    on certain products. Because we depend on a limited number of
    suppliers for certain product components and manufacturing
    equipment, each of the following could significantly harm our
    operating results:

•

an unwillingness of a supplier to supply such components or
    equipment to us;

•

an increase in the cost of such components or equipment;

•

an extended shortage of required components or equipment;

•

consolidation of key suppliers, such as the acquisition of
    Brilliant Manufacturing Limited by Nidec Corporation, the
    acquisition of Agere Systems Inc. by LSI Corporation, the
    acquisition of Infineon Technologies’ hard drive
    semiconductor business by LSI Corporation, the acquisition of
    Alps Electric Co. Ltd.’s magnetic device division’s
    assets and related intellectual property by TDK Corp, and the
    acquisition of Magnecomp Precision Technology Public Company
    Limited by TDK Corp;

•

failure of a key supplier’s business process;

•

a key supplier’s or

sub-supplier’s

inability to access credit necessary to operate its
    business; or

•

failure of a key supplier to remain in business, to remain an
    independent merchant supplier, to adjust to market conditions,
    or to meet our quality, yield or production requirements.

If
    components and equipment that we use are available from only a
    limited number of suppliers or are in short supply, it may
    negatively impact our production and cause us to lose
    revenue.

Our future operating results may also depend substantially on
    our suppliers’ ability to timely qualify their components
    in our programs, and their ability to supply us with these
    components in sufficient volumes to meet our production
    requirements. A number of the components that we use are
    available from only a single or limited number of qualified
    suppliers, and may be used across multiple product lines. In
    addition, some of the components (or component types) used in
    our products are used in other devices, such as mobile
    telephones and digital cameras. If there is a significant
    simultaneous upswing in demand for such a component (or
    component type) from several high volume industries resulting in
    a supply reduction, if a component is otherwise in short supply,
    or if a supplier fails to qualify or has a quality issue with a
    component, we may experience delays or increased costs in
    obtaining that component. If we are unable to obtain sufficient
    quantities of materials used in the manufacture of magnetic
    components, or other necessary components, we may experience
    production delays which could cause us loss of revenue. If a
    component becomes unavailable, we could suffer significant loss
    of revenue.

In addition, certain equipment we use in our manufacturing or
    testing processes is available only from a limited number of
    suppliers. Some of this equipment uses materials that at times
    could be in short supply. If these materials are not available,
    or are not available in the quantities we require for our
    manufacturing and testing processes, our ability to manufacture
    our products could be impacted, and we could suffer significant
    loss of revenue.

Contractual
    commitments with component suppliers may result in us paying
    increased charges and cash advances for such components or may
    cause us to have inadequate or excess component
    inventory.

To reduce the risk of component shortages, we attempt to provide
    significant lead times when buying components which may subject
    us to cancellation charges if we cancel orders as a result of
    technology transitions or changes in our component needs. In
    addition, we may from time to time enter into contractual
    commitments with component suppliers



in an effort to increase and stabilize the supply of those
    components and enable us to purchase such components at
    favorable prices. Some of these commitments may require us to
    buy a substantial number of components from the supplier or make
    significant cash advances to the supplier; however, these
    commitments may not result in a satisfactory increase or
    stabilization of the supply of such components. Furthermore, as
    a result of the current negative worldwide economic conditions,
    our ability to forecast our requirements for these components
    has become increasingly difficult, therefore increasing the risk
    that our contractual commitments may not meet our actual supply
    requirements, which could cause us to have inadequate or excess
    component inventory and adversely affect our operating results
    and increase our operating costs.

Failure
    by certain suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and
    manufacture components, technology or production equipment for
    our products may adversely affect our operations.

We rely on suppliers for various component parts that we
    integrate into our hard drives but do not manufacture ourselves,
    such as semiconductors, motors, flex circuits and suspensions.
    Likewise, we rely on suppliers for certain technology and
    equipment necessary for advanced development technology for
    future products. Some of these components, and most of this
    technology and production equipment, must be specifically
    designed to be compatible for use in our products or for
    developing and manufacturing our future products, and are only
    available from a limited number of suppliers, some of with whom
    we are sole sourced. We are therefore dependent on these
    suppliers to be able and willing to dedicate adequate
    engineering resources to develop components that can be
    successfully integrated with our products, and technology and
    production equipment that can be used to develop and manufacture
    our next-generation products efficiently. The failure of these
    suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture
    components that can be integrated into our products or
    technology and production equipment that can be used to develop
    or manufacture next generation products may cause us to
    experience inability or delay in our manufacturing and shipment
    of hard drive products, our expansion into new technology and
    markets, or our ability to remain competitive with alternative
    storage technologies, therefore adversely affecting our business
    and financial results.

There are
    certain additional capital expenditure costs and asset
    utilization risks to our business associated with our strategy
    to vertically integrate our operations.

Our vertical integration of head and magnetic media
    manufacturing resulted in a fundamental change in our operating
    structure, as we now manufacture heads and magnetic media for
    use in many of the hard drives we manufacture. Consequently, we
    make more capital investments and carry a higher percentage of
    fixed costs than we would if we were not vertically integrated.
    If the overall level of production decreases for any reason, and
    we are unable to reduce our fixed costs to match sales, our head
    or magnetic media manufacturing assets may face
    under-utilization that may impact our operating results. We are
    therefore subject to additional risks related to overall asset
    utilization, including the need to operate at high levels of
    utilization to drive competitive costs and the need for assured
    supply of components that we do not manufacture ourselves.

In addition, we may incur additional risks, including:

•

failure to continue to leverage the integration of our magnetic
    media technology with our head technology;

•

insufficient third party sources to satisfy our needs if we are
    unable to manufacture a sufficient supply of heads or magnetic
    media;

•

third party head or magnetic media suppliers may not continue to
    do business with us or may not do business with us on the same
    terms and conditions we have previously enjoyed;

•

claims that our manufacturing of heads or magnetic media may
    infringe certain intellectual property rights of other
    companies; and

•

difficulties locating in a timely manner suitable manufacturing
    equipment for our head or magnetic media manufacturing processes
    and replacement parts for such equipment.

If we do not adequately address the challenges related to our
    head or magnetic media manufacturing operations, our ongoing
    operations could be disrupted, resulting in a decrease in our
    revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating
    results.



If we are
    unable to timely and cost-effectively develop heads and magnetic
    media with leading technology and overall quality, our ability
    to sell our products may be significantly diminished, which
    could materially and adversely affect our business and financial
    results.

Under our business plan, we are developing and manufacturing a
    substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media used in some
    of the hard drive products we manufacture. Consequently, we are
    more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts
    and less able to take advantage of head and magnetic media
    technologies developed by other manufacturers. Technology
    transition for head and magnetic media designs is critical to
    increasing our volume production of heads and magnetic media.
    There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful
    in timely and cost-effectively developing and manufacturing
    heads or magnetic media for products using future technologies.
    We also may not effectively transition our head or magnetic
    media design and technology to achieve acceptable manufacturing
    yields using the technologies necessary to satisfy our
    customers’ product needs, or we may encounter quality
    problems with the heads or magnetic media we manufacture. In
    addition, we may not have access to external sources of supply
    without incurring substantial costs which would negatively
    impact our business and financial results.

Changes
    in product life cycles could adversely affect our financial
    results.

If product life cycles lengthen, we may need to develop new
    technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any particular
    product to maintain competitive pricing for that product. If
    product life cycles shorten, it may result in an increase in our
    overall expenses and a decrease in our gross margins, both of
    which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition,
    shortening of product life cycles also makes it more difficult
    to recover the cost of product development before the product
    becomes obsolete. Our failure to recover the cost of product
    development in the future could adversely affect our operating
    results.

If we
    fail to make the technical innovations necessary to continue to
    increase areal density, we may fail to remain
    competitive.

New products in the hard drive market typically require higher
    areal densities than previous product generations, posing
    formidable technical and manufacturing challenges. Higher areal
    densities require existing head and magnetic media technology to
    be improved or new technology developed to accommodate more data
    on a single disk. In addition, our introduction of new products
    during a technology transition increases the likelihood of
    unexpected quality concerns. Our failure to bring high quality
    new products to market on time and at acceptable costs may put
    us at a competitive disadvantage to companies that achieve these
    results.

A
    fundamental change in recording technology could result in
    significant increases in our operating expenses and could put us
    at a competitive disadvantage.

Historically, when the industry experiences a fundamental change
    in technology, any manufacturer that fails to successfully and
    timely adjust its designs and processes to accommodate the new
    technology fails to remain competitive. There are some
    technologies, such as current-perpendicular-to-plane
    (“CPP”), energy assisted magnetic recording, patterned
    magnetic media and other similar potentially breakthrough
    technology, that will represent revolutionary recording
    technologies if they can be implemented by a competitor on a
    commercially viable basis ahead of the industry, which could put
    us at a competitive disadvantage. As a result of these
    technology shifts, we could incur substantial costs in
    developing new technologies, such as heads, magnetic media, and
    tools to remain competitive. If we fail to successfully
    implement these new technologies, or if we are significantly
    slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies, we
    may not be able to offer products with capacities that our
    customers desire. For example, new recording technology requires
    changes in the manufacturing process of heads and magnetic
    media, which may cause longer production times and reduce the
    overall availability of magnetic media in the industry.
    Additionally, the new technology requires a greater degree of
    integration between heads and magnetic media which may lengthen
    our time of development of hard drives using this technology.

Furthermore, as we attempt to develop and implement new
    technologies, we may become more dependent on suppliers to
    ensure our access to components, technology and production
    equipment that accommodate the new technology. For example,
    advanced wafer and magnetic media manufacturing technologies
    have historically been developed for use in the semiconductor
    industry prior to the hard drive industry. However, successful
    implementation of the use of patterned magnetic media with hard
    drive magnetic media currently presents a significant technical
    challenge



facing the hard drive industry but not the semiconductor
    industry. Therefore, our suppliers may not be willing to
    dedicate adequate engineering resources to develop manufacturing
    equipment for patterned magnetic media prior to a need for the
    equipment in the semiconductor industry. We believe that if
    patterned magnetic media technology is not successfully
    implemented in the hard drive industry, then alternative storage
    technologies like solid-state storage may more rapidly overtake
    hard drives as the preferred storage solution for higher
    capacity storage needs. This result would put us at a
    competitive disadvantage and negatively impact our operating
    results.

The
    difficulty of introducing hard drives with higher levels of
    areal density and the challenges of reducing other costs may
    impact our ability to achieve historical levels of cost
    reduction.

Storage capacity of the hard drive, as manufactured by us, is
    determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal
    density. Areal density is a measure of the amount of magnetic
    bits that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk.
    Generally, the higher the areal density, the more information
    can be stored on a single platter. Historically, we have been
    able to achieve a large percentage of cost reduction through
    increases in areal density. Increases in areal density mean that
    the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same
    capacity and, therefore, may result in a lower component cost.
    However, because increasing areal density has become more
    difficult in the hard drive industry, such increases may require
    increases in component costs, and other opportunities to reduce
    costs may not continue at historical rates. Additionally,
    increases in areal density may require us to make further
    capital expenditures on items such as new testing equipment
    needed as a result of an increased number of GB per platter. Our
    inability to achieve cost reductions could adversely affect our
    operating results.

If we do
    not properly manage the technology transitions of our products,
    our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively
    affected.

The storage markets in which we offer our products continuously
    undergo technology transitions which we must anticipate and
    adapt our products to address in a timely manner. For example,
    serial interfaces normally go through cycles in which their
    maximum speeds double. We must effectively manage the transition
    of the features of our products to address these faster
    interface speeds in a timely manner in order to remain
    competitive and cost effective. If we fail to successfully and
    timely manage the transition to faster interface speeds, we may
    be at a competitive disadvantage to other companies that have
    successfully adapted their products in a timely manner and our
    operating results may suffer.

If we
    fail to develop and introduce new hard drives that are
    competitive against alternative storage technologies, our
    business may suffer.

Our success depends in part on our ability to develop and
    introduce new products in a timely manner in order to keep pace
    with competing technologies. Alternative storage technologies
    like solid-state storage, or flash memory technology, have
    helped advance acceptance of “netbooks” in the PC
    market, and have successfully served digital entertainment
    markets for products such as digital cameras, MP3 players, USB
    flash drives and mobile phones that require lower storage
    capacity devices that cannot be economically manufactured using
    hard drive technology. Typically, storage needs for higher
    capacity and performance, with lower

cost-per-gigabyte,

have been better served by hard drives. However, advances in
    semiconductor technology have resulted in flash memory emerging
    as a technology that is competitive with hard drives for niche
    high performance needs in advanced digital computing markets
    such as enterprise servers and storage, in spite of the
    associated challenges in the attributes of cost, capacity and
    reliability. Additionally, solid-state storage is produced by
    large semiconductor companies who can sell their products at
    lower prices and operate their solid-state storage business unit
    at a loss while still remaining profitable overall in an attempt
    to gain market share. There can be no assurance that we will be
    successful in anticipating and developing new products for the
    desktop, mobile, enterprise, CE and external storage markets in
    response to solid-state storage, as well as other competing
    technologies. If our hard drive technology fails to offer higher
    capacity, performance and reliability with lower

cost-per-gigabyte

than solid-state storage for the desktop, mobile, enterprise, CE
    and external storage markets, we will be at a competitive
    disadvantage to companies using semiconductor technology to
    serve these markets and our business will suffer.



Spending
    to improve our technology and develop new technology to remain
    competitive may negatively impact our financial
    results.

In attempting to remain competitive, we may need to increase our
    capital expenditures and expenses above our historical run-rate
    model in order to attempt to improve our existing technology and
    develop new technology. Increased investments in technology
    could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with
    demand for our products which would have a negative impact on
    our financial results.

Our head
    manufacturing operations include a single wafer fabrication
    facility in California and a single slider fabrication and head
    gimbal assembly facility in Thailand, our magnetic media
    operations include three facilities in Malaysia, and our high
    volume hard drive manufacturing operations include facilities in
    Thailand and Malaysia, which subjects us to substantial risk of
    damage or loss if operations at any of these facilities are
    disrupted.

We design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and
    magnetic media required for the hard drives we manufacture.
    Approximately

80-90%

of
    our requirement for heads is satisfied by wafers fabricated in
    our Fremont, California facility. Wafers are then sent to our
    Thailand facility for slider fabrication and wafer slicing and
    HGA assembly and testing. Additionally, we manufacture the
    majority of our magnetic media and substrates in three
    facilities in Malaysia. Our high volume hard drive manufacturing
    facilities are in Malaysia and Thailand, and the manufacturing
    facilities of many of our suppliers are also in Asia. A fire,
    flood, earthquake or other disaster, condition or event such as
    political instability, civil unrest or a power outage that
    adversely affects any of these facilities would significantly
    affect supply of our heads or magnetic media and limit our
    ability to manufacture hard drives, which would result in a
    substantial loss of sales and revenue and a substantial harm to
    our operating results. Similarly, a localized health risk
    affecting our employees or the staff of our suppliers, such as
    the spread of the Influenza A (H1N1) or a new pandemic
    influenza, could impair the total volume of hard drives that we
    are able to manufacture, which would result in substantial harm
    to our operating results.

Our
    operating results will be adversely affected if we fail to
    optimize the overall quality,

time-to-market

and

time-to-volume

of new and established products.

To achieve consistent success with our customers, we must
    balance several key attributes such as

time-to-market,

time-to-volume,

quality, cost, service, price and a broad product portfolio. Our
    operating results will be adversely affected if we fail to:

•

maintain overall quality of products in new and established
    programs;

•

produce sufficient quantities of products at the capacities our
    customers demand while managing the integration of new and
    established technologies;

•

develop and qualify new products that have changes in overall
    specifications or features that our customers may require for
    their business needs;

•

obtain commitments from our customers to qualify new products,
    redesigns of current products, or new components in our existing
    products;

•

obtain customer qualification of these products on a timely
    basis by meeting all of our customers’ needs for
    performance, quality and features;

•

maintain an adequate supply of components required to
    manufacture our products; or

•

maintain the manufacturing capability to quickly change our
    product mix between different capacities, form factors and spin
    speeds in response to changes in customers’ product demands.

Manufacturing
    and marketing our products abroad subjects us to numerous
    risks.

We are subject to risks associated with our foreign
    manufacturing operations and foreign marketing efforts,
    including:

•

obtaining requisite U.S. and foreign governmental permits
    and approvals;



•

currency exchange rate fluctuations or restrictions;

•

political instability and civil unrest, such as the recent
    protests and violence in Bangkok, Thailand;

•

limited transportation availability, delays, and extended time
    required for shipping, which risks may be compounded in periods
    of price declines;

•

higher freight rates;

•

labor problems;

•

•

copyright levies or similar fees imposed in European and other
    countries;

•

•

increasing labor and overhead costs; and

•

loss or non-renewal of favorable tax treatment under agreements
    or treaties with foreign tax authorities.

Terrorist
    attacks may adversely affect our business and operating
    results.

The continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war
    or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial and
    insurance markets and have significantly increased the
    political, economic and social instability in some of the
    geographic areas in which we operate. Additionally, it is
    uncertain what impact the reactions to such acts by various
    governmental agencies and security regulators worldwide will
    have on shipping costs. Acts of terrorism, either domestically
    or abroad, could create further uncertainties and instability.
    To the extent this results in disruption or delays of our
    manufacturing capabilities or shipments of our products, our
    business, operating results and financial condition could be
    adversely affected.

Sudden
    disruptions to the availability of freight lanes could have an
    impact on our operations.

We ship the majority of our products to our various customers
    via air freight. The sudden unavailability of air cargo
    operations used to ship our products would impair our ability to
    deliver our products in a timely and efficient manner, which
    could adversely impact our operating results. We also ship a
    portion of our product via ocean freight, and events or
    conditions at shipping ports, such as labor difficulties or
    disputes, could also impact our operating results by impairing
    our ability to timely and efficiently deliver these products.

We are
    vulnerable to system failures, which could harm our
    business.

We are heavily dependent on our technology infrastructure, among
    other functions, to operate our factories, sell our products,
    fulfill orders, manage inventory and bill, collect and make
    payments. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption
    from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures,
    computer viruses, computer

denial-of-service

attacks and other events. Our business is also subject to
    break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by third
    parties as well as employees. Despite any precautions we may
    take, such problems could result in, among other consequences,
    interruptions in our business, which could harm our reputation
    and financial condition.

If we
    fail to successfully integrate SiliconSystems’ business and
    technology into our operations in a timely manner, it may
    adversely affect our future results.

While we expect our recent acquisition of SiliconSystems, Inc.
    to have only a nominal positive impact on our results in the
    near term, we believe that the acquisition may result in certain
    more significant future benefits, including technology
    efficiencies and synergies. However, we may encounter
    difficulties in the complicated process of integrating
    SiliconSystems’ business and technology into our existing
    operations. If we are not able to quickly and cost-effectively
    integrate SiliconSystems’ business and technology into our
    operations, our current operations may be disrupted and the
    future anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be
    realized fully or at all. Consequently, our future results of
    operations may be adversely affected.



If we are
    unable to retain or hire key staff and skilled employees our
    business results may suffer.

Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key
    staff and skilled employees, many of whom would be extremely
    difficult to replace. Worldwide competition for skilled
    employees in the data storage industry is intense and, as we
    attempt to move to a position of technology leadership in the
    storage industry, our business success becomes increasingly
    dependent on our ability to retain our key staff and skilled
    employees as well as attract, integrate and retain new skilled
    employees. Volatility or lack of positive performance in our
    stock price and the overall markets may adversely affect our
    ability to retain key staff or skilled employees who have
    received equity compensation. This risk increases during periods
    of declining stock price, which may cause many of our key staff
    and skilled employees to lose much of the value of the equity
    compensation that they have received as an incentive to remain
    in our employ and work towards the success of our operations.
    Additionally, because a substantial portion of our key
    employees’ compensation is placed “at risk” and
    linked to the performance of our business, when our operating
    results are negatively impacted by events such as the current
    global economic downturn, we are at a competitive disadvantage
    for retaining and hiring key staff and skilled employees versus
    other companies that pay a relatively higher fixed salary. If we
    are unable to retain our existing key staff or skilled
    employees, or hire and integrate new key staff or skilled
    employees, or if we fail to implement succession plans for our
    key staff, our operating results would likely be harmed.

The
    nature of our business and our reliance on intellectual property
    and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk of
    significant litigation.

The data storage industry has been characterized by significant
    litigation. This includes litigation relating to patent and
    other intellectual property rights, product liability claims and
    other types of litigation. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy
    and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the
    results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in
    adverse rulings or decisions. We may enter into settlements or
    be subject to judgments that may, individually or in the
    aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition or operating results.

We evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices
    of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to
    time. If claims or actions are asserted against us, we may be
    required to obtain a license or cross-license, modify our
    existing technology or design a new non-infringing technology.
    Such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly.
    In addition, we may decide to settle a claim or action against
    us, which settlement could be costly. We may also be liable for
    any past infringement. If there is an adverse ruling against us
    in an infringement lawsuit, an injunction could be issued
    barring production or sale of any infringing product. It could
    also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or
    lost profits or, if there is a finding of willful infringement,
    treble damages. Any of these results would increase our costs
    and harm our operating results.

Our
    reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary
    information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients
    of our business could be copied by competitors.

Our success depends, in significant part, on the proprietary
    nature of our technology, including non-patentable intellectual
    property such as our process technology. If a competitor is able
    to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology despite
    the safeguards we have in place, it may be difficult, expensive
    or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection. Also,
    the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our
    intellectual property to the same extent as do U.S. laws.
    In addition to patent protection of intellectual property
    rights, we consider elements of our product designs and
    processes to be proprietary and confidential. We rely upon
    employee, consultant and vendor non-disclosure agreements and
    contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to
    protect our proprietary information. However, any of our
    registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be
    challenged or exploited by others in the industry, which might
    harm our operating results.

The costs
    of compliance with environmental regulation and customers’
    standards of corporate citizenship could cause an increase in
    our operating costs.

We may be subject to various state, federal and international
    laws and regulations governing the environment, including those
    restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic
    products and making producers of those products financially
    responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and
    disposal of certain products. Such laws and regulations have
    been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate. For
    example, the European Union (“EU”) has



enacted the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous
    Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment
    (“RoHS”) directive, which prohibits the use of certain
    substances in electronic equipment, and the Waste Electrical and
    Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) directive, which
    obligates parties that place electrical and electronic equipment
    onto the market in the EU to put a clearly identifiable mark on
    the equipment, register with and report to EU member countries
    regarding distribution of the equipment, and provide a mechanism
    to take-back and properly dispose of the equipment. Similar
    legislation may be enacted in other locations where we
    manufacture or sell our products. We will need to ensure that we
    comply with such laws and regulations as they are enacted, and
    that our component suppliers also timely comply with such laws
    and regulations. If we fail to timely comply with the
    legislation, our customers may refuse to purchase our products,
    which would have a materially adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and operating results.

In connection with our compliance with such environmental laws
    and regulations, as well as our compliance with industry
    environmental initiatives, the standards of business conduct
    required by some of our customers, and our commitment to sound
    corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business, we could
    incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject
    to disruptions to our operations and logistics. In addition, if
    we were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliance
    with these initiatives or standards of conduct, we could be
    subject to governmental fines, liability to our customers and
    damage to our reputation and corporate brand which could cause
    our financial condition or operating results to suffer.

Fluctuations
    in currency exchange rates as a result of our international
    operations may negatively affect our operating
    results.

Because we manufacture our products abroad, our operating costs
    are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
    Further fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Thai Baht and
    of the Malaysian Ringgit may negatively impact our operating
    results. The Thai Baht is a free floating currency while the
    Malaysian Ringgit exchange rate policy is one of a managed
    float. We have attempted to manage the impact of foreign
    currency exchange rate changes by, among other things, entering
    into short-term, forward contracts. However, these contracts do
    not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the issuer if
    currency controls are put in place. Currently, we hedge the Thai
    Baht, Malaysian Ringgit, Euro and British Pound Sterling with
    forward contracts.

If the U.S. dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most
    foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar equivalents of unhedged
    manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion
    of our production costs are foreign-currency denominated.
    Conversely, there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues
    since revenues are substantially U.S. dollar denominated.

Additionally, we negotiate and procure some of our component
    requirements in U.S. dollars from Japanese and other

non-U.S. based

vendors. If the U.S. dollar continues to weaken against
    other foreign currencies, some of our component suppliers may
    increase the price which they charge for their components in
    order to maintain an equivalent profit margin. If this occurs,
    it would have a negative impact on our operating results.

Increases
    in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses
    and an increase in our operating costs.

Some of our OEM customers have adopted a subcontractor model
    that requires us to contract directly with companies, such as
    ODMs, that provide manufacturing services to our OEM customers.
    Because these subcontractors are generally not as well
    capitalized as our direct OEM customers, this subcontractor
    model exposes us to increased credit risks. Our agreements with
    our OEM customers may not permit us to increase our product
    prices to alleviate this increased credit risk. Additionally, as
    we attempt to expand our OEM and distribution channel sales into
    emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India and China, the
    customers in these regions may have relatively short operating
    histories, making it more difficult for us to accurately assess
    the associated credit risks. Any credit losses we may suffer as
    a result of these increased risks, or as a result of credit
    losses from any significant customer, would increase our
    operating costs, which may negatively impact our operating
    results.



Inaccurate
    projections of demand for our product can cause large
    fluctuations in our quarterly results.

We often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in
    the third month of the quarter, which makes it difficult for us
    to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter.
    In addition, our quarterly projections and results may be
    subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of
    other factors including:

•

the timing of orders from and shipment of products to major
    customers;

•

our product mix;

•

changes in the prices of our products;

•

manufacturing delays or interruptions;

•

acceptance by customers of competing products in lieu of our
    products;

•

variations in the cost of components for our products;

•

limited availability of components that we obtain from a single
    or a limited number of suppliers;

•

competition and consolidation in the data storage industry;

•

seasonal and other fluctuations in demand for PCs often due to
    technological advances; and

•

availability and rates of transportation.

Rapidly
    changing conditions in the hard drive industry make it difficult
    to predict actual results.

We have made and continue to make a number of estimates and
    assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting.
    The highly technical nature of our products and the rapidly
    changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual
    results may differ significantly from our estimates and
    assumptions. These changes have impacted our financial results
    in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Key
    estimates and assumptions for us include:

•

price protection adjustments and other sales promotions and
    allowances on products sold to retailers, resellers and
    distributors;

•

inventory adjustments for write-down of inventories to lower of
    cost or market value (net realizable value);

•

reserves for doubtful accounts;

•

accruals for product returns;

•

accruals for warranty costs related to product defects;

•

accruals for litigation and other contingencies; and

•

liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits.

The
    market price of our common stock is volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue
    to be, extremely volatile. Factors such as the following may
    significantly affect the market price of our common stock:

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;

•

announcements of technological innovations by us or our
    competitors which may decrease the volume and profitability of
    sales of our existing products and increase the risk of
    inventory obsolescence;

•

new products introduced by us or our competitors;

•

periods of severe pricing pressures due to oversupply or price
    erosion resulting from competitive pressures or industry
    consolidation;

•

developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights;



•

conditions and trends in the hard drive, computer, data and
    content management, storage and communication industries;

•

contraction in our operating results or growth rates that are
    lower than our previous high growth-rate periods;

•

changes in financial estimates by securities analysts relating
    specifically to us or the hard drive industry in
    general; and

•

macroeconomic conditions that affect the market generally.

In addition, general economic conditions may cause the stock
    market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from
    time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many
    high technology companies. These fluctuations often appear to be
    unrelated to the operating performance of the companies.

Securities class action lawsuits are often brought against
    companies after periods of volatility in the market price of
    their securities. A number of such suits have been filed against
    us in the past, and should any new lawsuits be filed, such
    matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of
    resources and management’s attention.

Negative
    conditions in the global credit markets may impair the liquidity
    of a portion of our investment portfolio.

Our long-term investments consist of auction-rate securities
    totaling $18 million as of July 3, 2009. The negative
    conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some
    investors from liquidating their holdings of auction-rate
    securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale
    has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities.
    If the credit market does not improve, auctions for our invested
    amounts may continue to fail. If an auction fails for securities
    in which we have invested, we may be unable to liquidate some or
    all of our auction-rate securities at par should we need or
    desire to access the funds invested in those securities. In the
    event we need or desire to access these funds, we will not be
    able to do so until a future auction on these investments is
    successful or a buyer is found outside the auction process. If a
    buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at
    par (or current carrying value), we may incur a loss beyond
    losses already recognized by us on these securities. For
    example, during the year ended July 3, 2009, the market
    values of some of the auction-rate securities we owned were
    impacted by the macroeconomic credit market conditions, and as a
    result, we recognized $10 million of

other-than-temporary

losses to mark the investments to estimated market value.
    Further, rating downgrades of the security issuer or the
    third-parties insuring such investments may require us to adjust
    the carrying value of these investments through an additional
    impairment charge.

Current
    economic conditions have caused us difficulty in adequately
    protecting our increased cash and short-term investments from
    financial institution failures.

The negative global economic conditions and volatile investment
    markets have caused us to hold more cash, cash equivalents and
    short-term investments than we would hold under normal
    circumstances. Since there has been an overall increase in
    demand for low-risk, U.S. government backed securities with
    a limited supply in the financial marketplace, we face increased
    difficulty in adequately protecting our increased cash and
    short-term investments from possible sudden and unforeseeable
    failures by banks and other financial institutions. A failure of
    any of these financial institutions in which deposits exceed
    FDIC limits could have an adverse impact on our financial
    position.

If our
    internal controls are found to be ineffective, our financial
    results or our stock price may be adversely affected.

Our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of
    July 3, 2009, in compliance with Section 404 of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective. We believe that we currently have
    adequate internal control procedures in place for future
    periods; however, if our internal control over financial
    reporting is found to be ineffective or if we identify a
    material weakness or significant deficiency in our financial
    reporting, investors may lose confidence in the reliability of
    our financial statements, which may adversely affect our
    financial results or our stock price.

The
    outcome of our ongoing domestic and foreign tax audits may
    negatively impact our operating results.

As we have previously disclosed, we are under examination of
    certain of our fiscal years by the U.S. Internal Revenue
    Service (the “IRS”). Separately, our French subsidiary
    is under examination by the French tax authorities. Although we



believe our tax positions for the years under review are
    reasonable, the outcomes and timing of these audits are subject
    to significant uncertainty and could result in us having to pay
    amounts to the IRS or French tax authorities in order to resolve
    examination of our tax positions, which could result in an
    increase or decrease of our current estimate of unrecognized tax
    benefits and may negatively impact our financial position,
    results of operations, net income or cash flows.

Properties

Our corporate headquarters are located in Lake Forest,
    California. The Lake Forest facilities consist of approximately
    257,000 square feet of leased space and house our
    management, research and development, administrative and sales
    staff. In addition, in Fremont, California, we own facilities
    consisting of approximately 286,000 square feet, which we
    use for head wafer fabrication, research and development and
    warehousing. In San Jose, California, we lease facilities
    consisting of approximately 401,000 square feet, which we
    use for research and development. In Longmont, Colorado, we
    lease one facility consisting of approximately
    23,000 square feet, which we use for research and
    development. We lease one facility in Irvine, California, which
    consists of approximately 60,000 square feet, which we use
    as a hard drive return and refurbishing center. In addition, we
    lease one facility in Aliso Viejo, California, consisting of
    approximately 34,000 square feet, which we assumed in
    connection with our acquisition of SiliconSystems, Inc. and
    which we use to house research and development, administrative
    and sales staff. We also lease office space in various other
    locations throughout the world primarily for research and
    development and sales and technical support.

We own manufacturing facilities in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,
    consisting of approximately 575,000 square feet, which we
    use for assembly of hard drives, printed circuit boards and
    HSAs, and facilities in Penang and Johor, Malaysia, consisting

    which we are currently leasing for assembly of hard drives. The
    acquisition, which is subject to customary closing conditions,
    is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2010.

We believe our present facilities are adequate for our current
    needs, although the process of upgrading our facilities to meet
    technological and market requirements is expected to continue.
    New manufacturing facilities, in general, can be developed and
    become operational within approximately nine to eighteen months
    should we require such additional facilities.

Our
    Company

We design, develop, manufacture and sell hard drives. A hard
    drive is a device that uses one or more rotating magnetic disks
    to store and allow fast access to data. Hard drives are key
    components of computers, including desktop and notebook
    computers (“PCs”), data storage subsystems and many
    consumer electronic (“CE”) devices.

We sell our products worldwide to original equipment
    manufacturers (“OEMs”) and original design
    manufacturers (“ODMs”) for use in computer systems,
    subsystems or CE devices, and to distributors, resellers and
    retailers. Our hard drives are used in desktop computers,
    notebook computers, and enterprise applications such as servers,
    workstations, network attached storage, storage area networks
    and video surveillance equipment. Additionally, our hard drives
    are used in CE applications such as digital video recorders
    (“DVRs”), and satellite and cable set-top boxes
    (“STBs”). We also sell our hard drives as stand-alone
    storage products and integrate them into finished enclosures,
    embedding application software and offering the products as
    WD

®

-branded

    external storage appliances for personal data backup and
    portable or expanded storage of digital music, photographs,
    video and other digital data.



Hard drives provide non-volatile data storage, which means that
    the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the
    device. Our hard drives currently include 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch
    form factor drives, having capacities ranging from 40 gigabytes
    (“GB”) to 2 terabytes (“TB”), nominal
    rotation speeds up to 10,000 revolutions per minute
    (“RPM”), and offer interfaces including both Enhanced
    Integrated Drive Electronics (“EIDE”) and Serial
    Advanced Technology Attachment (“SATA”). We also embed
    our hard drives into
    WD

®

-branded

    external storage appliances using interfaces such as USB 2.0,
    external SATA,
    FireWire

tm

and Ethernet network connections with capacities of 160 GB up to
    8 TB. In addition, we offer a family of hard drives specifically
    designed to consume substantially less power than standard
    drives, using our WD GreenPower
    Technology

tm

.

In the second quarter of 2009, we began to design, develop,
    manufacture and sell media players. A media player is a device
    that connects to a user’s television or home theater system
    and plays digital movies, music and photos from any of our
    WD

®

-branded

    external hard drives or other USB mass storage devices. We sell
    our media players worldwide to resellers and retailers under our
    WD

®

brand.

In the third quarter of 2009, we acquired SiliconSystems, Inc
    (“SiliconSystems”) and began to design, develop,
    manufacture and sell solid-state drives. A solid-state drive is
    a storage device that uses semiconductor, non-volatile media,
    rather than magnetic disks and magnetic heads, to store and
    allow fast access to data. We sell our solid-state drives
    worldwide to OEMs and distributors for use in the embedded
    systems market which includes network-communications,
    industrial, embedded-computing, medical, military, aerospace,
    media-appliance and data-streaming applications.

Results
    of Operations

On September 5, 2007, we completed our acquisition of
    Komag, Incorporated (“Komag”) and on March 27,
    2009, we completed our acquisition of SiliconSystems. In
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles (“U.S. GAAP”), operating results for
    Komag and SiliconSystems prior to the dates of their
    acquisitions are not included in our operating results, which
    therefore affects our discussion of changes in our revenues and
    expenses for the periods prior to the acquisitions as compared
    to the periods after the acquisitions.

Fiscal
    2009 Overview

In 2009, our net revenue decreased by 8% to $7.5 billion on
    hard drive shipments of 146 million units as compared to
    $8.1 billion and 133 million units, respectively, in
    2008. In 2009, 62% of our hard drive revenue was derived from
    non-desktop sources including CE products, enterprise
    applications, notebook computers and retail sales as compared to
    56% in 2008. Hard drive average selling price decreased to $51
    in 2009 from $59 in 2008. Gross margin percentage decreased to
    17.9% in 2009 from 21.5% in 2008. Operating income decreased by
    $487 million to $519 million in 2009, which included a
    $14 million in-process research and development charge
    related to the acquisition of SiliconSystems, $112 million
    of restructuring charges and an $18 million gain on the
    sale of assets from our media substrate manufacturing facility
    in Sarawak, Malaysia. Operating income was $1.0 billion in
    2008, which included a $49 million in-process research and
    development charge related to the acquisition of Komag. As a
    percentage of net revenue, operating income was 7.0% in 2009
    compared to 12.4% in 2008. Net income in 2009 was
    $470 million, or $2.08 per diluted share, compared to
    $867 million, or $3.84 per diluted share, in 2008.

During December 2008, our second fiscal quarter, we announced a
    restructuring plan to realign our cost structure as a result of
    a softer demand environment. This plan was completed during our
    third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2009. This resulted in the
    closure of one of our hard drive manufacturing facilities in
    Thailand, the disposal of our media substrate manufacturing
    facility in Sarawak, Malaysia, and headcount reductions
    throughout the world of approximately 3,300 people.
    Restructuring costs totaled $112 million and consisted of
    $81 million of asset impairment charges, $27 million
    of employee termination benefits and $4 million of contract
    termination and other exit costs. Total cash expenditures
    related to the restructuring activities were approximately
    $31 million. During our fourth fiscal quarter, we sold our
    media substrate manufacturing facility, and related assets, in
    Sarawak, Malaysia for net proceeds of approximately
    $29 million, resulting in a gain of $18 million. The
    closure and disposal of our manufacturing facilities was to
    realign our manufacturing capacity with our expectations
    regarding demand at that time. During our fourth fiscal quarter,
    we experienced a much stronger demand than originally
    anticipated. We expect continuing sequential growth in our first
    quarter of fiscal 2010. As a result, in our first quarter of
    fiscal 2010, we reopened the hard drive manufacturing facility
    in Thailand that we previously closed as part of our
    restructuring plan.



We also completed our acquisition of SiliconSystems resulting in
    a total acquisition cost of $66 million, consisting of
    $65 million in cash paid to SiliconSystems shareholders and
    $1 million of other direct acquisition costs.

Fiscal
    Year 2009 Compared to Fiscal Year 2008

Net Revenue.

Net revenue was $7.5 billion
    for 2009, a decrease of 8% from 2008. Total unit shipments of
    hard drives increased to 146 million as compared to
    133 million for the prior year. The decrease in revenue
    primarily resulted from a decline in our ASPs which reflects a
    more competitive pricing environment, particularly in the
    notebook and branded markets. The decline in our ASPs was
    partially offset by an increase in unit shipments of 2.5-inch
    drives. We shipped 56 million 2.5-inch drives in 2009 as
    compared to 37 million units in 2008. The increase in
    2.5-inch unit



shipments was driven by continued strength in notebook and
    netbook PC demand, coupled with increased customer preference
    for our product offerings.

Changes in revenue by geography and by channel generally reflect
    normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics as
    well as demand strength in Asia, which continues to be driven by
    the concentration of global manufacturing in that region.
    Changes in revenue by channel are a result of increases in sales
    of mobile hard drives to OEMs.

We have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide
    customers with price protection and other incentives or
    reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross
    revenue. For 2009, these programs represented 11% of gross
    revenues compared to 10% in 2008. These amounts generally vary
    according to several factors including industry conditions,
    seasonal demand, competitor actions, channel mix and overall
    availability of product.

Gross Margin.

Gross margin for 2009 was
    $1.3 billion, a decrease of $402 million, or 23% over
    the prior year. Gross margin percentage decreased to 17.9% in
    2009 from 21.5% in 2008. This decrease is due to a more
    competitive pricing environment primarily resulting from an
    increase in product offerings in the mobile and branded markets.

Operating Expenses.

Total research and
    development (“R&D”) expense and selling, general
    and administrative (“SG&A”) expense increased to
    9.5% of net revenue in 2009 compared to 8.5% in 2008. R&D
    expense was $509 million in 2009, an increase of
    $45 million, or 10% over the prior year. This increase in
    R&D expense includes $76 million relating to product
    development to support new programs offset by a $31 million
    decrease in variable incentive compensation. As a percentage of
    net revenue, R&D expense increased to 6.8% in 2009 compared
    to 5.7% in 2008 primarily due to continued investment in product
    development. SG&A expense was $201 million in 2009, a
    decrease of $19 million, or 8.6%, as compared to 2008. This
    decrease in SG&A expense primarily resulted from a
    $19 million decrease in variable incentive compensation and
    a $6 million insurance recovery, offset by a
    $6 million net increase in the expansion of our sales and
    marketing presence into new regions. SG&A expense was 2.7%
    as a percentage of revenue in both 2009 and 2008.

During 2009, we recorded a $14 million in-process research
    and development charge related to the acquisition of
    SiliconSystems. During 2008, we recorded a $49 million
    in-process research and development charge related to the
    acquisition of Komag. These charges relate to projects that were
    not ready for commercial production and had no alternative
    future use and, therefore, the fair value of the development
    effort did not quality for capitalization and was immediately
    expensed. During 2009, we also recorded $112 million in
    restructuring charges and an $18 million gain on the sale
    of assets from our media substrate manufacturing facility in
    Sarawak, Malaysia.

Other Income (Expense).

Net interest and other
    expense was $18 million in 2009 compared to
    $25 million in 2008. This change was primarily due to a
    decrease in the variable interest rate on our debt and a
    $3 million decrease in losses on our auction-rate
    securities.

Income Tax Provision.

Income tax expense was
    $31 million in 2009 compared to $114 million in 2008.
    Tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 6% in
    2009 compared to 12% for 2008. Differences between the effective
    tax rates and the U.S. Federal statutory rate are primarily
    due to tax holidays and incentive programs and the current year
    generation of income tax credits. We have tax holidays in
    Malaysia and Thailand that expire at various times through 2022.
    In 2009, income tax expense includes a provision of
    $42 million offset by $6 million in tax benefits
    related to the extension of the U.S. Federal research and
    development tax credit, enacted into law in October 2008, and a
    favorable adjustment of $5 million to previously recorded
    tax accruals and credits. In 2008, tax expense included net
    charges of $60 million for taxes incurred upon the license
    of certain intellectual property to a foreign subsidiary in our
    first fiscal quarter.

We recognized a $29 million increase in the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits during 2009. As of July 3, 2009,
    we had approximately $136 million of unrecognized tax
    benefits which, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax
    rate in subsequent years.

Fiscal
    Year 2008 Compared to Fiscal Year 2007

Net Revenue.

Net revenue was $8.1 billion
    for 2008, an increase of 48% from 2007. Total unit shipments
    increased to 133 million as compared to 97 million for
    the prior year. This unit increase resulted from an increase in
    higher overall



demand for hard drives and our continuing diversification into
    non-desktop markets, including mobile, consumer electronics,
    enterprise and branded products. For example, we shipped
    37 million 2.5 inch drives to the mobile and branded
    markets in 2008 as compared to 12 million units in 2007.
    Additionally, we shipped 15 million units to the DVR market
    in 2008 as compared to 10 million units in 2007. ASPs
    increased to $59 due to an improved mix of revenues by market
    category, improved product mix and more favorable demand/supply
    conditions. Changes in revenue by geography generally reflect
    normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics as
    well as an increase in mobile drives sold to Asia. Changes in
    revenue by channel are a result of increases in sales of mobile
    hard drives to OEMs and an increase in sales of branded products
    due to the growing worldwide acceptance of our My
    Passport

®

and My
    Book

®

external digital storage appliances.

We have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide
    customers with price protection and other incentives or
    reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross
    revenue. For the year ended June 27, 2008, these programs
    represented 10% in 2008 compared to 7% in 2007. These amounts
    generally vary according to several factors including industry
    conditions, seasonal demand, competitor actions, channel mix and
    overall availability of product.

Gross Margin.

Gross margin for 2008 was
    $1.7 billion, an increase of $839 million, or 93% over
    2007. Gross margin percentage increased to 21.5% in 2008 from
    16.5% in 2007. The factors contributing to this increase were an
    improved mix of revenues by market category, improved product
    mix and more favorable demand/supply conditions. Our
    manufacturing throughput and costs also improved through
    operational efficiencies, higher utilization and a higher mix of
    products based on newer, more cost-effective technologies and
    the contribution of media operations.

Operating Expenses.

Total operating expenses,
    consisting of research and development (“R&D”)
    and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”),
    decreased to 8.5% of net revenue in 2008 compared to 8.9% in
    2007. R&D expense was $464 million in 2008, an
    increase of $158 million, or 52% over the prior year. This
    increase in R&D expense includes $75 million relating
    to the acquired media operations, $52 million related to
    product development to support new programs and $31 million
    in incentive and equity compensation. As a percentage of net
    revenue, R&D expense remained consistent at 5.7% in 2008
    compared to 5.6% in 2007. SG&A expense was
    $220 million in 2008, an increase of $41 million, or
    23%, as compared to 2007. This increase in SG&A expense
    includes $28 million for the expansion of sales and
    marketing to support new products and $13 million in higher
    incentive and equity compensation. As a percentage of net
    revenue, SG&A expense decreased to 2.7% in 2008 from 3.3%
    in 2007 primarily due to an increase in net revenue in 2008
    compared to 2007.

During 2008, we recorded a $49 million charge to operating
    expense related to an in-process research and development
    project acquired from Komag involving technology for higher
    recording densities on advanced perpendicular recording magnetic
    media. As these advanced products were not ready for commercial
    production and had no alternative future use, the fair value of
    the development effort did not qualify for capitalization and
    was immediately expensed.

Other Income (Expense).

Net interest and other
    expense was $25 million in 2008 compared to net interest
    and other income of $28 million in 2007. This decrease is a
    result of higher debt balances and realized and recognized
    losses on investments of $13 million.

Income Tax Provision.

Income tax expense was
    $114 million in 2008 compared to an income tax benefit of
    $121 million in 2007. Tax provision as a percentage of
    income before taxes was 12% in 2008 compared to tax benefit as a
    percentage of income of 27% for 2007. Differences between the
    effective tax rates and the U.S. Federal statutory rate are
    primarily due to tax holidays and incentive programs and the
    current year generation of income tax credits. We have tax
    holidays in Malaysia and Thailand that expire at various times
    through 2022. In 2008, income tax expense also includes net
    charges of $60 million for taxes incurred upon the license
    of certain intellectual property to a foreign subsidiary in our
    first fiscal quarter. In 2007, the tax provision was impacted by
    a favorable adjustment to the company’s valuation allowance
    for deferred tax assets of $126 million. In the fourth
    quarter of 2007, we reversed the remaining valuation allowance
    for our deferred tax assets based upon a determination that it
    was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be
    realized. The realization of the deferred tax assets is
    primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient
    earnings in certain jurisdictions in future years. The amount of
    deferred tax assets considered realizable may increase or
    decrease in subsequent periods based on fluctuating industry or
    company conditions.



We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (“FIN 48”), as of June 30, 2007. As a result
    of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognized no
    adjustment in the net liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
    The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the
    date of adoption of FIN 48 was $58 million, all of
    which would affect our effective tax rate if realized. During
    the year ended June 27, 2008, we recognized a
    $17 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits and recorded $32 million of liabilities for
    unrecognized tax benefits related to Komag. As of June 27,
    2008, we had approximately $107 million of unrecognized tax
    benefits which included the $32 million of gross
    unrecognized tax benefits related to Komag.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

We ended 2009 with total cash and cash equivalents of
    $1.8 billion, an increase of $690 million from
    June 27, 2008. The following table summarizes the results
    of our statements of cash flows for the three years ended

Our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to
    preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing return through
    the full investment of available funds. We believe our current
    cash, cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will
    be sufficient to meet our working capital needs through the
    foreseeable future. Our ability to sustain our working capital
    position is subject to a number of risks that are discussed in
    Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities during 2009 was
    $1.3 billion as compared to $1.4 billion for 2008 and
    $618 million for 2007. Cash flow from operating activities
    consists of net income, adjusted for non-cash charges, plus or
    minus working capital changes. This represents our principal
    source of cash. Net cash provided by changes in working capital
    was $198 million for 2009 as compared to $22 million
    for 2008 and $78 million used to fund working capital for
    2007.

Our working capital requirements primarily depend upon the
    effective management of our cash conversion cycle, which
    measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash
    through sales. The following table summarizes the cash
    conversion cycle for the three years ended 2009:

For the year ended July 3, 2009, our days sales outstanding
    (“DSOs”) increased by 1 day, days in inventory
    (“DIOs”) decreased by 1 day, and days payables
    outstanding remained consistent with 2008.

From time to time, we modify the timing of payments to our
    vendors. We make these modifications primarily to manage our
    vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows, including our
    cash balances. Generally, we make the



payment modifications through negotiations with or by granting
    to or receiving from our vendors payment term accommodations.

Investing
    Activities

Net cash used in investing activities for 2009 was
    $551 million as compared to $1.3 billion for 2008 and
    $383 million for 2007. During 2009, cash used in investing
    activities primarily consisted of $519 million for capital
    expenditures and $63 million for the acquisition of
    SiliconSystems, net of cash acquired. During 2008, cash used in
    investing activities consisted of $927 million for the
    acquisition of Komag, net of cash acquired, and
    $615 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by
    net cash provided by investments of $221 million. The
    decrease in capital expenditures in 2009 compared to 2008 was
    primarily the result of the expected reduction in market demand
    due to the macroeconomic conditions. Capital expenditures in
    2009 primarily consisted of the expansion of our head wafer
    fabrication facilities, continued investment in advanced head
    technologies and increased capacity for our broadening and
    growing product portfolio.

For 2010, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately
    $600 million and depreciation and amortization to be
    approximately $530 million.

Our cash equivalents are invested primarily in readily
    accessible, AAA rated institutional money market funds which are
    invested in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Treasury
    bills and U.S. Government agency securities. We also have
    auction-rate securities that are classified as long-term
    investments as they are expected to be held until secondary
    markets become available. These investments are currently
    accounted for as

available-for-sale

securities and recorded at fair value within other non-current
    assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The estimated market
    values of these investments are subject to fluctuation. The
    carrying value of our investments in auction-rate securities was
    reduced from $28 million as of June 27, 2008 to
    $18 million as of July 3, 2009, as a result of the
    recognition of $10 million in

other-than-temporary

losses that were recorded through earnings.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash used by financing activities for 2009 was
    $64 million as compared to net cash provided by financing
    activities for 2008 of $326 million. Net cash used in
    financing activities was $86 million for 2007. The net cash
    provided by financing activities in 2009 consisted of
    $28 million provided by the issuance of stock under
    employee plans, offset by $36 million used to repurchase
    our common stock, a $24 million decrease in excess tax
    benefits from employee stock plans, $5 million in tax
    withholding obligations paid in connection with the vesting of
    stock awards under employee stock plans, and $27 million
    used to repay long-term debt. The net cash provided by financing
    activities in 2008 consisted of $500 million in net
    proceeds from debt, $89 million provided by an increase in
    excess tax benefits from employee stock plans, $65 million
    provided by the issuance of stock under employee stock plans,
    offset by a $250 million repayment of convertible
    debentures assumed in the acquisition of Komag, $60 million
    used to repurchase our common stock, $13 million used to
    repay other long-term debt and $5 million in tax
    withholding obligations paid in connection with the vesting of
    stock awards under employee stock plans. The net cash used in
    financing activities in 2007 consisted of $73 million used
    for repurchases of our common stock, $43 million used for
    repayments of long-term debt, $9 million in tax withholding
    obligations paid in connection with the vesting of stock awards
    under employee stock plans, offset by $39 million provided
    by the issuance of stock under employee plans.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Other than facility and equipment lease commitments incurred in
    the normal course of business and certain indemnification
    provisions (see “Contractual Obligations and
    Commitments” below), we do not have any off-balance sheet
    financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts,
    retained or contingent interests in transferred assets, or any
    obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an
    unconsolidated entity. We do not have any majority-owned
    subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial
    statements. Additionally, we do not have an interest in, or
    relationships with, any special-purpose entities.

Long-Term
    Debt

In February 2008, Western Digital Technologies, Inc.
    (“WDTI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
    entered into a five-year Credit Agreement (“Credit
    Facility”) that provides for a $750 million unsecured
    loan consisting of a $500 million term loan facility and a
    $250 million revolving credit facility. The revolving
    credit facility includes borrowing capacity available for
    letters of credit and for short-term borrowings referred to as
    swingline. In addition, WDTI may elect to expand the Credit
    Facility by up to $250 million if existing or new lenders
    provide additional term or revolving commitments. The
    $500 million term loan had a variable interest rate of
    1.63% as of July 3, 2009 and requires sixteen quarterly
    principal payments, that began in June 2009, of approximately
    $19 million, $25 million, $31 million and
    $50 million per quarter for each four quarter increment.
    The Credit Facility requires WDTI to comply with a leverage
    ratio and an interest coverage ratio calculated on a
    consolidated basis for the Company and its subsidiaries. In
    addition, the Credit Facility contains customary covenants,
    including covenants that limit or restrict WDTI’s and its
    subsidiaries’ ability to: incur liens, incur indebtedness,
    make certain restricted payments, merge or consolidate and enter
    into certain speculative hedging arrangements. As of
    July 3, 2009, WDTI had $250 million available for
    future borrowings on the revolving credit facility and was in
    compliance with all covenants.

Purchase
    Orders

In the normal course of business, we enter into purchase orders
    with suppliers for the purchase of hard drive components used to
    manufacture our products. These purchase orders generally cover
    forecasted component supplies needed for production during the
    next quarter, are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the
    components, and generally may be changed or canceled at any time
    prior to shipment of the components. We also enter into purchase
    orders with suppliers for capital equipment that are recorded as
    a liability upon receipt of the equipment. Our ability to change
    or cancel a capital equipment purchase order without penalty
    depends on the nature of the equipment being ordered. In some
    cases, we may be obligated to pay for certain costs related to
    changes to, or cancellation of, a purchase order, such as costs
    incurred for raw materials or work in process of components or
    capital equipment.

We have entered into long-term purchase agreements with various
    component suppliers which contain minimum quantity requirements.
    However, the dollar amount of the purchases may depend on the
    specific products ordered, achievement of pre-defined quantity
    or quality specifications or future price negotiations. The
    estimated related minimum purchase requirements are included in
    “Purchase obligations” in the table above. We have
    also entered into long-term purchase agreements with various
    component suppliers that carry fixed volumes and pricing which
    obligate us to make certain future purchases, contingent on
    certain conditions of performance, quality and technology of the
    vendor’s components. These arrangements are included under
    “Purchase obligations” in the table above.

We enter into, from time to time, other long-term purchase
    agreements for components with certain vendors. Generally,
    future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and
    determinable as they depend on our overall unit volume
    requirements and are contingent upon the prices, technology and
    quality of the supplier’s products remaining



competitive. These arrangements are not included under
    “Purchase obligations” in the table above. Please see
    Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for a discussion of risks related to these commitments.

Foreign
    Exchange Contracts

We purchase short-term, forward exchange contracts to hedge the
    impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying
    assets, liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and
    product costs denominated in foreign currencies. See
    Part II, Item 7A, under the heading “Disclosure
    About Foreign Currency Risk,” for our current forward
    exchange contract commitments.

Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, we may provide
    indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers,
    vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with
    respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to,
    losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, products or
    services to be provided by us, or from intellectual property
    infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have
    entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and
    certain of our officers that will require us, among other
    things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may
    arise by reason of their status or service as directors or
    officers. We maintain director and officer insurance, which may
    cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to
    indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances.

It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount
    under these indemnification agreements due to the limited
    history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and
    circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such
    indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss
    clauses. Historically, we have not incurred material costs as a
    result of obligations under these agreements.

Stock
    Repurchase Program

Our Board of Directors previously authorized us to repurchase
    $750 million of our common stock in open market
    transactions under a program through March 31, 2013. Since
    the inception of this stock repurchase program in 2005, through
    July 3, 2009, we have repurchased 18 million shares
    for a total cost of $284 million (including commissions).
    We expect stock repurchases to be funded principally by
    operating cash flows. We may continue to repurchase our stock as
    we deem appropriate and market conditions allow.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). The
    preparation of the financial statements requires the use of
    judgment and estimates that affect the reported amounts of
    revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and shareholders’
    equity. We have adopted accounting policies and practices that
    are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate. We
    believe the following are our most critical accounting policies
    that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates
    made by us. If these estimates differ significantly from actual
    results, the impact to the consolidated financial statements may
    be material.

Revenue
    and Accounts Receivable

In accordance with standard industry practice, we provide
    resellers with limited price protection for inventories held by
    resellers at the time of published list price reductions and
    other sales incentive programs. In accordance with current
    accounting standards, we recognize revenue upon delivery to
    OEMs, ODMs and resellers and record a reduction of revenue for
    estimated price protection and other programs in effect until
    the resellers sell such inventory to their customers. We base
    these adjustments on several factors including anticipated price
    decreases during the reseller holding period, reseller’s
    sell-through and inventory levels, estimated amounts to be
    reimbursed to qualifying customers, historical pricing
    information and customer claim processing. If customer demand
    for hard drives or market conditions differ from our
    expectations, our operating results could be affected. We also
    have programs under which we reimburse qualified distributors
    and retailers for certain marketing expenditures which are
    recorded as a reduction of revenue. We apply the provisions of
    Emerging Issues Task Force

No. 01-9,

“Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
    Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s
    Products)” and such sales incentive and marketing programs
    are recorded



as a reduction of revenue. These amounts generally vary
    according to several factors including industry conditions,
    seasonal demand, competitor actions, channel mix and overall
    availability of product. Since 2007, total sales incentive and
    marketing programs have ranged from 7% to 12% of gross revenues
    per quarter. Changes in future customer demand and market
    conditions may require us to increase our incentive programs as
    a percentage of gross revenue from the current range.
    Adjustments to revenues due to changes in accruals for these
    programs related to revenues reported in prior periods have
    averaged 0.2% of quarterly gross revenue since 2007.

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing
    specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based
    on insolvency, disputes or other collection issues. In addition,
    we routinely analyze the different receivable aging categories
    and establish reserves based on a combination of past due
    receivables and expected future losses based primarily on our
    historical levels of bad debt losses. If the financial condition
    of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its
    inability to pay its accounts when due, or if our overall loss
    history changes significantly, an adjustment in our allowance
    for doubtful accounts would be required, which could affect
    operating results.

We establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for
    sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is
    recognized. We base these provisions on existing product return
    notifications. If actual sales returns exceed expectations, an
    increase in the sales return accrual would be required, which
    could negatively affect operating results.

Warranty

We record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue
    is recognized. We generally warrant our products for a period of
    one to five years. Our warranty provision considers estimated
    product failure rates and trends, estimated repair or
    replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory
    claims related to product quality issues, if any. We use a
    statistical warranty tracking model to help prepare our
    estimates and we exercise judgment in determining the underlying
    estimates. Our statistical tracking model captures specific
    detail on hard drive reliability, such as factory test data,
    historical field return rates, and costs to repair by product
    type. If actual product return trends, costs to repair returned
    products or costs of customer compensatory claims differ
    significantly from our estimates, our future results of
    operations could be materially affected. Also, during a period
    of declining revenue, the percentage of warranty utilization to
    revenue may increase. Our judgment is subject to a greater
    degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products
    because of limited field experience with those products upon
    which to base our warranty estimates. We review our warranty
    accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and
    which are still under warranty. Any changes in the estimates
    underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact
    current period gross margin and income. Such changes are
    generally a result of differences between forecasted and actual
    return rate experience and costs to repair. For a summary of
    historical changes in estimates related to pre-existing warranty
    provisions, refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 4 of
    the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Inventory

We value inventories at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out and weighted average methods) or net realizable value.
    We use the

first-in,

first-out method to value the cost of the majority of our
    inventories, while we use the weighted-average method to value
    precious metal inventories. Weighted-average cost is calculated
    based upon the cost of precious metals at the time they are
    received by us. We have determined that it is not practicable to
    assign specific costs to individual units of precious metals
    and, as such, we relieve our precious metals inventory based on
    the weighted-average cost of the inventory at the time the
    inventory is used in production. The weighted average method of
    valuing precious metals does not materially differ from a

first-in,

first-out method. We record inventory write-downs for the
    valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable
    value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future
    sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory
    balances.

We evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and
    obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand,
    inventory on hand, sales levels and other information, and
    reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and
    obsolete inventory based on this analysis. Unanticipated changes
    in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in
    demand for one or more of our products, which may require a
    write down of inventory that could negatively affect operating
    results.



Litigation
    and Other Contingencies

We apply SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for
    Contingencies,” to determine when and how much to accrue
    for and disclose related to legal and other contingencies.
    Accordingly, we disclose material contingencies deemed to be
    reasonably possible and accrue loss contingencies when, in
    consultation with our legal advisors, we conclude that a loss is
    probable and reasonably estimable (Refer to Part II,
    Item 8, Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K).

The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters
    involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. The
    actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from
    management’s estimates.

Income
    Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability
    method, which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities
    be recognized for temporary differences between the financial
    reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities
    and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss
    (“NOL”) and tax credit carryforwards. We record a
    valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the
    deferred tax assets will not be realized. Each quarter we
    evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax
    assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record
    net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it
    is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be
    realized.

We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on
    the two-step process prescribed in Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes- an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” To the
    extent a tax position does not meet a more-likely-than-not level
    of certainty, no benefit is recognized in the financial
    statements. If a position meets the more-likely-than-not level
    of certainty, it is recognized in the financial statements at
    the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of
    being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties
    related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on
    liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are
    recorded in our provision for income taxes. The actual liability
    for unrealized tax benefit in any such contingency may be
    materially different from our estimates, which could result in
    the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax
    benefits or potentially adjust previously recorded liabilities
    for unrealized tax benefits.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We account for all stock-based compensation in accordance with
    the fair value recognition provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123(R)”). Under these provisions,
    stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date
    based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense
    over the vesting period. The fair values of all stock options
    granted are estimated using a binomial model, and the fair
    values of all Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)
    shares are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option
    pricing model. Both the binomial and the Black-Scholes-Merton
    models require the input of highly subjective assumptions. Under
    SFAS 123(R), we are required to use judgment in estimating
    the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be
    forfeited. If actual forfeitures differ significantly from the
    original estimate, stock-based compensation expense and our
    results of operations could be materially impacted.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”).
    SFAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value
    under U.S. GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurement. In February 2008, FASB issued FASB Staff Position

157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement 157”

(“FSP 157-2”),

which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those
    that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis, until fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2008 and interim periods within those
    years, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The
    partial adoption of SFAS 157 for financial assets and
    financial liabilities in our first quarter of fiscal 2009 did
    not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    statements. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption
    of SFAS 157 will have on the non-financial assets and
    non-financial liabilities in our consolidated financial
    statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159
    permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and
    financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses
    on items for which the fair value option has been elected are
    reported in earnings.



We chose not to elect the fair value option for eligible items,
    and accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 159 in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2009 had no impact on our consolidated
    financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS 141(R)”). SFAS 141(R) establishes
    principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business
    recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
    identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141(R) also
    provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill
    acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain
    purchase and determines what information to disclose to enable
    users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and
    financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141(R)
    applies prospectively to business combinations for which the
    acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2008, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2010. SFAS
    141(R) will impact the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements for business combinations with an acquisition date on
    or after adoption in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”
    (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 updates guidance
    regarding disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and
    hedging activities. The adoption of SFAS 161 in our third
    quarter of fiscal 2009 did not have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial statements.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets” (“FSP

FAS 142-3”),

which amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
    life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB Statement
    No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”.
    FSP

FAS 142-3

is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008, which for us is the first quarter of
    fiscal 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption
    of FSP

FAS 142-3

will have on our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 107-1

and ABP

28-1,

“Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments” (“FSP

FAS 107-1

and ABP

28-1”),

which amends SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about
    Fair Value of Financial Instruments”, and ABP Opinion
    No. 28, “Interim Financial Reporting”, to require
    disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim
    and annual reporting periods. FSP

FAS 107-1

and ABP

28-1

is effective for interim reporting periods ending after
    June 15, 2009, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal
    2010.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 115-2

and

FAS 124-2,

“Recognition and Presentation of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairments” (“FSP

FAS 115-2

and

FAS 124-2”),

which amends the

other-than-temporary

impairment guidance in U.S. GAAP for debt securities to
    make the guidance more operational and to modify the
    presentation and disclosure of

other-than-temporary

impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial
    statements. The adoption of FSP

FAS 115-2

and

FAS 124-2

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 did not have a material
    impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS 165, “Subsequent
    Events” (“SFAS 165”) which establishes
    accounting and disclosure requirements for events or
    transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before
    financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.
    SFAS 165 requires disclosure of the date through which the
    Company has evaluated subsequent events for recognition or
    disclosure. SFAS 165 also requires events that provide
    additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of
    the balance sheet and the related estimates to be recognized in
    the financial statements. Events that provide evidence about
    conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet
    but arose after the balance sheet date but before the financial
    statements are issued or available to be issued should not be
    recognized, but should be disclosed if material. The adoption of
    SFAS 165 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 did not have
    a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Disclosure
    About Foreign Currency Risk

Although the majority of our transactions are in
    U.S. dollars, some transactions are based in various
    foreign currencies. We purchase short-term, foreign exchange
    contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange
    fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities and
    commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated
    in foreign currencies. The purpose of entering into these hedge
    transactions is to minimize the impact



of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations.
    The contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months. We do
    not purchase short-term foreign exchange contracts for trading
    purposes. Currently, we focus on hedging our foreign currency
    risk related to the Thai Baht, Malaysian Ringgit, Euro and the
    British Pound Sterling. Malaysian Ringgit contracts are
    designated as cash flow hedges. Euro and British Pound Sterling
    contracts are designated as fair value hedges. Thai Baht
    contracts are designated as both cash flow and fair value
    hedges. See Part II, Item 8, Note 1 in the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

As of July 3, 2009, we had outstanding the following
    purchased foreign exchange contracts (in millions, except
    weighted average contract rate):

Disclosure
    About Other Market Risks

Variable
    Interest Rate Risk

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate
    equal to, at the option of WDTI, either (a) a LIBOR rate
    determined by reference to the cost of funds for Eurodollar
    deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing,
    adjusted for certain additional costs (the “Eurocurrency
    Rate”); or (b) a base rate determined by reference to
    the higher of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and
    (ii) the prime rate as announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank,
    N.A. (the “Base Rate”); in each case plus an
    applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under
    the term loan facility ranges from 1.25% to 1.50% with respect
    to borrowings at the Eurocurrency Rate and 0.0% to 0.125% with
    respect to borrowings at the Base Rate. The applicable margin
    for revolving loan borrowings under the revolving credit
    facility ranges from 0.8% to 1.125% with respect to borrowings
    at the Eurocurrency Rate and 0.0% to 0.125% with respect to
    borrowings at the Base Rate. The applicable margins for
    borrowings under the Credit Facility are determined based upon a
    leverage ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries calculated on
    a consolidated basis. If the federal funds rate, prime rate or
    LIBOR rate increases, our interest payments could also increase.
    A one percent increase in the variable rate of interest on the
    Credit Facility would increase interest expense by approximately
    $5 million annually.

Credit
    Market Risk

Our long-term investments consist of auction-rate securities
    totaling $18 million as of July 3, 2009. The negative
    conditions in the global credit markets have prevented us from
    liquidating some of our holdings of auction rate securities
    because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded
    the amount of purchase orders for such securities. If the credit
    markets do not improve, auctions for our invested amounts may
    continue to fail. If this occurs, we may be unable to liquidate
    some or all of our auction-rate securities at par should we need
    or desire to access the funds invested in those securities prior
    to maturity of the underlying assets. In the event we need or
    desire to access these funds, we will not be able to do so until
    a future auction on these investments is successful or a buyer
    is found outside the auction process. If a buyer is found but is
    unwilling to purchase the investments at par, we may incur a
    loss. The market values of some of the auction-rate securities
    we owned were impacted by the macroeconomic credit market
    conditions. Rating downgrades of the security issuer or the
    third-parties insuring such investments may require us to adjust
    the carrying value of these investments through an impairment
    charge. Based on our ability to access our cash, cash
    equivalents and cash generated from operations, we do not
    anticipate these investments will affect our ability to execute
    our current business plan.

REPORT
    OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors

Western Digital Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries as of July 3,
    2009 and June 27, 2008, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, shareholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended July 3, 2009. In connection
    with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we
    have also audited the related financial statement schedule.
    These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    July 3, 2009 and June 27, 2008, and the results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended July 3, 2009, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
    in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries’ internal
    control over financial reporting as of July 3, 2009, based
    on criteria established in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report
    dated August 13, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

REPORT
    OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors

Western Digital Corporation:

We have audited Western Digital Corporation and
    subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as
    of July 3, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
    The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of July 3, 2009, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Western Digital Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of July 3, 2009 and June 27, 2008, the
    related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’
    equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended July 3, 2009, and the
    related financial statement schedule, and our report dated
    August 13, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule.

WESTERN

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.

Organization
    and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Western Digital Corporation (the “Company” or
    “Western Digital” or “WD”) designs,
    develops, manufactures and sells hard drives. A hard drive is a
    device that stores data on one or more rotating magnetic media
    to allow fast access to data. The Company sells its products
    worldwide to original equipment manufacturers and original
    design manufacturers for use in computer systems, subsystems or
    CE devices, and to distributors, resellers and retailers. The
    Company’s hard drives are used in desktop computers,
    notebook computers, external storage appliances, enterprise
    applications such as servers, workstations, network attached
    storage, storage area networks and video surveillance equipment
    and in consumer electronics products such as digital video
    recorders and satellite and cable set-top boxes.

The Company also designs, develops, manufactures and sells
    solid-state drives and media players. A solid-state drive is a
    storage device that uses semiconductor, non-volatile media,
    rather than magnetic disks and magnetic heads, to store and
    allow fast access to data. The Company sells its solid-state
    drives worldwide to OEMs and distributors for use in the
    embedded systems market which includes network-communications,
    industrial, embedded-computing, medical, military, aerospace,
    media-appliance and data-streaming applications. A media player
    is a device that connects to a user’s television or home
    theater system and plays digital movies, music and photos from
    any of the Company’s
    WD

®

-branded

    external hard drives or other USB mass storage devices. The
    Company sells its media players worldwide to resellers and
    retailers under the
    WD

®

brand.

The Company has prepared its consolidated financial statements
    in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and has adopted
    accounting policies and practices which are generally accepted
    in the industry in which it operates. The Company’s
    significant accounting policies are summarized below.

Fiscal
    Year

The Company has a 52 or 53-week fiscal year. The 2009 fiscal
    year which ended on July 3, 2009 consisted of
    53 weeks. The 2008 and 2007 fiscal years, which ended on
    June 27, 2008 and June 29, 2007, respectively,
    consisted of 52 weeks each.

Basis of
    Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
    intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
    consolidation. The accounts of foreign subsidiaries have been
    remeasured using the U.S. dollar as the functional
    currency. As such, gains or losses resulting from remeasurement
    of these accounts from local currencies into U.S. dollars
    are reflected in the results of operations. These gains and
    losses were immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.

On March 27, 2009, the Company completed its acquisition of
    SiliconSystems, Inc. (“SiliconSystems”). On
    September 5, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of
    Komag, Inc. (“Komag”). The acquisitions are further
    described in Note 14 below. The results of operations of
    SiliconSystems and Komag since the dates of their acquisitions
    are included in the consolidated financial statements. The
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
    Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including
    SiliconSystems and Komag. All significant inter-company accounts
    and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

The Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid
    investments in money market funds, U.S. Treasury
    securities, and U.S. Government agency securities with
    original maturities of three months or less.

Investments

The Company’s investments consist primarily of auction-rate
    securities, which are primarily investments in insurance
    products with original maturities greater than three months. The
    Company has classified these investments as



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

“available for sale” securities under Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115
    “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
    Securities” and they are carried at fair value.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
    receivable, investments, accounts payable and accrued expenses
    approximate fair value for all periods presented because of the
    short-term maturity of these assets and liabilities or, in the
    case of investments, these are recorded using appropriate market
    information. The carrying amount of debt approximates fair value
    because of its variable interest rate.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company sells its products to computer manufacturers,
    resellers and retailers throughout the world. The Company
    performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’
    financial condition and generally requires no collateral. The
    Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses, and
    such losses have historically been within management’s
    expectations. At any given point in time, the total amount
    outstanding from any one of a number of its customers may be
    individually significant to the Company’s financial
    results. At July 3, 2009 and June 27, 2008, the
    Company had reserves for potential credit losses of
    $14 million and $8 million, respectively, and net
    accounts receivable of $926 million and $1.0 billion,
    respectively. The Company also has cash equivalent and
    investment policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to
    any one financial institution or investment instrument and
    requires that investments be made only with financial
    institutions or in investment instruments evaluated as highly
    credit-worthy.

Inventory
    Valuation

The Company values inventory at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first out and weighted average methods) or net realizable value.
    The

first-in,

first-out method is used to value the cost of the majority of
    the Company’s inventories, while the weighted-average
    method is used to value precious metal inventories.
    Weighted-average cost is calculated based upon the cost of
    precious metals at the time they are received by the Company.
    The Company has determined that it is not practicable to assign
    specific costs to individual units of precious metals and, as
    such, precious metals are relieved from inventory based on the
    weighted-average cost of the inventory at the time the inventory
    is used in production. The weighted average method of valuing
    precious metals does not materially differ from a

first-in,

first-out method. As of July 3, 2009 and June 27,
    2008, 82% and 78%, respectively, of the inventory was valued
    using the FIFO method with the remainder valued using the
    weighted average method. Inventory write-downs are recorded for
    the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net
    realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of
    future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory
    balances.

The Company evaluates inventory balances for excess quantities
    and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated
    demand, inventory on hand, sales levels and other information,
    and reduces inventory balances to net realizable value for
    excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis.
    Unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could
    result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products,
    which may require a write down of inventory that could
    negatively affect operating results.

Property
    and Equipment

The cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the
    estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The
    Company’s buildings are being depreciated over periods
    ranging from fifteen to thirty years. The majority of the
    Company’s equipment is being depreciated over periods of
    three to seven years. Depreciation is computed on a
    straight-line basis. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
    the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the
    related lease terms.



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Goodwill
    and Other Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business
    Combinations” (“SFAS 141”), the total
    purchase price in a business combination is allocated to the
    fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
    their fair values at the acquisition date, with amounts
    exceeding the fair values being recorded as goodwill. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets”, goodwill is not amortized. Instead, it
    is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    goodwill may be impaired. The Company did not record any
    impairment of goodwill during 2009.

Other intangible assets consist of technology acquired in
    business combinations. Acquired intangibles are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful
    lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets” (“SFAS 144”), long-lived assets are
    tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be
    recoverable. The Company recorded impairments to certain
    long-lived assets during 2009. See Note 13.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC Staff
    Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104,
    “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements”
    (“SAB No. 104”). Under
    SAB No. 104, revenue is recognized when the title and
    risk of loss have passed to the customer, there is persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, or services
    have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
    collectability is reasonably assured. The Company establishes
    provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated
    sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is
    recognized based on existing product return notifications. If
    actual sales returns exceed expectations, an increase in the
    sales return accrual would be required, which could negatively
    affect operating results.

In accordance with standard industry practice, the Company
    provides resellers with limited price protection for inventories
    held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions
    and other sales incentive programs. In accordance with current
    accounting standards, the Company recognizes revenue upon
    delivery to OEMs, ODMs and resellers and records a reduction of
    revenue for estimated price protection and other programs in
    effect until the resellers sell such inventory to their
    customers. The Company bases these adjustments on several
    factors, including anticipated price decreases during the
    reseller holding period, reseller’s sell-through and
    inventory levels, estimated amounts to be reimbursed to
    qualifying customers, historical pricing information and
    customer claim processing. If customer demand for hard drives or
    market conditions differ from the Company’s expectations,
    the Company’s operating results could be affected. The
    Company also has programs under which it reimburses qualified
    distributors and retailers for certain marketing expenditures
    which are recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company
    applies the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force

No. 01-9,

“Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
    Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s
    Products),” and such sales incentive and marketing programs
    are recorded as a reduction of revenue.

The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts by
    analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of
    loss based on insolvency, disputes or other collection issues.
    In addition, the Company routinely analyzes the different
    receivable aging categories and establishes reserves based on a
    combination of past due receivables and expected future losses
    based primarily on its historical levels of bad debt losses. If
    the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates
    resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due, or if
    the Company’s overall loss history changes significantly,
    an adjustment in the Company’s allowance for doubtful
    accounts would be required, which could affect operating results.

Warranty

The Company records an accrual for estimated warranty costs when
    revenue is recognized. The Company generally warrants its
    products for a period of one to five years. The warranty
    provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends,
    estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for
    customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues,
    if any. A statistical warranty tracking model is used to help
    with estimates and assists in exercising



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

judgment in determining the underlying estimates. The
    statistical tracking model captures specific detail on hard
    drive reliability, such as factory test data, historical field
    return rates, and costs to repair by product type. If actual
    product return trends, costs to repair returned products or
    costs of customer compensatory claims differ significantly from
    estimates, future results of operations could be materially
    affected. Also, during a period of declining revenue, the
    percentage of warranty utilization to revenue may increase.
    Management’s judgment is subject to a greater degree of
    subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because
    of limited field experience with those products upon which to
    base warranty estimates. Management reviews the warranty accrual
    quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are
    still under warranty. Any changes in the estimates underlying
    the accrual may result in adjustments that impact current period
    gross margin and income. Such changes are generally a result of
    differences between forecasted and actual return rate experience
    and costs to repair.

Advertising
    Expense

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Selling, general and
    administrative expenses of the Company include advertising costs
    of $5 million, $3 million and $5 million in 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Income
    Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and
    liability method, which provides that deferred tax assets and
    liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the
    financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and
    liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating
    loss (“NOL”) and tax credit carryforwards. The Company
    records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not
    that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Each period,
    the Company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance for its
    deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowance so that
    the Company records net deferred tax assets only to the extent
    that it has concluded it is more likely than not that these
    deferred tax assets will be realized.

The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions
    based on the two-step process prescribed in FASB Interpretation
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement No. 109”
    (“FIN 48”). To the extent a tax position does not
    meet a more-likely-than-not level of certainty, no benefit is
    recognized in the financial statements. If a position meets the

more-likely-than-not

level of certainty, it is recognized in the financial statements
    at the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of
    being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties
    related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on
    liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are
    recorded in the provision for income taxes. The actual liability
    for unrealized tax benefit in any such contingency may be
    materially different from the Company’s estimates, which
    could result in the need to record additional liabilities for
    unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previously
    recorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits.

Income
    per Common Share

The Company computes basic income per common share using net
    income and the weighted average number of common shares
    outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is
    computed using net income and the weighted average number of
    common shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding
    during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares include
    certain dilutive outstanding employee stock options, rights to
    purchase shares of common stock under our Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) and restricted stock and stock
    unit awards.

For purposes of computing diluted income per common share,
    common share equivalents with an exercise price that exceeded
    the average fair market value of common stock for the period are
    considered anti-dilutive and have been excluded from the
    calculation.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company accounts for all stock-based compensation in
    accordance with the fair value recognition provisions in
    SFAS No. 123(R). Under the fair value recognition
    provisions of SFAS 123(R), stock-based compensation cost is
    measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and
    is recognized as expense over the vesting period. The fair
    values of all stock options granted are estimated using a
    binomial model, and the fair values of all ESPP purchase rights
    are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing
    model. Both the binomial and the Black-Scholes-Merton models
    require the input of highly subjective assumptions. Under
    SFAS 123(R), the Company is required to use judgment in
    estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to
    be forfeited. If actual forfeitures differ significantly from
    the original estimate, stock-based compensation expense and the
    results of operations could be materially impacted.

Other
    Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to revenue, expenses,
    gains and losses that are recorded as an element of
    shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net income. The
    Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of
    unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts.

Foreign
    Exchange Contracts

Although the majority of the Company’s transactions are in
    U.S. dollars, some transactions are based in various
    foreign currencies. The Company purchases short-term, forward
    exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency
    fluctuations on certain underlying assets, revenue, liabilities
    and commitments for operating expenses and product costs
    denominated in foreign currencies. The contracts have maturity
    dates that do not exceed 12 months. The Company does not
    purchase short-term forward exchange contracts for trading
    purposes.

The Company applies the provisions of SFAS No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities” (“SFAS 133”), as amended, which
    establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
    instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging
    activities. The Company had outstanding forward exchange
    contracts with



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

commercial banks for Thai Baht, Malaysian Ringgit, British Pound
    Sterling and Euro with values of $583 million and
    $1.3 billion at July 3, 2009 and June 27, 2008,
    respectively. Malaysian Ringgit contracts are designated as cash
    flow hedges. Euro and British Pound Sterling contracts are
    designated as fair value hedges. Thai Baht contracts are
    designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges.

If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the
    effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative
    is initially deferred in other comprehensive income (loss), net
    of tax. These amounts are subsequently recognized into earnings
    when the underlying cash flow being hedged is recognized into
    earnings. Recognized gains and losses on foreign exchange
    contracts entered into for manufacturing related activities are
    reported in cost of revenues. Hedge effectiveness is measured by
    comparing the hedging instrument’s cumulative change in
    fair value from inception to maturity to the underlying
    exposure’s terminal value. The Company has determined that
    all of its cash flow hedging instruments for all years presented
    were effective as defined under SFAS 133.

A change in the fair value of fair value hedges is recognized in
    earnings in the period incurred and is reported as a component
    of operating expenses. All fair value hedges were determined to
    be effective as defined under SFAS 133. Changes in fair
    value on these contracts were not material to the consolidated
    financial statements for all years presented.

Use of
    Estimates

Company management has made estimates and assumptions relating
    to the reporting of certain assets and liabilities in conformity
    with U.S. GAAP. These estimates and assumptions have been
    applied using methodologies which are consistent throughout the
    periods presented. However, actual results could differ from
    these estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
    the current year presentation.

Subsequent
    Events

The Company evaluated subsequent events through August 13,
    2009, the date these financial statements were issued, and there
    were no material subsequent events that required recognition or
    additional disclosure in these financial statements.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS 157, “Fair Value
    Measurement” (“SFAS 157”), which establishes
    a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurement. In February
    2008, FASB issued FASB Staff Position

157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement 157”

(“FSP 157-2”),

which delayed the effective date of SFAS 157 for all
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those
    that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis, until fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2008 and interim periods within those
    years, which for the Company is the first quarter of fiscal
    2010. The partial adoption of SFAS 157 for financial assets
    and financial liabilities in the Company’s first quarter of
    fiscal 2009 did not have a material impact on its consolidated
    financial statements. See Note 10. The Company is currently
    evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on
    the non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities in its
    consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159
    permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and
    financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses
    on items for which the fair value option has been elected are
    reported in earnings. The Company chose not to elect the fair
    value option for eligible items, and accordingly, the adoption
    of SFAS 159 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 had no
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS 141(R)”). SFAS 141(R) establishes
    principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business
    recognizes and measures in its financial



WESTERN

NOTES TO

statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
    assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree.
    SFAS 141(R) also provides guidance for recognizing and
    measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a
    gain from a bargain purchase and determines what information to
    disclose to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the
    nature and financial effects of the business combination.
    SFAS 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations
    for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of
    the first annual reporting period beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008, which for the Company is the first
    quarter of fiscal 2010. SFAS 141(R) will impact the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements for business
    combinations with an acquisition date on or after adoption in
    the first quarter of fiscal 2010.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”
    (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 updates guidance
    regarding disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and
    hedging activities. The adoption of SFAS 161 in the
    Company’s third quarter of fiscal 2009 did not have a
    material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets” (“FSP

FAS 142-3”),

which amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
    life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB Statement
    No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”.
    FSP

FAS 142-3

is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008, which for the Company is the first
    quarter of fiscal year 2010. The Company is currently evaluating
    the impact the adoption of FSP

FAS 142-3

will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 107-1

and ABP

28-1,

“Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments” (“FSP

FAS 107-1

and ABP

28-1”),

which amends SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about
    Fair Value of Financial Instruments”, and ABP Opinion
    No. 28, “Interim Financial Reporting”, to require
    disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim
    and annual reporting periods. FSP

FAS 107-1

and ABP

28-1

is effective for interim reporting periods ending after
    June 15, 2009, which for the Company is the first quarter
    of fiscal 2010.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 115-2

and

FAS 124-2,

“Recognition and Presentation of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairments” (“FSP

FAS 115-2

and

FAS 124-2”),

which amends the

other-than-temporary

impairment guidance in U.S. GAAP for debt securities to
    make the guidance more operational and to modify the
    presentation and disclosure of

other-than-temporary

impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial
    statements. The adoption of FSP

FAS 115-2

and

FAS 124-2

in the Company’s fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 did not have
    a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS 165, “Subsequent
    Events” (“SFAS 165”), which establishes
    accounting and disclosure requirements for events or
    transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before
    financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.
    SFAS 165 requires disclosure of the date through which the
    Company has evaluated subsequent events for recognition or
    disclosure. SFAS 165 also requires events that provide
    additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of
    the balance sheet and the related estimates to be recognized in
    the financial statements. Events that provide evidence about
    conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet
    but arose after the balance sheet date but before the financial
    statements are issued or available to be issued should not be
    recognized, but should be disclosed if material. The adoption of
    SFAS 165 in the Company’s fourth quarter of fiscal
    2009 did not have a material impact on its consolidated
    financial statements.

Credit
    Facility

In February 2008, Western Digital Technologies, Inc.
    (“WDTI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
    entered into a five-year Credit Agreement (“Credit
    Facility”) that provides for a $750 million unsecured
    loan consisting of a $500 million term loan facility and a
    $250 million revolving credit facility. The revolving
    credit facility includes borrowing capacity available for
    letters of credit and for short-term borrowings referred to as
    swingline. In addition, WDTI may elect to expand the Credit
    Facility by up to $250 million if existing or new lenders
    provide additional term or revolving commitments. The
    $500 million term loan had a variable interest rate of
    1.63% as of July 3, 2009 and requires sixteen quarterly
    principal payments, that began in June 2009, of approximately
    $19 million, $25 million, $31 million and
    $50 million per quarter for each four quarter increment.
    The Credit Facility requires WDTI to comply with a leverage
    ratio and an interest coverage ratio calculated on a
    consolidated basis for the Company and its subsidiaries.

In addition, the Credit Facility contains customary covenants,
    including covenants that limit or restrict WDTI’s and its
    subsidiaries’ ability to: incur liens, incur indebtedness,
    make certain restricted payments, merge or consolidate and enter
    into certain speculative hedging arrangements. As of

Legal
    Proceedings

In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to
    legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. Although the
    ultimate aggregate amount of probable monetary liability or
    financial impact with respect to these matters is subject to
    many uncertainties and is therefore not predictable with
    assurance, management believes that any monetary liability or
    financial impact to the Company from these matters or the
    specified matters below, individually and in the aggregate would
    not be material to the Company’s financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flows. However, there can be no
    assurance with respect to such result, and monetary liability or
    financial impact to the Company from these legal proceedings,
    lawsuits and other claims could differ materially from those
    projected.

On June 20, 2008, plaintiff Convolve, Inc.
    (“Convolve”) filed a complaint in the Eastern District
    of Texas against the Company and two other companies for patent
    infringement alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos.
    6,314,473 and 4,916,635. Plaintiff is seeking unspecified
    monetary damages and injunctive relief. On October 10,
    2008, Convolve amended its complaint to allege infringement of
    only the ’473 patent. The ’473 patent allegedly
    relates to interface technology to select between certain modes
    of a disk drive’s operations relating to speed and noise.
    The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter.

On December 8, 2008, plaintiffs MagSil Corporation and the
    Massachusetts Institute of Technology filed a complaint in the
    District of Delaware against the Company and seven other
    companies in the disk drive industry alleging infringement of
    U.S. Patent Nos. 5,629,922 and 5,835,314. Plaintiffs are
    seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. The
    asserted patents allegedly relate to tunneling magnetoresistive
    technology. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in
    this matter.

On March 20, 2009, plaintiff Ghazala H. Durrani, a former
    employee of the Company, filed a putative class action complaint
    in the Alameda County (California) Superior Court. The complaint
    alleges that certain of the Company’s engineers have been
    misclassified as exempt employees under California state law and
    are, therefore, due unpaid hourly overtime wages and other
    amounts, as well as penalties for allegedly missed meal and rest
    periods. By court order dated April 24, 2009, the case was
    transferred to the Orange County (California) Superior Court,
    where it is now pending. On or about June 16, 2009, the
    Company was dismissed from the case without prejudice by
    stipulation, leaving WDTI as the sole remaining defendant. On or
    about June 4, 2009, WDTI filed its Answer to the Complaint,
    denying the substantive allegations thereof and raising several
    affirmative defenses. The case is in the preliminary stages,
    with no formal discovery having occurred. A court hearing on
    whether the case should be certified as a class action will
    likely not occur until late calendar 2009 at the earliest. If
    the Company is unsuccessful in its defense of this matter,
    potential liability could include unpaid wages, interest,
    penalties, attorneys’ fees and costs. The Company intends
    to defend itself vigorously in this matter.

On April 7, 2009, plaintiff Gregory Bender filed a
    complaint in the Northern District of California against the
    Company and Seagate Technology LLC alleging infringement of
    U.S. Patent No. 5,103,188. Plaintiff is seeking
    unspecified monetary damages. The asserted patent allegedly
    relates to buffered transconductance amplifier technology. The
    Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter.

On July 15, 2009, plaintiffs Carl B. Collins and Farzin
    Davanloo filed a complaint in the Eastern District of Texas
    against the Company and ten other companies alleging
    infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,411,797 and 5,478,650.
    Plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief and unspecified
    monetary damages, fees, and costs. The asserted patents
    allegedly relate to nanophase diamond films. The Company intends
    to defend itself vigorously in this matter.

Western
    Digital Corporation 401(k) Plan

The Company has adopted the Western Digital Corporation 401(k)
    Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan covers substantially all
    domestic employees, subject to certain eligibility requirements.
    The Company matches 50% of the first 5% of each
    participant’s pre-tax contribution, provided, however, that
    each eligible participant shall receive a minimum annual basic
    matching contribution equal to 50% of the first $4,000 of
    pre-tax contributions for any calendar year. Company
    contributions vest over a

5-year

period of employment. For 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company made
    Plan contributions of $7 million, $4 million, and
    $4 million, respectively.

Shareholders’
    Equity

Stock
    Incentive Plans

The Company maintains four stock-based incentive plans
    (collectively referred to as the “Stock Plans”): The
    amended and restated 2004 Performance Incentive Plan, the
    Employee Stock Option Plan, the Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan
    and the Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Subsequent
    to the expiration of the Employee Stock Option Plan on
    November 10, 2004 and approval of the 2004 Performance
    Incentive Plan by the Company’s shareholders on
    November 18, 2004, no new awards may be granted under the
    Employee Stock Option Plan, the Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan
    or the Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors
    (collectively referred to as the “Prior Stock Plans”).
    As of July 3, 2009, options to purchase 3.0 million
    shares of the Company’s common stock remain outstanding and
    exercisable under the Prior Stock Plans. Options granted under
    the Prior Stock Plans vested over periods from one to four
    years. Options granted under the Prior Stock Plans expire either
    five or ten years from the date of grant. There are no
    outstanding restricted stock awards under the Prior Stock Plans.



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In November 2004, the Company’s shareholders approved the
    2004 Performance Incentive Plan. The types of awards that may be
    granted under the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan include stock
    options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock
    bonuses and other forms of awards granted or denominated in the
    Company’s common stock or units of the Company’s
    common stock, as well as cash bonus awards. Persons eligible to
    receive awards under the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan include
    officers or employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
    directors of the Company and certain consultants and advisors to
    the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The vesting of awards
    under the Performance Incentive Plan is determined at the date
    of grant. Each award expires on a date determined at the date of
    grant; however, the maximum term of options, stock appreciation
    rights and other rights to acquire common stock under the 2004
    Performance Incentive Plan is ten years after the grant date of
    the award.

As of July 3, 2009, the maximum number of shares of the
    Company’s common stock that was authorized for award grants
    under the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan is 22.7 million
    shares. Any shares subject to awards under the Prior Stock Plans
    that are canceled, forfeited or otherwise terminate without
    having vested or been exercised, as applicable, will become
    available for other award grants under the 2004 Performance
    Incentive Plan. The 2004 Performance Incentive Plan will
    terminate on September 20, 2014 unless terminated earlier
    by the Company’s Board of Directors.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

During 2006, the Company adopted the ESPP whereby eligible
    employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their
    eligible compensation to purchase shares of the Company’s
    common stock at 95% of the fair market value of common stock on
    either the date of grant or on the exercise date, whichever is
    less. The date of grant of each offering period is
    June 1st or December 1st, except for the initial
    offering period, which began on December 15, 2005. Each
    offering period is 24 months and consists of four exercise
    dates. If the fair market value of the common stock is less on a
    given exercise date than on the date of grant, employee
    participation in that offering period is terminated and
    re-enrollment in the new offering period occurs automatically.
    The Company’s ESPP operates in accordance with
    Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.

Stock-Based
    Compensation Expense

Effective July 2, 2005, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123(R)”), using the modified prospective
    method. SFAS 123(R) establishes the financial accounting
    and reporting standards for stock-based compensation plans. As
    required by SFAS 123(R), the Company recognized the cost
    resulting from all share-based payment transactions including
    shares issued under the Company’s stock option plans and
    ESPP in the financial statements. The Company expensed
    $24 million, $18 million and $18 million related
    to stock-based compensation from stock options and ESPP purchase
    rights in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of July 3,
    2009, total compensation cost related to unvested stock options
    granted to employees and ESPP shares, but not yet recognized,
    was $58 million and will be amortized on a straight-line
    basis over a weighted average period of approximately
    2.46 years.

The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated based on the

    and the quoted price of the Company’s common stock for
    those awards that have an exercise price below the quoted price
    on the date the intrinsic value is determined. As of
    July 3, 2009, the Company had options outstanding to
    purchase an aggregate of 10.5 million shares with an
    exercise price below the quoted price of the Company’s
    stock on that date resulting in an aggregate intrinsic value of
    $105 million. During 2009 and 2008, the aggregate intrinsic
    value of options exercised under the Company’s stock option
    plans was $8 million and $76 million, respectively,
    determined as of the date of exercise.

    during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which are payable in
    an equal number of shares of the Company’s common stock at
    the time of vesting of the units. Restricted stock unit awards
    vest over periods ranging from one to five years from the date
    of grant. The aggregate market value of the shares underlying
    the restricted stock units at the date of grant was
    $19 million,

$23 million and $36 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. These amounts have been recorded as deferred
    compensation and are being amortized to expense over the
    corresponding vesting periods. For purposes of valuing these
    awards, the Company has assumed a forfeiture rate of zero based
    on a historical analysis indicating minimal forfeitures for
    these types of awards. The Company charged to expense
    $23 million, $19 million and $30 million related
    to restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards that were
    vested during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of
    July 3, 2009, the aggregate unamortized fair value of all

Fair
    Value Disclosure — Binomial Model

The fair value of stock options granted during 2009, 2008 and
    2007 was estimated using a binomial option pricing model. The
    binomial model requires the input of highly subjective
    assumptions including the expected stock price volatility, the
    expected price multiple at which employees are likely to
    exercise stock options and the expected employee termination
    rate. The Company uses historical data to estimate option
    exercise, employee termination, and expected stock price
    volatility within the binomial model. The risk-free rate for
    periods within the contractual life of the option is based on
    the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of
    grant.

The fair value of stock options granted during the three years
    ended July 3, 2009 was estimated using the following
    weighted average assumptions:

The fair value of ESPP purchase rights issued is estimated at

    developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
    that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
    The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model requires the input
    of highly subjective assumptions such as the expected stock
    price volatility and the expected period until options are
    exercised.

Stock
    Repurchase Program

The Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
    of $750 million of the Company’s common stock in open
    market transactions through March 31, 2013. During 2009,
    the Company repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock
    at a total cost of $36 million. Since the inception of this
    stock repurchase program in 2005, the Company has repurchased
    18 million shares for a total cost of $284 million
    (including commissions). Stock repurchases are to be funded
    principally by operating cash flows. The Company may continue to
    repurchase common stock as it deems appropriate and market
    conditions allow.

Stock
    Purchase Rights

In 1989, the Company implemented a plan to protect
    shareholders’ rights in the event of a proposed takeover of
    the Company. Under the plan, each share of the Company’s
    outstanding common stock carried one Right to Purchase
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the
    “Right”). The Right enabled the holder, under certain
    circumstances, to purchase common stock of Western Digital or of
    an acquiring company at a substantially discounted price ten
    days after a person or group publicly announces it has acquired
    or has tendered an offer for 15% or more of the Company’s
    outstanding common stock. On September 10, 1998, the
    Company’s Board of Directors approved the adoption of a new
    Rights plan to replace the previous plan, which expired in
    September 1998. The Rights under the 1998 plan were similar to
    the rights under the 1989 plan except they were redeemable by
    the Company at $.01 per Right and expired in 2008. In connection
    with the establishment of a holding company structure on
    April 6, 2001, the Company terminated the Rights under the
    1998 plan and adopted a new Rights plan. The 2001 plan is
    similar to the terminated 1998 plan, except that the exercise
    price was reduced from $150.00 to $50.00 per share and the
    expiration date for the 2001 Rights plan was extended to April
    2011.

Remaining net undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries
    at July 3, 2009 on which no U.S. tax has been provided

    requirements. Accordingly, an additional U.S. tax provision
    has not been made on these earnings. The tax liability for these
    earnings would approximate $950 million if the Company

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In addition to the deferred tax assets presented above, the
    Company had additional NOL benefits related to stock-based
    compensation deductions of approximately $76 million and
    $43 million at July 3, 2009 and June 27, 2008,
    respectively. The increase in NOL benefits relates to the
    current year stock based compensation deductions which will
    result in a future benefit of $9 million and a reduction in
    the estimate of the prior year NOL utilization related to stock
    based compensation of $24 million. In accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS 123(R), this $76 million will be
    recorded as a credit to shareholders equity when an incremental
    benefit is recognized after considering all other tax attributes
    available to the Company.

As of the end of fiscal 2007, the Company determined that it is
    more likely than not that its net deferred tax assets will be
    realized. Accordingly, the Company eliminated its remaining
    valuation allowance which resulted in the recognition of
    additional net deferred tax assets of $125 million. The
    realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on
    the Company’s ability to generate sufficient earnings in
    certain jurisdictions in future years. The Company released the
    remainder of the valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets
    based on the weight of available evidence including the history
    of cumulative pretax income and the increased likelihood of the
    Company’s ability to generate profits in the future. The
    amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable may increase
    or decrease in subsequent periods based on fluctuating industry
    or Company conditions.

Tax
    Holidays and Carryforwards

A substantial portion of the Company’s manufacturing
    operations in Malaysia and Thailand operate under various tax
    holidays and tax incentive programs which will expire in whole
    or in part at various dates through 2022. Certain of the
    holidays may be extended if specific conditions are met. The net
    impact of these tax holidays and tax incentives was to increase
    the Company’s net earnings by $241 million ($1.07 per
    diluted share), $391 million ($1.73 per diluted share) and
    $86 million ($0.38 per diluted share) in 2009, 2008, and
    2007, respectively.

As of July 3, 2009, the Company had federal and state NOL
    carryforwards of approximately $280 million and
    $73 million, respectively. In addition, the Company had
    various federal and state tax credit carryforwards of
    approximately $216 million combined. The loss carryforwards
    available to offset future federal and state taxable income
    expire at various dates from 2020 to 2029 and 2015 to 2019,
    respectively. Approximately $90 million of the credit
    carryforwards available to offset future taxable income expire
    at various dates from 2010 to 2028. The remaining amount is
    available indefinitely. NOLs and credits relating to Komag,
    Inc., which was acquired by the Company on September 5,
    2007 (“Komag”), are subject to limitations under
    Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code. The
    Company does not expect these limitations to result in a
    reduction in the total amount of NOLs and credits ultimately
    realized.

Adoption
    of FIN 48

Effective as of June 30, 2007, the Company adopted the
    provisions of FIN 48. FIN 48 contains a two-step
    approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions
    accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes.” First, the tax position
    is evaluated for recognition by determining if it is more likely
    than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including
    resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
    If the tax position is deemed “more-likely-than-not”
    to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine
    the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial
    statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is
    the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of
    being realized upon ultimate settlement.

The adoption of FIN 48 at the beginning of fiscal year 2008
    did not result in an adjustment for unrecognized tax benefits.
    The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the
    date of adoption was $58 million which had previously been
    presented as a reduction to deferred tax assets of
    $47 million and an inclusion in other long term liabilities
    of $11 million as of June 29, 2007. With the exception
    of certain unrecognized tax benefits that are directly
    associated with the tax position taken, unrecognized tax
    benefits are presented gross in the Company’s balance
    sheet. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
    benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain
    tax positions and are recorded in the provision for income
    taxes. As of the date of adoption of FIN 48, and at
    July 3, 2009, such interest and penalties were not material.

As of July 3, 2009 the Company had approximately
    $136 million of unrecognized tax benefits.

The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts
    of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended July 3,

The Company files U.S. federal, U.S. state, and
    foreign tax returns. For federal tax returns, the Company is
    subject to examination for fiscal years 2006 through 2009. For
    state returns, with few exceptions, the Company is subject to
    tax examinations for 2005 through 2009. In foreign
    jurisdictions, with few exceptions, the Company is subject to
    examination for all years subsequent to fiscal 2000. The Company
    is no longer subject to examination by the Internal Revenue
    Service (“IRS”) for periods prior to 2006 and by the
    state taxing authorities for periods prior to 2005, although
    carry forwards generated prior to those periods may still be
    adjusted upon examination by the IRS or state taxing authority
    if they either have been or will be used in a subsequent period.

The IRS has commenced an examination of the fiscal years ended
    2006 and 2007 for the Company and calendar years 2005 and 2006
    for Komag. Additionally, the Company’s French subsidiary is
    under examination by the local tax authorities for fiscal years
    2003 through 2005.

Due to the risk that audit outcomes and the timing of audit
    settlements are subject to significant uncertainty, the
    Company’s current estimate of the total amounts of
    unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease for all
    open tax years. As of July 3, 2009, it is not possible to
    estimate the amount of change, if any, in the unrecognized tax
    benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve
    months. Any significant change in the amount of the
    Company’s unrecognized tax benefits would most likely
    result from additional information or settlements relating to
    the Company’s tax examination of uncertain tax positions.

Fair
    Value Measurements

In the first quarter of 2009, the Company adopted SFAS 157
    for financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and
    reported at fair value at each reporting period. SFAS 157
    requires that fair value measurements be classified and
    disclosed in one of the following three categories:

Level 1.

Quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2.

Inputs other than Level 1
    that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as
    quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices
    in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are
    observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
    substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3.

Inputs that are unobservable for
    the asset or liability and that are significant to the fair
    value of the assets or liabilities.

The following table presents information about the
    Company’s financial assets that are measured at fair value
    on a recurring basis as of July 3, 2009, and indicates the
    fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to
    determine such value (in millions):

    U.S Treasury securities are classified within Level 2
    and are valued based on broker quotations using observable
    inputs. U.S. Government agency securities classified within
    Level 2 are valued based on broker quotations using
    observable inputs. Securities classified as Level 3 are
    valued using a third party pricing service. Foreign currency
    hedges are classified within Level 2 and valued based on
    the present value of future cash flows using market-based
    observable inputs, including forward rates and credit default
    swap rates.

Money Market Funds.

The Company’s money
    market funds are AAA rated institutional money market funds
    which are invested in U.S. Treasury securities and are
    recorded within cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated
    balance sheet.

U.S. Treasury Securities.

The
    Company’s U.S. Treasury securities are investments in
    Treasury bills with original maturities of three months or less
    and are recorded within cash and cash equivalents in the
    consolidated balance sheet.

U.S. Government Agency Securities.

    Company’s U.S. Government agency securities are fixed
    income securities sponsored by the U.S. Government of which
    $79 million have original maturities of three months or
    less and are recorded within cash and cash equivalents and
    $1 million are classified as

available-for-sale

securities and are recorded within other current assets in the
    consolidated balance sheet.

Auction-Rate Securities.

The Company’s
    auction-rate securities are primarily backed by insurance
    products and are expected to be held until secondary markets
    become available. As a result, they are classified as long-term
    investments.

    at fair value on a recurring basis at July 3, 2009.

Note 11.

Foreign
    Exchange Contracts

In the third quarter of 2009, the Company adopted SFAS 161.
    SFAS 161 amends and enhances the disclosure requirements of
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities”
    (“SFAS 133”), to provide information about how
    and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under
    SFAS 133 and its related interpretations, and how
    derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an
    entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash
    flows.

Although the majority of the Company’s transactions are in
    U.S. dollars, some transactions are based in various
    foreign currencies. The Company purchases short-term, foreign
    exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency
    exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets, revenue,
    liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product
    costs denominated in foreign currencies. The purpose of entering
    into these hedging transactions is to minimize the impact of
    foreign currency fluctuations on the Company’s results of
    operations. These contract maturity dates do not exceed
    12 months. All forward exchange contracts are for risk
    management purposes only. The Company does not purchase
    short-term forward exchange contracts for trading purposes.
    Currently, the Company focuses on hedging its foreign currency
    risk related to the Thai Baht, Malaysian Ringgit, Euro, and the
    British Pound Sterling. Malaysian Ringgit contracts are
    designated as cash flow hedges. Euro and British Pound Sterling
    contracts are designated as fair value hedges. Thai Baht
    contracts are designated as either cash flow or fair value
    hedges.

If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the
    effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative
    is initially deferred in other comprehensive income (loss), net
    of tax. These amounts are subsequently recognized into earnings
    when the underlying cash flow being hedged is recognized into
    earnings. As of July 3, 2009, the net amount of existing
    gains expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next
    twelve months was $2 million. The Company determined the
    ineffectiveness associated with its cash flow hedges to be
    immaterial.

A change in the fair value of fair value hedges is recognized in
    earnings in the period incurred and is reported as a component
    of operating expenses. All fair value hedges were determined to
    be effective as defined under SFAS 133. The fair value and the
    changes in fair value on these contracts were not material to
    the consolidated financial statements.

As of July 3, 2009, the Company does not have any foreign
    exchange contracts with credit-risk-related contingent features.
    The Company opened $1.4 billion, and closed
    $1.8 billion, in foreign exchange contracts for the year

Other
    Intangible Assets

Other intangible assets consist primarily of technology acquired
    in business combinations and amortized on a straight-line basis
    over the respective estimated useful lives of the assets. In
    2009, the Company acquired $24 million of intangibles as a
    result of the SiliconSystems acquisition and recorded a
    $5 million impairment charge related to a customer
    relationship intangible asset acquired from Komag. The net
    carrying value of intangible assets as of July 3, 2009 was
    $89 million. Accumulated amortization of intangibles was
    $35 million as of July 3, 2009. Intangible assets as

    per year for 2012, 2013 and 2014.

Note 13.

Restructuring
    and Sale of Facility

During December 2008, the Company’s second fiscal quarter,
    the Company announced a restructuring plan to realign its cost
    structure as a result of a softer demand environment. This plan
    was completed during the Company’s third and fourth fiscal
    quarters of 2009. This resulted in the closure of one of the
    Company’s hard drive manufacturing facilities in Thailand,
    the disposal of its media substrate manufacturing facility in
    Sarawak, Malaysia, and headcount reductions throughout the world
    of approximately 3,300 people. During the fourth fiscal
    quarter, the Company sold its media substrate manufacturing
    facility, and related assets, in Sarawak, Malaysia for net
    proceeds of approximately $29 million,



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

resulting in a gain of $18 million. The closure and
    disposal of the Company’s manufacturing facilities was to
    realign its manufacturing capacity with the Company’s
    expectations regarding demand at that time. Total restructuring
    charges of $112 million, partially offset by the
    $18 million gain on sale of assets, is included in
    Restructuring and other, net within operating expenses on the
    accompanying consolidated statements of income.

The asset impairment charge of $81 million consists of
    $76 million primarily related to the land, buildings,
    machinery and equipment at the manufacturing facilities in
    Thailand and Malaysia and $5 million related to a customer
    relationship intangible asset acquired from Komag. The
    impairment charge is based on the excess of the carrying values
    over the estimated fair values of the assets in accordance with
    SFAS 144. The fair values of the land, buildings, and
    equipment were estimated using the market approach. The
    intangible asset was valued using the income approach.

Note 14.

Acquisitions

SiliconSystems

On March 27, 2009, the Company completed its acquisition of
    SiliconSystems, a supplier of solid-state drives for the
    embedded systems market. The total acquisition cost of
    SiliconSystems was $66 million, consisting of
    $65 million in cash paid to SiliconSystems shareholders and
    $1 million of other direct acquisition costs. In accordance
    with SFAS 141, the Company has identified and recorded the
    assets, including specifically identifiable intangible assets,
    and liabilities assumed from SiliconSystems at their estimated
    fair values as of the date of acquisition, and has allocated the
    remaining value to goodwill. The values assigned to certain
    acquired assets and liabilities are preliminary, are based on
    information available as of July 3, 2009, and may be
    adjusted as further information becomes available during the
    allocation period of up to 12 months from the date of the
    acquisition. The allocation is as follows (in millions):

    In-process research and development of $14 million relates
    to projects that had not reached technological feasibility and
    had no alternative future use, and therefore, did not qualify
    for capitalization and was recorded as an operating expense
    during 2009 in the accompanying consolidated statements of
    income.

On September 5, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition
    of Komag, a media manufacturer, which was followed by a merger
    of State M, the Company’s indirect wholly-owned subsidiary,
    and Komag whereby Komag became an indirect wholly-owned
    subsidiary of the Company and changed its name to WD Media. The
    aggregate purchase price for Komag was $1.0 billion,
    consisting of cash paid for outstanding shares, transaction
    fees, severance and other employee-related equity payments.

The Company has identified and recorded the assets, including
    specifically identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities
    assumed from Komag at their estimated fair values as of the

In connection with the acquisition, the Company assumed
    $250 million face value of additional debt in the form of
    Convertible Subordinated Notes (the “Notes”) issued by
    Komag on March 28, 2007. The holders of the Notes tendered
    their Notes to the Company and on December 5, 2007, the

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As required by SEC

Rule 13a-15(b)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”), we carried out an evaluation, under
    the supervision and with the participation of our management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
    disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period
    covered by this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over
    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in
    reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
    and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable
    assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to
    permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts
    and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
    authorizations of our management and our directors; and
    (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
    of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial
    statements.

Our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework.

Based on this evaluation, our management
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm,
    which audited the consolidated financial statements included in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

has issued an audit report on our internal control over
    financial reporting. See page 52 herein.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended July 3,
    2009 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations of Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our
    Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure
    controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial
    reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control
    system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
    only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
    the control system are met. Further, the benefits of controls
    must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the
    inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
    controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
    and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These
    inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
    decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
    because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can
    be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
    collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
    the control. The design of any system of controls is also based
    in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
    events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
    succeed in achieving



its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because
    of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
    misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
    detected.
