PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

We are an industry-leading developer and manufacturer of storage
solutions that enable people to create, manage, experience and preserve digital content. We design and make storage devices and home entertainment products under the HGST, WD and G-Technology brands. Our principal products today are hard drives that
use one or more rotating magnetic disks (“magnetic media”) to store and allow fast access to data. Hard drives are today’s primary storage medium for digital content. Over the last 10 years, we have achieved consistent profitable
growth, with revenues up 19% and earnings per share up 16% on a compounded annual growth rate basis.

We believe we are well
positioned to capitalize on an important long-term secular growth trend — the ongoing expansion in digital data — which is linked directly to consumers’ and commercial enterprises’ increasingly ubiquitous experience with digital
data. We believe this growth will continue with total exabytes (“EB”) shipped growing from 600 EB in calendar 2012 to at least 5,900 EB by calendar 2020, representing a 34% compounded annual growth rate. We believe EB growth is the most
relevant measure of the growth potential for the industry and our company.

The growth in the global market for digital data
storage solutions is being driven by several factors including:

•

Proliferation of data

. The proliferation of consumer electronics, computing devices, social media and cloud-related infrastructure is driving
rapid growth in the creation, sharing and retention of high definition video, high resolution images, e-mail and big data files.

•

Evolution in data access and distribution.

Increasing demand for data access and distribution anytime and anywhere, facilitated by rapidly
improving network accessibility and higher bandwidth, is powering a dramatic increase in the need for data storage at both the local level and in the off-site, network-accessed or “cloud” level.

•

Advancements in storage devices

. Technological improvements in the capacity, size, performance, connectivity and power requirements of storage
devices continue to meet the demand for higher density and higher performance storage in increasingly diverse applications.

•

Rapid growth in consumers’ use

of mobile computing and storage and use of digital content in the home.

•

Adoption of tiered storage architectures

. With the significant increase in data storage demand, enterprises and Internet cloud providers have
adopted tiered storage architectures to improve storage performance and manage the costs of this growth. Tiered storage architecture optimizes data storage to the most appropriate storage device, driving increasing demand for high capacity and high
performance hard drives, as well as flash-based solid-state storage. Client PC providers are also adopting tiered storage with the deployment of dual drive configurations and solid-state hybrid drives.

We are a market and customer driven company, focused on growth, innovation and value creation for our customers, employees and
shareholders. We develop deep and collaborative relationships with customers, an approach that is being manifested in our role as a trusted advisor and market maker in all served markets. We believe this approach is one of the key factors that will
help us continue to achieve strong business performance. We believe our platform is powerful, with growth drivers and unique competitive advantages that will continue to provide us the opportunity to expand our value-creation model within an
evolving and growing storage market.

We operate our global business through two independent subsidiaries due to regulatory
requirements — HGST and WD, both long-time innovators in the storage industry. As of June 28, 2013, we had approximately 9,200 engineers and one of the industry’s largest patent portfolios with more than 6,000 active patents
worldwide.

Our headquarters are located in Irvine, California. WDC was founded in 1970 as a specialized semiconductor
manufacturer and since entering the storage industry in 1988, its WD subsidiary has been a technology standard-setter in the industry’s highest volume markets. HGST, known as Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Holdings Pte. Ltd. until shortly
before its acquisition by WDC (“the Acquisition”) in March 2012, was founded in 2003 through the combination of the hard drive businesses of International Business Machines Corporation, the inventor of the hard drive, and Hitachi, Ltd
(“Hitachi”). For a further description of our acquisition of HGST in March 2012, see Part II, Item 8, Note 14 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



HGST and WD have relationships with a full range of customers currently addressing storage
opportunities. These include storage subsystem suppliers, Internet and social media infrastructure players, and personal computer (“PC”) and Mac™ providers. Through HGST and WD, we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers
(“OEMs”), distributors, resellers and consumers. WD has a strong brand and heritage with consumers with its WD Branded Products business; HGST enjoys the same with its G-Technology branded products.

We believe we are at the forefront of helping our customers meet the evolving storage needs of end users through
innovation and value creation. Examples of these efforts include our multi-platter high capacity drives and solid-state drives for the fast growing cloud computing storage market, our low-profile hard drives to address the emerging thin and light
Ultrabook

TM

PC and tablet markets, and our Connected Life
innovations for the home and small-to-medium sized businesses (“SMBs”).

The storage market in which we operate is
rapidly changing and evolving. To address these dynamics, we regularly review opportunities to apply our knowledge of data storage technology to markets that we do not currently serve or in markets where we seek to broaden our participation and
augment our resources and capabilities. Examples include our recent actions to strengthen our solid state drive business with the pending acquisition of sTec, Inc. (“sTec”), our acquisition of Velobit, Inc. and our investment in Skyera,
Inc., as well as our acquisition of Arkeia Software Solutions, Inc. to strengthen our SMBs solutions in our branded products business.

Through our investments and acquisitions, we seek to develop strategic relationships with technology innovators in the broader storage market to enable our customers to develop highly optimized storage
solutions that meet their changing data management needs. We believe we have the technology building blocks to increase our overall market participation and be a full-line data storage solutions supplier. Consistent with our measured and deliberate
approach to new market entries in the recent past, our approach to additional new markets will be based on a careful assessment of the risks, rewards, requirements and profit potential of such actions.

Industry

Storage is
increasingly critical to the large amount of digital content being created and utilized. We believe the growth in the number of computing users and connected mobile devices in the world is unabated, creating more usage and more digital content to be
stored. Cloud computing applications are especially noteworthy given that they create multiple copies of photos, videos and other content to ensure efficient distribution and security. We believe unit volumes in the hard drive industry were down 9%
in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012, reflecting continued soft industry demand driven by macroeconomic uncertainty and weak PC demand.

Client: Desktop and Notebook PCs

The PC market, which includes notebook
and desktop PCs, comprises the client market and has declined in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 due to weak global macroeconomic conditions and the popularity of tablet devices. We are encouraged by recent signs of innovation in the PC space, such as
new ultraportable PC designs that are thinner, lighter and faster than prior generation notebook PCs. This remains a significant market for us; however, our reliance on the PC market is declining, with cloud, traditional enterprise, branded and
other solutions accounting for 50% of our net revenue in fiscal 2013 as compared to 36% in fiscal 2012.

Client storage
devices consist of internal hard drives and solid-state drives for desktop and mobile PCs. We believe industry unit shipments of mobile hard drives into the client space declined 14% in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012, while volumes of desktop hard
drives declined 11% in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012.

Desktop PCs are intended for regular use at single locations in homes
and businesses, as well as in multi-user educational and government networks. Mobile PCs, primarily notebook computers, are used both in and away from homes and businesses. We believe that the demand for client computer hard drives and solid-state
drives will continue primarily due to demand in emerging countries, corporate refreshes, the proliferation of digital content and changing requirements for increasing performance and thinner and lighter devices with lower power consumption.



Mobile hard drives for notebook PCs, the industry’s highest volume market, have
traditionally been in a 2.5-inch form factor with a 9.5 mm height. We believe we have led a trend toward thinner, lighter devices with extended battery life and low power consumption, first with our family of 7 mm height drives and more recently
with our 5 mm height drives in both traditional hard drive and hybrid drive configurations. A solid-state hybrid drive is a form of a hard drive that incorporates NAND flash technology in the caching function. Solid-state hybrid drives specifically
designed for mobile computing combine the power and performance of solid-state drives with the capacity, affordability and availability attributes of hard drives.

Enterprise

We believe shipments into the enterprise market of the storage
industry remained relatively flat in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012. Enterprise storage devices consist of performance and capacity hard drives, as well as enterprise class solid-state drives. All of these devices are used in multiple types of
enterprise datacenters that provide storage for a range of cloud and corporate applications. Within datacenters, these drives are typically used in servers and storage systems.

Performance applications are essential to the operations of an enterprise and require the greatest capabilities and reliability in hard
drives and solid-state drives. This class of drives is the most highly engineered product line in the storage industry. The infrastructure to support cloud computing storage is driving the demand for multi-platter high capacity hard drives and
enterprise class solid-state drives in tiered architectures. Cloud computing delivers shared resources, software and information to users on demand on a multitude of devices, such as client PCs, tablets and smart phones. Most cloud computing models
consist of services delivered through large datacenters with enterprise-class servers, utilizing tiered architectures to address multiple levels of storage needs. We believe we have established a leading position in supplying advanced multi-platter
high capacity drives and solid-state drives with Serial Attached SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) (“SAS”) to address these needs.

We believe that capacity hard drives, performance hard drives and solid-state drives represented 49%, 46% and 5% of the industry unit shipments into enterprise systems in fiscal 2013, respectively.

Branded Products

External storage devices supplement the storage space of PC systems for home and small office networks and, through wireless connections, provide remote access to personal content. The highest volume
products include direct-attached and network-attached external drives. They are ideally suited to back up data on internal drives because of their portability and security features. We believe hard drive shipments into the external storage market
increased 42% in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012. Branded products also include media players that connect to a user’s television or home theater system and play digital movies, music and photos from an integrated hard drive, Universal Serial Bus
(“USB”) mass storage device or content services accessed over the Internet.

Consumer Electronics

Hard drives for CE products are primarily used in digital video recorders (“DVRs”), game consoles and security video recording
systems. We believe hard drive unit shipments into the CE market declined 22% in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012.

DVRs offer
greater consumer viewing flexibility and enhanced capabilities such as pausing live television, simplifying the process of recording and cataloging recorded television programs and quickly forwarding or returning to any section of a recorded
television program. Game consoles enable users to save games, movies, music, pictures and other user generated content. We believe growth in the CE market will continue to create demand for higher capacity hard drives.

Competition

We compete
with manufacturers of hard drives for client compute, client non-compute and enterprise applications and manufacturers of solid-state drives. Competition in the hard drive market consists of five principal brands: HGST, Samsung, Seagate, Toshiba and
WD. In solid-state products we compete with a wide range of manufacturers, from small startup companies to multinational corporations, including Fusion I-O, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., SanDisk
Corporation, Seagate Technology LLC and Toshiba Corporation.



The storage industry is increasingly utilizing tiered architectures with hard drives and
solid-state drives or solid state hybrid drives to address an expanding set of use cases and applications. Hard drives are highly substitutable due to the industry mandate of technical form, fit and function standards and we believe there are no
substantial barriers for existing competitors to offer competing products. Hard drive attributes include product quality and reliability, storage capacity, unit price, product performance, production volume capabilities, delivery capability,
leadership in time-to-market, time-to-volume and time-to-quality, service and support and ease of doing business. The relative importance of these factors varies by customer and market and we believe that we are generally competitive in all of these
factors. Semiconductor media or solid-state technology provides high performance attributes in some enterprise-class applications and attractive functionality in consumer handheld applications requiring smaller form factors, lower power and less
storage capacity, such as smart phones and tablets. With advances in our own solid-state enterprise business, coupled with recent actions to strengthen those resources through acquisitions, we believe we are positioned to compete successfully in the
enterprise-class solid-state segment of this market. Advances in magnetic, optical or other data storage technologies could also result in competitive products for storing digital content with better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity
than our products. We monitor the advantages, disadvantages and advances of the full array of storage technologies on an ongoing basis.

Business Strategy

Our
focused business strategy is to be an industry-leading developer and manufacturer of innovative storage solutions that enable people to create, manage, experience and preserve digital content. We strive to achieve our business strategy through the
following elements:

•

relentless focus on operational excellence in all aspects of our business;

Technology and Product Development

Hard Drives

Hard drives provide non-volatile data storage, which means that the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the device. The primary measures of hard drive performance include:

•

Acoustics — sound power emitted during hard drive operation, commonly expressed in decibels, and perceived loudness due to sound pressure,
commonly expressed in sones;

•

Data transfer rate — sustained rate of data transfer to and from the disk, commonly expressed in gigabits per second;

•

Power consumption — which is the amount of electricity required to operate the drive, measured in watts;

•

Seek time — time needed to position the heads over a selected track on the disk surface, commonly expressed in milliseconds;

•

Spindle rotation speed — nominal rotation speed of the disks inside the hard drive, commonly expressed in RPM or latency. Spindle rotation
speeds commonly stated as 5,400, 7,200 and 15,000 RPM are sometimes approximations; and

•

Storage capacity — which is the amount of data that can be stored on the hard drive, commonly expressed in GB or TB.

Industry-standard interfaces allow the drives to communicate with the host system. The primary interface
for PCs is SATA and the primary interfaces for enterprise systems are SAS, Fibre Channel and SATA.

The main components of the
hard drive are a Head-Disk-Assembly (“HDA”) and a Printed Circuit Board Assembly (“PCBA”).

The HDA
includes heads, magnetic media, head positioning mechanism (“actuator”) and spindle motor. A rigid base and top cover contain these components in a contamination-controlled environment. One or more disks positioned around a motor-driven
spindle hub that rotates the disks comprise the disk-pack assembly. The disk is made up of a smooth substrate on which thin layers of magnetic materials are deposited. The head stack assembly (“HSA”) is comprised of a magnetic positioner
and a pivot-arm module on which the individual heads, including suspension, are mounted. Each disk surface has a head suspended directly above it, which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk.

The PCBA includes both standard and custom integrated circuits, an interface connector to the host computer and a power connector. The
integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically include a power device that controls the motor and HSA positioner, and a System-on-Chip (“SoC”) comprised of a drive interface, controller and recording channel. The drive
interface receives instructions from the host computer, while the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and controls the heads. The location of data on each disk is logically maintained in concentric tracks divided into sectors.
The host computer sends instructions to the controller to read data from or write data to the disks, based on logical track and sector locations. Guided by instructions from the controller, the HSA pivots in an arc across the disk until it reaches
the selected track of a disk, where the data is recorded or retrieved.

The storage capacity of a hard drive is determined by
the number of disks and each disk’s areal density (track density multiplied by bit density), which is a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk per unit area. Head and magnetic media technologies
are two of the key technology components of hard drives affecting areal density. We develop and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media used in our hard drive products. As areal density increases, achieving a given drive
capacity potentially reduces product costs over time through reduced component requirements. We also invest considerable resources in research and development, manufacturing infrastructure and capital equipment of head and magnetic media components
in order to secure our competitive position and cost structure.

Solid-State Drives

Solid-state drives use semiconductor, non-volatile media, rather than magnetic media and magnetic heads, to store and allow fast access to
data without any moving parts. The cost per bit of solid-state drives is more expensive than hard drives, but the higher input/output (“IO”) performance makes solid-state drives an attractive new tier of storage that fits between DRAM
memory and hard drives. Solid-state drives are finding growing usage in enterprise storage systems and servers in applications that demand the highest IO performance.



The non-volatile memory in use today for solid-state drives is NAND flash technology. While
Single Level Cell (“SLC”) Flash provides the highest endurance and performance, the optimal balance of price and performance is usually achieved through the use of Multi-Level Cell (“MLC”) Flash. Multiple NAND Flash die are used
on a single PCBA and connected in parallel through a controller to the host bus. Various performance classes of solid-state drives are created by varying the number of parallel NAND channels and the speed of controller logic and firmware. The
controller contains hardware logic and firmware to buffer the data flow to and from the host, to the NAND Flash, and to manage the reliability and performance of the NAND Flash media.

The typical host interfaces for solid-state drives include PCIe, SAS and SATA. PCIe products typically offer the highest performance and
come on edge cards that plug into the PCIe bus. PCIe defines the hardware and electrical interface but the software protocols are still proprietary today. New standards such as NVMe and SCSI express are emerging to bring more standardized software
protocols for communicating with PCIe solid-state drives. SAS and SATA products utilize standardized interfaces similar to hard drives and come in 2.5-inch form factors with differing package heights depending on the application and usage. The
typical power consumption for the SAS and SATA interfaces is similar to hard drives, while the power consumption of PCIe form factor devices is typically higher.

Solid-State Hybrid Drives

Solid-state hybrid drives combine semiconductor
non-volatile memory, typically NAND Flash, and magnetic rotating storage in one device. The capacity of the non-volatile memory is typically 8 GB to 32 GB. The prevalent usage of these hybrid drives is in notebook computers. The non-volatile memory
and control electronics are mounted on the same board as the HDD electronics and share the same host SATA interface as hard drives. The non-volatile memory is utilized as a non-volatile cache to enhance input/output performance, to reduce latency on
boot up of the system, and to reduce power consumption (by allowing the hard drive to spin down more often). The key challenges of adding the non-volatile memory to the hard drive card are in adding the control electronics for the NAND Flash, the
firmware to manage the NAND Flash, qualifying the NAND Flash memory for use in this application, and the algorithms and new software commands sets to manage data between the non-volatile memory, the HDD, and the host system.

Our products generally leverage a common platform for various products within product families, and in some cases across product
families, resulting in the commonality of components which reduces our exposure to changes in demand, facilitates inventory management and allows us to achieve lower costs through purchasing economies. This platform strategy also enables our
customers to leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product models. For a discussion of risks related to technological innovations, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Sales and Distribution

We maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world including the major geographies of the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe and the
Middle East. Our international sales, which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of United States (“U.S.”) companies but do not include sales to U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies, represented 78%, 81% and 83% of our net revenue
for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Sales to international customers are subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations, including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations. For a discussion regarding the risks
related to sales to international customers, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We perform our
marketing and advertising functions internally and through outside firms utilizing both consumer media and trade publications targeting various reseller and end-user categories. We also maintain customer relationships through direct communication
and providing information and support through our Web site. In accordance with standard storage industry practice, we provide distributors and retailers with limited price protection and programs under which we reimburse certain marketing
expenditures. We also provide distributors, resellers and OEMs with other sales incentive programs.

Original Equipment
Manufacturers.

OEMs, including large-scale datacenter operators

,

purchase our products, either directly or through a contract manufacturer such as an original design manufacturer (“ODM”), and assemble them into the devices
they build. OEMs typically seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of products and generally will purchase products from those vendors for the life of that product. Many of our OEM customers utilize just-in-time inventory
management processes. As a result, for certain OEMs we maintain a base stock of finished goods inventory in facilities located near or adjacent to the OEM’s operations.



Distributors.

We use a broad group of distributors to sell our products to non-direct
customers such as small computer and CE manufacturers, dealers, systems integrators, online retailers and other resellers. Distributors generally enter into non-exclusive agreements with us for the purchase and redistribution of our products in
specific territories.

Retailers.

We sell our branded products directly to a select group of major retailers such
as computer superstores, warehouse clubs, online retailers, and computer electronics stores, and authorize sales through distributors to smaller retailers. The retail channel complements our other sales channels while helping to build brand
awareness for us and our products. We also sell our branded products through our Web sites.

For 2013 and 2011, no single
customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue. For 2012, sales to Hewlett Packard Company accounted for 11% of our net revenue. For a discussion of risks related to our customers, refer to Item 1A of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. For additional information regarding revenue recognition, sales by geographic region and major customer information, see Part II, Item 8, Notes 1 and 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Seasonality

We have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in our business with higher levels of demand in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year as a result of increased customer spending.
Seasonality can also be impacted by the growth in emerging markets and macroeconomic conditions. For a discussion of risks related to seasonality in our business, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Service and Warranty

We
generally warrant our newly manufactured products against defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from the date of manufacture depending on the type of product. Our warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or
replacement. We have engaged third parties in various countries in multiple regions to provide various levels of testing, processing or recertification of returned products for our customers. For a further discussion of our service and warranty
policy, see Part II, Item 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Manufacturing

We believe that we have significant know-how, unique product
manufacturing processes, test and tooling, execution skills and human resources to continue to be successful and be able to grow, as necessary, our manufacturing operations. We strive to maintain manufacturing flexibility, high manufacturing yields,
reliable products, and high-quality components. The critical elements of our hard drive production are high volume and utilization, low cost assembly and testing, and maintaining close relationships with our strategic component suppliers to access
best-in-class technology and manufacturing capacity.

Hard drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the production
and assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and thorough testing. The assembly process occurs in a “clean room” environment that demands skill in process engineering and efficient space utilization to control the operating
costs of this manufacturing environment. Our clean room manufacturing process consists of modular production units, each of which contains a number of work cells.

We continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity, sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs. We continually evaluate which steps in the
manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs. For our non-hard drive products, we leverage the efficiencies of contract manufacturers when
strategically advantageous. For a discussion of risks related to manufacturing, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Materials and Supplies

We use a number of components, equipment, goods and services in the manufacturing of our products. The key components of our hard drives are: magnetic heads; magnetic media; suspensions with related head
gimbal assemblies (“HGAs”) and HSAs; spindle motors; custom and standard electronics such as SoC, magnetic media, motor controllers, pre-amps and printed circuit boards; base and top covers; and magnets and related voice coil motors.

We design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media required for our hard drives. We acquire all
of the remaining components for our products from third party suppliers. The major components used in the manufacture of our solid-state drives (the semiconductor media and SoC) and in our media players (the controller) are also acquired from third
party suppliers. We believe that our sourcing strategy currently enables us to have the business flexibility needed to select the highest quality, low cost of ownership suppliers as product designs and technologies evolve.

We generally retain multiple suppliers for each of our component requirements but in some instances use sole sources for business
reasons. Currently, we believe that there are no major issues with component availability. For a discussion of risks related to our component supplies, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Backlog

A substantial
portion of our orders are generally for shipments within 30 to 60 days of the placement of the order. Customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with relatively short notice to us, with little or no cost to the customer, or
modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date. In addition, for many of our OEMs utilizing just-in-time inventory, we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead, receive a periodic forecast of requirements.
Therefore, backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of our revenue and profit and may not be comparable to prior periods.

Patents, Licenses and Proprietary Information

We have more than 6,000
patents and have many patent applications in process. We believe that although our patents and patent applications have considerable value, the successful manufacturing and marketing of our products depends primarily upon the technical and
managerial competence of our staff. Accordingly, the patents held and applied for do not ensure our future success.

In
addition to patent protection of certain intellectual property rights, we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential. We believe that our non-patented intellectual property, particularly some of our
process technology, is an important factor in our success. We rely upon non-disclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information. Despite these safeguards, there is a risk that
competitors may obtain and use such information. The laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide less protection for confidential information than the U.S.

We rely on certain technology that we license from other parties to manufacture and sell our products. We believe that we have adequate
cross-licenses and other agreements in place in addition to our own intellectual property portfolio to compete successfully in the storage industry. For discussion of risks related to our ownership and use of intellectual property, see Item 1A
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Environmental Regulation

We are subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations in connection with our operations and relating to the protection of
the environment, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Some of our operations require environmental permits and controls
to prevent and reduce air and water pollution. These permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. We believe that we have obtained or are in the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our
operations.

We have established environmental management systems and continually update our environmental policies and
standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits. We budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to
comply with environmental laws.

Our properties have in some cases been operated for many years and may contain soil or
groundwater contamination. In certain of our facilities we are undertaking voluntary monitoring of soil and groundwater. Based on available information, including our voluntary monitoring activities, we do not believe that we have a current
affirmative legal obligation for any remedial action.



For a discussion of risks related to environmental regulation, see Item 1A of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Employees

As of June 28, 2013, we employed a total of 85,777 employees worldwide, excluding temporary employees and contractors. Many of our employees are highly skilled, and our continued success depends in
part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees. Accordingly, we offer employee benefit programs which we believe are, in the aggregate, competitive with those offered by our competitors.

While the substantial majority of our employees are not party to a collective bargaining agreement, a majority of our employees in Japan
are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. In addition, each of our three manufacturing subsidiaries in China has its own labor union of which many of each subsidiary’s direct employees are members. Our three manufacturing subsidiaries
in China are not currently subject to collective bargaining agreements; however, the government has required that they begin collective bargaining negotiations in calendar 2013. We consider our employee relations to be good. For a discussion of
risks related to our skilled employees, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 1A.

Risk

Factors

If we
fail to realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisition of HGST on a timely basis, or at all, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.

In connection with obtaining the regulatory approvals required to complete the acquisition of HGST, we agreed to certain conditions required by the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of
China (“MOFCOM”), including adopting measures to keep HGST as an independent competitor until MOFCOM agrees otherwise (with the minimum period being two years from the March 8, 2012 closing date of the acquisition). We worked closely
with MOFCOM to finalize an operations plan that outlines in more detail the conditions of the competitive requirement. Compliance with these measures has affected, and may continue to affect, our business and financial conditions in the following
ways:

•

limits our ability to integrate HGST’s business with our business (and we do not expect to achieve significant operating expense synergies while
the conditions remain in place),

•

has caused, and could cause further, difficulties in retaining key employees and delays or uncertainties in making decisions about the combined
business,

•

has resulted in, and could result in additional, significant costs (including capital expenditures relative to our competitors as a result of
maintaining separate research and development functions), and

•

has required, and could require additional, changes in business practices.

We cannot predict when the conditions imposed by MOFCOM will be removed. In addition, in the event we fail to comply with these measures,
the time during which we are required to comply with the conditions could be extended and we could be subject to other conditions or penalties that could adversely affect the business.



The financing of the HGST acquisition may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, limit
our flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions

.

Our acquisition of HGST was financed by a combination of the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, the use of a significant amount of our cash on hand and the incurrence of a significant
amount of indebtedness. The use of cash on hand and indebtedness to finance the acquisition reduced our liquidity and could cause us to place more reliance on cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the
availability of our cash flow for operations and development activities. The credit agreement we entered into with respect to the indebtedness we incurred to finance the Acquisition contains restrictive covenants, including financial covenants
requiring us to maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet these restrictive covenants can be affected by events beyond our control. The indebtedness and these restrictive covenants will also have the effect, among other things, of
impairing our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, limiting our flexibility in the conduct of our business and making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions. In addition, a breach of
the restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable and could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or operating results.

In connection with obtaining the regulatory approvals required to complete our
acquisition of HGST, we divested certain assets to Toshiba and agreed to provide certain support services for those assets for a period of time, and our business will be adversely affected in the event we fail to successfully meet our obligations to
Toshiba under the divestiture transaction.

In connection with obtaining the regulatory approvals required to complete our
acquisition of HGST, we agreed, subject to review by regulatory agencies in certain jurisdictions, to divest certain assets to Toshiba that will expand Toshiba’s capacity to manufacture 3.5-inch hard drives for the desktop, consumer electronics
and near-line (business critical) applications. While this divestiture transaction closed in May 2012, we agreed to provide certain support service for those assets for a period of time. If we are not able to meet our continuing service obligations
under our agreement with Toshiba, the jurisdictions that conditioned their approval of the HGST acquisition on the divestiture could impose certain obligations on us, including a requirement that we divest the assets subject to the Toshiba
divestiture (or other assets) to another purchaser, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Adverse global economic conditions and credit market uncertainty could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Adverse global economic conditions and uncertain conditions in the credit market have had, and in the future could have, a significant
adverse effect on our company and on the storage industry as a whole. Some of the risks and uncertainties we face as a result of these global economic and credit market conditions include the following:

•

Volatile Demand.

Negative or uncertain global economic conditions could cause many of our direct and indirect customers to delay or reduce their
purchases of our products and systems containing our products. In addition, many of our customers rely on credit financing to purchase our products. If negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers’ access to credit,
product orders may decrease, which could result in lower revenue. Likewise, if our suppliers, sub-suppliers and sub-contractors (collectively referred to as “suppliers”) face challenges in obtaining credit, in selling their products or
otherwise in operating their businesses, they may be unable to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products. These actions could result in reductions in our revenue and increased operating costs, which could adversely affect our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

•

Restructuring Activities.

If demand for our products slows as a result of deterioration in economic conditions, we may undertake restructuring
activities to realign our cost structure with softening demand. The occurrence of restructuring activities could result in impairment charges and other expenses, which could adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition.

•

Credit Volatility and Loss of Receivables.

We extend credit and payment terms to some of our customers. In addition to ongoing credit
evaluations of our customers’ financial condition, we traditionally seek to mitigate our credit risk by purchasing credit insurance on certain of our accounts receivable balances. As a result of the continued uncertainty and volatility in
global economic conditions, however, we may find it increasingly difficult to be able to insure these accounts receivable. We could suffer significant losses if a customer whose accounts receivable we have not insured, or have underinsured, fails
and is unable to pay us. Additionally, negative or uncertain global economic conditions increase the risk that if a customer whose accounts receivable we have insured fails, the financial condition of the insurance carrier for such customer account
may have also deteriorated such that it cannot cover our loss. A significant loss of an accounts receivable that we cannot recover through credit insurance would have a negative impact on our financial results.



•

Impairment Charges.

Negative or uncertain global economic conditions could result in circumstances, such as a sustained decline in our stock
price and market capitalization or a decrease in our forecasted cash flows such that they are insufficient, indicating that the carrying value of our long-lived assets or goodwill may be impaired. If we are required to record a significant charge to
earnings in our consolidated financial statements because an impairment of our long-lived assets or goodwill is determined, our results of operations will be adversely affected.

We participate in a highly competitive industry that is subject to the risk of declining average selling prices (“ASPs”),
volatile gross margins and significant shifts in market share, all of which could adversely affect our operating results.

Demand for our hard drives depends in large part on the demand for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to
existing systems. The demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for hard drives in any given period. As a result, the hard drive market has experienced periods of excess capacity, which
can lead to liquidation of excess inventories and more intense price competition. If more intense price competition occurs, we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected, which could adversely impact revenue and gross margins. Our
ASPs and gross margins also tend to decline when there is a shift in the mix of product sales, and sales of lower priced products increase relative to those of higher priced products. In addition, rapid technological changes often reduce the volume
and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence. These factors, along with others, may result in significant shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants, including a substantial
decrease in our market share.

Our failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for our products, or to
quickly adjust to forecast changes, could adversely affect our business and financial results or operating efficiencies.

The data storage industry faces difficulties in accurately forecasting market and customer demand for its products. The variety and
volume of products we manufacture is based in part on these forecasts. Accurately forecasting demand has become increasingly difficult for us, our customers and our suppliers in light of the volatility in global economic conditions and industry
consolidation, resulting in less availability of historical market data for certain product segments. In addition, because hard drives are designed to be largely interchangeable with competitors’ products, our demand forecasts may be impacted
significantly by the strategic actions of our competitors. As forecasting demand becomes more difficult, the risk that our forecasts are not in line with demand increases. If our forecasts exceed actual market demand, then we could experience
periods of product oversupply and price decreases, which could impact our financial performance. If market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts or beyond our ability to add manufacturing capacity, then we may not be able to satisfy
customer product needs, possibly resulting in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands.

We experience significant sales seasonality and cyclicality, which could cause our operating results to fluctuate.

Sales of computer systems, storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal and cyclical, and therefore we expect to
continue to experience seasonality and cyclicality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for hard drives. However, changes in seasonal and cyclical patterns have made it, and could continue to make it, more
difficult for us to forecast demand, especially as a result of the current macroeconomic environment. Changes in the product or channel mix of our business can also impact seasonal and cyclical patterns, adding complexity in forecasting demand.
Seasonality and cyclicality also may lead to higher volatility in our stock price. It is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which seasonality and cyclicality may affect our stock price or business in future periods because of the rate and
unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions and macroeconomic conditions.



Our sales to the non-compute and enterprise markets (collectively, the “non-PC
markets”), representing an increasing percentage of our overall revenue, may not continue to grow at current estimates, which could materially adversely impact our operating results.

The secular growth of digital data is resulting in a more diversified mix of revenue. For example, for the year ended June 28, 2013,
approximately 50% of our net revenue was derived from the non-PC markets. As sales to the non-PC markets become a more significant portion of our revenue, events or circumstances that adversely impact demand in these markets, or our ability to
address that demand successfully, could materially adversely impact our operating results. For example, demand in, or our sales to, the non-PC markets may be adversely affected by the following:

•

Mobile Devices.

There has been and continues to be a rapid growth in devices that do not contain a hard drive such as tablet computers and smart
phones. As tablet computers and smart phones provide many of the same capabilities as PCs, they have displaced or materially affected, and may continue to displace or materially affect, the demand for PCs. If we are not successful in adapting our
product offerings to include disk drives or alternative storage solutions that address these devices, demand for our products in the non-PC markets may decrease and our financial results could be materially adversely affected.

•

Cloud Computing.

Consumers traditionally have stored their data on their PC, often supplemented with personal external storage devices. Most
businesses also include similar local storage as a primary or secondary storage location. This storage is typically provided by hard disk drives. Over the last few years, cloud computing has emerged whereby applications and data are hosted, accessed
and processed through a third-party provider over a broadband Internet connection, potentially reducing or eliminating the need for, among other things, significant storage inside the accessing computer. If we are not successful in manufacturing
compelling products to address the cloud computing opportunity, demand for our products in the non-PC markets may decrease and our financial results could be materially adversely affected.

•

Obsolete Inventory.

In some cases, products we manufacture for the non-PC markets are uniquely configured for a single customer’s
application, creating a risk of obsolete inventory if anticipated demand is not actually realized.

•

Macroeconomic Conditions.

Consumer spending in the non-PC markets has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected in many regions due to
negative macroeconomic conditions and high unemployment levels. Please see the risk factor entitled “

Adverse global economic conditions and credit market uncertainty could harm our business, results of operations and financial
condition.”

for more risks and uncertainties relating to macroeconomic conditions.

In addition,
demand in the non-PC markets also could be negatively impacted by developments in the regulation and enforcement of digital rights management, the emergence of processes such as data deduplication and storage virtualization, and the rate of increase
in areal density exceeding the increase in our customers’ demand for storage. These factors could lead to our customers’ storage needs being satisfied at lower prices with lower capacity hard drives or solid-state storage products that we
do not offer, thereby decreasing our revenue or putting us at a disadvantage to competing storage technologies. As a result, even with increasing aggregate demand for digital storage, if we fail to anticipate or timely respond to these developments
in the demand for storage, our ASPs could decline, which could adversely affect our operating results.

Sales in the client
compute market (the “PC market”) are important to our business, and if we fail to respond to changes in the PC market, our operating results could suffer.

While sales to the non-PC market are becoming a more significant source of revenue, sales to the PC market remain an important part of our business. The PC market, however, has been, and may continue to
be, adversely affected by the growth of tablet computers, smart phones and similar devices that perform many of the same capabilities as PCs, the lengthening of product life cycles and macroeconomic conditions. If demand in the PC market is worse
than expected as a result of these or other conditions, demand for our products in the PC market may decrease and our operating results may be adversely affected.



Selling to the retail market is an important part of our business, and if we fail to
maintain and grow our market share or gain market acceptance of our branded products, our operating results could suffer.

Selling branded products is an important part of our business, and as our branded products revenue increases as a portion of our overall revenue, our success in the retail market becomes increasingly
important to our operating results. Our success in the retail market depends in large part on our ability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation and to expand into and gain market acceptance of our products in multiple channels,
including the e-tail channel. Adverse publicity, whether or not justified, or allegations of product or service quality issues, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish our reputation and cause our customers to choose products offered by our
competitors. In addition, the proliferation of new methods of mass communication facilitated by the Internet makes it easier for false or unfounded allegations to adversely affect our brand image and reputation. If customers no longer maintain a
preference for WD

®

, HGST™ or G-Technology™ brand products, our operating results may be adversely
affected.

Sales in the distribution channel are important to our business, and if we fail to respond to demand changes in
distribution markets or if distribution markets for hard drives weaken, our operating results could suffer.

Our
distribution customers typically sell to small computer manufacturers, dealers, systems integrators and other resellers. We face significant competition in this channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a significant focus on
price and availability of product. In addition, the PC market is experiencing a shift to notebook and other mobile devices and, as a result, more computing devices are being delivered to the market as complete systems, which could weaken the
distribution market. If we fail to respond to changes in demand in the distribution market, our operating results could suffer. Additionally, if the distribution market weakens as a result of a slowing PC growth rate, technology transitions or a
significant change in consumer buying preference, or if we experience significant price declines due to demand changes in the distribution channel, then our operating results would be adversely affected.

Loss of market share with or by a key customer, or consolidation among our customer base, could harm our operating results.

During the year ended June 28, 2013, 44% of our revenue came from sales to our top 10 customers. These customers
have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us, including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms, often resulting in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier. Our ability to maintain
strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance. If we lose a key customer, if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce
costs, if a customer is acquired by one of our competitors or if a key customer suffers financial hardship, our operating results would likely be harmed.

Additionally, if there is consolidation among our customer base, our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale, which could adversely affect our
profitability. In addition, if, as a result of increased leverage, customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished, we could decide not to sell our products to a particular customer, which could result
in a decrease in our revenue. Consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products, replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders, each of which could
harm our operating results.

Our entry into additional markets increases the complexity of our business, and if we are
unable to successfully adapt our business processes and product offerings as required by these new markets, we will be at a competitive disadvantage and our ability to grow will be adversely affected.

As we expand our product line to sell into additional markets, the overall complexity of our business increases at an accelerated rate
and we become subject to different market dynamics. The new markets into which we are expanding, or may expand, may have different characteristics from the markets we currently serve. These different characteristics may include, among other things,
demand volume requirements, demand seasonality, product generation development rates, customer concentrations, warranty and product return policies and performance and compatibility requirements. Our failure to make the necessary adaptations to our
business model and product offerings to address these different characteristics, complexities and new market dynamics could adversely affect our operating results.



Expansion into new markets may cause our capital expenditures to increase, and if we do
not successfully expand into new markets, our business may suffer.

To remain a significant supplier in the storage
industry, we will need to offer a broad range of storage products to our customers. We currently offer a variety of 3.5-inch or 2.5-inch hard drives for the PC and non-PC storage markets, as well as a variety of solid state drives. However, demand
for storage devices may shift to products in form factors or with interfaces that our competitors offer but which we do not. Expansion into other markets and resulting increases in manufacturing capacity requirements may require us to make
substantial additional investments in part because our operations are largely vertically integrated. If we fail to successfully expand into new markets with products that we do not currently offer, we may lose business to our competitors who offer
these products.

Our vertical integration of head and magnetic media manufacturing makes us dependent on our ability to
timely and cost-effectively develop heads and magnetic media with leading technology and overall quality, increasing capital expenditure costs and asset utilization risks for our business.

Under our business plan, we are developing and manufacturing a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media used in the hard drive
products we manufacture. Consequently, we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less able to take advantage of head and magnetic media technologies developed by other manufacturers. Technology transition for head and
magnetic media designs is critical to increasing our volume production of heads and magnetic media. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in timely and cost-effectively developing and manufacturing heads or magnetic media
for products using future technologies. We also may not effectively transition our head or magnetic media design and technology to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields using the technologies necessary to satisfy our customers’ product needs,
or we may encounter quality problems with the heads or magnetic media we manufacture. If we are unable to timely and cost-effectively develop heads and magnetic media with leading technology and overall quality, our ability to sell our products may
be significantly diminished, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.

In addition, as
a result of our vertical integration of head and magnetic media manufacturing, we make more capital investments and carry a higher percentage of fixed costs than we would if we were not vertically integrated. If our overall level of production
decreases for any reason, and we are unable to reduce our fixed costs to match sales, our head or magnetic media manufacturing assets may face underutilization that may impact our operating results. We are therefore subject to additional risks
related to overall asset utilization, including the need to operate at high levels of utilization to drive competitive costs and the need for assured supply of components that we do not manufacture ourselves. In addition, as a result of adverse
labor rates or availability, we may be required to increase investments in automation, which may cause our capital expenditures to increase. If we do not adequately address the challenges related to our head or magnetic media manufacturing
operations, our ongoing operations could be disrupted, resulting in a decrease in our revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating results.

We make significant investments in research and development to improve our technology and develop new technologies, and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Over the past several years, our business strategy has been to derive a
competitive advantage by moving from being a follower of new technologies to being a leader in the innovation and development of new technologies. This strategy requires us to make significant investments in research and development and, in
attempting to remain competitive, we may increase our capital expenditures and expenses above our historical run-rate model. There can be no assurance that these investments will result in viable technologies or products, or if these investments do
result in viable technologies or products, that they will be profitable or accepted by the market. Significant investments in unsuccessful research and development efforts could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations. In addition, increased investments in technology could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products, which would have a negative impact on our financial results.

Current or future competitors may gain a technology advantage or develop an advantageous cost structure that we cannot match.

It may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain an advantage in product technology, manufacturing
technology, or process technology, which may allow them to offer products or services that have a significant advantage over the products and services that we offer. Advantages could be in capacity, performance, reliability, serviceability, or other
attributes. A competitive cost structure for our products, including critical components, labor and overhead, is also critical to the success of our business. We may be at a competitive disadvantage to any companies that are able to gain a
technological or cost structure advantage.



Industry consolidation could provide competitive advantages to our competitors.

The storage industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years. Consolidation by our competitors may
enhance their capacity, abilities and resources and lower their cost structure, causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage.

Some of our competitors with diversified business units outside of storage products may over extended periods of time sell storage
products at prices that we cannot profitably match.

Some of our competitors earn a significant portion of their revenue
from business units outside of storage products. Because they do not depend solely on sales of storage products to achieve profitability, they may sell storage products at lower prices and operate their storage business unit at a loss over an
extended period of time while still remaining profitable overall. In addition, if these competitors can increase sales of non-storage products to the same customers, they may benefit from selling their storage products at lower prices. Our operating
results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully compete with the pricing by these companies.

If we fail to
qualify our products with our customers, it may have a significant adverse impact on our sales and margins.

We regularly
engage in new product qualification with our customers. Once a product is accepted for qualification testing, failures or delays in the qualification process can result in delayed or reduced product sales, reduced product margins caused by having to
continue to offer a more costly current generation product, or lost sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced. The effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high
volume OEMs, which continue to consolidate their share of the storage markets. Likewise, if product life cycles lengthen, we may have a significantly longer period to wait before we have an opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer, which
could reduce our profits because we expect declining gross margins on our current generation products as a result of competitive pressures.

We are subject to risks related to product defects, which could result in product recalls or epidemic failures and could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are
greater than anticipated.

We warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to five years. We test our hard
drives in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means. However, there can be no assurance that our testing will reveal defects in our products, which may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market.
Accordingly, there is a risk that product defects will occur, which could require a product recall. Product recalls can be expensive to implement and, if a product recall occurs during the product’s warranty period, we may be required to
replace the defective product. Moreover, there is a risk that product defects may trigger an epidemic failure clause in a customer agreement. If an epidemic failure occurs, we may be required to replace or refund the value of the defective product
and to cover certain other costs associated with the consequences of the epidemic failure. In addition, a product recall or epidemic failure may damage our reputation or customer relationships, and may cause us to lose market share with our
customers, including our OEM and ODM customers.

Our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability
for consequential damages and for misuse, improper installation, alteration, accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us. We record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. We may incur
additional operating expenses if our warranty provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products, whether as a result of a product recall, epidemic failure or otherwise. If these additional expenses are
significant, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.



Dependence on a limited number of qualified suppliers of components and manufacturing
equipment could lead to delays, lost revenue or increased costs.

Our future operating results may depend substantially on
our suppliers’ ability to timely qualify their components in our programs, and their ability to supply us with these components in sufficient volumes to meet our production requirements. A number of the components that we use are available from
only a single or limited number of qualified suppliers, and may be used across multiple product lines. As such, the success of our products depends on our ability to gain access to and integrate parts from reliable component suppliers. To do so, we
must maintain effective relationships with our supply base to source our component needs, develop compatible technology, and maintain continuity of supply at reasonable costs. If we fail to maintain effective relationships with our supply base, or
if we fail to integrate components from our suppliers effectively, this may adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver the best products to our customers and our profitability could suffer.

Certain equipment and consumables we use in our manufacturing or testing processes are available only from a limited number of suppliers.
Some of this equipment and consumables use materials that at times could be in short supply. If these materials are not available, or are not available in the quantities we require for our manufacturing and testing processes, our ability to
manufacture our products could be impacted, and we could suffer significant loss of revenue.

Each of the following could also
significantly harm our operating results:

•

an unwillingness of a supplier to supply such components or equipment to us;

•

consolidation of key suppliers;

•

failure of a key supplier’s business process;

•

a key supplier’s or sub-supplier’s inability to access credit necessary to operate its business; or

•

failure of a key supplier to remain in business, to remain an independent merchant supplier, or to adjust to market conditions.

Failure by certain suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture components,
technology or production equipment for our products may adversely affect our operations.

We rely on suppliers for various
component parts that we integrate into our hard drives but do not manufacture ourselves, such as semiconductors, motors, flex circuits and suspensions. Likewise, we rely on suppliers for certain technology and equipment necessary for advanced
development technology for future products. Some of these components, and most of this technology and production equipment, must be specifically designed to be compatible for use in our products or for developing and manufacturing our future
products, and are only available from a limited number of suppliers, some of whom are our sole-source suppliers. We are therefore dependent on these suppliers to be able and willing to dedicate adequate engineering resources to develop components
that can be successfully integrated into our products, and technology and production equipment that can be used to develop and manufacture our next-generation products efficiently. As consolidation in the hard drive supply chain increases, these
suppliers may reevaluate their business models. The failure of these suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture components, technology and production equipment for our products, or a decision by these suppliers to exit this
industry, may cause us to be unable to, or experience a delay in our ability to, manufacture and ship hard drive products, expand into new technology and markets, or compete with alternative storage technologies, therefore adversely affecting our
business and financial results. In addition, these suppliers may seek to impose volume guarantees on us or to shift the burden of certain fixed costs to us in order to continue developing and manufacturing components, technology or production
equipment for our products, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results.



Price volatility, shortages of commodity materials or commodity components, or use by
other industries of materials and components used in the storage industry, may negatively impact our operating results.

Increases in the cost for certain commodity materials, commodity components and oil may increase our costs of manufacturing and
transporting hard drives and key components and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers. Shortages of commodity components such as DRAM and NAND flash, or commodity materials such as
glass substrates, stainless steel, aluminum, nickel, neodymium, ruthenium, platinum or cerium, may increase our costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to find ways to mitigate these increased costs. We or our suppliers
acquire certain precious metals and rare earth metals like ruthenium, platinum, neodymium and cerium, which are critical to the manufacture of components in our products from a number of countries, including the People’s Republic of China. The
government of China or any other nation may impose regulations, quotas or embargoes upon these metals that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals or increase their cost, both of which could negatively impact our operating results until
alternative suppliers are sourced. Furthermore, if other high volume industries increase their demand for materials or components used in our products, our costs may further increase, which could have an adverse effect on our operating margins. In
addition, shortages in other commodity components and materials used in our customers’ products could result in a decrease in demand for our products, which would negatively impact our operating results.

Contractual commitments with component suppliers may result in us paying increased charges and cash advances for such components or
may cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory.

To reduce the risk of component shortages, we attempt to
provide significant lead times when buying components, which may subject us to cancellation charges if we cancel orders as a result of technology transitions or changes in our component needs. In addition, we may from time to time enter into
contractual commitments with component suppliers in an effort to increase and stabilize the supply of those components and enable us to purchase such components at favorable prices. Some of these commitments may require us to buy a substantial
number of components from the supplier or make significant cash advances to the supplier; however, these commitments may not result in a satisfactory increase or stabilization of the supply of such components. Furthermore, as a result of uncertain
global economic conditions, our ability to forecast our requirements for these components has become increasingly difficult, therefore increasing the risk that our contractual commitments may not meet our actual supply requirements, which could
cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory and adversely affect our operating results and increase our operating costs.

Changes in product life cycles could adversely affect our financial results.

If product life cycles lengthen, we may need to develop new technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any particular product to maintain competitive pricing for that product. If product life cycles
shorten, it may result in an increase in our overall expenses and a decrease in our gross margins, both of which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, shortening of product life cycles also makes it more difficult to recover the
cost of product development before the product becomes obsolete. Our failure to recover the cost of product development in the future could adversely affect our operating results.

A fundamental change in recording technology could result in significant increases in our costs and could put us at a competitive
disadvantage.

Historically, when the industry experiences a fundamental change in technology, any manufacturer that fails
to successfully and timely adjust its designs and processes to accommodate the new technology fails to remain competitive. There are some revolutionary technologies, such as current-perpendicular-to-plane giant magnetoresistance, shingle magnetic
recording, energy assisted magnetic recording, patterned magnetic media and advanced signal processing, that if implemented by a competitor on a commercially viable basis ahead of the industry, could put us at a competitive disadvantage. As a result
of these technology shifts, we could incur substantial costs in developing new technologies, such as heads, magnetic media, and tools to remain competitive. If we fail to successfully implement these new technologies, or if we are significantly
slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies, we may not be able to offer products with capacities that our customers desire, which could harm our operating results.

The difficulty of introducing hard drives with higher levels of areal density and the challenges of reducing other costs may impact
our ability to achieve historical levels of cost reduction.

Storage capacity of the hard drive, as manufactured by us, is
determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density. Areal density is a measure of the amount of magnetic bits that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk. Generally, the higher the areal density, the more information
can be stored on a single platter. Higher areal densities require existing head and magnetic media technology to be improved or new technologies developed to accommodate more data on a single disk. Historically, we have been able to achieve a large
percentage of cost reduction through increases in areal density. Increases in areal density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same capacity and, therefore, may result in a lower component cost. However, increasing
areal density has become more difficult in the storage industry. If we are not able to increase areal density at the same rate as our competitors or at a rate that is expected by our customers, we may be required to include more components in our
drives to meet demand without corresponding incremental revenue, which could negatively impact our operating margins and make achieving historical levels of cost reduction difficult or unlikely. Additionally, increases in areal density may require
us to make further capital expenditures on items such as new testing equipment needed as a result of an increased number of gigabytes per platter. Our inability to achieve cost reductions could adversely affect our operating results.



If we do not properly manage technology transitions, our competitiveness and operating
results may be negatively affected.

The storage markets in which we offer our products continuously undergo technology
transitions which we must anticipate and adapt our products to address in a timely manner. If we fail to implement these new technologies successfully, or if we are slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies, we may not be able to
competitively offer products that our customers desire, which could harm our operating results.

If we do not properly
manage new product development, our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected.

As advances in
computer hardware and software are made, our customers have demanded a more diversified portfolio of disk drive products with new and additional features. In some cases, this demand results in investments in new products for a particular market that
do not necessarily expand overall market opportunity, which may negatively affect our operating results.

In addition, the
success of our new product introductions depends on a number of other factors, including

•

difficulties faced in manufacturing ramp;

•

implementing at an acceptable cost product features expected by our customers;

•

market acceptance/qualification;

•

effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand; and

•

quality problems or other defects in the early stages of new product introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products.

Our business may suffer if we fail to successfully anticipate and manage issues associated with our product
development.

If we fail to develop and introduce new products that are competitive against alternative storage
technologies, our business may suffer.

Our success depends in part on our ability to develop and introduce new products
in a timely manner in order to keep pace with competing technologies. Alternative storage technologies like solid-state storage technology have successfully served digital entertainment markets for products such as digital cameras, MP3 players, USB
flash drives, mobile phones and tablet devices that cannot be economically serviced using hard drive technology. Advances in semiconductor technology have resulted in solid-state storage emerging as a technology that is competitive with hard drives
for high performance needs in advanced digital computing markets such as enterprise servers and storage. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in anticipating and developing new products for the PC and non-PC storage markets in
response to solid-state storage, as well as other competing technologies. If our hard drive technology fails to offer higher capacity, performance and reliability with lower cost-per-gigabyte than solid-state storage, we will be at a competitive
disadvantage to companies using semiconductor technology and our business will suffer.



Our manufacturing operations, and those of certain of our suppliers and customers, are
concentrated in large, purpose-built facilities, subjecting us to substantial risk of damage or loss if operations at any of these facilities are disrupted.

As a result of our cost structure and strategy of vertical integration, we conduct our manufacturing operations at large, high volume, purpose-built facilities in California and in Asia. The manufacturing
facilities of many of our customers, our suppliers and our customers’ suppliers are also concentrated in certain geographic locations in Asia and elsewhere. A localized health risk affecting our employees at these facilities or the staff of our
or our customers’ other suppliers, such as the spread of a pandemic influenza, could impair the total volume of hard drives that we are able to manufacture or sell, which would result in substantial harm to our operating results. Similarly, a
fire, flood, earthquake, tsunami or other disaster, condition or event such as political instability, civil unrest or a power outage that adversely affects any of these facilities, including access to or from these facilities by employees or
logistics operations, would significantly affect our ability to manufacture or sell hard drives, which would result in a substantial loss of sales and revenue and a substantial harm to our operating results. For example, prior to the 2011 flooding
in Thailand, all of our internal slider capacity and 60% of our hard drive manufacturing capacity was in Thailand. As a result of the flooding in Thailand, our facilities were inundated and temporarily shut down. During that period, our ability to
manufacture hard drives was significantly constrained, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. A significant event that impacts any of our manufacturing sites, or the sites of our customers or suppliers,
could adversely affect our ability to manufacture hard drives, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.

Manufacturing and marketing our products globally subjects us to numerous risks.

We are subject to risks associated with our global manufacturing operations and global marketing efforts, including:

•

obtaining requisite governmental permits and approvals;

•

currency exchange rate fluctuations or restrictions;

•

political instability and civil unrest;

•

limited transportation availability, delays, and extended time required for shipping, which risks may be compounded in periods of price declines;

•

higher freight rates;

•

labor challenges, including difficulties finding and retaining talent or responding to labor disputes or disruptions;

•

trade restrictions or higher tariffs;

•

copyright levies or similar fees or taxes imposed in European and other countries;

•

exchange, currency and tax controls and reallocations;

•

increasing labor and overhead costs; and

•

loss or non-renewal of favorable tax treatment under agreements or treaties with foreign tax authorities.



Terrorist attacks may adversely affect our business and operating results.

The continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial
and insurance markets and have significantly increased the political, economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate. Additionally, it is uncertain what impact the reactions to such acts by various governmental
agencies and security regulators worldwide will have on shipping costs. Acts of terrorism, either domestically or abroad, could create further uncertainties and instability. To the extent this results in disruption or delays of our manufacturing
capabilities or shipments of our products, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Sudden disruptions to the availability of freight lanes could have an impact on our operations.

We generally ship our products to our customers, and receive shipments from our suppliers, via air, ocean or land freight. The sudden
unavailability or disruption of cargo operations or freight lanes caused by, among other things, labor difficulties or disputes, severe weather patterns or other natural disasters, or political instability or civil unrest, could impact our operating
results by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our products.

We are vulnerable to system failures or
attacks, which could harm our business.

We are heavily dependent on our technology infrastructure, among other functions,
to operate our factories, sell our products, fulfill orders, manage inventory and bill, collect and make payments. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, cyber-attacks
such as computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and other events. Our business is also subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by third parties as well as employees. Despite any precautions we may take, such
problems could result in, among other consequences, loss or theft of our, our customers’ or our business partners’ intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information; damage to our reputation;
interruptions in our business; and remediation costs, each of which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

If we fail to identify, manage, complete and integrate acquisitions, investment opportunities or other significant transactions, it may adversely affect our future results.

As part of our growth strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of, investment opportunities in or other significant transactions with
companies that are complementary to our business. In order to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities, successfully complete the transaction, some of which may be large and complex, and
manage post-closing issues such as integration of the acquired company or employees. We may not be able to identify or complete appealing acquisition or investment opportunities given the intense competition for these transactions. Even if we
identify and complete suitable corporate transactions, we may not be able to successfully address any integration challenges in a timely manner, or at all. If we fail to successfully integrate an acquisition, we may not realize all or any of the
anticipated benefits of the acquisition, and our future results of operations could be adversely affected.

Please also see
the risk factors above for specific risks and uncertainties regarding our acquisition of HGST.



If we are unable to retain or hire key staff and skilled employees our business results
may suffer.

Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key staff and skilled employees, many of whom
would be extremely difficult to replace. Global competition for skilled employees in the data storage industry is intense and, as we attempt to move to a position of technology leadership in the storage industry, our business success becomes
increasingly dependent on our ability to retain our key staff and skilled employees as well as attract, integrate and retain new skilled employees. Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price and the overall markets may adversely
affect our ability to retain key staff or skilled employees who have received equity compensation. Additionally, because a substantial portion of our key employees’ compensation is placed “at risk” and linked to the performance of our
business, when our operating results are negatively impacted by global economic conditions, we are at a competitive disadvantage for retaining and hiring key staff and skilled employees versus other companies that pay a relatively higher fixed
salary. If we are unable to retain our existing key staff or skilled employees, or hire and integrate new key staff or skilled employees, or if we fail to implement succession plans for our key staff, our operating results would likely be harmed.

The nature of our industry and its reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us and our
suppliers and customers to the risk of significant litigation.

The data storage industry has been characterized by
significant litigation. This includes litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights, product liability claims and other types of litigation. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations.
Moreover, the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions. We may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or operating results. As disclosed in Part II, Item 8, Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K on November 18, 2011, a sole arbitrator ruled against
us in an arbitration in Minnesota. The arbitration involves claims brought by Seagate Technology LLC against us and a now former employee, alleging misappropriation of confidential information and trade secrets. The arbitrator issued an interim
award against us in the amount of $525 million plus pre-award interest. On January 23, 2012, the arbitrator issued a final award adding pre-award interest in the amount of $105.4 million, for a total award of $630.4 million. On January 23,
2012, we filed a petition in the District Court of Hennepin County, Minnesota to have the final arbitration award vacated, and a hearing on the petition was held on March 1, 2012. On October 12, 2012, the District Court of Hennepin County,
Minnesota vacated, in full, the $630.4 million final arbitration award and ordered that a rehearing be held concerning certain trade secret claims before a new arbitrator. On October 30, 2012, Seagate initiated an appeal of the District
Court’s decision with the Minnesota Court of Appeals. Oral arguments in the appeal were held on April 24, 2013. On July 22, 2013, the Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s decision and remanded for entry of an
order and judgment confirming the arbitration award. We strongly disagree with the decision of the Court of Appeals, believe that the District Court’s decision was correct, and will file a petition for review with the Minnesota Supreme Court.
If the Minnesota Supreme Court elects not to hear our petition for review or affirms the Court of Appeals decision, the District Court is expected to enter an order and judgment confirming the $630.4 million final arbitration award, plus post-award
interest on the $525 million initial award at the statutory rate of 10% from January 24, 2012. No judgment will be entered while we are petitioning the Minnesota Supreme Court.

We evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to time. If
claims or actions are asserted against us, we may be required to obtain a license or cross-license, modify our existing technology or design a new non-infringing technology. Such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly. In addition,
we may decide to settle a claim or action against us, which settlement could be costly. We may also be liable for any past infringement. If there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit, an injunction could be issued barring
production or sale of any infringing product. It could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or, if there is a finding of willful infringement, treble damages. Any of these results would increase our costs and
harm our operating results. In addition, our suppliers and customers are subject to similar risks of litigation, and a material, adverse ruling against a supplier or customer could negatively impact our business.

Our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of our
business could be copied by competitors.

Our success depends, in significant part, on the proprietary nature of our
technology, including non-patentable intellectual property such as our process technology. If a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology despite the safeguards we have in place, it may be difficult, expensive or
impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection. Also, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do U.S. laws. In addition to patent protection of intellectual property rights, we
consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential. We rely upon employee, consultant and vendor non-disclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our
proprietary information. However, any of our registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry, which might harm our operating results.



The costs of compliance with state, federal and international legal and regulatory
requirements, such as environmental, labor, trade and tax regulations, and customers’ standards of corporate citizenship could cause an increase in our operating costs.

We are subject to, and may become subject to additional, state, federal and international laws and regulations governing our
environmental, labor, trade and tax practices. These laws and regulations, particularly those applicable to our international operations, are or may be complex, extensive and subject to change. We will need to ensure that we and our component
suppliers timely comply with such laws and regulations, which may result in an increase in our operating costs. For example, in August 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted final rules to implement Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act intended to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries, which obligates us
to conduct a reasonable country of origin inquiry with respect to conflict minerals included in components of products we directly manufacture, contract to manufacture and purchase to include in products. Other legislation has been, and may in the
future be, enacted in other locations where we manufacture or sell our products. In addition, climate change and financial reform legislation in the United States is a significant topic of discussion and has generated and may continue to generate
federal or other regulatory responses in the near future. If we or our component suppliers fail to timely comply with applicable legislation, our customers may refuse to purchase our products or we may face increased operating costs as a result of
taxes, fines or penalties, which would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.

In connection with our compliance with such environmental laws and regulations, as well as our compliance with industry environmental initiatives, the standards of business conduct required by some of our
customers, and our commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business, we could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics. In addition, if we were found to be
in violation of these laws or noncompliant with these initiatives or standards of conduct, we could be subject to governmental fines, liability to our customers and damage to our reputation and corporate brand which could cause our financial
condition or operating results to suffer.

Violation of applicable laws, including labor or environmental laws, and certain
other practices by our suppliers or customers could harm our business.

We expect our suppliers and customers to operate
in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including labor and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required standards of conduct. While our internal operating guidelines promote ethical business practices, we do not control our
suppliers or customers or their labor or environmental practices. The violation of labor, environmental or other laws by any of our suppliers or customers, or divergence of a supplier’s or customer’s business practices from those generally
accepted as ethical, could harm our business by:

•

interrupting or otherwise disrupting the shipment of our product components;

•

damaging our reputation;

•

forcing us to find alternate component sources;

•

reducing demand for our products (for example, through a consumer boycott); or

•

exposing us to potential liability for our suppliers’ or customers’ wrongdoings.



Failure to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends to our shareholders could cause the
market price for our common stock to decline.

Our payment of quarterly cash dividends will be subject to, among other
things, our financial position and results of operations, available cash and cash flow, capital requirements, and other factors. Any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends could cause the market price of our
common stock to decline. Moreover, in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends is reduced or discontinued, our failure or inability to resume paying cash dividends at historical levels could result in a lower market valuation of our common
stock.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations may negatively affect our
operating results.

Because we manufacture and sell our products abroad, our revenue, margins, operating costs and cash
flows are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. If the U.S. dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant
portion of our production costs are foreign-currency denominated. Conversely, there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially U.S. dollar denominated. Additionally, we negotiate and procure some of our component
requirements in U.S. dollars from non-U.S. based vendors. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other foreign currencies, some of our component suppliers may increase the price they charge for their components in order to maintain an equivalent profit
margin. If this occurs, it would have a negative impact on our operating results.

Prices for our products are substantially
U.S. dollar denominated even when sold to customers that are located outside the United States. Therefore, as a substantial portion of our sales are from countries outside the United States, fluctuations in currency exchanges rates, most notably the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, contribute to variations in sales of products in impacted jurisdictions and could adversely impact demand and revenue growth. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect
margins on sales of our products in countries outside the United States.

We have attempted to manage the impact of foreign
currency exchange rate changes by, among other things, entering into short-term, foreign exchange contracts. However, these contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the counterparty if currency controls are put in place.

Increases in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses and an increase in our operating costs.

Some of our OEM customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies, such
as ODMs, that provide manufacturing and fulfillment services to our OEM customers. Because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct OEM customers, this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks. Our
agreements with our OEM customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk. Additionally, as we attempt to expand our OEM and distribution channel sales into emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia,
India and China, the customers with the most success in these regions may have relatively short operating histories, making it more difficult for us to accurately assess the associated credit risks. Our acquisition of HGST has also resulted in an
increase to our customer credit risk given that we service many of the same customers. Any credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased risks, or as a result of credit losses from any significant customer, would increase our operating
costs, which may negatively impact our operating results.

Our operating results fluctuate, sometimes significantly, from
period to period due to many factors, which may result in a significant decline in our stock price.

Our quarterly
operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including:

•

the timing of orders from and shipment of products to major customers;

•

our product mix;

•

changes in the prices of our products;



•

manufacturing delays or interruptions;

•

acceptance by customers of competing products in lieu of our products;

•

variations in the cost of and lead times for components for our products;

•

limited availability of components that we obtain from a single or a limited number of suppliers;

•

seasonal and other fluctuations in demand for PCs often due to technological advances; and

•

availability and rates of transportation.

We often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter, which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter. As a result
of the above or other factors, our forecast of operating results for the quarter may differ materially from our actual financial results. If our results of operations fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could cause an
immediate and significant decline in our stock price.

We have made and continue to make a number of estimates and
assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting, and actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions.

We have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting. The highly technical nature of our products and the rapidly changing market
conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions. These changes have impacted our financial results in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Key estimates and assumptions
for us include:

•

price protection adjustments and other sales promotions and allowances on products sold to retailers, resellers and distributors;

•

inventory adjustments for write-down of inventories to lower of cost or market value (net realizable value);

•

testing of goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment;

•

reserves for doubtful accounts;

•

accruals for product returns;

•

accruals for warranty costs related to product defects;

•

accruals for litigation and other contingencies;

•

liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits; and

•

expensing of stock-based compensation.



The market price of our common stock is volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, extremely volatile. Factors that may significantly affect the
market price of our common stock include the following:

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, including those resulting from the seasonality of our business;

•

announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors, which may decrease the volume and profitability of sales of our existing products
and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence;

•

new products introduced by us or our competitors;

•

strategic actions by us or competitors, such as acquisitions and restructurings;

•

periods of severe pricing pressures due to oversupply or price erosion resulting from competitive pressures or industry consolidation;

•

developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights;

•

proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments or anticipated or pending investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us or
our competitors;

•

conditions and trends in the hard drive, computer, data and content management, storage and communication industries;

•

contraction in our operating results or growth rates that are lower than our previous high growth-rate periods;

•

failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates or changes in financial estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations
by financial analysts relating specifically to us or the storage industry in general; and

•

macroeconomic conditions that affect the market generally and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for our industry.

In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the stock prices and trading volumes that
affect the market prices of the stock of public companies, including us. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock. For example, expectations
concerning general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies. These fluctuations often appear to
be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies.

Securities class action lawsuits are often brought against
companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. A number of such suits have been filed against us in the past, and should any new lawsuits be filed, such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of
resources and management’s attention.

The resale of shares of common stock issued to Hitachi in connection with our
acquisition of HGST could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

On March 8, 2012, as partial
consideration for our acquisition of HGST, we issued 25 million shares of our common stock to Hitachi. We are required by the terms of an Investor Rights Agreement we entered into with Hitachi to file a Form S-3 registration statement with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on or before August 28, 2013 to register the resale by Hitachi of these shares of common stock. Sales of these shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may
occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, because we do not know when or in what amounts Hitachi may seek to sell these shares of common stock, uncertainty about the market price of our common stock could extend
for a significant period of time and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.



Current economic conditions have caused us difficulty in adequately protecting our
increased cash and cash equivalents from financial institution failures.

The uncertain global economic conditions and
volatile investment markets have caused us to hold more cash and cash equivalents than we would hold under normal circumstances. Since there has been an overall increase in demand for low-risk, U.S. government-backed securities with a limited supply
in the financial marketplace, we face increased difficulty in adequately protecting our increased cash and cash equivalents from possible sudden and unforeseeable failures by banks and other financial institutions. A failure of any of these
financial institutions in which deposits exceed FDIC limits could have an adverse impact on our financial position.

If our
internal controls are found to be ineffective, our stock price may be adversely affected.

Our most recent evaluation
resulted in our conclusion that as of June 28, 2013, in compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. If our internal control over financial reporting is found
to be ineffective or if we identify a material weakness in our financial reporting in future periods, investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which may adversely affect our stock price.

From time to time we may become subject to income tax audits or similar proceedings, and as a result we may incur additional costs and
expenses or owe additional taxes, interest and penalties that may negatively impact our operating results.

We are subject
to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, and our determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities. For example, as we have previously disclosed, we are under
examination by the Internal Revenue Service for certain fiscal years and in connection with that examination, we received Revenue Agent Reports seeking certain adjustments to income as disclosed in Part II, Item 8, Note 9 in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although we believe our tax positions are properly supported, the final timing and resolution of the notice of proposed adjustment and the audits are subject to
significant uncertainty and could result in our having to pay amounts to the applicable tax authority in order to resolve examination of our tax positions, which could result in an increase or decrease of our current estimate of unrecognized tax
benefits and may negatively impact our financial position, results of operations, net income or cash flows.

PART II

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Market Information for Common Stock

Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “WDC.” Until June 1, 2012, our common stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (“NYSE”) under the symbol “WDC.” The approximate number of holders of record of our common stock as of August 8, 2013 was 1,506.

The high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported by the NASDAQ and the NYSE, as applicable, for each quarter of 2013 and 2012 were as follows:

Repurchases of Equity Securities

The following table provides information about repurchases by us of our common stock during the quarter ended June 28, 2013:

(1)

On May 21, 2012, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized $1.5 billion for the repurchase of our common stock through May 18, 2017. On
September 13, 2012, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion for the repurchase of our common stock and the extension of our stock repurchase program until September 13, 2017. Repurchases
under our stock repurchase program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan.

Dividends to Shareholders

On September 13, 2012, we announced that
our Board of Directors had authorized the adoption of a quarterly cash dividend policy. Under the cash dividend policy, holders of our common stock receive dividends when and as declared by our Board of Directors. In 2013, we declared aggregate cash
dividends of $1.00 per share of our common stock, totaling $240 million, of which $181 million was paid during 2013. We may modify, suspend or cancel our cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time.

The following table provides information about the quarterly dividends our Board of Directors declared in fiscal 2013. We did not pay any
cash dividends to our stockholders in fiscal 2012.



Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

The Company’s U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the Western Digital Corporation 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”)
through which the participants may invest in the Company’s common stock through a common stock fund. The Company’s common stock held in the stock fund is purchased in open market transactions by the plan trustee. We recently discovered
that we exceeded the number of shares that we had registered for offers and sales under the 401(k) Plan and, therefore, failed to maintain an effective SEC registration statement for the 401(k) Plan. As a result, certain purchasers of common stock
through the common stock fund under the 401(k) Plan may have the right to rescind their purchases. The potential rescission rights are immaterial to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. On August 1, 2013, the Company filed a
new registration statement on Form S-8 to register offers and sales of shares under the 401(k) Plan after such date.



Stock Performance Graph

Selected Financial Data

Financial Highlights

This selected consolidated financial data should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes contained
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the subsequent reports filed with the SEC, as well as the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other reports entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.”

“Number of employees” excludes temporary employees and contractors. Results for HGST, the
magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya Corporation and Hoya Magnetics Singapore Pte. Ltd., and SiliconSystems Inc., which were acquired on March 8, 2012, June 30, 2010 and March 27, 2009, respectively, are included in
our operating results only after the dates of their acquisitions.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Forward-Looking Statements

The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. You are
urged to carefully review our description and examples of forward-looking statements included earlier in this Annual Report on Form 10-K immediately prior to Part I, under the heading “Forward-Looking Statements.” Forward-looking
statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review the disclosures we make concerning risks and other
factors that may affect our business and operating results, including those made in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and any of those made in our other reports filed with the SEC. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this document. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to publish revised forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document or to
reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Our Company

We are an industry-leading developer and manufacturer of storage solutions that enable people to create, manage, experience and preserve
digital content. We design and make storage devices and home entertainment products under the HGST, WD and G-Technology brands. Our principal products today are hard drives that use one or more rotating magnetic disks (“magnetic media”) to
store and allow fast access to data. Hard drives are today’s primary storage medium for digital content. We operate our global business through two independent subsidiaries due to regulatory requirements—HGST and WD, both long-time
innovators in the storage industry.

Acquisition

Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Holdings Pte. Ltd. (“HGST”) Acquisition

On March 8, 2012 (the “Closing Date”), we, through Western Digital Ireland (“WDI”), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, completed the acquisition (the “Acquisition”)
of all the issued and outstanding paid-up share capital of Viviti Technologies Ltd., known until shortly before the Acquisition as HGST, from Hitachi, Ltd. (“Hitachi”), pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated March 7, 2011,
among us, WDI, Hitachi and HGST. The Acquisition is intended over time, and subject to compliance with the regulatory conditions discussed below under “Maintenance of Competitive Requirement,” to result in a more efficient and innovative
customer-focused storage company. We do not expect to achieve significant operating expense synergies while the regulatory conditions are in effect.



The aggregate purchase price of the Acquisition amounted to approximately $4.7 billion. The
purchase price consideration originally included preliminary estimates of the working capital assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Based on a final post-closing adjustment, the cash portion of the purchase price decreased by a net $27 million as
a result of $37 million we received during 2013 for a post-closing adjustment related to changes in the working capital of HGST, partially offset by $10 million we paid during 2013 for a post-closing assumed pension adjustment. The purchase price
was finalized prior to March 8, 2013, which was the final date of the 12 month measurement period following the date of the Acquisition.

Toshiba Transactions

In connection with the regulatory approval process of
the Acquisition, we announced on May 15, 2012 that we had closed a transaction with Toshiba Corporation (“Toshiba”) to divest certain 3.5-inch hard drive assets and to purchase Toshiba Storage Device (Thailand) Company Limited
(“TSDT”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Toshiba that manufactured hard drives prior to the Thailand flooding. The net impact of these two transactions was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. In August 2013, we received a
$45 million insurance recovery related to facilities acquired in connection with the acquisition of TSDT.

Maintenance of
Competitive Requirement

In connection with the regulatory approval process of the Acquisition, we agreed to certain
conditions required by the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China (“MOFCOM”), including adopting measures to maintain HGST as an independent competitor until MOFCOM agrees otherwise (with the minimum period being two
years from the Closing Date). We worked closely with MOFCOM to finalize an operations plan that outlines in more detail the conditions of the competitive requirement.

Pending Acquisition of sTec

On June 24, 2013, we entered into a
definitive merger agreement under which sTec will be acquired by HGST. The aggregate purchase price is estimated to be approximately $340 million in cash. This represents approximately $207 million in enterprise value, net of sTec’s cash as of
March 31, 2013. The pending acquisition when completed will augment HGST’s existing solid-state storage capabilities, accelerating its ability to expand its participation in the rapidly growing area of enterprise SSDs. The pending
acquisition, which is subject to closing customary conditions, is expected to be completed in the third or fourth calendar quarter of 2013.

Results of Operations

Fiscal 2013 Overview

In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), operating results for HGST, which was acquired on March 8, 2012, are included in our
operating results only after the date of its acquisition.

In 2013, our net revenue increased by 23% to $15.4 billion on
hard drive shipments of 242 million units as compared to $12.5 billion and 202 million units in 2012. In 2013, 50% of our net revenue was derived from non-PC (personal computer) markets, which include enterprise applications, branded
products and CE products, as compared to 19% in 2012. Hard drive average selling price (“ASP”) decreased to $61 in 2013 from $62 in 2012. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to 28.4% in 2013 from 29.2% in 2012. Operating
income decreased from $1.8 billion in 2012 to $1.3 billion in 2013, which included a $681 million charge related to an arbitration award as well as $138 million of employee termination benefits and other charges. As a percentage of net revenue,
operating income was 8.2% in 2013 compared to 14.2% in 2012. Net income in 2013 was $1.0 billion, or $3.98 per diluted share, compared to $1.6 billion, or $6.58 per diluted share, in 2012.

For the September quarter, we expect overall hard drive industry shipments to increase modestly to approximately 135 million to
140 million units from the June quarter’s 133 million units primarily due to a seasonal increase in consumer electronics and branded product shipments. We expect our revenue in the September quarter to remain flat or increase slightly
from the June quarter reflecting modest price declines and a seasonal change in business mix.



Summary Comparison of 2013, 2012 and 2011

The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, selected summary information from our consolidated statements of income by
dollars and percentage of net revenue (in millions, except percentages):

The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, summary information regarding unit shipments,
ASPs and revenues by geography and channel (in millions, except percentages and ASPs):

*

Based on sales of hard drive units only.

Fiscal Year 2013 Compared to Fiscal Year 2012

Net Revenue.

Net
revenue was $15.4 billion for 2013, an increase of 23% from 2012. Total hard drive shipments in 2013 increased to 242 million units as compared to 202 million units for the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from the contribution
of a full year of HGST operations, partially offset by continued soft industry demand as well as a $1 decrease in ASP from $62 to $61.

Changes in revenue by geography and channel generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics. In addition, as a result of our acquisition of HGST, our revenue by channel mix
has become more heavily weighted toward OEM.

Consistent with standard industry practice, we have sales incentive and
marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. For 2013, these programs represented 8% of gross revenues compared to 6% in 2012. These amounts
generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions, seasonal demand, competitor actions, channel mix and overall availability of product.



Gross Profit.

Gross profit for 2013 was $4.4 billion, an increase of
$725 million, or 20%, from the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 28.4% in 2013 from 29.2% in 2012. This percentage decrease was primarily due to a decrease in ASP as well as $101 million of incremental
amortization, reflecting a full year of amortization for intangibles related to the Acquisition.

Operating
Expenses.

Total research and development (“R&D”) expense and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense increased to 14.8% of net revenue in 2013 compared to 12.6% in 2012. R&D expense was
$1.6 billion in 2013, an increase of $517 million, or 49%, over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the inclusion of HGST’s R&D expense for the full year period as well as continued investment in product development to
support new programs. As a percentage of net revenue, R&D expense increased to 10.2% in 2013 compared to 8.5% in 2012. SG&A expense was $706 million in 2013, an increase of $188 million, or 36%, as compared to 2012. This increase
in SG&A expense was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of HGST’s SG&A expense and amortization of intangibles related to the Acquisition, partially offset by the inclusion of acquisition-related expenses in the prior-year
period. SG&A expense as a percentage of net revenue increased to 4.6% in 2013 compared to 4.2% in 2012.

During 2013, we
recorded a $681 million charge related to an arbitration award for claims brought against us and a now former employee by Seagate Technology LLC (“Seagate”), alleging misappropriation of confidential information and trade secrets. For
further detail see “Arbitration Award” section below.

During 2013, we recorded $138 million of employee termination
benefits and other charges. These charges consisted of $109 million of employee termination benefits, $14 million of asset impairment charges and $15 million of other charges. During 2012, we recorded $56 million of asset impairment charges, $16
million of contract termination and other exit costs and $8 million of employee termination benefits. In addition, during 2012, we recorded $214 million of net charges related to the flooding in Thailand, including $119 million of fixed asset
impairments, $61 million of recovery charges, $28 million of write-downs of damaged inventory and $27 million in wage continuation during the shutdown period of our facilities, offset by $21 million of insurance recoveries and other cost
reimbursements.

Other Income (Expense).

Other expense, net was $44 million in 2013 compared to $14 million
in 2012. Interest expense increased from $26 million in 2012 to $55 million in 2013, primarily due to interest on a higher debt balance since the Acquisition. Interest income decreased slightly from $12 million in 2012 to $11 million in 2013
primarily due to a lower average daily invested cash balance for the period.

Income Tax Provision.

Income tax
expense was $242 million in 2013 as compared to $145 million in 2012. Tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 19.8% in 2013 compared to 8.3% in 2012. Our income tax provision for 2013 also reflects a tax benefit of $37
million as a result of the retroactive extension of the U.S. Federal research and experimentation tax credit (“R&D credit”) that was signed into law on January 2, 2013 as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The
R&D credit, which had previously expired on December 31, 2011, was extended through December 31, 2013. The differences between the effective tax rate and the U.S. Federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand that expire at various dates from 2014 through 2025, the current year generation of income tax credits and the effect of California Proposition 39.

On November 6, 2012, California voters approved California Proposition 39, which affects California state income tax apportionment
for most multi-state taxpayers for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2013. This proposition reduces our future income apportioned to California, making it less likely for us to realize certain California deferred tax assets. As a
result, we recorded an $88 million charge in 2013 to reduce our previously recognized California deferred tax assets as of December 28, 2012.

As of June 28, 2013, we had a recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $240 million. We recognized a net decrease of $40 million in our liability for unrecognized tax
benefits during 2013. Interest and penalties recognized on such amounts were not material.

The Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) had completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 and issued Revenue Agent Reports (“RARs”) that proposed adjustments to income before income taxes of approximately $970
million primarily related to transfer pricing and intercompany payable balances. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office. In June 2013, we reached an agreement with the IRS to resolve the transfer
pricing issue. This agreement resulted in a decrease in the amount of net operating loss and tax credits realized, but did not have an impact to our consolidated statements of income. The proposed adjustment relating to intercompany payable balances
for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 will be addressed in conjunction with the IRS’s examination of our fiscal years 2008 and 2009, which commenced in January 2012. In addition, in January 2012, the IRS commenced an examination of the 2007 fiscal
period ended September 5, 2007 of Komag, Incorporated (“Komag”). In February 2013, the IRS commenced an examination of calendar years 2010 and 2011 of HGST, which was acquired by us on March 8, 2012.



We believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from
tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, we could be required to adjust our
provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. As of June 28, 2013, it is not possible to estimate the amount of change, if any, in the unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve months. Any
significant change in the amount of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits would most likely result from additional information or settlements relating to the examination of our uncertain tax positions.

Arbitration Award

As disclosed below in Part II, Item 8, Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on November 18, 2011, a sole arbitrator ruled against
us in an arbitration in Minnesota. The arbitration involves claims brought by Seagate against us and a now former employee, alleging misappropriation of confidential information and trade secrets. The arbitrator issued an interim award against us in
the amount of $525 million plus pre-award interest. On January 23, 2012, the arbitrator issued a final award adding pre-award interest in the amount of $105.4 million, for a total award of $630.4 million. On January 23, 2012, we filed a
petition in the District Court of Hennepin County, Minnesota to have the final arbitration award vacated, and a hearing on the petition to vacate was held on March 1, 2012. On October 12, 2012, the District Court of Hennepin County,
Minnesota vacated, in full, the $630.4 million final arbitration award and ordered that a rehearing be held concerning certain trade secret claims before a new arbitrator. On October 30, 2012, Seagate initiated an appeal of the District
Court’s decision with the Minnesota Court of Appeals. Oral arguments in the appeal were held on April 24, 2013. On July 22, 2013, the Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s decision and remanded for entry of an
order and judgment confirming the arbitration award. We strongly disagree with the decision of the Court of Appeals, believe that the District Court’s decision was correct, and will file a petition for review with the Minnesota Supreme Court.
If the Minnesota Supreme Court elects not to hear our petition for review or affirms the Court of Appeals decision, the District Court is expected to enter an order and judgment confirming the $630.4 million final arbitration award, plus post-award
interest on the $525 million initial award at the statutory rate of 10% from January 24, 2012. No judgment will be entered while we are petitioning the Minnesota Supreme Court. We will continue to vigorously defend this matter. Nevertheless, in
light of uncertainties, including the fact that the review of the Court of Appeals decision by the Minnesota Supreme Court is discretionary, we recorded an accrual of $681 million for this matter in our financial statements for the three months
ended June 28, 2013. This amount is in addition to the $25 million previously accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The total amount accrued of $706 million represents the amount of the final arbitration award, plus interest accrued on
the initial arbitration award at the statutory rate of 10% from January 24, 2012 through June 28, 2013.

Fiscal Year 2012
Compared to Fiscal Year 2011

Net Revenue.

Net revenue was $12.5 billion for 2012, an increase of 31% from
2011. Operations from HGST contributed $3.1 billion in net revenue. Total hard drive shipments in 2012 decreased to 202 million units as compared to 207 million units for the prior year. The increase in net revenue resulted primarily from
a $17 increase in ASP from $45 to $62, partially offset by lower shipments. These changes were as a result of the severe supply constraints across the hard drive industry brought about by the Thailand floods.

Changes in revenue by geography and channel generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics. However,
during 2012, changes in revenue by geography and channel reflected our efforts to allocate products to our customers as a result of the flooding in Thailand by balancing their immediate needs with their prevailing inventory positions in order to
maximize the availability of hard drive products to the end customer within the shortest time horizon. In addition, as a result of our acquisition of HGST, our revenue by channel mix has become more heavily weighted toward OEM.

In accordance with standard industry practice, we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price
protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. For 2012, these programs represented 6% of gross revenues compared to 11% in 2011. This decrease was mainly driven by the severe supply constraints
brought about by the Thailand floods. These amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions, seasonal demand, competitor actions, channel mix and overall availability of product.

Gross Margin.

Gross margin for 2012 was $3.6 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 103%, from the prior year.
Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue increased to 29.2% in 2012 from 18.8% in 2011. This percentage increase was primarily due to an increase in ASP brought about by the impact of the Thailand flooding, offset by $91 million for costs
recognized upon the sale of inventory that was written-up to fair value and $48 million for amortization of intangibles related to the Acquisition.

Operating Expenses.

Total R&D expense and SG&A expense increased to 12.6% of net revenue in 2012 compared to 10.6% in 2011. R&D expense was $1.1 billion in 2012, an increase
of $352 million, or 50%, over the prior year. This increase in R&D expense was primarily due to increased expense related to the business of HGST and the continued investment in product development to support new programs. As a percentage of net
revenue, R&D expense increased to 8.5% in 2012 compared to 7.4% in 2011. SG&A expense was $518 million in 2012, an increase of $211 million, or 69%, as compared to 2011. This increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to
increased expense related to the business of HGST, the expansion of sales and marketing to support new products and growing markets, $37 million of incremental expenses related to the acquisition of HGST and $15 million for amortization of
intangibles related to the Acquisition. SG&A expense as a percentage of net revenue increased to 4.2% in 2012 compared to 3.2% in 2011.



During 2012, we recorded $214 million of net charges related to the flooding in Thailand,
including $119 million of fixed asset impairments, $61 million of recovery charges, $28 million of write-downs of damaged inventory and $27 million in wage continuation during the shutdown period of our facilities, offset by $21 million of insurance
recoveries and other cost reimbursements.

In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2012, we recorded $56 million of asset
impairment charges, $16 million of contract termination and other exit costs and $8 million of employee termination benefits.

Other Income (Expense).

Other expense, net was $14 million in 2012 compared to $1 million in 2011. Interest expense
increased from $10 million in 2011 to $26 million in 2012, primarily due to interest on a higher debt balance and a $5 million increase in debt commitment fees incurred prior to the closing of the Acquisition, offset by $4 million of gains on sales
of our investments. Interest income increased from $9 million in 2011 to $12 million in 2012 due to higher average daily invested cash balances.

Income Tax Provision.

Income tax expense was $145 million in 2012 as compared to $54 million in 2011. Tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 8.3% in 2012 compared to
6.9% for 2011. The differences between the effective tax rate and the U.S. Federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand that expire at various dates through 2025 and the current
year generation of income tax credits.

As of June 29, 2012, we had a recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits of
approximately $280 million, which includes $39 million assumed in the Acquisition. Aside from the increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to liabilities assumed in the Acquisition, we recognized a net decrease of
$4 million in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2012. Interest and penalties recognized on such amounts were not material.

The IRS has completed its field examination of the federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 for us and calendar years 2005 and 2006 for Komag, which was acquired by us on
September 5, 2007. In September 2011, we received a final RAR and Closing Agreement with respect to the years under examination for Komag. This agreement resulted in an immaterial benefit to our income tax provision. We have also received RARs
from the IRS that seek adjustments to income before income taxes of approximately $970 million in connection with unresolved issues related primarily to transfer pricing and intercompany payable balances. We disagree with the proposed adjustments
and in May 2011, we filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office. In January 2012, the IRS commenced an examination of our fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and Komag’s period ended September 5, 2007.

We believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax
audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such
resolution occurs. As of June 29, 2012, it was not possible to estimate the amount of change, if any, in the unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve months. Any significant change in the amount of our
unrecognized tax benefits would most likely result from additional information or settlements relating to the examination of our tax returns.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We ended 2013 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.3 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion from June 29, 2012. The following table summarizes our statements of cash flows for the three
years ended June 28, 2013 (in millions):



Our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and
liquidity while maximizing return through the full investment of available funds. In connection with our Acquisition, we entered into a five-year credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”), which provides for a $500 million revolving credit
facility. In addition, we may elect to expand the Credit Facility by up to an additional $500 million if existing or new lenders provide additional term or revolving commitments. We believe our current cash, cash equivalents and cash generated from
operations as well as our available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital, debt, dividend, stock repurchase and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to sustain our working capital
position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

A total of
$2.8 billion and $1.7 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the United States at June 28, 2013 and June 29, 2012, respectively. Substantially all of the amounts held outside of the United States are intended to be
indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. If we are required to pay the arbitration award described in the section “Arbitration Award” above, the award would be paid from one of our foreign subsidiaries using cash and cash equivalents
held outside of the United States. On September 13, 2012, our Board of Directors approved a capital allocation plan which includes repurchases of our common stock and the adoption of a quarterly cash dividend policy. Our current plans do not
anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations or capital allocation plan. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed in the United States, any repatriation could result in the accrual
and payment of additional U.S. income tax.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.1 billion in both 2013 and 2012 as compared to $1.7 billion in 2011. Cash flow from
operating activities consists of net income, adjusted for non-cash charges, plus or minus working capital changes. This represents our principal source of cash. Net cash provided by working capital changes was $715 million for 2013 as compared to
$324 million for 2012 and $238 million for 2011.

Our working capital requirements primarily depend on the effective
management of our cash conversion cycle, which measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash through sales. The average quarterly cash conversion cycles for the three years ended 2013 were as follows:

For 2013, our average days sales outstanding (“DSOs”) decreased by 6 days, days in inventory
(“DIOs”) increased by 2 days, and days payables outstanding (“DPOs”) decreased by 17 days. Changes in average DSOs and DIOs are generally related to linearity of shipments and the timing of inventory builds, respectively. Changes
in DPOs are generally related to production volume and the timing of purchases during the period. In the prior-year period, the higher DSOs, DIOs and DPOs were primarily due to the impact of including HGST’s accounts receivable, inventory and
accounts payable balances as of June 29, 2012, but only including HGST’s revenue and cost of sales from the date of Acquisition. From time to time, we modify the timing of payments to our vendors. We make modifications primarily to manage
our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows, including our cash balances. Generally, we make the payment modifications through negotiations with our vendors or by granting to, or receiving from, our vendors’ payment term
accommodations.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities for 2013 was $970 million as compared to $4.2 billion for 2012 and $793 million for 2011. During 2013, cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of
$952 million of capital expenditures and $17 million related to the purchase of investments. Capital expenditures in 2013 primarily consisted of flood recovery and increased capacity for our broadening and growing product portfolio. During 2012,
cash used in investing activities consisted of $3.5 billion, net of cash acquired, used for the acquisitions, $76 million of proceeds related to the sale of equipment, and capital expenditures of $717 million. During 2011, cash used in investing
activities consisted of capital expenditures of $778 million and $15 million for equipment related to the acquisition of a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility.

Our cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid money market funds that are invested in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Treasury bills and U.S. Government agency securities. We also have
$14 million of auction-rate securities, which are classified as available-for-sale securities in our consolidated balance sheets.



Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $1.0 billion for 2013 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of
$819 million for 2012 and net cash used in financing activities of $106 million for 2011. Net cash used in financing activities for 2013 consisted of $842 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock, $181 million used to pay dividends
on our common stock and $230 million used to repay long-term debt, offset by a net $205 million provided by employee stock plans. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2012 consisted of the $2.8 billion of proceeds borrowed under the Credit
Facility in connection with the Acquisition, net of issuance costs, and a net $141 million provided by employee stock plans, offset by $604 million used to repurchase stock and $1.5 billion used to repay our outstanding debt as well as debt assumed
in the Acquisition. Net cash used in financing activities for 2011 consisted of $106 million used to repay long-term debt and $50 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock, offset by a net $50 million related to employee
stock plans.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Other than facility lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business and certain indemnification provisions (see “Contractual Obligations and Commitments” below), we do not have any
off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in transferred assets, or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. We do not have any
majority-owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we do not have an interest in, or relationships with, any special-purpose entities.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

The following is a summary of our
known contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as of June 28, 2013 (in millions):

*

Included within our consolidated balance sheet

Long-Term Debt

On March 8, 2012, in connection with the Acquisition,
WDI and WDT (collectively, the “Borrowers”) entered into the Credit Facility that provides for $2.8 billion of unsecured loan facilities, consisting of a $2.3 billion term loan facility and a $500 million revolving credit facility. In
addition, the Borrowers may elect to expand the Credit Facility by up to an additional $500 million if existing or new lenders provide additional term or revolving commitments. As of June 28, 2013, the outstanding balance of the term loan
facility was $2.0 billion. We are required to make principal payments on the term loan facility totaling $230 million a year for fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2016, and the remaining $1.3 billion balance (subject to adjustment to reflect prepayments or
an increase to its term loan facility) due and payable in full in fiscal 2017 on March 8, 2017. As of June 28, 2013, $500 million was available for future borrowings on the revolving credit facility. See Part II, Item 8, Note 3 in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The Credit Facility requires us to
comply with a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio calculated on a consolidated basis for us and our subsidiaries. In addition, the Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict, subject to certain
exceptions, our ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, make certain restricted payments, merge, consolidate or dispose of substantially all of our assets, enter into certain speculative hedging arrangements and make any material change in the
nature of our business. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, the administrative agent at the request, or with the consent, of the Required Lenders (as defined in the Credit Facility) may cease making loans, terminate
the Credit Facility and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, require the cash collateralization of letters of credit and/or exercise all other rights and remedies available to it, the lenders and the letter of credit
issuer. The Credit Facility specifies a number of events of default (some of which are subject to applicable grace or cure periods), including, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material
indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, material judgment defaults and a change of control default. As of June 28, 2013, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility.



Purchase Orders

In the normal course of business, we enter into purchase orders with suppliers for the purchase of hard drive components used to
manufacture our products. These purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter, are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the components, and generally may be changed or canceled at any
time prior to shipment of the components. We also enter into purchase orders with suppliers for capital equipment that are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the equipment. Our ability to change or cancel a capital equipment purchase order
without penalty depends on the nature of the equipment being ordered. In some cases, we may be obligated to pay for certain costs related to changes to, or cancellation of, a purchase order, such as costs incurred for raw materials or work in
process of components or capital equipment.

We have entered into long-term purchase agreements with various component
suppliers, containing minimum quantity requirements. However, the dollar amount of the purchases may depend on the specific products ordered, achievement of pre-defined quantity or quality specifications or future price negotiations. The estimated
related minimum purchase requirements are included in “Purchase obligations” in the table above. We have also entered into long-term purchase agreements with various component suppliers that carry fixed volumes and pricing which obligate
us to make certain future purchases, contingent on certain conditions of performance, quality and technology of the vendor’s components. These arrangements are included under “Purchase obligations” in the table above.

We enter into, from time to time, other long-term purchase agreements for components with certain vendors. Generally, future purchases
under these agreements are not fixed and determinable as they depend on our overall unit volume requirements and are contingent upon the prices, technology and quality of the supplier’s products remaining competitive. These arrangements are not
included under “Purchase obligations” in the table above. Please see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of risks related to commitments.

Foreign Exchange Contracts

We purchase short-term, foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets, revenue, liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and
product costs denominated in foreign currencies. See Part II, Item 7A, under the heading “Disclosure About Foreign Currency Risk,” for a description of our current foreign exchange contract commitments and Part II,
Item 8, Notes 1 and 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, we may provide
indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of agreements, products or services to
be provided by us, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us, among other things, to
indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. We maintain director and officer insurance, which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our
directors and officers in certain circumstances.

It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these
indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses.
Historically, we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements.

Unrecognized Tax
Benefits

As of June 28, 2013, the cash portion of our total recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits was
$208 million. We estimate the timing of the future payments of these liabilities to be within the next one to eight years. See Part II, Item 8, Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our total tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits.



Stock Repurchase Program

On May 21, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized $1.5 billion for the repurchase of our common stock through
May 18, 2017. On September 13, 2012, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion for the repurchase of our common stock and the extension of our stock repurchase program until September 13, 2017. We
repurchased 19.0 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of $842 million in 2013. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our stock repurchase program as of June 28, 2013 was $2.0 billion. Subsequent to
June 28, 2013 and through August 16, 2013, we repurchased an additional 2.3 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of $150 million. We may continue to repurchase our common stock as we deem appropriate and market
conditions allow. Repurchases under our stock repurchase program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan. We expect stock repurchases to be funded principally by operating cash
flows.

Cash Dividend Policy

On September 13, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the adoption of a quarterly cash dividend policy. Under the cash dividend policy, holders of our common stock receive
dividends when and as declared by our Board of Directors. In 2013, we declared aggregate cash dividends of $1.00 per share of our common stock, totaling $240 million, of which $181 million was paid during 2013. We may modify, suspend or cancel our
cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time. See Part II, Item 5 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have prepared the
accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and
shareholders’ equity. We have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate. We believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and
involve judgment and estimates made by us. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material.

Revenue and Accounts Receivable

In accordance with standard industry
practice, we provide distributors and retailers (collectively referred to as “resellers”) with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions, and we provide resellers and OEMs
with other sales incentive programs. At the time we recognize revenue to resellers and OEMs, we record a reduction of revenue for estimated price protection until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers and we also record a reduction of
revenue for the other programs in effect. We base these adjustments on several factors including anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period, resellers’ sell-through and inventory levels, estimated amounts to be reimbursed to
qualifying customers, historical pricing information and customer claim processing. If customer demand for hard drives or market conditions differs from our expectations, our operating results could be materially affected. We also have programs
under which we reimburse qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing expenditures, which are recorded as a reduction of revenue. These amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions, seasonal demand,
competitor actions, channel mix and overall availability of product. Generally, total sales incentive and marketing programs range from 7% to 11% of gross revenues per quarter. For 2013, sales incentive and marketing programs were 8% of gross
revenues. Changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue from the current range. Adjustments to revenues due to changes in accruals for these programs related
to revenues reported in prior periods have averaged 0.5% of quarterly gross revenue since the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Customer sales incentive and marketing programs are recorded as a reduction of revenue.

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency,
disputes or other collection issues. In addition, we routinely analyze the different receivable aging categories and establish reserves based on a combination of past due receivables and expected future losses based primarily on our historical
levels of bad debt losses. If the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due, or if our overall loss history changes significantly, an adjustment in our allowance for doubtful
accounts would be required, which could materially affect operating results.

We establish provisions against revenue and cost
of revenue for sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized. We base these provisions on existing product return notifications. If actual sales returns exceed expectations, an increase in the sales return accrual would be
required, which could materially affect operating results.



Warranty

We record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized. We generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years. Our warranty provision considers estimated product
failure rates and trends, estimated replacement costs, estimated repair costs which include scrap costs, and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues, if any. We use a statistical warranty tracking model to
help prepare our estimates and assist us in exercising judgment in determining the underlying estimates. Our statistical tracking model captures specific detail on hard drive reliability, such as factory test data, historical field return rates, and
costs to repair by product type. Our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited field experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates. We review our
warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty. Any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact current period gross profit and income. Such changes are
generally a result of differences between forecasted and actual return rate experience and costs to repair. If actual product return trends, costs to repair returned products or costs of customer compensatory claims differ significantly from our
estimates, our future results of operations could be materially affected. For a summary of historical changes in estimates related to pre-existing warranty provisions, refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Inventories

We value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out and weighted average methods) or net realizable value. We use the first-in,
first-out (“FIFO”) method to value the cost of the majority of our inventories, while we use the weighted-average method to value precious metal inventories. Weighted-average cost is calculated based upon the cost of precious metals at the
time they are received by us. We have determined that it is not practicable to assign specific costs to individual units of precious metals and, as such, we relieve our precious metals inventory based on the weighted-average cost of the inventory at
the time the inventory is used in production. The weighted average method of valuing precious metals does not materially differ from a FIFO method. We record inventory write-downs for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable
value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances.

We evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand, inventory on hand, sales levels and other information, and reduce inventory balances
to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis. Unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products, which may require a write down of
inventory that could materially affect operating results.

Litigation and Other Contingencies

When we become aware of a claim or potential claim, we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure. We disclose information regarding
each material claim where the likelihood of a loss contingency is probable or reasonably possible. If a loss contingency is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record an accrual for the loss. In such cases, there may
be an exposure to potential loss in excess of the amount accrued. Where a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible, or where a loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably possible, we disclose an estimate of the amount of the loss or
range of possible losses for the claim if a reasonable estimate can be made, unless the amount of such reasonably possible losses is not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The ability to predict the ultimate
outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. The actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 5 in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized
for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance when it is more
likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Each period, we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the
extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized.

We recognize liabilities
for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. To the extent a tax position does not meet a more-likely-than-not level of certainty, no benefit is recognized in the financial statements. If a position meets the more-likely-than-not level
of certainty, it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on
liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in our provision for income taxes. The actual liability for unrealized tax benefits in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the
need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previously-recorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits and materially affect our operating results.



Stock-based Compensation

We account for all stock-based compensation at fair value. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value
of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. The fair values of all stock options and cash-settled stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) granted are estimated using a binomial model, and the fair values of all Employee
Stock Purchase Plan purchase rights are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. We account for SARs as liability awards based upon our intention to settle such awards in cash. The SARs liability is recognized for that portion
of fair value for the service period rendered at the reporting date. The share-based liability is remeasured at each reporting date through the requisite service period. Both the binomial and the Black-Scholes-Merton models require the input of
highly subjective assumptions. We are required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate, stock-based compensation expense
and our results of operations could be materially affected.

Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets

The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition are recognized at the acquisition date, with amounts
exceeding the fair values being recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized. Instead, it is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. During
2013, we changed the date of our annual impairment test from the last day of May to the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter. We believe changing the test date to the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter is preferable as it allows us additional
time to complete the impairment test.

We first use qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is more likely than not
impaired. If we conclude from the qualitative assessment that goodwill is more likely than not impaired, we follow a two-step approach to quantify the impairment.

We are required to use judgment when applying the goodwill impairment test, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill
to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. In addition, the estimates used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit may change based on results of operations, macroeconomic conditions or other factors.
Changes in these estimates could materially affect our assessment of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.

Other intangible assets consist primarily of technology acquired in business combinations and in-process research and development. In-process research and development is not amortized. Instead, it is
tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. Acquired intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives.
Long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If impairment is indicated, the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

For a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption and expected
effects on our results of operations and financial condition, refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference in
response to this item.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Disclosure About Foreign Currency Risk

Although the majority of our
transactions are in U.S. dollars, some transactions are based in various foreign currencies. We purchase short-term, foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets, revenue,
liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies. The purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations.
The contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months. We do not purchase foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes. Currently, we focus on hedging our foreign currency risk related to the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Japanese Yen,
Malaysian Ringgit, Philippine Peso, Singapore Dollar and Thai Baht. See Part II, Item 8, Notes 1 and 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



As of June 28, 2013, we had outstanding the following purchased foreign exchange
contracts (in millions, except weighted average contract rate):

*

Expressed in units of foreign currency per U.S. dollar

In 2013, 2012 and 2011, total net realized transaction and foreign exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements.

Disclosure About Other Market Risks

Variable Interest Rate Risk

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear
interest at a rate equal to, at the option of the applicable Borrower, either (a) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, subject to certain
exceptions (the “Eurodollar Rate”) or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate as announced by Bank of America, N.A. and (iii) the Eurodollar
Rate plus 1.00% (the “Base Rate”), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under the Credit Facility ranges from 1.50% to 2.50% with respect to borrowings at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.50% to 1.50% with
respect to borrowings at the Base Rate. The applicable margins for borrowings under the Credit Facility are determined based upon a leverage ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis. If the federal funds rate,
prime rate or LIBOR rate increase, our interest payments could also increase. A one percent increase in the variable rate of interest on the term loan facility would increase interest expense by approximately $20 million annually.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Western Digital Corporation:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 28, 2013 and June 29, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 28, 2013. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the related financial statement schedule. These consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 28, 2013 and June 29, 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended June 28, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Western Digital Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 28, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated August 16, 2013, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Western Digital Corporation:

We have audited Western Digital Corporation’s
internal control over financial reporting as of June 28, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Western Digital Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 28, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated
balance sheets of Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 28, 2013 and July 29, 2012, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended June 28, 2013, and the related financial statement schedule, and our report dated August 16, 2013, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Western Digital Corporation (the “Company” or “Western Digital”) is an industry-leading developer
and manufacturer of storage solutions that enable people to create, manage, experience and preserve digital content. The Company designs and makes storage devices and home entertainment products under the HGST, WD and G-Technology brands. The
Company’s principal products today are hard drives that use one or more rotating magnetic disks (“magnetic media”) to store and allow fast access to data. Hard drives are today’s primary storage medium for digital content. The
Company operates its global business through two independent subsidiaries due to regulatory requirements—HGST and WD, both long-time innovators in the storage industry.

The Company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and has adopted accounting
policies and practices which are generally accepted in the industry in which it operates. The Company’s significant accounting policies are summarized below.

Fiscal Year

The Company has a 52 or 53-week fiscal year. The 2013, 2012
and 2011 fiscal years which ended on June 28, 2013, June 29, 2012 and July 1, 2011, respectively, consisted of 52 weeks each.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In fiscal 2013, the accounts for all foreign subsidiaries have been remeasured using the U.S.
dollar as the functional currency. In fiscal 2012, the accounts for all foreign subsidiaries, except for one Japanese subsidiary in which Yen was the functional currency, have been remeasured using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency.
Gains or losses resulting from remeasurement or translation of these accounts from local currencies into U.S. dollars were immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.

On March 8, 2012 (“Closing Date”), the Company completed its acquisition (“the Acquisition”) of all of the
issued and paid-up share capital of Viviti Technologies Ltd., known until shortly before the Acquisition as Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Holdings Pte. Ltd. (“HGST”) from Hitachi, Ltd. (“Hitachi”). The acquisition is
further described in Note 14. The results of operations of HGST since the date of Acquisition are included in the consolidated financial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company’s cash equivalents represent
highly liquid investments in money market funds, which are invested in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Treasury bills and U.S. Government agency securities with original maturities when purchased of three months or less.

Investments

The Company’s investments consist of auction-rate securities, which are primarily backed by insurance products with original maturities greater than three months. The Company has classified these
investments as available-for-sale securities and they are carried at fair value within other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company enters into certain strategic investments for the promotion of business and
strategic objectives. These strategic investments are recorded at cost within other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and are periodically analyzed to determine whether or not there are indicators of impairment.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value for all periods presented because of the short-term maturity of
these assets and liabilities or, in the case of investments, these are recorded using appropriate market information. The carrying amount of debt approximates fair value because of its variable interest rate.



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company sells its products to computer manufacturers, resellers and retailers throughout the world. The Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally requires no collateral. The Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses, and such losses have historically been within management’s expectations. At any
given point in time, the total amount outstanding from any one of a number of its customers may be individually significant to the Company’s financial results. At both June 28, 2013 and June 29, 2012, the Company had reserves for
potential credit losses of $9 million, and net accounts receivable of $1.8 billion and $2.4 billion at each date, respectively.

The Company also has cash equivalent and investment policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or investment instrument and requires that investments be made only
with financial institutions or in investment instruments evaluated as highly credit-worthy.

Inventories

The Company values inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first out and weighted average methods) or net realizable value. The
first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method is used to value the cost of the majority of the Company’s inventories, while the weighted-average method is used to value precious metal inventories. Weighted-average cost is calculated based upon
the cost of precious metals at the time they are received by the Company. The Company has determined that it is not practicable to assign specific costs to individual units of precious metals and, as such, precious metals are relieved from inventory
based on the weighted-average cost of the inventory at the time the inventory is used in production. The weighted average method of valuing precious metals does not materially differ from a FIFO method. As of June 28, 2013 and June 29,
2012, 91% and 89%, respectively, of the inventory was valued using the FIFO method with the remainder valued using the weighted average method. Inventory write-downs are recorded for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable
value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances.

The Company evaluates inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand, inventory on hand, sales levels and other information, and reduces
inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis. Unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of the Company’s products, which
may require a write down of inventory that could materially affect operating results.

Property, Plant and Equipment

The cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The
Company’s buildings are depreciated over periods ranging from fifteen to thirty years. The majority of the Company’s equipment is depreciated over periods of two to seven years. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the related lease terms.

Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets

The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition are recognized at the acquisition date, with amounts exceeding the fair values being recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is
not amortized. Instead, it is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. During 2013, the Company changed the date of its annual impairment test
from the last day of May to the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter. The Company believes changing the test date to the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter is preferable as it should allow the Company additional time to complete the impairment
test.

The Company first uses qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is more likely than not impaired. If the
Company concludes from the qualitative assessment that goodwill is more likely than not impaired, it follows a two-step approach to quantify the impairment.

The Company is required to use judgment when applying the goodwill impairment test, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of
goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. In addition, the estimates used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit may change based on results of operations, macroeconomic conditions or other
factors. Changes in these estimates could materially affect the Company’s assessment of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. The Company did not record any impairment of goodwill during 2013, 2012, or 2011.



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Other intangible assets consist primarily of technology acquired in business
combinations and in-process research and development. In-process research and development is not amortized. Instead, it is instead tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
it may be impaired. Acquired intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. Long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying
amounts may not be recoverable. If impairment is indicated, the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The Company recorded impairments to certain long-lived assets in
2013 and 2012. See Notes 15 and 16. The Company did not record any impairment to long-lived assets in 2011.

Revenue and
Accounts Receivable

Revenue is recognized when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, there is persuasive
evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company establishes provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for
estimated sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized based on existing product return notifications. If actual sales returns exceed expectations, an increase in the sales return accrual would be required, which could
materially affect operating results.

In accordance with standard industry practice, the Company provides distributors and
retailers (collectively referred to as “resellers”) with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions, and the Company provides resellers and OEMs with other sales incentive
programs. At the time the Company recognizes revenue to resellers and OEMs, a reduction of revenue is recorded for estimated price protection until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers and the Company also records a reduction of
revenue for the other programs in effect. The Company bases these adjustments on several factors including anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period, reseller’s sell-through and inventory levels, estimated amounts to be
reimbursed to qualifying customers, historical pricing information and customer claim processing. If customer demand for hard drives or market conditions differ from the Company’s expectations, the Company’s operating results could be
materially affected. The Company also has programs under which it reimburses qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing expenditures, which are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Sales incentive and marketing programs are recorded
as a reduction of revenue.

The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and
assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency, disputes or other collection issues. In addition, the Company routinely analyzes the different receivable aging categories and establishes reserves based on a combination of past due receivables and
expected future losses based primarily on its historical levels of bad debt losses. If the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due, or if the Company’s overall loss
history changes significantly, an adjustment in the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts would be required, which could materially affect operating results.

Warranty

The Company records an accrual for estimated warranty costs when
revenue is recognized. The Company generally warrants its products for a period of one to five years. The warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends, estimated replacement costs, estimated repair costs which include
scrap costs, and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues, if any. A statistical warranty tracking model is used to help prepare estimates and assist the Company in exercising judgment in determining the
underlying estimates. The statistical tracking model captures specific detail on hard drive reliability, such as factory test data, historical field return rates, and costs to repair by product type. Management’s judgment is subject to a
greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited field experience with those products upon which to base warranty estimates. Management reviews the warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior
periods and which are still under warranty. Any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact current period gross profit and income. Such changes are generally a result of differences between forecasted and
actual return rate experience and costs to repair. If actual product return trends, costs to repair returned products or costs of customer compensatory claims differ significantly from estimates, future results of operations could be materially
affected.



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Litigation and Other Contingencies

When the Company becomes aware of a claim or potential claim, the Company assesses the likelihood of any loss or exposure. The Company
discloses information regarding each material claim where the likelihood of a loss contingency is probable or reasonably possible. If a loss contingency is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records an
accrual for the loss. In such cases, there may be an exposure to potential loss in excess of the amount accrued. Where a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible or where a loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably possible, the
Company discloses an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim if a reasonable estimate can be made, unless the amount of such reasonably possible losses is not material to the Company’s financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. The actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates.
See Note 5.

Advertising Expense

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Selling, general and administrative expenses of the Company included advertising costs of $61 million, $30 million and $11 million in 2013, 2012 and
2011, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting
basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss (“NOL”) and tax credit carryforwards. The Company records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. Each period, the Company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowance so that the Company records net deferred tax assets only to the extent that it has
concluded it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized.

The Company recognizes liabilities for
uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. To the extent a tax position does not meet a more-likely-than-not level of certainty, no benefit is recognized in the financial statements. If a position meets the more-likely-than-not level of
certainty, it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on
liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in the provision for income taxes. The actual liability for unrealized tax benefits in any such contingency may be materially different from the Company’s estimates, which could
result in the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previously-recorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits, and may materially affect the Company’s operating results.

Income per Common Share

The Company computes basic income per common share using net income and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per common share is computed using net
income and the weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares include certain dilutive outstanding employee stock options, rights to purchase shares
of common stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) and restricted stock unit awards (“RSUs”).

The following table illustrates the computation of basic and diluted income per common share (in millions, except per share data):

*

For purposes of computing diluted income per common share, certain potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the calculation because their effect would
have been anti-dilutive.



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Stock-based Compensation

The Company accounts for all stock-based compensation at fair value. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on
the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. The fair values of all stock options and cash-settled stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) granted are estimated using a binomial model, and the fair values of all
ESPP purchase rights are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The Company accounts for SARs as liability awards based upon management’s intention to settle such awards in cash. The SARs liability is recognized for that
portion of fair value for the service period rendered at the reporting date. The share-based liability is remeasured at each reporting date through the requisite service period. Both the binomial and the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing models
require the input of highly subjective assumptions. The Company is required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate,
stock-based compensation expense and the results of operations could be materially affected.

Other Comprehensive Income
(Loss)

Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that are recorded as an element of
shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net income. The Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts, actuarial gains and losses related to pensions and gains and
losses on foreign currency translation adjustments.

The following table illustrates the changes in the balances of each
component of accumulated comprehensive income for 2013, 2012 and 2011:

Foreign Exchange Contracts

Although the majority of the Company’s transactions are in U.S. dollars, some transactions are based in various foreign
currencies. The Company purchases short-term, foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets, revenue, liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs
denominated in foreign currencies. The purpose of entering into these hedging transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the Company’s results of operations. These contract maturity dates do not exceed
12 months. All foreign exchange contracts are for risk management purposes only. The Company does not purchase foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes. The Company had outstanding foreign exchange contracts with commercial banks for
British Pound Sterling, Euro, Japanese Yen, Malaysian Ringgit, Philippine Peso, Singapore Dollar and Thai Baht, which were designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and had an aggregate notional amount of $2.0 billion and
$1.6 billion at June 28, 2013 and June 29, 2012, respectively.



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the
change in fair value of the derivative is initially deferred in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax and presented within cash flow from operations. These amounts are subsequently recognized into earnings when the underlying cash flow being
hedged is recognized into earnings. Recognized gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts entered into for manufacturing-related activities are reported in cost of revenue. Hedge effectiveness is measured by comparing the hedging
instrument’s cumulative change in fair value from inception to maturity to the underlying exposure’s terminal value. The Company determined the ineffectiveness associated with its cash flow hedges to be immaterial.

A change in the fair value of fair value hedges is recognized in earnings in the period incurred and is reported as a component of
operating expenses. The fair value and the changes in fair value on these contracts were not material to the consolidated financial statements for all years presented. See Notes 10 and 11 for additional disclosures related to foreign exchange
contracts.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

The Company has defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans covering certain employees in various countries. The benefits
are based on the employees’ years of service and compensation. The plans are funded in conformity with the funding requirements of applicable government authorities. The Company amortizes unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior
service costs on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated average service life of the participants. The measurement date for the plans is the Company’s fiscal year-end. The Company recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit
pension and postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheets, with changes in the funded status recognized through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the year in which such changes occur. See Note 13 for additional disclosures
related to the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Use of Estimates

Company management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of certain assets and liabilities in conformity with
U.S. GAAP. These estimates and assumptions have been applied using methodologies that are consistent throughout the periods presented. However, actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2011-05 “Presentation of Comprehensive Income” (“ASU
2011-05”). The new standard requires that all non-owner changes in shareholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but continuous statements. If presented in two separate
statements, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed immediately by a second statement of total other comprehensive income, its components and the total comprehensive income. In December 2011, the FASB deferred
certain changes in ASU 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. The Company adopted this pronouncement in its first quarter of fiscal 2013. The adoption of ASU 2011-05 resulted in an additional financial statement
which increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income but did not have an impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment” (“ASU 2011-08”). The new
standard permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative
impairment test in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 350-30, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-General Intangibles Other than Goodwill.” The Company adopted this pronouncement in its first quarter of fiscal 2013. The adoption
of ASU 2011-08 did not have a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.

In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, “Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Items Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” (“ASU 2013-02”). The
new standard requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component for those items reclassified to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period. For other
amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts. The new standard is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2012. In the Company’s circumstances, this is the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Since ASU 2013-02 relates only to the presentation and disclosure of information, it is not expected to
have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

On the Closing Date, the Company, in its capacity as the parent entity and guarantor, Western Digital
Technologies, Inc. (“WDT”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Western Digital Ireland, Ltd. (“WDI”), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five-year credit agreement (the “Credit
Facility”) with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer, and certain other participating lenders (collectively, the “Lenders”). The Credit Facility provided for $2.8 billion of
unsecured loan facilities consisting of a $2.3 billion term loan facility and a $500 million revolving credit facility. The only borrower under the term loan facility is WDI and the revolving credit facility is available to both WDI and WDT (WDI and
WDT are referred to as “the Borrowers”). The Borrowers may elect to expand the Credit Facility by up to an additional $500 million if existing or new lenders provide additional term or revolving commitments. The obligations of the
Borrowers under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company and the Company’s material domestic subsidiaries, and the obligations of WDI under the Credit Facility are also guaranteed by WDT.

The term loans and the revolving credit loans may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty, subject to
certain conditions. As of June 28, 2013, the term loan facility had a variable interest rate of 2.2% and a remaining, outstanding balance of $2.0 billion. The Company is required to make principal payments on the term loan facility totaling
$230 million a year for fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2016, and the remaining $1.3 billion balance (subject to adjustment to reflect prepayments or an increase to its term loan facility) due and payable in full in fiscal 2017 on March 8, 2017. As
of June 28, 2013, $500 million was available for future borrowings on the revolving credit facility.

The Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with a leverage ratio and an interest
coverage ratio calculated on a consolidated basis for the Company and its subsidiaries. In addition, the Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the Company’s and
its subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, make certain restricted payments, merge, consolidate or dispose of substantially all of its assets, and enter into certain speculative hedging arrangements and make any material
change in the nature of its business. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, the administrative agent at the request, or with the consent, of the Required Lenders (as defined in the Credit Facility) may cease making
loans, terminate the Credit Facility and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, require the cash collateralization of letters of credit and/or exercise all other rights and remedies available to it, the Lenders and the
letter of credit issuer. The Credit Facility specifies a number of events of default (some of which are subject to applicable grace or cure periods), including, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other
material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, material judgment defaults and a change of control default. As of June 28, 2013, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.

Note 4. Commitments and Contingencies

Lease Commitments

The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under long-term, non-cancelable operating leases. The Company’s operating leases consist of leased property and equipment that expire at various
dates through 2022. Rental expense under these operating leases, including month-to-month rentals, was $64 million, $41 million and $23 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases that have
initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year at June 28, 2013 are as follows (in millions):

Product Warranty Liability

Changes in the warranty accrual for 2013, 2012 and 2011 were as follows (in millions):

Accrued warranty also includes amounts classified in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets
of $73 million at June 28, 2013 and $89 million at June 29, 2012.

Long-term Purchase Agreements

The Company has entered into long-term purchase agreements with various component suppliers. The commitments depend on
specific products ordered and may be subject to minimum quality requirements and future price negotiations. The Company expects these commitments to total $43 million for 2014, $8 million for 2015, $2 million for 2016, $1 million for 2017
and $1 million for 2018.

Note 5. Legal Proceedings

When the Company becomes aware of a claim or potential claim, the Company assesses the likelihood of any loss or
exposure. The Company discloses information regarding each material claim where the likelihood of a loss contingency is probable or reasonably possible. If a loss contingency is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the
Company records an accrual for the loss. In such cases, there may be an exposure to potential loss in excess of the amount accrued. Where a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible or where a loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably
possible, the Company discloses an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim if a reasonable estimate can be made, unless the amount of such reasonably possible losses is not material to the Company’s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Unless otherwise stated below, for each of the matters described below, the Company has either recorded an accrual for losses that are probable and reasonably estimable or has determined that,
while a loss is reasonably possible (including potential losses in excess of the amounts accrued by the Company), a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible losses with respect to the claim or in excess of amounts already
accrued by the Company cannot be made. The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. The actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates.

Intellectual Property Litigation

On June 20, 2008, plaintiff Convolve, Inc. (“Convolve”) filed a complaint in the Eastern District of Texas against WD,
HGST, and one other company alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,314,473 and 4,916,635. The complaint sought unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. On October 10, 2008, Convolve amended its complaint to allege infringement
of only the ‘473 patent. The ‘473 patent allegedly relates to interface technology to select between certain modes of a disk drive’s operations relating to speed and noise. A trial in the matter began on July 18, 2011 and
concluded on July 26, 2011 with a verdict against WD and HGST in an amount that is not material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. WD and HGST have filed post-trial motions challenging the verdict and
will evaluate their options for appeal after the Court rules on the post-trial motions.

On December 7, 2009, plaintiff
Nazomi Communications (“Nazomi”) filed a complaint in the Eastern District of Texas against WD and seven other companies alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,080,362 and 7,225,436. Nazomi dismissed the Eastern District of Texas suit
after filing a similar complaint in the Central District of California on February 8, 2010. The case was subsequently transferred to the Northern District of California on October 14, 2010. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and
unspecified monetary damages, fees and costs. The asserted patents allegedly relate to processor cores capable of Java hardware acceleration. In August 2012, the Court dismissed WD on summary judgment for non-infringement. Nazomi filed a notice of
appeal on January 16, 2013. WD intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in this matter.

On November 10,
2010, plaintiff Rembrandt Data Storage (“Rembrandt”) filed a complaint in the Western District of Wisconsin against WD alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,995,342 and 6,195,232. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and unspecified
monetary damages, fees and costs. The asserted patents allegedly relate to specific thin film heads having solenoid coils. After a favorable claim construction ruling by the court, WD secured a stipulation from Rembrandt to dismiss the case.
Rembrandt appealed the Court’s claim construction ruling, and the Federal Circuit issued a summary affirmance in favor of WD in December 2012. Rembrandt did not appeal this ruling and the case has closed.

On August 1, 2011, plaintiff Guzik Technical Enterprises (“Guzik”) filed a complaint in the Northern District of
California against WD and various of its subsidiaries alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,023,145 and 6,785,085, breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and unspecified monetary
damages, fees and costs. The patents asserted by Guzik allegedly relate to devices used to test hard disk drive heads and media. WD has filed counterclaims against Guzik or patent infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,844,420; 5,640,089; 6,891,696; and
7,480,116. The patents asserted by WD relate to devices and methods used in the testing of hard disk drive heads and media. WD intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter.

On April 29, 2013, plaintiffs Charles C. Freeney III et al. filed a complaint in
the Eastern District of Texas against WD alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,110,744. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and unspecified monetary damages, fees and costs. The patent allegedly relates to WD’s AC router products.
WD intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter.

Seagate Matter

On October 4, 2006, plaintiff Seagate Technology LLC (“Seagate”) filed an action in the District Court of Hennepin County,
Minnesota, naming as defendants WD and one of its now former employees previously employed by Seagate. The complaint in the action alleged claims based on supposed misappropriation of trade secrets and sought injunctive relief and unspecified
monetary damages, fees and costs. On June 19, 2007, WD’s former employee filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association. A motion to stay the litigation as against all defendants and to compel arbitration of all
Seagate’s claims was granted on September 19, 2007. On September 23, 2010, Seagate filed a motion to amend its claims and add allegations based on the supposed misappropriation of additional confidential information, and the
arbitrator granted Seagate’s motion. The arbitration hearing commenced on May 23, 2011 and concluded on July 11, 2011.

On November 18, 2011, the sole arbitrator ruled in favor of WD in connection with five of the eight alleged trade secrets at issue, based on evidence that such trade secrets were known publicly at
the time the former employee joined WD. Based on a determination that the employee had fabricated evidence, the arbitrator then concluded that WD had to know of the fabrications. As a sanction, the arbitrator precluded any evidence or defense by WD
disputing the validity, misappropriation, or use of the three remaining alleged trade secrets by WD, and entered judgment in favor of Seagate with respect to such trade secrets. Using an unjust enrichment theory of damages, the arbitrator issued an
interim award against WD in the amount of $525 million plus pre-award interest at the Minnesota statutory rate of 10% per year. In his decision with respect to these three trade secrets, the arbitrator did not question the relevance, veracity
or credibility of any of WD’s ten expert and fact witnesses (other than WD’s former employee), nor the authenticity of any other evidence WD presented. On January 23, 2012, the arbitrator issued a final award adding pre-award interest
in the amount of $105.4 million for a total final award of $630.4 million. On January 23, 2012, WD filed a petition in the District Court of Hennepin County, Minnesota to have the final arbitration award vacated. A hearing on the petition to
vacate was held on March 1, 2012.

On October 12, 2012, the District Court of Hennepin County, Minnesota vacated, in
full, the $630.4 million final arbitration award. Specifically, the Court confirmed the arbitration award with respect to each of the five trade secret claims that WD and the former employee had won at the arbitration and vacated the arbitration
award with respect to the three trade secret claims that WD and the former employee had lost at the arbitration. The Court ordered that a rehearing be held concerning those three alleged trade secret claims before a new arbitrator.

On October 30, 2012, Seagate initiated an appeal of the District Court’s decision with the Minnesota Court of Appeals. Oral
arguments in the appeal were held on April 24, 2013. On July 22, 2013, the Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s decision and remanded for entry of an order and judgment confirming the arbitration award. The Company
strongly disagrees with the decision of the Court of Appeals, believes that the District Court’s decision was correct, and will file a petition for review with the Minnesota Supreme Court. If the Minnesota Supreme Court elects not to hear the
Company’s petition for review or affirms the Court of Appeals decision, the District Court is expected to enter an order and judgment confirming the $630.4 million final arbitration award, plus post-award interest on the $525 million initial
award at the statutory rate of 10% from January 24, 2012. No judgment will be entered while the Company is petitioning the Minnesota Supreme Court. The Company will continue to vigorously defend this matter. Nevertheless, in light of
uncertainties, including the fact that the review of the Court of Appeals decision by the Minnesota Supreme Court is discretionary, the Company recorded an accrual of $681 million for this matter in its financial statements for the three months
ended June 28, 2013. This amount is in addition to the $25 million previously accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The total amount accrued of $706 million represents the amount of the final arbitration award, plus interest accrued on
the initial arbitration award at the statutory rate of 10% from January 24, 2012 through June 28, 2013.

Other Matters

In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to other legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. Although
the ultimate aggregate amount of probable monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these other matters is subject to many uncertainties and is therefore not predictable with assurance, management believes that any monetary liability or
financial impact to the Company from these other matters, individually and in the aggregate, would not be material to the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance with respect to
such result, and monetary liability or financial impact to the Company from these other matters could differ materially from those projected.

2013, 2012, and 2011, sales to the Company’s top ten customers accounted for 44%, 50% and 49% of the Company’s net revenue, respectively.

Note 7. Western Digital Corporation 401(k) Plan

The Company has adopted the Western Digital Corporation 401(k) Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan covers
substantially all domestic employees, subject to certain eligibility requirements. The Company makes a basic matching contribution on behalf of each participating eligible employee equal to fifty percent (50%) of the eligible participant’s
pre-tax contributions for the contribution cycle not to exceed 5% of the eligible participant’s compensation; provided, however, that each eligible participant shall receive a minimum annual basic matching contribution equal to fifty percent
(50%) of the first $4,000 of pre-tax contributions for any calendar year. The Plan was amended effective January 1, 2013, to provide for a year-end true-up matching contribution such that participants who save at least 5% of their eligible
compensation for the year receive a minimum annual matching contribution equal to 2.5% of eligible compensation (up to Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) limitations). Company contributions vest over a 5-year period of employment. For 2013,
2012, and 2011, the Company made Plan contributions of $19 million, $12 million and $9 million, respectively.

Note 8. Shareholders’ Equity

Stock Incentive Plans

In addition to awards assumed in connection with the Acquisition, the Company maintains four stock-based incentive plans (collectively, including the assumed HGST awards, referred to as the “Stock
Plans”): the amended and restated 2004 Performance Incentive Plan, the Employee Stock Option Plan, the Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan and the Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors. No new awards may be granted under the Employee Stock
Option Plan, the Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan or the Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (collectively referred to as the “Prior Stock Plans”). As of June 28, 2013, options to purchase 194,409 shares of the
Company’s common stock remained outstanding and exercisable under the Employee Stock Option Plan. Other than for such options, no restricted stock or other awards were outstanding under the Prior Stock Plans as of June 28, 2013. Options
granted under the Prior Stock Plans expire either five or ten years from the date of grant.

The types of awards that may be
granted under the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan include stock options, SARs, restricted stock units, stock bonuses and other forms of awards granted or denominated in the Company’s common stock or units of the Company’s common stock, as
well as cash bonus awards. Persons eligible to receive awards under the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan include officers and employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, directors of the Company and certain consultants and advisors to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries. The vesting of awards under the Performance Incentive Plan is determined at the date of grant. Each award expires on a date determined at the date of grant; however, the maximum term of options and SARs under the
2004 Performance Incentive Plan is ten years after the grant date of the award. RSUs granted under the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan typically vest over periods ranging from one to five years from the date of grant. To the extent available, the
Company issues shares out of treasury stock upon the vesting of awards or the exercise of employee stock options and ESPP.

As
of June 28, 2013, the maximum number of shares of the Company’s common stock that was authorized for award grants under the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan was 48.8 million shares. Any shares subject to awards under the Prior Stock
Plans that are canceled, forfeited or otherwise terminate without having vested or been exercised, as applicable, will become available for other award grants under the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan. Shares issued in respect of stock options and
SARs granted under the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan count against the plan’s share limit on a one-for-one basis, whereas shares issued in respect of any other type of award granted through November 7, 2012 under the plan count against
the plan’s share limit as 1.35 shares for every one share actually issued in connection with such award. Shares issued in respect of awards granted on or after November 8, 2012 count against the plan’s share limit as 1.72 shares
for every one share actually issued in connection with such award. The 2004 Performance Incentive Plan was extended in 2013 and will terminate on August 6, 2022 unless terminated earlier by the Company’s Board of Directors.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company maintains an ESPP. Under the ESPP, eligible employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their eligible compensation during prescribed offering periods to purchase shares of the
Company’s common stock at 95% of the fair market value of common stock on either the first day of that offering period or on the applicable exercise date, whichever is less. A participant may participate in only one offering period at a time,
and a new offering period generally begins each June 1st and December 1st. Each offering period is generally 24 months and consists of four exercise dates (each, generally six months following the start of the offering period or
the preceding exercise date, as the case may be). If the fair market value of the Company’s common stock is less on a given exercise date than on the date of grant, employee participation in that offering period ends and participants are
automatically re-enrolled in the next new offering period.

Stock-based Compensation Expense

The Company recognized in expense $88 million, $57 million and $37 million for stock-based compensation related to the vesting
of options issued by the Company under the Stock Plans and the ESPP in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The tax benefit realized as a result of the aforementioned stock-based compensation expense was $25 million, $12 million and $8 million in
2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As of June 28, 2013, total compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted under the Stock Plans and ESPP rights issued to employees but not yet recognized was $105 million and will be
amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average service period of approximately 2.2 years.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

For purposes of this footnote, references to RSUs include performance stock unit awards
(“PSUs”) reported at target. The effect of the PSU activity was immaterial to the consolidated financial statements in 2013 and 2012. The Company granted approximately 1.7 million RSUs during 2013, which are generally payable in an
equal number of shares of the Company’s common stock at the time of vesting of the units. The aggregate market value of the shares underlying the RSUs was $74 million at the date of grant. The compensation expense for granted and assumed RSUs
is being recognized as expense over the corresponding vesting or measurement periods of the awards. For purposes of recognizing awards granted, the Company has assumed a weighted average forfeiture rate of 2.0% based on a historical analysis
indicating forfeitures for these types of awards. The Company recognized in expense $52 million, $35 million and $32 million related to RSUs granted under the Stock Plans that vested during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The tax benefit
realized as a result of the aforementioned expense was $14 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As of June 28, 2013, the aggregate unamortized fair value of all unvested RSUs granted under the Stock Plans
was $70 million, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average vesting period of approximately 1.4 years. In 2013, stock-based compensation expense included $5 million of accelerated expense associated with the
employee termination benefits as discussed in Note 16.

The Company recognized in expense $46 million related to adjustments
to market value as well as the vesting of SARs in 2013 and a benefit of $7 million related to SARs in 2012. The tax benefit realized as a result of the aforementioned SARs expense was $4 million in 2013. There was no tax effect in 2012. The SARs
will be settled in cash upon exercise. As a result, the Company had a total liability of $46 million related to SARs included in accrued liabilities as of June 28, 2013 in the consolidated balance sheet. As of June 28, 2013, total
compensation cost related to unvested SARs issued to employees but not yet recognized was $11 million and will be recognized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average service period of approximately 0.8 years.

Stock Option Activity

The following table summarizes stock option activity under the Stock Plans over the last three fiscal years (in millions, except per share amounts and remaining contractual lives):

If an option has an exercise price that is less than the quoted price of the Company’s common stock
at the particular time, the aggregate intrinsic value of that option at that time is calculated based on the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the quoted price of the Company’s common stock at that time. As of
June 28, 2013, the Company had options outstanding to purchase an aggregate of 11.9 million shares with an exercise price below the quoted price of the Company’s stock on that date resulting in an aggregate intrinsic value of
$389 million at that date. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under the Stock Plans was $211 million, $53 million and $25 million, respectively, determined as of the date of exercise.

under the Stock Plans as of June 28, 2013 (in millions, except exercise price):

RSU Activity

The following table summarizes RSU activity (in millions, except weighted average grant date fair value):

The fair value of each RSU is the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. RSUs are
generally payable in an equal number of shares of the Company’s common stock at the time of the vesting of the units. The aggregate value of RSUs that became fully-vested during 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $71 million, $41 million and
$23 million, respectively, determined as of the vest date. The grant-date fair value of the shares underlying the RSU awards at the date of grant or assumption was $74 million, $71 million and $26 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011,
respectively. These amounts are being recognized to expense over the corresponding vesting periods. For purposes of valuing these awards, the Company has assumed a forfeiture rate of 2.0%, 2.4% and 1.8% during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively,
based on a historical analysis indicating forfeitures for these types of awards.

SARs Activity

The share-based compensation liability for SARs is recognized for the portion of fair value for which service has been rendered at the
reporting date. The share-based liability is remeasured at each reporting date, using a binomial option-pricing model, through the requisite service period. As of June 28, 2013, 1.0 million SARs were outstanding with a weighted average
exercise price of $7.90. There were no SARs granted and all other SARs activity was immaterial to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 28, 2013.

Fair Value Disclosure — Binomial Model

The fair value of stock options granted is estimated using a binomial option-pricing model. The binomial model requires the input of
highly subjective assumptions. The Company uses historical data to estimate exercise, employee termination, and expected stock price volatility within the binomial model. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is
based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair value of stock options granted during the three years ended June 28, 2013 was estimated using the following weighted average assumptions:

The weighted average expected term of the Company’s stock options granted during 2013, 2012 and 2011
was 4.0 years, 4.9 years and 4.7 years, respectively.

Fair Value Disclosure — Black-Scholes-Merton Model

The fair value of ESPP purchase rights issued is estimated at the date of grant of the purchase rights using the
Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions such as the expected stock price volatility and the expected period until options are exercised. Purchase
rights under the ESPP are granted on either June 1st or December 1st of each year.

The fair values of all ESPP
purchase rights granted on or prior to June 28, 2013 have been estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

Stock Repurchase Program

On May 21, 2012, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion for the repurchase of its common stock through May 18, 2017. On September 13, 2012,
the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion for the repurchase of its common stock and the extension of its stock repurchase program until September 13, 2017. The Company repurchased 19.0 million
shares for a total cost of $842 million during 2013. The remaining amount available to be purchased under the Company’s stock repurchase program as of June 28, 2013 was $2.0 billion. The Company may continue to repurchase its stock as
it deems appropriate and market conditions allow. Repurchases under the stock repurchase program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan. The Company expects stock repurchases
to be funded principally by operating cash flows.

Dividends to Shareholders

On September 13, 2012, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the adoption of a quarterly cash dividend policy. Under the cash dividend policy, holders of the Company’s
common stock receive dividends when and as declared by the Company’s Board of Directors. In 2013, the Company declared aggregate cash dividends of $1.00 per share of the Company’s common stock, totaling $240 million, of which $181 million

Income Tax Provision

The components of the provision for income taxes were as follows for the three years ended June 28, 2013 (in millions):

The Company’s income tax provision for 2013 reflects a tax benefit of $37 million as a result of the
retroactive extension of the U.S. Federal research and experimentation tax credit (“R&D credit”) that was signed into law on January 2, 2013 as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The R&D credit, which had
previously expired on December 31, 2011, was extended through December 31, 2013.

In addition, on November 6,
2012, California voters approved California Proposition 39, which affects California state income tax apportionment for most multi-state taxpayers for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2013. This proposition reduces the Company’s
future income apportioned to California, making it less likely for the Company to realize certain California deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company recorded an $88 million charge in 2013 to reduce its previously recognized California deferred
tax assets as of December 28, 2012.



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Remaining net undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries at June 28, 2013 on
which no U.S. tax has been provided amounted to $6.8 billion. The net undistributed earnings are intended to finance local operating requirements and capital investments. Accordingly, an additional U.S. tax provision has not been made
on these earnings. The tax liability for these earnings would be $2.3 billion if the Company repatriated the $6.8 billion in undistributed earnings from the foreign subsidiaries.

Deferred Taxes

Temporary differences and carryforwards, which give rise to a significant portion of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of June 28, 2013 and June 29, 2012 were as follows (in millions):

The net deferred tax asset valuation allowance was $133 million as of June 28, 2013. This $93
million increase in valuation allowance was due to the passage of Proposition 39, which affects California state income apportionment for most multi-state taxpayers beginning on or after January 1, 2013. This proposition reduces the
Company’s future income apportioned to California, making it less likely for the Company to realize certain California deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance is based on the Company’s assessment that it is more likely than not that
certain deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future.

In addition to the deferred tax assets presented
above, the Company had additional NOL benefits related to stock-based compensation deductions of $13 million and $33 million at June 28, 2013 and June 29, 2012, respectively. During the current year, the Company generated an
additional $25 million of benefits related to stock-based compensation deductions. The benefits generated in the current year, along with $20 million of the benefits related to prior years, were utilized in the current year. This $45 million
was recorded as a credit to shareholders’ equity.

Effective Tax Rate

Reconciliation of the U.S. Federal statutory rate to the Company’s effective tax rate is as follows for the three years ended
June 28, 2013:

Tax Holidays and Carryforwards

A substantial portion of the Company’s manufacturing operations in Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand operate under
various tax holidays and tax incentive programs which will expire in whole or in part at various dates from 2014 through 2025. Certain of the holidays may be extended if specific conditions are met. The net impact of these tax holidays and tax
incentives was to increase the Company’s net earnings by $899 million ($3.65 per diluted share), $729 million ($2.98 per diluted share), and $362 million ($1.54 per diluted share) in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

As of June 28, 2013, the Company had federal and state NOL carryforwards of $309 million and $205 million, respectively. In
addition, as of June 28, 2013, the Company had various federal and state tax credit carryforwards of $271 million combined. The NOL carryforwards available to offset future federal and state taxable income expire at various dates from 2020
to 2032 and 2017 to 2031, respectively. Approximately $42 million of the credit carryforwards available to offset future taxable income expire at various dates from 2016 to 2031. The remaining amount is available indefinitely. NOLs and credits
relating to Komag, Incorporated (“Komag”), which was acquired by the Company on September 5, 2007, and HGST, which was acquired by the Company on March 8, 2012, are subject to limitations under Section 382 and 383 of the
Internal Revenue Code. The Company does not expect these limitations to result in a reduction in the total amount of Komag’s NOLs and credits ultimately realized. The Company expects the total amount of HGST’s NOLs and credits ultimately
realized will be reduced by $39 million and $33 million, respectively. Because the Company expects the amount of HGST’s NOLs and credits ultimately realized will be reduced, the Company has adjusted the goodwill accordingly.

Uncertain Tax Positions

The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. First, the tax position is evaluated for recognition by determining if it is more likely than not that the
position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to
be recognized in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. With the exception of certain unrecognized tax
benefits that are directly associated with the tax position taken, unrecognized tax benefits are presented gross in the Company’s balance sheet. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded
for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in the provision for income taxes. As of June 28, 2013, such interest and penalties were not material. As of June 28, 2013, the Company had $240 million of unrecognized tax benefits.



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax
benefits for the years ended June 28, 2013, June 29, 2012 and July 1, 2011 (in millions):

The Company’s unrecognized tax benefits are primarily included within long-term liabilities in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits at June 28, 2013, June 29, 2012 and July 1, 2011, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.

The Company files U.S. Federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns. For both federal and state tax returns, with few
exceptions, the Company is subject to examination for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. In foreign jurisdictions, with few exceptions, the Company is subject to examination for all years subsequent to fiscal 2006. The Company is no longer subject to
examination by the IRS for periods prior to 2008, although carry forwards generated prior to those periods may still be adjusted upon examination by the IRS or state taxing authority if they either have been or will be used in a subsequent period.

The IRS had completed its field examination of the Company’s federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2006 and 2007
and issued Revenue Agent Reports (“RARs”) that proposed adjustments to income before income taxes of approximately $970 million primarily related to transfer pricing and intercompany payable balances. The Company disagreed with the
proposed adjustments and filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office. In June 2013, the Company reached an agreement with the IRS to resolve the transfer pricing issue. This agreement resulted in a decrease in the amount of net operating loss and
tax credits realized, but did not have an impact to the Company’s consolidated statements of income. The proposed adjustment relating to intercompany payable balances for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 will be addressed in conjunction with the
IRS’s examination of the Company’s fiscal years 2008 and 2009, which commenced in January 2012. In addition, in January 2012, the IRS commenced an examination of the 2007 fiscal period ended September 5, 2007 of Komag, Incorporated
(“Komag”). In February 2013, the IRS commenced an examination of calendar years 2010 and 2011 of HGST, which was acquired by the Company on March 8, 2012.

The Company believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues
addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. As of June 28,
2013, it is not possible to estimate the amount of change, if any, in the unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve months. Any significant change in the amount of the Company’s liability for unrecognized tax
benefits would most likely result from additional information or settlements relating to the examination of the Company’s tax returns.

Note 10. Fair Value Measurements

Financial assets and liabilities that are remeasured and reported at fair value at each reporting period are classified
and disclosed in one of the following three levels:

Level 1.

Foreign Exchange Contracts.

The Company’s foreign exchange contracts
are short-term contracts to hedge the Company’s foreign currency risk. Foreign exchange contracts are classified within other current assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company presents its foreign exchange contracts
on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheets due to the right of offset by its individual counterparties under master netting arrangements. Foreign exchange contracts are valued using an income approach that is based on a present value of
future cash flows model. The market-based observable inputs for the model include forward rates and credit default swap rates.

For the year ended June 28, 2013, there were no transfers between levels and no changes in Level 3 financial assets measured on
a recurring basis. For the year ended June 28, 2012, the Company had a $1 million settlement in its Level 3 financial assets measured on a recurring basis, reducing the balance from $15 million to $14 million.

The Company develops a discount rate by calculating when the estimated benefit payments will be due.
Management in Japan then matches the benefit payments to AA or higher bond ratings that match the timing of the expected benefit payments to determine the appropriate discount rate.

The Company develops the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by analyzing rates of return in Japan as well as the investment
portfolio applicable to the plan. Management’s estimates of future rates of return on assets is based in large part on the projected rate of return from the respective investment managers using a long-term view of historical returns, as well as
actuarial recommendations using the most current generational and mortality tables and rates.

The Company develops the rate
of compensation increase assumptions using local compensation practices and historical rates of increases.

Plan Assets

Investment Policies and Strategies

The investment policy in Japan is to generate a stable return on investments over a long-term horizon in order to have adequate pension funds to meet the Company’s future obligations. In order to
achieve this investment goal, a diversified portfolio with target asset allocation and expected rate of return is established by considering factors such as composition of participants, level of funded status, capacity to absorb risks, and the
current economic environment. The target asset allocation is 35% in equity securities, 62% in debt securities and the remaining 3% in other assets. Risk management is accomplished through diversification, periodic review of plan asset performance,
and appropriate realignment of asset allocation. Assumptions regarding the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are periodically reviewed and are based on the historical trend of returns, the risk and correlation of each asset, and the
latest economic environment.

The expected long-term rate of return is estimated based on many factors, including expected
forecast for inflation, risk premiums for each asset class, expected asset allocation, current and future financial market conditions, and diversification and rebalancing strategies. Historical return patterns and correlations, consensus return
forecasts, and other relevant financial factors are analyzed periodically by the investment advisor so as to ensure that the expected long-term rate of return is reasonable and appropriate.

asset categories and their associated fair values as of June 29, 2012 (in millions):

(1)

Includes direct investments in equity of domestic and foreign companies, including those in developing countries.

(2)

Commingled funds represent pooled institutional investments.

(3)

Equity mutual funds invest primarily in equity securities.

(4)

Includes debt issued by national, state or local governments and related agencies.

(5)

Fixed income mutual funds invest primarily in fixed income securities.

(6)

Other securities include corporate bonds, insurance contracts and mortgage-backed securities.

(7)

Includes investments in hedge funds, venture capital funds, limited partnerships, private real estate, bank capital and collateral debt obligations
such as private placement real estate funds.

Assets held in defined benefit plans in the Philippines,
Taiwan and Thailand were less than $1 million and are not presented in the above table. There were no significant movements of assets between any level categories in 2013 or 2012.

Fair Value Valuation Techniques

Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the stock exchange on which the individual securities are traded. Equity commingled/mutual funds are typically valued using the net asset
value (“NAV”) provided by the investment manager or administrator of the fund. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus liabilities and divided by the number of shares or units outstanding. These
assets are classified as either Level 1 or Level 2, depending on availability of quoted market prices for identical or similar assets.

If available, fixed income securities are valued using the close price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded and are classified as Level 1. The fair value of other
fixed income securities is typically estimated using pricing models and quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, and is generally classified as Level 2.

Cash includes money market accounts that are valued at their cost plus interest on a daily basis, which approximates fair value. Short-term investments represent securities with original maturities of one
year or less. These assets are classified as either Level 1 or Level 2.

Alternative investment valuations require significant
judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of the underlying assets. These assets are valued based on individual fund manager valuation models utilizing available and relevant market
data. These investments are classified as Level 3.

Cash Flows

Contributions

The Company’s expected employer contributions for 2014 are $13 million for its Japanese defined benefit pension plans.

Estimated Future Benefits Payments

Annual benefit payments from the Japanese defined benefit pension plans are estimated to range from $6 million to $10 million annually
over the next five years.

Note 14. Acquisition

On the Closing Date, the Company completed the Acquisition of all the issued and outstanding paid-up share capital of
HGST from Hitachi Ltd. (“Hitachi”). HGST is a developer and manufacturer of storage devices. As a result of the Acquisition, HGST became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The aggregate purchase price of the Acquisition
was approximately $4.7 billion and was funded with $3.7 billion of existing cash and cash from new debt, as well as 25 million newly issued shares of the Company’s common stock with a fair value of $877 million. The fair value of the newly
issued shares of the Company’s common stock was determined based on the closing market price of the Company’s shares of common stock on the date of the Acquisition, less a 10% discount for lack of marketability as the shares issued were
subject to a restriction that limited their trade or transfer for one year from the Closing Date. The purchase price consideration originally included preliminary estimates of the working capital assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Based on a
final post-closing adjustment, the cash portion of the purchase price decreased by a net $27 million as a result of $37 million received by the Company during 2013 for a post-closing adjustment related to changes in the working capital of HGST,
partially offset by $10 million paid by the Company during 2013 for a post-closing assumed pension adjustment. The aggregate purchase price for HGST was comprised of (in millions):

measurement period following the date of the Acquisition. The final purchase price allocation was as follows (in millions):

In 2013, the Company recorded a net $21 million decrease in the purchase price allocation to goodwill as
a result of a $37 million decrease in goodwill related to the completion of the post-closing adjustment for changes in working capital, partially offset by increases to goodwill of $10 million for the post-closing assumed pension adjustment, $5
million in deferred income taxes and $1 million in intangible assets.

Toshiba Transactions

In connection with the regulatory approval process, the Company announced on May 15, 2012 that it had closed a transaction with
Toshiba to divest certain 3.5-inch hard drive assets and to purchase Toshiba Storage Device (Thailand) Company Limited (“TSDT”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Toshiba which manufactured hard drives prior to the Thailand flooding. The net
impact of these two transactions was immaterial to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In August 2013, the Company received a $45 million insurance recovery related to facilities acquired in connection with the acquisition of TSDT.

Maintenance of Competitive Requirement

In connection with the regulatory approval process of the Acquisition, the Company agreed to certain conditions required by the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China
(“MOFCOM”), including adopting measures to maintain HGST as an independent competitor until MOFCOM agrees otherwise (with the minimum period being two years from the Closing Date). The Company worked closely with MOFCOM to finalize an
operations plan that outlines in more detail the conditions of the competitive requirement.

Note 15. Thailand Flooding

In October 2011, severe flooding in Thailand inundated all of the Company’s Thailand manufacturing facilities and
submerged certain equipment located there. These facilities included the Company’s magnetic head slider fabrication facilities, as well as its hard drive, head gimbal assembly and head stack assembly facilities. As a result, the Company
recorded $235 million of flood-related charges in fiscal 2012, offset by $21 million of insurance recoveries and other cost reimbursements. These charges are separately stated as a line item, “Charges related to flooding, net,” within
operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income.

The Company maintains insurance coverage that provides property
and business interruption coverage in the event of losses arising from flooding. The Company has submitted claims to its insurers and is awaiting a determination of how much of its total losses will be covered by insurance.

Note 16. Employee Termination Benefits and Other Charges

The Company incurred $138 million and $80 million of charges in 2013 and 2012, respectively, to realign its operations
with anticipated market demand. These charges were classified as operating expenses and included within employee termination benefits and other charges in the consolidated statements of income. The following table summarizes the charges in 2013 (in
millions):

The employee termination benefits relate to headcount reductions at various worldwide locations,
including the Company’s voluntary separation program (the “Program”) for the U.S.-based employees of its WD subsidiary, which was announced on January 23, 2013. The remaining liabilities are expected to be primarily relieved and
the Program is expected to be substantially completed by the first quarter of fiscal 2014.

During 2012, the Company recorded
$56 million of asset impairment charges, $16 million of contract termination and other exit costs and $8 million of employee termination benefits.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As required by SEC
Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the
end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework.

Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, which audited the consolidated financial statements
included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting. See page 51 herein.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been
no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended June 28, 2013 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations of Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect our internal controls over
financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a system of internal control over financial reporting, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the
individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
detected.
