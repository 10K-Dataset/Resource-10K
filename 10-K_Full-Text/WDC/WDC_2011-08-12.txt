PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

We are a global provider of solutions for the collection,
    storage, management, protection and use of digital content,
    including audio and video. Our principal products are hard
    drives, which are devices that use one or more rotating magnetic
    disks (“magnetic media”) to store and allow fast
    access to data. Hard drives are currently the primary storage
    medium for digital content. Our hard drives are used in desktop
    and notebook computers, corporate and cloud computing data
    centers, home entertainment equipment and stand-alone consumer
    storage devices. In addition to hard drives, our other products
    include solid-state drives and home entertainment and networking
    products.

Business
    Strategy

Our business strategy is to provide a broad selection of
    reliable, high quality storage devices at a low total cost of
    ownership and with high efficiency and speed. We have designed
    our business strategy to accommodate significant unit and
    revenue growth with relatively small increases in operating
    expenses and to consistently achieve high asset utilization. We
    believe this strategy helps accomplish the following:

•

distinguishes us in the dynamic and competitive electronic data
    storage industry;

•

provides value to our customers;

•

allows us to better achieve consistent financial performance,
    including strong returns on invested capital; and

•

provides continued diversification of our storage product
    portfolio and entry into additional markets.

Industry

We believe that growth in the unit sales within the electronic
    data storage industry has continued to outpace the growth in the
    unit sales of all personal computers (“PCs”). For
    example, there were approximately 89% more hard drives sold than
    PCs in calendar 2010, based on industry data. We believe the
    following factors continue to drive the unit growth of storage
    device sales in addition to PCs:

•

consumer use of data storage devices for the playing, retention
    and creation of digital content for personal use;

•

growth of the external storage devices, permitting the easy
    storage, portability and backup of digital data such as music,
    photographs or video; and

•

growth of Internet-based applications, such as social
    networking, and cloud computing which drives the need for
    digital content storage and distribution.

For a discussion of risks relating to the electronic data
    storage industry, please see Item 1A of this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

Client
    Compute

Client compute storage devices consist of internal hard drives
    and solid-state drives for desktop and mobile PCs. Hard drives
    and solid-state drives store the computer operating system and
    application software, as well as the data used by the
    applications. Desktop PCs are intended for regular use at a
    single location in homes, businesses and multi-user networks.
    Mobile PCs, primarily notebook computers, are used both in and
    away from homes and businesses. We believe that the demand for
    client compute hard drives and solid-state drives will grow
    primarily due to the increasing demand in emerging countries,
    continued corporate refreshes, the proliferation of digital
    content and requirements for increasing performance, small size
    and low power consumption.

Client
    Non-Compute

External Storage.

External storage devices
    supplement the storage space of PC systems for home and small
    office networks, back up data on internal drives and are used
    for portability and security. We believe there is a growing



consumer need to back up personal digital content and externally
    expand storage capacity. Media players connect to a user’s
    television or home theater system and play digital movies, music
    and photos from an integrated hard drive, USB mass storage
    devices or content services accessed over the Internet. We also
    believe there is a growing need for consumers to play and view
    their personal stored digital content and premium content from
    the Internet on their television and home theater system
    consistent with the growing trend to digitize rich content and
    data.

Consumer Electronics.

Hard drives for CE
    products are primarily used in digital video recorders
    (“DVRs”) and game consoles. DVRs offer greater
    consumer viewing flexibility and enhanced capabilities such as
    pausing live television, simplifying the process of recording
    and cataloging recorded television programs and quickly
    forwarding or returning to any section of a recorded television
    program. Game consoles enable users to save games, movies,
    music, pictures and other user generated content. We believe
    growth in consumer electronics will continue to create demand
    for higher capacity hard drives.

Solid-state

drives are also used in consumer electronics products which are
    primarily designed for small form factor, battery powered
    consumer hand held devices, such as tablets and smartphones.

Enterprise

Enterprise storage devices consist of hard drives and
    solid-state drives for mission critical storage applications,
    also referred to as traditional enterprise, and nearline storage
    applications. Mission critical storage applications are
    essential to the operations of an enterprise and require high
    performance, high reliability hard drives and solid-state
    drives. Nearline storage applications are business critical but
    require higher capacity and lower power consumption hard drives.
    Nearline hard drives are more cost effective than traditional
    enterprise hard drives while offering higher capacities and
    maintaining similar reliability, scalability and performance.
    Nearline hard drives have stimulated applications such as video
    surveillance, video editing/broadcasting and medical imaging,
    and are also becoming commonplace for IT infrastructure
    applications such as databases, scientific computing, web
    content, web caching, web search engines and electronic mail. We
    believe that shipments of nearline hard drive units comprised
    approximately 41% of enterprise hard drives in calendar 2010
    compared to 36% in calendar 2009. We believe that nearline hard
    drives will continue to consume a growing portion of the highest
    capacity hard drives in the next three years. Enterprise also
    consists of solid-state drives for use in embedded applications,
    such as network communications, industrial, medical, military
    and aerospace, which require high durability and long life
    cycles.

There is a trend towards centralization of information storage
    and delivery of Internet-based services through cloud computing.
    Cloud computing delivers shared resources, software and
    information to users on demand on a multitude of devices, such
    as client PCs and handheld computing devices. Most cloud
    computing models consist of services delivered through large
    data centers that utilize

enterprise-class

servers. The infrastructure to support cloud computing storage
    needs is driving the demand for enterprise-class hard drives and

solid-state

drives.

Other
    Market Opportunities

We regularly review opportunities to apply our knowledge of data
    storage technology to markets that we do not currently serve.
    Based on our significant investments, we believe we have the
    technology building blocks to increase our overall market
    penetration and be a full-line data storage solutions supplier.
    Consistent with our measured and deliberate approach to new
    market entries in the recent past, our approach to additional
    new markets will be based on a careful assessment of the risks,
    rewards, requirements and profit potential of such actions.

Research
    and Development

We devote substantial resources to the development of new
    products and improvement of existing products. We focus our
    engineering efforts on coordinating our product design and
    manufacturing processes to bring our products to market in a
    cost-effective and timely manner. Research and development
    expenses totaled $703 million, $611 million and
    $509 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For a
    discussion of risks related to our development of new products,
    see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Technology
    and Product Development

Hard drives provide non-volatile data storage, which means that
    the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the
    device. The primary measures of hard drive performance include:

•

Acoustics — sound power emitted during hard drive
    operation, commonly expressed in decibels, and perceived
    loudness due to sound pressure, commonly expressed in sones;

•

Data transfer rate — sustained rate of data transfer
    to and from the disk, commonly expressed in gigabits per second.
    One gigabit equals one billion bits;

•

Power Consumption — which is the amount of electricity
    required to operate the drive, measured in watts;

•

Seek time — time needed to position the heads over a
    selected track on the disk surface, commonly expressed in
    milliseconds;

•

Spindle rotation speed — nominal rotation speed of the
    disks inside the hard drive, commonly expressed in RPM or
    latency. Spindle rotation speeds commonly stated as 5,400, 7,200
    and 10,000 RPM are sometimes approximations; and

•

Storage capacity — which is the amount of data that
    can be stored on the hard drive, commonly expressed in GB or TB.
    As defined in the hard drive industry, one GB equals one billion
    bytes and one TB equals one trillion bytes. A byte is a digital
    character, typically comprised of eight bits. A bit is a binary
    digit, the smallest unit of information in a digital system.

Industry-standard interfaces allow the drives to communicate
    with the host system. The primary interface for PCs is SATA and
    the primary interfaces for enterprise systems are SAS, Fibre
    Channel Arbitrated Loop (“FC-AL”) and SATA.

The main components of the hard drive are a Head-Disk-Assembly
    (“HDA”) and a Printed Circuit Board Assembly
    (“PCBA”).

The HDA includes heads, magnetic media, head positioning
    mechanism (“actuator”) and spindle motor. A rigid base
    and top cover contain these components in a
    contamination-controlled environment. One or more disks
    positioned around a motor-driven spindle hub that rotates the
    disks comprise the disk-pack assembly. The disk is made up of a
    smooth substrate on which thin layers of magnetic materials are
    deposited. The head stack assembly (“HSA”) is
    comprised of a magnetic positioner and a pivot-arm module on
    which the individual heads, including suspension, are mounted.
    Each disk has a head suspended directly above it, which can read
    data from or write data to the spinning disk.

The PCBA includes both standard and custom integrated circuits,
    an interface connector to the host computer and a power
    connector. The integrated circuits on the printed circuit board
    typically include a power device that controls the motor and HSA
    positioner, and a System on Chip (SoC) comprised of a drive
    interface, controller and recording channel.



The drive interface receives instructions from the host
    computer, while the controller directs the flow of data to or
    from the disks and controls the heads. The location of data on
    each disk is logically maintained in concentric tracks divided
    into sectors. The host computer sends instructions to the
    controller to read data from or write data to the disks, based
    on logical track and sector locations. Guided by instructions
    from the controller, the HSA pivots in an arc across the disk
    until it reaches the selected track of a disk, where the data is
    recorded or retrieved.

The storage capacity of a hard drive is determined by the number
    of disks and each disk’s areal density (track density
    multiplied by bit density), which is a measure of the amount of
    data that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk per
    unit area. Head and magnetic media technologies are two of the
    key components affecting areal density. As areal density
    increases, achieving a given drive capacity potentially reduces
    product costs over time through reduced component requirements.
    We are vertically integrated in these two most important
    technology components of hard drives (heads and magnetic media).
    We also invest considerable resources in research and
    development, manufacturing infrastructure and capital equipment
    of head and magnetic media components, in order to secure our
    competitive position and cost structure.

Solid-state drives use semiconductor, non-volatile media, rather
    than magnetic media and magnetic heads, to store and allow fast
    access to data without any moving parts. The capacity of a
    solid-state drive is based on the total number of megabytes
    (“MB”) or GB of semiconductor media in the solid-state
    drive.

Our products generally leverage a common platform for various
    products within product families, and in some cases across
    product families, resulting in the commonality of components
    which reduces our exposure to changes in demand, facilitates
    inventory management and allows us to achieve lower costs
    through purchasing economies. This platform strategy also
    enables our customers to leverage their qualification efforts
    onto successive product models. For a discussion of risks
    related to technological innovations, see Item 1A of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Sales and
    Distribution

We maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world
    including the major geographies of the Americas, Asia Pacific,
    Europe and the Middle East. Our international sales, which
    include sales to foreign subsidiaries of United States
    (“U.S.”) companies but do not include sales to
    U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies, represented 83%,
    81% and 80% of our net revenue for 2011, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. Sales to international customers may be subject to
    certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations,
    including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations. For
    a discussion regarding the risks related to sales to
    international customers, see Item 1A of this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

We perform our marketing and advertising functions internally
    and through outside firms utilizing both consumer media and
    trade publications targeting various reseller and end-user
    categories. We also maintain customer relationships through
    direct communication and providing information and support
    through our Web site. In accordance with standard hard drive
    industry practice, we provide distributors and retailers with
    limited price protection and programs under which we reimburse
    certain marketing expenditures. We also provide distributors,
    resellers and OEMs with other sales incentive programs.

Original Equipment Manufacturers.

OEMs
    purchase our products, either directly or through a contract
    manufacturer such as an original design manufacturer
    (“ODM”), and assemble them into the devices they
    build. OEMs typically seek to qualify two or more providers for
    each generation of products and generally will purchase products
    from those vendors for the life of that product. Many of our OEM
    customers utilize

just-in-time

inventory management processes or supply chain business models
    that allow for

“build-to-order,”

in which they do not build until there is a firm order. For
    certain OEMs, we maintain a base stock of finished goods
    inventory in facilities located near or adjacent to the
    OEM’s operations. We believe that our success depends on
    our ability to maintain and improve our strong relationships
    with the leading OEMs.

Distributors.

We use a broad group of
    distributors to sell our products to non-direct customers such
    as small computer and CE manufacturers, dealers, systems
    integrators, online retailers and other resellers. Distributors
    generally enter into non-exclusive agreements with us for the
    purchase and redistribution of our products in specific
    territories.

Retailers.

We sell our branded products
    directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer
    superstores, warehouse clubs, online retailers, and computer
    electronics stores, and authorize sales through distributors to
    smaller retailers. The retail channel complements our other
    sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for WD and
    our products. We also sell our branded products through our Web
    site.



For 2011 and 2010, no single customer accounted for 10% or more
    of our net revenue. For 2009, sales to Dell Inc. accounted for
    10% of our net revenue. For a discussion of risks related to our
    customers, refer to Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

For additional information regarding revenue recognition, sales
    by geographic region and major customer information, see
    Part II, Item 8, Notes 1 and 6 in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Competition

We compete with manufacturers of hard drives for client compute,
    client non-compute and enterprise applications as well as
    manufacturers of solid-state drives. Our competitors include
    companies such as Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, Intel
    Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co.
    Ltd., Seagate Technology, STEC, Inc. and Toshiba Corporation.

The storage industry is intensely competitive with hard drive
    and solid-state suppliers competing for sales to a limited
    number of major customers. Hard drives are highly substitutable
    due to the industry mandate of technical form, fit and function
    standards and we believe there are no substantial barriers for
    existing competitors to offer competing products. Hard drive
    manufacturers compete on the basis of product quality and
    reliability, storage capacity, unit price, product performance,
    production volume capabilities, delivery capability, leadership
    in

time-to-market,

time-to-volume

and

time-to-quality,

service and support and ease of doing business. The relative
    importance of these factors varies by customer and market and we
    believe that we are generally competitive in all of these
    factors. Semiconductor media competes with hard drives along a
    range of product attributes. In particular, semiconductor media
    currently offers attractive functionality in consumer handheld
    applications requiring smaller form factors, lower power and
    less storage capacity, such as smartphones and tablets.
    Semiconductor media offers greater performance than hard drives
    in some storage applications. Advances in magnetic, optical or
    other data storage technologies could also result in competitive
    products for storing digital content with better performance or
    lower cost per unit of capacity than our products. We monitor
    the advantages, disadvantages and advances of the full array of
    storage technologies on an ongoing basis.

We differentiate WD by focusing on operational excellence, high
    product quality and reliability, and designing and incorporating
    into our storage devices desirable product performance
    attributes. We also differentiate WD by emphasizing non-product
    related attributes such as availability and rapid response to
    our customers, which requires accelerated design cycles,
    customer delivery, production flexibility and timely service and
    support. We believe that trust in a manufacturer’s
    reputation, its execution track record and the establishment of
    strategic relationships have become important factors in the
    selection of a storage device, particularly in a rapidly
    changing technology environment.

Seasonality

We have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in our
    business with higher levels of demand in the first and second
    quarters of our fiscal year. This seasonality is a result of
    consumer spending at the beginning of the school year and during
    the holiday season. Seasonality can also be impacted by the
    growth in emerging markets and macroeconomic conditions. For a
    discussion of risks related to seasonality in our business, see
    Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Service
    and Warranty

We generally warrant our newly manufactured products against
    defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from
    the date of manufacture depending on the type of product. Our
    warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or
    replacement. We have engaged third parties in various countries
    in multiple regions to provide various levels of testing,
    processing

and/or

recertification of returned products for our customers. For a
    further discussion of our service and warranty policy, see
    Part II, Item 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

Manufacturing

We believe that we have significant know-how, unique product
    manufacturing processes, test and tooling, execution skills and
    human resources to continue to be successful and be able to
    grow, as necessary, our manufacturing operations. We strive to
    maintain manufacturing flexibility, high manufacturing yields,
    reliable products, and high-quality components. The critical
    elements of our hard drive production are high volume and
    utilization, low cost



assembly and testing, and maintaining close relationships with
    our strategic component suppliers to access

best-of-class

technology and manufacturing quality.

Hard drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the
    assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and
    thorough testing. The assembly process occurs in a “clean
    room” environment that demands skill in process engineering
    and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs
    of this manufacturing environment. Our clean room manufacturing
    process consists of modular production units, each of which
    contains a number of work cells.

We continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort
    to increase productivity, sustain and improve quality and
    decrease manufacturing costs. We continually evaluate which
    steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation
    and how automated manufacturing processes can improve
    productivity and reduce manufacturing costs. We leverage the
    efficiencies of contract manufacturers when strategically
    advantageous. For a discussion of risks related to
    manufacturing, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Materials
    and Supplies

We use a number of components, equipment, goods and services in
    the manufacturing of our products. The key components of our
    hard drives are:

•

magnetic heads;

•

magnetic media;

•

suspensions with related head gimbal assemblies
    (“HGAs”) and head stack assemblies (“HSAs”);

•

spindle motors;

•

custom and standard electronics such as

system-on-chip,

magnetic media, motor controllers,

pre-amps

and
    printed circuit boards;

•

base and top covers; and

•

magnets and related voice coil motors.

We design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and
    magnetic media required for our hard drives. We acquire all of
    the remaining components for our products from third party
    suppliers. The major components used in the manufacture of our
    solid-state drives (the semiconductor media and

system-on-chip)

and in our media players (the controller) are also acquired from
    third party suppliers. We believe that our sourcing strategy
    currently enables us to have the business flexibility needed to
    select the highest quality, low cost of ownership suppliers as
    product designs and technologies evolve.

We generally retain multiple suppliers for each of our component
    requirements but in some instances use sole sources for business
    reasons. Currently, we believe that there are no major issues
    with component availability. For a discussion of risks related
    to our component supplies, see Item 1A of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Backlog

A substantial portion of our orders are generally for shipments
    within 30 to 60 days of the placement of the order.
    Customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with
    relatively short notice to us, with little or no cost to the
    customer, or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a
    later date. In addition, for many of our OEMs utilizing

just-in-time

inventory, we do not generally require firm order commitments
    and instead, receive a periodic forecast of requirements.
    Therefore, backlog information as of the end of a particular
    period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of our
    revenue and profit and may not be comparable to prior periods.

Patents,
    Licenses and Proprietary Information

We own numerous patents and have many patent applications in
    process. We believe that, although our patents and patent
    applications have considerable value, the successful
    manufacturing and marketing of our products depends primarily
    upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff.
    Accordingly, the patents held and applied for do not ensure our
    future success.



In addition to patent protection of certain intellectual
    property rights, we consider elements of our product designs and
    processes to be proprietary and confidential. We believe that
    our non-patented intellectual property, particularly some of our
    process technology, is an important factor in our success. We
    rely upon non-disclosure agreements and contractual provisions
    and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary
    information. Despite these safeguards, there is a risk that
    competitors may obtain and use such information. The laws of
    foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide
    less protection for confidential information than the U.S.

We rely on certain technology that we license from other parties
    to manufacture and sell WD products. We believe that we have
    adequate cross-licenses and other agreements in place in
    addition to our own intellectual property portfolio to compete
    successfully in the hard drive industry. For discussion of risks
    related to our ownership and use of intellectual property, see
    Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Environmental
    Regulation

We are subject to a variety of regulations in connection with
    our operations. We believe that we have obtained or are in the
    process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our
    operations. For a discussion of risks related to environmental
    regulation, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Employees

As of July 1, 2011, we employed a total of
    65,431 employees worldwide, excluding temporary employees
    and contractors. Many of our employees are highly skilled, and
    our continued success depends in part upon our ability to
    attract and retain such employees. Accordingly, we offer
    employee benefit programs which we believe are, in the
    aggregate, competitive with those offered by our competitors. We
    consider our employee relations to be good. For a discussion of
    risks related to our skilled employees, see Item 1A of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

The
    successful completion of our planned acquisition of HGST is
    subject to risks and uncertainties, including obtaining the
    requisite regulatory approvals, and our business may suffer in
    the event we fail to successfully complete the
    acquisition.

In March 2011, we announced our planned acquisition of HGST.
    Completion of the planned acquisition of HGST is subject to
    risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to:

•

Required Government Approvals.

Completion of
    our planned acquisition of HGST is conditioned upon, among other
    things, obtaining required governmental approvals. While certain
    governmental approvals have been obtained, the transaction
    remains conditioned upon the receipt of approval from the United
    States, the European Union, the People’s Republic of China,
    Japan, Korea and Mexico. There is no assurance that we will
    obtain such approvals or, if obtained, the timing of the
    approvals. We agreed to take any and all actions to obtain the
    requisite governmental approvals in specified jurisdictions
    unless such action would reasonably be expected to materially
    impair the business operations of the combined company absent
    such imposed condition. There can be no assurance that
    conditions or changes will not be imposed and any such
    conditions or changes could have the effect of jeopardizing or
    delaying completion of the planned acquisition or reducing the
    anticipated benefits of the planned acquisition. If we agree to
    any material conditions in order to obtain any approvals
    required to complete the planned acquisition, the business and
    results of operations of the combined company may be adversely
    affected.

•

Termination Fee.

If the acquisition agreement
    is terminated by any party because the acquisition has not
    closed by March 7, 2012, and if, as of the time of such
    termination, certain regulatory and antitrust closing conditions
    have not been satisfied due to the failure to receive any
    required antitrust or competition consent, approval or



clearance or any action by any certain governmental entities to
    prevent the acquisition for antitrust or competition reasons,
    then we will be required to pay a termination fee of
    $250 million.

•

Transaction Costs.

We have incurred and will
    continue to incur costs relating to the planned acquisition
    (including significant legal and financial advisory fees) and
    many of these costs are payable by us whether or not the planned
    acquisition is completed.

•

Time and Resources Commitment.

Matters
    relating to the planned acquisition (including integration
    planning) have and will continue to require substantial
    commitments of time and resources by our management team, which
    could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that
    may have been beneficial to us.

•

Financing.

We may fail to complete the planned
    financing for the transaction.

These risks and uncertainties regarding the acquisition may
    adversely affect our relationships with our vendors and
    customers, which could harm our operating results. In addition,
    in the event that the acquisition is not completed or is
    delayed, our business could suffer and the current market price
    of our common stock may decline.

Even if
    we successfully complete our planned acquisition of HGST, we may
    fail to successfully integrate HGST’s business into our
    operations and realize the anticipated benefits from such
    integration on a timely basis, or at all, which could negatively
    impact our business.

The success of our planned acquisition of HGST will depend on
    our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from integrating
    HGST’s business into our operations. Due to legal
    restrictions, we and HGST have conducted, and until the
    completion of the planned acquisition will conduct, only limited
    planning regarding the integration of the two companies
    following the acquisition. Our ongoing business could be
    disrupted and our management’s attention diverted due to
    these integration planning activities and as a result of the
    actual integration of the two companies following the
    acquisition. Following the planned acquisition, we may fail to
    realize the anticipated benefits from this integration on a
    timely basis, or at all, for a variety of reasons, including the
    following:

•

difficulties entering new markets or manufacturing in new
    geographies where we have no or limited direct prior experience;

•

difficulties in coordinating geographically separate
    organizations, which may be subject to additional complications
    resulting from being geographically distant from our other
    operations;

•

failure to identify or assess the magnitude of certain
    liabilities we are assuming in the acquisition, which could
    result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure,
    unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes
    due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects
    on our business, operating results or financial condition;

•

failure to realize the anticipated increase in our revenues due
    to the acquisition if customers adjust their purchasing
    decisions and allocate more market share to our competitors;

•

difficulties or delays in incorporating acquired technologies or
    products with our existing product lines and maintaining uniform
    standards, controls, processes and policies;

•

failure to successfully manage relationships with our combined
    supplier and customer base;

•

the impact of the March 2011 earthquakes, tsunami and related
    events in Japan on HGST’s business, component supply or
    Japan facilities;

•

difficulties integrating and harmonizing business systems;

•

difficulties in modifying HGST’s existing accounting and
    internal control systems to comply with Section 404 of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to which HGST is not currently
    subject, which could adversely impact the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting for the combined
    company; and

•

the loss of key employees.

If we are not able to successfully integrate HGST’s
    business and technology into our operations, the anticipated
    benefits and efficiencies of the planned acquisition may not be
    realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than



expected, and our ability to compete, our revenue and gross
    margins and our results of operations may be adversely affected.

The
    integration of HGST may result in significant restructuring
    charges that could adversely affect the financial results of the
    combined company.

The financial results of the combined company may be adversely
    affected by cash expenses and non-cash accounting charges
    incurred in connection with the combination. The amount and
    timing of these possible charges are not yet known. The price of
    our common stock following the acquisition could decline to the
    extent the combined company’s financial results are
    materially affected by these charges.

The
    financing of our planned HGST acquisition will dilute our
    stockholders’ ownership interest in the company, and may
    have an adverse impact on our liquidity, limit our flexibility
    in responding to other business opportunities and increase our
    vulnerability to adverse economic and industry
    conditions.

Our planned acquisition of HGST will be financed by a
    combination of the issuance of additional shares of our common
    stock, the use of a significant amount of our cash on hand and
    the incurrence of a significant amount of indebtedness. The
    issuance of additional shares of our common stock will dilute
    your ownership interest in the company. The use of cash on hand
    and indebtedness to finance the acquisition will reduce our
    liquidity and could cause us to place more reliance on cash flow
    from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt,
    thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for
    operations and development activities. The credit agreement we
    expect to enter into with respect to the indebtedness we will
    incur to finance the planned acquisition contains restrictive
    covenants, including financial covenants requiring us to
    maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet these
    restrictive covenants can be affected by events beyond our
    control. The indebtedness and these restrictive covenants will
    also have the effect, among other things, of impairing our
    ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, limiting our
    flexibility in the conduct of our business and making us more
    vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive and
    industry conditions. In addition, a breach of the restrictive
    covenants could result in an event of default under the credit
    agreement we will enter into with respect to the indebtedness,
    which, if not cured or waived, could result in the indebtedness
    becoming immediately due and payable and could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating
    results.

Adverse
    global economic conditions and credit market uncertainty could
    harm our business, results of operations and financial
    condition.

Adverse global economic conditions and uncertain conditions in
    the credit market have had, and in the future could have, a
    significant adverse effect on our company and on the storage
    industry as a whole. Some of the risks and uncertainties we face
    as a result of these global economic and credit market
    conditions include the following:

•

Volatile Demand.

Negative or uncertain global
    economic conditions could cause many of our direct and indirect
    customers to delay or reduce their purchases of our products and
    systems containing our products. In addition, many of our
    customers rely on credit financing to purchase our products. If
    negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our
    customers’ access to credit, product orders may decrease,
    which could result in lower revenue. Likewise, if our suppliers,

sub-suppliers

and

sub-contractors

(collectively referred to as “suppliers”) face
    challenges in obtaining credit, in selling their products or
    otherwise in operating their businesses, they may be unable to
    offer the materials we use to manufacture our products. These
    actions could result in reductions in our revenue and increased
    operating costs, which could adversely affect our business,
    results of operations and financial condition.

•

Restructuring Activities.

If demand slows
    significantly as a result of a deterioration in economic
    conditions or otherwise, we may need to execute restructuring
    activities to realign our cost structure with softening demand.
    The occurrence of restructuring activities could result in
    impairment charges and other expenses, which could adversely
    impact our results of operations or financial condition.

•

Credit Volatility and Loss of Receivables.

We
    extend credit and payment terms to some of our customers. In
    addition to ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’
    financial condition, we traditionally seek to mitigate our
    credit risk by purchasing credit insurance on certain of our
    accounts receivable balances. As a result of the



continued uncertainty and volatility in global economic
    conditions, however, we may find it increasingly difficult to be
    able to insure these accounts receivable. We could suffer
    significant losses if a customer whose accounts receivable we
    have not insured, or have underinsured, fails and is unable to
    pay us. Additionally, negative or uncertain global economic
    conditions increase the risk that if a customer whose accounts
    receivable we have insured fails, the financial condition of the
    insurance carrier for such customer account may have also
    deteriorated such that it cannot cover our loss. A significant
    loss of an accounts receivable that we cannot recover through
    credit insurance would have a negative impact on our financial
    results.

•

Impairment Charges.

Negative or uncertain
    global economic conditions could result in circumstances, such
    as a sustained decline in our stock price and market
    capitalization or a decrease in our forecasted cash flows such
    that they are insufficient, indicating that the carrying value
    of our long-lived assets or goodwill may be impaired. If we are
    required to record a significant charge to earnings in our
    consolidated financial statements because an impairment of our
    long-lived assets or goodwill is determined, our results of
    operations will be adversely affected.

We
    participate in a highly competitive industry that is subject to
    the risk of declining average selling prices (“ASPs”),
    volatile gross margins and significant shifts in market share,
    all of which could adversely affect our operating
    results.

Demand for our hard drives depends in large part on the demand
    for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage
    upgrades to existing systems. The demand for systems has been
    volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on
    the demand for hard drives in any given period. As a result, the
    hard drive market has experienced periods of excess capacity,
    which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories and more
    intense price competition. If more intense price competition
    occurs, we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than
    expected, which could result in lower ASPs, revenue and gross
    margins. Our ASPs and gross margins also tend to decline when
    there is a shift in the mix of product sales, and sales of lower
    priced products increase relative to those of higher priced
    products. In addition, rapid technological changes often reduce
    the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and
    increase the risk of inventory obsolescence. These factors,
    along with others, may result in significant shifts in market
    share among the industry’s major participants.

Our
    failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for
    our products, or to quickly adjust to forecast changes, could
    adversely affect our business and financial results or operating
    efficiencies.

The data storage industry faces difficulties in accurately
    forecasting market and customer demand for its products. The
    variety and volume of products we manufacture is based in part
    on these forecasts. Accurately forecasting demand has become
    increasingly difficult for us, our customers and our suppliers
    in light of the volatility in global economic conditions and a
    recent shift from air to ocean freight in response to increased
    transportation costs, which requires additional lead times. In
    addition, because hard drives are designed to be largely
    substitutable, our demand forecasts may be impacted
    significantly by the strategic actions of our competitors. As
    forecasting demand becomes more difficult, the risk that our
    forecasts are not in line with demand increases. If our
    forecasts exceed actual market demand, then we could experience
    periods of product oversupply and price decreases, which could
    impact our financial performance. If market demand increases
    significantly beyond our forecasts or beyond our ability to add
    manufacturing capacity, then we may not be able to satisfy
    customer product needs, which could result in a loss of market
    share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands.

We
    experience significant sales seasonality and cyclicality, which
    could cause our operating results to fluctuate.

Sales of computer systems, storage subsystems and consumer
    electronics tend to be seasonal and cyclical, and therefore we
    expect to continue to experience seasonality and cyclicality in
    our business as we respond to variations in our customers’
    demand for hard drives. In the desktop, mobile, CE and retail
    markets, seasonality is partially attributable to the increase
    in sales of PCs and CE devices during the

back-to-school

and winter holiday seasons. As such, we anticipate that sales of
    our products will continue to be lower during the second half of
    our fiscal year. However, recently we have experienced

stronger-than-anticipated

demand partially driven by the increased adoption of sea freight
    in the PC supply chain. In the enterprise market our sales are
    seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles
    of our end users. However, changes in seasonal and cyclical
    patterns have made it, and could continue to make it, more
    difficult for us to forecast demand, especially in the current
    macroeconomic environment. Changes in the product or channel mix
    of our business can also impact seasonal and cyclical patterns,
    adding complexity in forecasting demand. Seasonality and



cyclicality also may lead to higher volatility in our stock
    price. It is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which
    seasonality and cyclicality may affect our stock price or
    business in future periods because of the rate and
    unpredictability of product transitions and new product
    introductions and macroeconomic conditions.

Our
    customers’ demand for storage capacity may not continue to
    grow at current industry estimates, which may lower the prices
    our customers are willing to pay for our products or put us at a
    disadvantage to competing technologies.

Our customers’ demand for storage capacity may not continue
    to grow at current industry estimates as a result of:

•

Mobile Devices.

There has been a recent rapid
    growth in CE devices that do not contain a hard drive such as
    tablet computers and smartphones. While tablet computers and
    smartphones provide many of the same capabilities as PCs, the
    extent to which they will displace or materially affect the
    demand for PCs is uncertain. If device-makers are successful in
    achieving customer acceptance of these devices as a replacement
    for traditional computing applications that contain hard drives,
    or if we are not successful in adapting our product offerings to
    include alternative storage solutions that address these
    devices, then demand for our products may decrease.

•

Cloud Computing.

Consumers traditionally have
    stored their data on their PC, often supplemented with personal
    external storage devices. Most businesses also include similar
    local storage as a primary or secondary storage location. This
    storage is typically provided by hard disk drives. Recently,
    cloud computing has emerged whereby applications and data are
    hosted, accessed and processed through a third-party provider
    over a broadband Internet connection, potentially reducing or
    eliminating the need for, among other things, significant
    storage inside the accessing computer. This trend could cause
    the market for disk drives in computers to decline over time,
    which could harm our business to the extent this decline is not
    offset by the sale of our products to customers who provide
    cloud computing services.

Demand for our products also could be negatively impacted by
    developments in the regulation and enforcement of digital rights
    management, the emergence of processes such as data
    deduplication and storage virtualization, economic conditions,
    and the rate of increase in areal density exceeding the increase
    in our customers’ demand for storage capacity. These
    factors could lead to our customers’ storage capacity needs
    being satisfied at lower prices with lower capacity hard drives
    or solid-state storage products that we do not offer, thereby
    decreasing our revenue or putting us at a disadvantage to
    competing storage technologies. As a result, even with
    increasing aggregate demand for storage capacity, if we fail to
    anticipate or timely respond to these developments in the demand
    for storage, our ASPs could decline, which could adversely
    affect our operating results.

Selling
    to the retail market is an important part of our business, and
    if we fail to maintain and grow our market share or gain market
    acceptance of our branded products, our operating results could
    suffer.

Selling branded products is an important part of our business,
    and as our branded products revenue increases as a portion of
    our overall revenue, our success in the retail market becomes
    increasingly important to our operating results. Our success in
    the retail market depends in large part on our ability to
    maintain our brand image and corporate reputation and to expand
    into and gain market acceptance of our products in multiple
    channels. Adverse publicity, whether or not justified, or
    allegations of product quality issues, even if false or
    unfounded, could tarnish our reputation and cause our customers
    to choose products offered by our competitors. In addition, the
    proliferation of new methods of mass communication facilitated
    by the Internet makes it easier for false or unfounded
    allegations to adversely affect our brand image and reputation.
    If customers no longer maintain a preference for
    WD

brand

    products, our operating results may be adversely affected.

Sales in
    the distribution channel are important to our business, and if
    we fail to respond to demand changes in distribution markets or
    if distribution markets for hard drives weaken, our operating
    results could suffer.

Our distribution customers typically sell to small computer
    manufacturers, dealers, systems integrators and other resellers.
    We face significant competition in this channel as a result of
    limited product qualification programs and a significant focus
    on price and availability of product. In addition, the PC market
    is experiencing a shift to notebook and other mobile devices
    and, as a result, more computing devices are being delivered to
    the market as complete systems, which could weaken the
    distribution market. If we fail to respond to changes in demand
    in the distribution market, our operating results could suffer.
    Additionally, if the distribution market weakens as a result of
    a slowing PC growth rate,



technology transitions or a significant change in consumer
    buying preference, or if we experience significant price
    declines due to demand changes in the distribution channel, then
    our operating results would be adversely affected.

Loss of
    market share with or by a key customer, or consolidation among
    our customer base, could harm our operating results.

During the year ended July 1, 2011, a large percentage of
    our revenue, 49%, came from sales to our top 10 customers. These
    customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and
    therefore can make substantial demands on us, including demands
    on product pricing and on contractual terms, which often results
    in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier. Our ability to
    maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is
    essential to our future performance. If we lose a key customer,
    if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products
    or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce
    costs, if a customer is acquired by one of our competitors or if
    a key customer suffers financial hardship, our operating results
    would likely be harmed.

Additionally, if there is consolidation among our customer base,
    our customers may be able to command increased leverage in
    negotiating prices and other terms of sale, which could
    adversely affect our profitability. In addition, if, as a result
    of increased leverage, customer pressures require us to reduce
    our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished, we could
    decide not to sell our products to a particular customer, which
    could result in a decrease in our revenue. Consolidation among
    our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our
    products, replacement of our products by the combined entity
    with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders, each
    of which could harm our operating results.

Our entry
    into additional storage markets increases the complexity of our
    business, and if we are unable to successfully adapt our
    business processes as required by these new markets, we will be
    at a competitive disadvantage and our ability to grow will be
    adversely affected.

As we expand our product line to sell into additional storage
    markets, the overall complexity of our business increases at an
    accelerated rate and we become subject to different market
    dynamics. The new markets into which we are expanding, or may
    expand, may have different characteristics from the markets in
    which we currently exist. These different characteristics may
    include, among other things, demand volume requirements, demand
    seasonality, product generation development rates, customer
    concentrations, warranty and product return policies and
    performance and compatibility requirements. Our failure to make
    the necessary adaptations to our business model to address these
    different characteristics, complexities and new market dynamics
    could adversely affect our operating results. For example, as we
    have previously disclosed, we entered the traditional enterprise
    market in November 2009. In addition to requiring significant
    capital expenditures, our entry into the traditional enterprise
    market adds complexity to our business that requires us to
    effectively adapt our business and management processes to
    address the unique challenges and different requirements of the
    traditional enterprise market, while maintaining a competitive
    operating cost model. If we fail to gain market acceptance in
    the traditional enterprise storage market, we will remain at a
    competitive disadvantage to the companies that succeed in this
    market and our ability to continue our growth will be negatively
    affected.

Expansion
    into new hard drive markets may cause our capital expenditures
    to increase, and if we do not successfully expand into new
    markets, our business may suffer.

To remain a significant supplier of hard drives, we will need to
    offer a broad range of hard drive products to our customers. We
    currently offer a variety of 3.5-inch or 2.5-inch hard drives
    for the desktop, mobile, enterprise, CE and external storage
    markets. However, demand for hard drives may shift to products
    in form factors or with interfaces that our competitors offer
    but which we do not. Expansion into other hard drive markets and
    resulting increases in manufacturing capacity requirements may
    require us to make substantial additional investments in part
    because our operations are largely vertically integrated now
    that we manufacture heads and magnetic media for use in many of
    the hard drives we manufacture. If we fail to successfully
    expand into new hard drive markets with products that we do not
    currently offer, we may lose business to our competitors who
    offer these products.



Our
    vertical integration of head and magnetic media manufacturing
    makes us dependent on our ability to timely and

cost-effectively

develop heads and magnetic media with leading technology and
    overall quality, and creates additional capital expenditure
    costs and asset utilization risks to our business.

Under our business plan, we are developing and manufacturing a
    substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media used in the
    hard drive products we manufacture. Consequently, we are more
    dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and
    less able to take advantage of head and magnetic media
    technologies developed by other manufacturers. Technology
    transition for head and magnetic media designs is critical to
    increasing our volume production of heads and magnetic media.
    There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful
    in timely and cost-effectively developing and manufacturing
    heads or magnetic media for products using future technologies.
    We also may not effectively transition our head or magnetic
    media design and technology to achieve acceptable manufacturing
    yields using the technologies necessary to satisfy our
    customers’ product needs, or we may encounter quality
    problems with the heads or magnetic media we manufacture. If we
    are unable to timely and cost-effectively develop heads and
    magnetic media with leading technology and overall quality, our
    ability to sell our products may be significantly diminished,
    which could materially and adversely affect our business and
    financial results.

In addition, as a result of our vertical integration of head and
    magnetic media manufacturing, we make more capital investments
    and carry a higher percentage of fixed costs than we would if we
    were not vertically integrated. If our overall level of
    production decreases for any reason, and we are unable to reduce
    our fixed costs to match sales, our head or magnetic media
    manufacturing assets may face under-utilization that may impact
    our operating results. We are therefore subject to additional
    risks related to overall asset utilization, including the need
    to operate at high levels of utilization to drive competitive
    costs and the need for assured supply of components that we do
    not manufacture ourselves. If we do not adequately address the
    challenges related to our head or magnetic media manufacturing
    operations, our ongoing operations could be disrupted, resulting
    in a decrease in our revenue or profit margins and negatively
    impacting our operating results.

We make
    significant investments in research and development to improve
    our technology and develop new technologies, and unsuccessful
    investments could materially adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Over the past several years, our business strategy has been to
    derive a competitive advantage by moving from being a follower
    of new technologies to being a leader in the innovation and
    development of new technologies. This strategy requires us to
    make significant investments in research and development and, in
    attempting to remain competitive, we may increase our capital
    expenditures and expenses above our historical run-rate model.
    There can be no assurance that these investments will result in
    viable technologies or products, or if these investments do
    result in viable technologies or products, that they will be
    profitable or accepted by the market. Significant investments in
    unsuccessful research and development efforts could materially
    adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
    of operations. In addition, increased investments in technology
    could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with
    demand for our products, which would have a negative impact on
    our financial results.

Current
    or future competitors may gain a technology advantage or develop
    an advantageous cost structure that we cannot match.

It may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain
    an advantage in product technology, manufacturing technology, or
    process technology, which may allow them to offer products or
    services that have a significant advantage over the products and
    services that we offer. Advantages could be in capacity,
    performance, reliability, serviceability, or other attributes. A
    competitive cost structure for our products, including critical
    components, labor and overhead, is also critical to the success
    of our business. We may be at a competitive disadvantage to any
    companies that are able to gain a technological or cost
    structure advantage.

Further
    industry consolidation could provide competitive advantages to
    our competitors.

The hard drive industry has experienced consolidation over the
    past several years. Consolidation by our competitors may enhance
    their capacity, abilities and resources and lower their cost
    structure, causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage.



Some of
    our competitors with diversified business units outside the hard
    drive industry may over extended periods of time sell hard
    drives at prices that we cannot profitably match.

Some of our competitors earn a significant portion of their
    revenue from business units outside the hard drive industry.
    Because they do not depend solely on sales of hard drives to
    achieve profitability, they may sell hard drives at lower prices
    and operate their hard drive business unit at a loss over an
    extended period of time while still remaining profitable
    overall. In addition, if these competitors can increase sales of
    non-hard drive products to the same customers, they may benefit
    from selling their hard drives at lower prices. Our operating
    results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully
    compete with the pricing by these companies.

If we
    fail to qualify our products with our customers or if product
    life cycles lengthen, it may have a significant adverse impact
    on our sales and margins.

We regularly engage in new product qualification with our
    customers. Once a product is accepted for qualification testing,
    failures or delays in the qualification process can result in
    delayed or reduced product sales, reduced product margins caused
    by having to continue to offer a more costly current generation
    product, or lost sales to that customer until the next
    generation of products is introduced. The effect of missing a
    product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited
    number of high volume OEMs, which continue to consolidate their
    share of the storage markets. Likewise, if product life cycles
    lengthen, we may have a significantly longer period to wait
    before we have an opportunity to qualify a new product with a
    customer, which could reduce our profits because we expect
    declining gross margins on our current generation products as a
    result of competitive pressures.

We are
    subject to risks related to product defects, which could result
    in product recalls or epidemic failures and could subject us to
    warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which
    are greater than anticipated.

We warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to
    five years. We test our hard drives in our manufacturing
    facilities through a variety of means. However, there can be no
    assurance that our testing will reveal defects in our products,
    which may not become apparent until after the products have been
    sold into the market. Accordingly, there is a risk that product
    defects will occur, which could require a product recall.
    Product recalls can be expensive to implement and, if a product
    recall occurs during the product’s warranty period, we may
    be required to replace the defective product. Moreover, there is
    a risk that product defects may trigger an epidemic failure
    clause in a customer agreement. If an epidemic failure occurs,
    we may be required to replace or refund the value of the
    defective product and to cover certain other costs associated
    with the consequences of the epidemic failure. In addition, a
    product recall or epidemic failure may damage our reputation or
    customer relationships, and may cause us to lose market share
    with our customers, including our OEM and ODM customers.

Our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions
    of liability for consequential damages and for misuse, improper
    installation, alteration, accident or mishandling while in the
    possession of someone other than us. We record an accrual for
    estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. We
    may incur additional operating expenses if our warranty
    provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues
    related to defects in our products, whether as a result of a
    product recall, epidemic failure or otherwise. If these
    additional expenses are significant, it could adversely affect
    our business, financial condition and operating results.

Dependence
    on a limited number of qualified suppliers of components and
    manufacturing equipment could lead to delays, lost revenue or
    increased costs.

Our future operating results may depend substantially on our
    suppliers’ ability to timely qualify their components in
    our programs, and their ability to supply us with these
    components in sufficient volumes to meet our production
    requirements. A number of the components that we use are
    available from only a single or limited number of qualified
    suppliers, and may be used across multiple product lines. As
    such, the success of our products depends on our ability to gain
    access to and integrate parts from reliable component suppliers.
    To do so, we must maintain effective relationships with our
    supply base to source our component needs, develop compatible
    technology, and maintain continuity of supply at reasonable
    costs. If we fail to maintain effective relationships with our
    supply base, or if we fail to integrate components from our
    suppliers effectively, this may adversely affect our ability to
    develop and deliver the best products to our customers and our
    profitability could suffer.



Certain equipment and consumables we use in our manufacturing or
    testing processes are available only from a limited number of
    suppliers. Some of this equipment and consumables use materials
    that at times could be in short supply. If these materials are
    not available, or are not available in the quantities we require
    for our manufacturing and testing processes, our ability to
    manufacture our products could be impacted, and we could suffer
    significant loss of revenue.

Each of the following could also significantly harm our
    operating results:

•

an unwillingness of a supplier to supply such components or
    equipment to us;

•

consolidation of key suppliers;

•

failure of a key supplier’s business process;

•

a key supplier’s or

sub-supplier’s

inability to access credit necessary to operate its
    business; or

•

failure of a key supplier to remain in business, to remain an
    independent merchant supplier, or to adjust to market conditions.

Shortages
    of commodity materials or commodity components, price
    volatility, or use by other industries of materials and
    components used in the hard drive industry, may negatively
    impact our operating results.

Increases in the cost for certain commodity materials or
    commodity components may increase our costs of manufacturing and
    transporting hard drives and key components. Shortages of
    commodity components such as DRAM and NAND flash, or commodity
    materials such as glass substrates, stainless steel, aluminum,
    nickel, neodymium, ruthenium, platinum or cerium, may increase
    our costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are
    unable to find ways to mitigate these increased costs. We or our
    suppliers acquire certain precious metals and rare earth metals
    like ruthenium, platinum, neodymium and cerium, critical to the
    manufacture of components in our products from a number of
    countries, including the People’s Republic of China. The
    government of China or any other nation may impose regulations,
    quotas or embargoes upon these metals that would restrict the
    worldwide supply of such metals

and/or

increase their cost, both of which could negatively impact our
    operating results until alternative suppliers are sourced.
    Furthermore, if other high volume industries increase their
    demand for materials or components used in our products, our
    costs may further increase, which could have an adverse effect
    on our operating margins. In addition, shortages in other
    commodity components and materials used in our customers’
    products could result in a decrease in demand for our products,
    which would negatively impact our operating results. The
    volatility in the cost of oil also affects our costs and may
    result in lower operating margins if we are unable to pass these
    increased costs on to our customers.

Contractual
    commitments with component suppliers may result in us paying
    increased charges and cash advances for such components or may
    cause us to have inadequate or excess component
    inventory.

To reduce the risk of component shortages, we attempt to provide
    significant lead times when buying components, which may subject
    us to cancellation charges if we cancel orders as a result of
    technology transitions or changes in our component needs. In
    addition, we may from time to time enter into contractual
    commitments with component suppliers in an effort to increase
    and stabilize the supply of those components and enable us to
    purchase such components at favorable prices. Some of these
    commitments may require us to buy a substantial number of
    components from the supplier or make significant cash advances
    to the supplier; however, these commitments may not result in a
    satisfactory increase or stabilization of the supply of such
    components. Furthermore, as a result of uncertain global
    economic conditions, our ability to forecast our requirements
    for these components has become increasingly difficult,
    therefore increasing the risk that our contractual commitments
    may not meet our actual supply requirements, which could cause
    us to have inadequate or excess component inventory and
    adversely affect our operating results and increase our
    operating costs.

Failure
    by certain suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and
    manufacture components, technology or production equipment for
    our products may adversely affect our operations.

We rely on suppliers for various component parts that we
    integrate into our hard drives but do not manufacture ourselves,
    such as semiconductors, motors, flex circuits and suspensions.
    Likewise, we rely on suppliers for certain



technology and equipment necessary for advanced development
    technology for future products. Some of these components, and
    most of this technology and production equipment, must be
    specifically designed to be compatible for use in our products
    or for developing and manufacturing our future products, and are
    only available from a limited number of suppliers, some of with
    whom we are sole sourced. We are therefore dependent on these
    suppliers to be able and willing to dedicate adequate
    engineering resources to develop components that can be
    successfully integrated with our products, and technology and
    production equipment that can be used to develop and manufacture
    our next-generation products efficiently. The failure of these
    suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture
    components that can be integrated into our products or
    technology and production equipment that can be used to develop
    or manufacture next generation products may cause us to
    experience inability or delay in our manufacturing and shipment
    of hard drive products, our expansion into new technology and
    markets, or our ability to remain competitive with alternative
    storage technologies, therefore adversely affecting our business
    and financial results.

Changes
    in product life cycles could adversely affect our financial
    results.

If product life cycles lengthen, we may need to develop new
    technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any particular
    product to maintain competitive pricing for that product. If
    product life cycles shorten, it may result in an increase in our
    overall expenses and a decrease in our gross margins, both of
    which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition,
    shortening of product life cycles also makes it more difficult
    to recover the cost of product development before the product
    becomes obsolete. Our failure to recover the cost of product
    development in the future could adversely affect our operating
    results.

A
    fundamental change in recording technology could result in
    significant increases in our operating expenses and could put us
    at a competitive disadvantage.

Historically, when the industry experiences a fundamental change
    in technology, any manufacturer that fails to successfully and
    timely adjust its designs and processes to accommodate the new
    technology fails to remain competitive. There are some
    revolutionary technologies, such as
    current-perpendicular-to-plane giant magnetoresistance, shingle
    magnetic recording, energy assisted magnetic recording,
    patterned magnetic media and advanced signal processing, that if
    implemented by a competitor on a commercially viable basis ahead
    of the industry, could put us at a competitive disadvantage. As
    a result of these technology shifts, we could incur substantial
    costs in developing new technologies, such as heads, magnetic
    media, and tools to remain competitive. If we fail to
    successfully implement these new technologies, or if we are
    significantly slower than our competitors at implementing new
    technologies, we may not be able to offer products with
    capacities that our customers desire.

The
    difficulty of introducing hard drives with higher levels of
    areal density and the challenges of reducing other costs may
    impact our ability to achieve historical levels of cost
    reduction.

Storage capacity of the hard drive, as manufactured by us, is
    determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal
    density. Areal density is a measure of the amount of magnetic
    bits that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk.
    Generally, the higher the areal density, the more information
    can be stored on a single platter. Higher areal densities
    require existing head and magnetic media technology to be
    improved or new technologies developed to accommodate more data
    on a single disk. Historically, we have been able to achieve a
    large percentage of cost reduction through increases in areal
    density. Increases in areal density mean that the average drive
    we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same capacity and,
    therefore, may result in a lower component cost. However,
    increasing areal density has become more difficult in the hard
    drive industry. If we are not able to increase areal density at
    the same rate as our competitors or at a rate that is expected
    by our customers, we may be required to include more components
    in our drives to meet demand without corresponding incremental
    revenue, which could negatively impact our operating margins and
    make achieving historical levels of cost reduction difficult or
    unlikely. Additionally, increases in areal density may require
    us to make further capital expenditures on items such as new
    testing equipment needed as a result of an increased number of
    GB per platter. Our inability to achieve cost reductions could
    adversely affect our operating results.



If we do
    not properly manage technology transitions and new product
    development, our competitiveness and operating results may be
    negatively affected.

The storage markets in which we offer our products continuously
    undergo technology transitions which we must anticipate and
    adapt our products to address in a timely manner. If we fail to
    implement these new technologies successfully, or if we are
    slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies, we
    may not be able to competitively offer products that our
    customers desire, which could harm our operating results.

In addition, the success of our new product introductions
    depends on a number of other factors, including

•

difficulties faced in manufacturing ramp;

•

implementing at an acceptable cost product features expected by
    our customers;

•

market acceptance/qualification;

•

effective management of inventory levels in line with
    anticipated product demand; and

•

quality problems or other defects in the early stages of new
    product introduction that were not anticipated in the design of
    those products.

Our business may suffer if we fail to successfully anticipate
    and manage these issues associated with our product development.

If we
    fail to develop and introduce new hard drives that are
    competitive against alternative storage technologies, our
    business may suffer.

Our success depends in part on our ability to develop and
    introduce new products in a timely manner in order to keep pace
    with competing technologies. Alternative storage technologies
    like solid-state storage technology have successfully served
    digital entertainment markets for products such as digital
    cameras, MP3 players, USB flash drives, mobile phones and tablet
    devices that cannot be economically serviced using hard drive
    technology. Advances in semiconductor technology have resulted
    in solid-state storage emerging as a technology that is
    competitive with hard drives for high performance needs in
    advanced digital computing markets such as enterprise servers
    and storage. Solid-state storage is produced by large
    semiconductor companies who can then sell their storage products
    at lower prices while still remaining profitable overall. This
    can help them improve their market share at the expense of the
    competition. In addition, these semiconductor companies may
    choose to supply companies like us with semiconductor media at
    prices that make it difficult, if not impossible, for us to
    compete with them on a profitable basis. As a result, there can
    be no assurance that we will be successful in anticipating and
    developing new products for the desktop, mobile, enterprise, CE
    and external storage markets in response to solid-state storage,
    as well as other competing technologies. If our hard drive
    technology fails to offer higher capacity, performance and
    reliability with lower

cost-per-gigabyte

than solid-state storage for the desktop, mobile, enterprise, CE
    and external storage markets, we will be at a competitive
    disadvantage to companies using semiconductor technology to
    serve these markets and our business will suffer.

Our
    manufacturing operations, and those of certain of our suppliers
    and customers, are concentrated in large, purpose-built
    facilities, which subjects us to substantial risk of damage or
    loss if operations at any of these facilities are
    disrupted.

As a result of our cost structure and strategy of vertical
    integration, we conduct our manufacturing operations at large,
    high volume, purpose-built facilities. For example, a
    substantial majority of our requirement for heads is satisfied
    by wafers fabricated in our Fremont, California facility. Also,
    we manufacture the majority of our substrates for magnetic media
    in our Johor, Malaysia facility, and we finish a majority of our
    magnetic media in our facilities in Penang, Malaysia and Tuas,
    Singapore. A majority of our high volume hard drive
    manufacturing operations are conducted in our two facilities in
    Thailand, with the balance conducted in our Kuala Lumpur,
    Malaysia facility and the facilities of our contract
    manufacturers in Asia, Brazil, Europe and the United States. As
    part of our planned acquisition of HGST, we will also acquire
    manufacturing facilities located in Japan, China and the
    Philippines (as well as additional factories in Singapore,
    Thailand and Malaysia). The manufacturing facilities of many of
    our customers, our suppliers and our customers’ suppliers
    are also concentrated in certain geographic locations in Asia
    and elsewhere. A localized health risk affecting our employees
    at these facilities or the staff of our or our customers’
    other suppliers, such as the spread of the Influenza A (H1N1) or
    a new pandemic influenza, could impair the total volume of hard
    drives that we are able to manufacture

and/or



sell, which would result in substantial harm to our operating
    results. Similarly, a fire, flood, earthquake, tsunami or other
    disaster, condition or event such as political instability,
    civil unrest or a power outage that adversely affects any of
    these facilities would significantly affect our ability to
    manufacture

and/or

sell
    hard drives, which would result in a substantial loss of sales
    and revenue and a substantial harm to our operating results.

For example, while we presently do not have manufacturing
    operations located in Japan, we do source certain components
    from suppliers with facilities in Japan. The March 2011
    earthquakes, tsunami and related events in Japan, including the
    resulting power outages, have affected and may continue to
    affect the supply of certain components used in the production
    of hard drives and systems that include hard drives. The
    development of events in Japan has, however, been fluid and
    unpredictable. If we experience any shortage of components of
    acceptable quality, or any interruption in the supply of
    required components we cannot promptly obtain from alternative
    sources at acceptable prices, our operating results would be
    adversely affected. In addition, even if the events in Japan do
    not adversely affect our component supply, they may adversely
    affect the supply of other components our customers use in their
    systems, which could negatively impact demand for our products
    and, therefore, our revenues.

Manufacturing
    outside the United States and marketing our products globally
    subjects us to numerous risks.

We are subject to risks associated with our global manufacturing
    operations and global marketing efforts, including:

•

obtaining requisite U.S. and foreign governmental permits
    and approvals;

•

currency exchange rate fluctuations or restrictions;

•

political instability and civil unrest;

•

limited transportation availability, delays, and extended time
    required for shipping, which risks may be compounded in periods
    of price declines;

•

higher freight rates;

•

labor problems;

•

trade restrictions or higher tariffs;

•

copyright levies or similar fees or taxes imposed in European
    and other countries;

•

exchange, currency and tax controls and reallocations;

•

increasing labor and overhead costs; and

•

loss or non-renewal of favorable tax treatment under agreements
    or treaties with foreign tax authorities.

Terrorist
    attacks may adversely affect our business and operating
    results.

The continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war
    or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial and
    insurance markets and have significantly increased the
    political, economic and social instability in some of the
    geographic areas in which we operate. Additionally, it is
    uncertain what impact the reactions to such acts by various
    governmental agencies and security regulators worldwide will
    have on shipping costs. Acts of terrorism, either domestically
    or abroad, could create further uncertainties and instability.
    To the extent this results in disruption or delays of our
    manufacturing capabilities or shipments of our products, our
    business, operating results and financial condition could be
    adversely affected.

Sudden
    disruptions to the availability of freight lanes could have an
    impact on our operations.

We generally ship our products to our customers, and receive
    shipments from our suppliers, via air, ocean or land freight.
    The sudden unavailability or disruption of cargo operations or
    freight lanes, such as due to labor difficulties or disputes,
    severe weather patterns or other natural disasters, or political
    instability or civil unrest, could impact our operating results
    by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our
    products.



We are
    vulnerable to system failures or attacks, which could harm our
    business.

We are heavily dependent on our technology infrastructure, among
    other functions, to operate our factories, sell our products,
    fulfill orders, manage inventory and bill, collect and make
    payments. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption
    from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures,
    computer viruses, computer

denial-of-service

attacks and other events. Our business is also subject to
    break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by third
    parties as well as employees. Despite any precautions we may
    take, such problems could result in, among other consequences,
    interruptions in our business, which could harm our reputation
    and financial condition.

If we
    fail to identify, manage, complete and integrate acquisitions,
    investment opportunities or other significant transactions, it
    may adversely affect our future results.

As part of our growth strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of,
    investment opportunities in or other significant transactions
    with companies that are complementary to our business. In order
    to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify
    attractive acquisition or investment opportunities, successfully
    complete the transaction, some of which may be large and
    complex, and manage post-closing issues such as integration of
    the acquired company or employees. We may not be able to
    identify or complete appealing acquisition or investment
    opportunities given the intense competition for these
    transactions. Even if we identify and complete suitable
    corporate transactions, we may not be able to successfully
    address any integration challenges in a timely manner, or at
    all. If we fail to successfully integrate an acquisition, we may
    not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of the
    acquisition, and our future results of operations could be
    adversely affected.

If we are
    unable to retain or hire key staff and skilled employees our
    business results may suffer.

Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key
    staff and skilled employees, many of whom would be extremely
    difficult to replace. Global competition for skilled employees
    in the data storage industry is intense and, as we attempt to
    move to a position of technology leadership in the storage
    industry, our business success becomes increasingly dependent on
    our ability to retain our key staff and skilled employees as
    well as attract, integrate and retain new skilled employees.
    Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price
    and the overall markets may adversely affect our ability to
    retain key staff or skilled employees who have received equity
    compensation. Additionally, because a substantial portion of our
    key employees’ compensation is placed “at risk”
    and linked to the performance of our business, when our
    operating results are negatively impacted by global economic
    conditions, we are at a competitive disadvantage for retaining
    and hiring key staff and skilled employees versus other
    companies that pay a relatively higher fixed salary. If we are
    unable to retain our existing key staff or skilled employees, or
    hire and integrate new key staff or skilled employees, or if we
    fail to implement succession plans for our key staff, our
    operating results would likely be harmed.

The
    nature of our business and our reliance on intellectual property
    and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk of
    significant litigation.

The data storage industry has been characterized by significant
    litigation. This includes litigation relating to patent and
    other intellectual property rights, product liability claims and
    other types of litigation. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy
    and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the
    results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in
    adverse rulings or decisions. We may enter into settlements or
    be subject to judgments that may, individually or in the
    aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition or operating results.

We evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices
    of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to
    time. If claims or actions are asserted against us, we may be
    required to obtain a license or cross-license, modify our
    existing technology or design a new non-infringing technology.
    Such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly.
    In addition, we may decide to settle a claim or action against
    us, which settlement could be costly. We may also be liable for
    any past infringement. If there is an adverse ruling against us
    in an infringement lawsuit, an injunction could be issued
    barring production or sale of any infringing product. It could
    also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or
    lost profits or, if there is a finding of willful infringement,
    treble damages. Any of these results would increase our costs
    and harm our operating results.



Our
    reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary
    information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients
    of our business could be copied by competitors.

Our success depends, in significant part, on the proprietary
    nature of our technology, including non-patentable intellectual
    property such as our process technology. If a competitor is able
    to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology despite
    the safeguards we have in place, it may be difficult, expensive
    or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection. Also,
    the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our
    intellectual property to the same extent as do U.S. laws.
    In addition to patent protection of intellectual property
    rights, we consider elements of our product designs and
    processes to be proprietary and confidential. We rely upon
    employee, consultant and vendor non-disclosure agreements and
    contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to
    protect our proprietary information. However, any of our
    registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be
    challenged or exploited by others in the industry, which might
    harm our operating results.

The costs
    of compliance with state, federal and international legal and
    regulatory requirements, such as environmental, labor, trade and
    tax regulations, and customers’ standards of corporate
    citizenship could cause an increase in our operating
    costs.

We may be or become subject to various state, federal and
    international laws and regulations governing our environmental,
    labor, trade and tax practices. These laws and regulations,
    particularly those applicable to our international operations,
    are or may be complex, extensive and subject to change. We will
    need to ensure that we and our component suppliers timely comply
    with such laws and regulations, which may result in an increase
    in our operating costs. For example, the European Union
    (“EU”) has enacted the Restriction of the Use of
    Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic
    Equipment (“RoHS”) directive, which prohibits the use
    of certain substances in electronic equipment, and the Waste
    Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”)
    directive, which obligates parties that place electrical and
    electronic equipment onto the market in the EU to put a clearly
    identifiable mark on the equipment, register with and report to
    EU member countries regarding distribution of the equipment, and
    provide a mechanism to take back and properly dispose of the
    equipment. Similar legislation may be enacted in other locations
    where we manufacture or sell our products. In addition, climate
    change and financial reform legislation in the United States is
    a significant topic of discussion and has generated and may
    continue to generate federal or other regulatory responses in
    the near future. If we or our component suppliers fail to timely
    comply with applicable legislation, our customers may refuse to
    purchase our products or we may face increased operating costs
    as a result of taxes, fines or penalties, which would have a
    materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition
    and operating results.

In connection with our compliance with such environmental laws
    and regulations, as well as our compliance with industry
    environmental initiatives, the standards of business conduct
    required by some of our customers, and our commitment to sound
    corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business, we could
    incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject
    to disruptions to our operations and logistics. In addition, if
    we were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliant
    with these initiatives or standards of conduct, we could be
    subject to governmental fines, liability to our customers and
    damage to our reputation and corporate brand which could cause
    our financial condition or operating results to suffer.

Violation
    of applicable laws, including labor or environmental laws, and
    certain other practices by our suppliers could harm our
    business.

We expect our suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable
    laws and regulations, including labor and environmental laws,
    and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of
    conduct. While our internal operating guidelines promote ethical
    business practices, we do not control our suppliers or their
    labor or environmental practices. The violation of labor,
    environmental or other laws by any of our suppliers, or
    divergence of a supplier’s business practices from those
    generally accepted as ethical in the United States, could harm
    our business by:

•

interrupting or otherwise disrupting the shipment of our product
    components;

•

damaging our reputation;

•

forcing us to find alternate component sources;

•

reducing demand for our products (for example, through a
    consumer boycott); or



•

exposing us to potential liability for our supplier’s
    wrongdoings.

Fluctuations
    in currency exchange rates as a result of our international
    operations may negatively affect our operating
    results.

Because we manufacture and sell our products abroad, our
    revenue, margins, operating costs and cash flows are impacted by
    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. If the
    U.S. dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most
    foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar equivalents of unhedged
    manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion
    of our production costs are foreign-currency denominated.
    Conversely, there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues
    since revenues are substantially U.S. dollar denominated.
    Additionally, we negotiate and procure some of our component
    requirements in U.S. dollars from Japanese and other

non-U.S. based

vendors. If the U.S. dollar continues to weaken against
    other foreign currencies, some of our component suppliers may
    increase the price they charge for their components in order to
    maintain an equivalent profit margin. If this occurs, it would
    have a negative impact on our operating results.

Prices for our products are substantially U.S. dollar
    denominated, even when sold to customers that are located
    outside the United States. Therefore, as a substantial portion
    of our sales are from countries outside the United States,
    fluctuations in currency exchanges rates, most notably the
    strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other foreign
    currencies, contribute to variations in sales of products in
    impacted jurisdictions and could adversely impact demand and
    revenue growth. In addition, currency variations can adversely
    affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside the
    United States.

We have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency
    exchange rate changes by, among other things, entering into
    short-term, foreign exchange contracts. However, these contracts
    do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the
    counterparty if currency controls are put in place. Currently,
    we hedge the Thai Baht, Malaysian Ringgit, Euro and British
    Pound Sterling with foreign exchange contracts.

Increases
    in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses
    and an increase in our operating costs.

Some of our OEM customers have adopted a subcontractor model
    that requires us to contract directly with companies, such as
    ODMs, that provide manufacturing and fulfillment services to our
    OEM customers. Because these subcontractors are generally not as
    well capitalized as our direct OEM customers, this subcontractor
    model exposes us to increased credit risks. Our agreements with
    our OEM customers may not permit us to increase our product
    prices to alleviate this increased credit risk. Additionally, as
    we attempt to expand our OEM and distribution channel sales into
    emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India and China, the
    customers with the most success in these regions may have
    relatively short operating histories, making it more difficult
    for us to accurately assess the associated credit risks. Any
    credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased
    risks, or as a result of credit losses from any significant
    customer, would increase our operating costs, which may
    negatively impact our operating results.

Our
    operating results fluctuate, sometimes significantly, from
    period to period due to many factors, which may result in a
    significant decline in our stock price.

Our quarterly operating results may be subject to significant
    fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including:

•

the timing of orders from and shipment of products to major
    customers;

•

our product mix;

•

changes in the prices of our products;

•

manufacturing delays or interruptions;

•

acceptance by customers of competing products in lieu of our
    products;

•

variations in the cost of and lead times for components for our
    products;

•

limited availability of components that we obtain from a single
    or a limited number of suppliers;

•

seasonal and other fluctuations in demand for PCs often due to
    technological advances; and



•

availability and rates of transportation.

We often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in
    the third month of the quarter, which makes it difficult for us
    to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter.
    As a result of the above or other factors, our forecast of
    operating results for the quarter may differ materially from our
    actual financial results. If our results of operations fail to
    meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could cause
    an immediate and significant decline in our stock price.

We have
    made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions
    relating to our consolidated financial reporting, and actual
    results may differ significantly from our estimates and
    assumptions.

We have made and continue to make a number of estimates and
    assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting.
    The highly technical nature of our products and the rapidly
    changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual
    results may differ significantly from our estimates and
    assumptions. These changes have impacted our financial results
    in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Key
    estimates and assumptions for us include:

•

price protection adjustments and other sales promotions and
    allowances on products sold to retailers, resellers and
    distributors;

•

inventory adjustments for write-down of inventories to lower of
    cost or market value (net realizable value);

•

reserves for doubtful accounts;

•

accruals for product returns;

•

accruals for warranty costs related to product defects;

•

accruals for litigation and other contingencies;

•

liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits; and

•

expensing of stock-based compensation.

The
    market price of our common stock is volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue
    to be, extremely volatile. Factors that may significantly affect
    the market price of our common stock include the following:

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results,
    including those resulting from the seasonality of our business;

•

announcements of technological innovations by us or our
    competitors which may decrease the volume and profitability of
    sales of our existing products and increase the risk of
    inventory obsolescence;

•

new products introduced by us or our competitors;

•

periods of severe pricing pressures due to oversupply or price
    erosion resulting from competitive pressures or industry
    consolidation;

•

developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights;

•

conditions and trends in the hard drive, computer, data and
    content management, storage and communication industries;

•

contraction in our operating results or growth rates that are
    lower than our previous high growth-rate periods;

•

changes in financial estimates by securities analysts relating
    specifically to us or the hard drive industry in general;

•

macroeconomic conditions that affect the market
    generally; and

•

uncertainties regarding our planned acquisition of HGST.



In addition, general economic conditions may cause the stock
    market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from
    time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many
    high technology companies. These fluctuations often appear to be
    unrelated to the operating performance of the companies.

Securities class action lawsuits are often brought against
    companies after periods of volatility in the market price of
    their securities. A number of such suits have been filed against
    us in the past, and should any new lawsuits be filed, such
    matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of
    resources and management’s attention.

Current
    economic conditions have caused us difficulty in adequately
    protecting our increased cash and cash equivalents from
    financial institution failures.

The uncertain global economic conditions and volatile investment
    markets have caused us to hold more cash and cash equivalents
    than we would hold under normal circumstances. Since there has
    been an overall increase in demand for low-risk,
    U.S. government-backed securities with a limited supply in
    the financial marketplace, we face increased difficulty in
    adequately protecting our increased cash and cash equivalents
    from possible sudden and unforeseeable failures by banks and
    other financial institutions. A failure of any of these
    financial institutions in which deposits exceed FDIC limits
    could have an adverse impact on our financial position.

If our
    internal controls are found to be ineffective, our financial
    results or our stock price may be adversely affected.

Our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of
    July 1, 2011, in compliance with Section 404 of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective. We believe that we currently have
    adequate internal control procedures in place for future
    periods; however, if our internal control over financial
    reporting is found to be ineffective or if we identify a
    material weakness in our financial reporting, investors may lose
    confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which
    may adversely affect our financial results or our stock price.

From time
    to time we may become subject to income tax audits or similar
    proceedings, and as a result we may incur additional costs and
    expenses or owe additional taxes, interest and penalties that
    may negatively impact our operating results.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain
    foreign jurisdictions, and our determination of our tax
    liability is subject to review by applicable domestic and
    foreign tax authorities. For example, as we have previously
    disclosed, we are under examination by the Internal Revenue
    Service for certain fiscal years and in connection with that
    examination, we received Revenue Agent Reports seeking certain
    adjustments to income as disclosed in Part II, Item 8,
    Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Although we believe our tax positions are properly supported,
    the final timing and resolution of the notice of proposed
    adjustment and the audits are subject to significant uncertainty
    and could result in our having to pay amounts to the applicable
    tax authority in order to resolve examination of our tax
    positions, which could result in an increase or decrease of our
    current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits and may negatively
    impact our financial position, results of operations, net income
    or cash flows.

Item 2.

Properties

In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we began the process of
    relocating our corporate headquarters from Lake Forest,
    California to Irvine, California. The Irvine headquarters
    consist of approximately 365,000 square feet of leased
    space and house our management, research and development,
    administrative and sales staff. We continue to lease certain
    facilities in Lake Forest, California while we complete the
    relocation. The Lake Forest facilities consist of approximately
    67,000 square feet of leased space and house certain
    engineering and administrative staff. In addition, we lease one
    facility in Aliso Viejo, California, consisting of approximately
    34,000 square feet, which we use to house research and
    development, administrative and sales staff. We expect to
    complete the relocation and consolidation of our Lake Forest and
    Aliso Viejo functions to Irvine in the third quarter of fiscal
    2012.



In Fremont, California, we own facilities consisting of
    approximately 286,000 square feet, which we use for head
    wafer fabrication, research and development and warehousing. In
    San Jose, California, we lease facilities consisting of
    approximately 475,000 square feet, which we use for
    research and development. In Phoenix, Arizona, we own wafer
    fabrication facilities consisting of approximately
    545,000 square feet. In Longmont, Colorado, we lease one
    facility consisting of approximately 43,000 square feet,
    which we use for research and development. We also lease office
    space in various other locations throughout the world primarily
    for research and development and sales and technical support.

We own manufacturing facilities in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,
    consisting of approximately 1,054,000 square feet, which we
    use for assembly of hard drives, printed circuit boards and
    HSAs. We also own manufacturing facilities in Penang and Johor,
    Malaysia, consisting of approximately 800,000 and
    243,000 square feet, respectively, and we own and lease
    manufacturing facilities in Tuas, Singapore, consisting of
    approximately 311,000 square feet, all of which we use for
    our magnetic media operations. We also own manufacturing
    facilities in Navanakorn, Thailand, consisting of approximately
    226,000 square feet, which we use for assembly of hard
    drives and HSAs, and facilities in Bang Pa-In, Thailand,
    consisting of approximately 1,031,000 square feet, which we
    use for slider fabrication, the assembly of hard drives, HGAs
    and HSAs, and research and development.

We believe our present facilities are adequate for our current
    needs, although the process of upgrading our facilities to meet
    technological and market requirements is expected to continue.
    New manufacturing facilities, in general, can be developed and
    become operational within approximately nine to eighteen months
    should we require such additional facilities.

    in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully
    review the disclosures we make concerning risks and other
    factors that may affect our business and operating results,
    including those made in Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

and any of those made in our other reports filed with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). You
    are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
    forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of

Our
    Company

We are a global provider of solutions for the collection,
    storage, management, protection and use of digital content,
    including audio and video. Our principal products are hard
    drives, which are devices that use one or more rotating magnetic
    disks (“magnetic media”) to store and allow fast
    access to data. Hard drives are currently the primary storage
    medium for digital content. Our hard drives are used in desktop
    and notebook computers, corporate and cloud computing data
    centers, home entertainment equipment and stand-alone consumer
    storage devices. In addition to hard drives, our other products
    include solid-state drives and home entertainment and networking
    products.

Planned
    Acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies

On March 7, 2011, we entered into a stock purchase
    agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Hitachi,
    Ltd. (“Hitachi”), Viviti Technologies Ltd., until
    recently known as Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Holdings
    Pte. Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Hitachi
    (“HGST”), and Western Digital Ireland, Ltd., our
    indirect wholly owned subsidiary (“WDI”). Pursuant to
    the Purchase Agreement, WDI agreed to acquire all of the issued
    and outstanding

paid-up

share



capital of HGST from Hitachi. The planned acquisition is
    intended to result in a more efficient and innovative
    customer-focused storage company, with significant operating
    scale, strong global talent and the industry’s broadest
    product lineup backed by a rich technology portfolio. The
    aggregate purchase price of the planned acquisition is estimated
    to be approximately $4.3 billion, due at closing, and will
    be funded with existing cash, new debt, and 25 million
    newly issued shares of our common stock. The Purchase Agreement
    contains certain termination rights for both us and Hitachi,
    including the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement if the
    planned acquisition has not closed by March 7, 2012. If the
    planned acquisition has not closed by March 7, 2012 due to
    the failure to receive any required antitrust or competition
    authority’s consent, approval or clearance or any action by
    any certain governmental entities to prevent the planned
    acquisition for antitrust or competition reasons, we will,
    concurrently with such termination, be required to pay Hitachi a
    fee of $250 million in cash.

On March 7, 2011, in connection with the planned
    acquisition of HGST, WD, Western Digital Technologies, Inc.
    (“WDTI”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, and WDI entered
    into a commitment letter with Bank of America, N.A. and Merrill
    Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated regarding a
    new credit facility for an amount of $2.5 billion,
    consisting of a $500 million revolving credit facility and
    $2.0 billion in term loans, to be entered into in
    connection with the closing of the planned acquisition (the
    “Senior Facility”). Since entering into the commitment
    letter, Bank of America N.A. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
    Fenner & Smith Incorporated led the effort to
    syndicate the Senior Facility for an amount of up to
    $3.0 billion, consisting of a $500 million revolving
    credit facility and up to $2.5 billion in term loans. As a
    result of such effort, WD, WDTI and WDI have fully negotiated
    definitive loan documents for the Senior Facility with the
    syndicate members and, subject to customary closing conditions
    including completion of the acquisition in accordance with the
    terms, WD, WDTI and WDI fully expect all of these syndicate
    members to be part of the final lender group. We are required to
    pay a commitment fee at the rate of 0.35%, per annum, of the
    aggregate unfunded amount committed to be borrowed under the
    Senior Facility.

The planned acquisition of HGST is subject to several closing
    conditions, including the receipt of antitrust approvals or the
    expiration of applicable waiting periods in certain
    jurisdictions. We have received requests for additional
    information and are engaged in more in-depth reviews of the
    pending acquisition initiated by regulatory authorities in the
    United States, the European Union, the People’s Republic of
    China, Japan and Korea. We are cooperating fully with each of
    the regulatory authorities reviewing the proposed transaction.
    Subject to obtaining the required regulatory approvals or
    expiration of applicable waiting periods, we expect the
    transaction to close in our second quarter of fiscal 2012.

Results
    of Operations

Fiscal
    2011 Overview

In 2011, our net revenue decreased by 3% to $9.5 billion on
    hard drive shipments of 207 million units as compared to
    $9.8 billion and 194 million units in 2010. In 2011,
    64% of our hard drive net revenue was derived from compute
    markets, including notebook and desktop computers, as compared
    to 67% in 2010. Hard drive ASP decreased to $45 in 2011 from $50
    in 2010. Gross margin percentage decreased to 18.8% in 2011 from
    24.4% in 2010. In 2011, operating income decreased from
    $1.5 billion to $781 million, which included a
    $25 million accrual for litigation contingencies and
    $17 million of expenses related to the planned acquisition
    of HGST. As a percentage of net revenue, operating income was
    8.2% in 2011 compared to 15.5% in 2010. Net income in 2011 was
    $726 million, or $3.09 per diluted share, compared to
    $1.4 billion, or $5.93 per diluted share, in 2010.

For the September quarter, we expect our revenue to increase
    slightly from the June quarter primarily as a result of
    seasonality.

In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in

    results for the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya
    Corporation and Hoya Magnetics Singapore Pte. Ltd. (together,
    “Hoya”) and SiliconSystems Inc.
    (“SiliconSystems”), which were acquired on
    June 30, 2010 and March 27, 2009, respectively, are
    included in our operating results only after the dates of their
    acquisitions.

Fiscal
    Year 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year 2010

Net Revenue.

Net revenue was $9.5 billion
    for 2011, a decrease of 3% from 2010. Total hard drive shipments
    increased to 207 million units as compared to
    194 million units for the prior year. The decrease in net
    revenue resulted primarily from a $5 decrease in ASP from $50 to
    $45, partially offset by the increase in unit shipments.



Changes in revenue by geography and channel generally reflect
    normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics.

In accordance with standard industry practice, we have sales
    incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with
    price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are
    recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. For 2011 and 2009,
    these programs represented 11% of gross revenues compared to 8%
    in 2010. These amounts generally vary according to several
    factors including industry conditions, seasonal demand,
    competitor actions, channel mix and overall availability of
    product.

Gross Margin.

Gross margin for 2011 was
    $1.8 billion, a decrease of $610 million, or 25% from
    the prior year. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue
    decreased to 18.8% in 2011 from 24.4% in 2010. This decrease was
    primarily due to an aggressive pricing environment, resulting in
    a lower ASP.

Operating Expenses.

Total research and
    development (“R&D”) expense and selling, general
    and administrative (“SG&A”) expense increased to
    10.6% of net revenue in 2011 compared to 8.9% in 2010. R&D
    expense was $703 million in 2011, an increase of
    $92 million, or 15% over the prior year. As a percentage of
    net revenue, R&D expense increased to 7.4% in 2011 compared
    to 6.2% in 2010. This increase in R&D expense was primarily
    due to the continued investment in product development to
    support new programs. SG&A expense was $307 million in
    2011, an increase of $42 million, or 16%, as compared to
    2010. SG&A expense as a percentage of net revenue increased
    to 3.2% in 2011 compared to 2.7% in 2010. This increase in
    SG&A expense was primarily due to the expansion of sales
    and marketing to support new products and growing markets as
    well as $17 million of expenses related to the planned
    acquisition of HGST.

Other Income (Expense).

Other expense, net was
    $1 million in 2011 compared to $5 million in 2010.
    This decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest
    income of $5 million due to higher average daily invested
    cash balances and a $1 million decrease in our term loan
    interest expense due to a lower principal balance, partially
    offset by

acquisition-related

debt commitment fees of $2 million.

Income Tax Provision.

Income tax expense was
    $54 million in 2011 as compared to $138 million in
    2010. Tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 7%
    in 2011 compared to 9% for 2010. Income tax expense for 2011
    reflects the extension of the R&D tax credit that was
    signed into law in December 2010. The differences between the
    effective tax rate and the U.S. Federal statutory rate are
    primarily due to tax holidays in Malaysia, Singapore and
    Thailand that expire at various dates through 2023 and the
    current year generation of income tax credits.

We recognized a net increase of $15 million in our
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2011. As of
    July 1, 2011, we had a recorded liability for unrecognized
    tax benefits of approximately $245 million. Interest and
    penalties recognized on such amounts were not material.

The United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is
    currently examining our fiscal years 2006 and 2007 and calendar
    years 2005 and 2006 for Komag, Incorporated (“Komag”),
    which was acquired by us on September 5, 2007. The IRS has
    completed its field work and proposed certain adjustments.
    Certain issues have been agreed upon by us and the IRS and
    certain issues remain unresolved. We have received Revenue Agent
    Reports (“RARs”) for the agreed issues. We have also
    received RARs from the IRS for the unresolved issues that seek
    adjustments to our income before income taxes of approximately
    $970 million and $380 million for Komag. The issues in
    dispute relate primarily to transfer pricing and certain other
    intercompany transactions. We disagree with the proposed
    adjustments. In May 2011, we filed a protest with the IRS
    Appeals Office regarding the proposed adjustments for Western
    Digital. We are continuing discussions with the IRS to resolve
    the Komag issues.

We believe that adequate provision has been made for any
    adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the
    outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any
    issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not
    consistent with management’s expectations, we could be
    required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period
    such resolution occurs. As of July 1, 2011, it is not
    possible to estimate the amount of change, if any, in the
    unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible within the
    next twelve months.

Fiscal
    Year 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year 2009

Net Revenue.

Net revenue was $9.8 billion
    for 2010, an increase of 32% from 2009. Total hard drive
    shipments increased to 194 million units as compared to
    146 million units for the prior year. The increase in net
    revenue resulted



primarily from an increase in unit shipments due to the strong
    demand for hard drives, particularly in the mobile PC market. We
    shipped 80 million mobile drives in 2010 as compared to
    55 million units in 2009. The increase in mobile unit
    shipments was driven by continued strength in notebook and
    netbook PC demand, coupled with increased customer preference
    for our product offerings.

Changes in revenue by geography generally reflect normal
    fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics, as well
    as demand strength in Asia, which continues to be driven by the
    concentration of global manufacturing in that region. Changes in
    revenue by channel are a result of normal fluctuations in market
    demand and competitive dynamics.

In accordance with standard industry practice, we have sales
    incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with
    price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are
    recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. For 2010, these
    programs represented 8% of gross revenues compared to 11% in
    2009 and 10% in 2008, respectively. These amounts generally vary
    according to several factors including industry conditions,
    seasonal demand, competitor actions, channel mix and overall
    availability of product.

Gross Margin.

Gross margin for 2010 was
    $2.4 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 80% over
    the prior year. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue
    increased to 24.4% in 2010 from 17.9% in 2009. This increase was
    primarily due to higher volume, lower costs, a favorable product
    mix and a moderate pricing environment.

Operating Expenses.

Total R&D expense and
    SG&A expense decreased to 8.9% of net revenue in 2010
    compared to 9.5% in 2009. R&D expense was $611 million
    in 2010, an increase of $102 million, or 20% over the prior
    year. This increase in R&D expense was primarily due to a
    $68 million increase relating to product development to
    support new programs and a $34 million increase in variable
    incentive compensation. As a percentage of net revenue, R&D
    expense decreased to 6.2% in 2010 compared to 6.8% in 2009
    primarily due to an increase in net revenue in 2010 compared to
    2009. SG&A expense was $265 million in 2010, an
    increase of $64 million, or 32%, as compared to 2009. This
    increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to
    $27 million of expense related to litigation settlements, a
    $19 million increase in variable incentive compensation and
    an $18 million increase in the expansion of our sales and
    marketing presence into new regions. SG&A expense as a
    percentage of net revenue remained consistent at 2.7% in 2010
    and 2009.

During 2009, we recorded a $14 million in-process research
    and development charge related to the acquisition of
    SiliconSystems. This charge relates to projects that were not
    ready for commercial production and had no alternative future
    use and, therefore, the fair value of the development effort did
    not qualify for capitalization and was immediately expensed.
    During 2009, we also recorded $112 million in restructuring
    charges and an $18 million gain on the sale of our
    substrate manufacturing facility, and related assets, in
    Sarawak, Malaysia.

Other Income (Expense).

    $5 million in 2010 compared to $18 million in 2009.
    This decrease was primarily due to no impairment charges related
    to our auction-rate securities in 2010, compared to
    $10 million in

other-than-temporary

losses in 2009, as well as decreases in the variable interest
    rate on a lower amount of debt.

Income Tax Provision.

Income tax expense was
    $138 million in 2010 as compared to $31 million in
    2009. Tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 9%
    in 2010 compared to 6% for 2009. In 2009, income tax expense
    included a provision of $42 million offset by
    $6 million in tax benefits related to the extension of the
    U.S. Federal research and development tax credit enacted
    into law in October 2008, and a favorable adjustment of
    $5 million to previously recorded tax accruals and credits.
    Differences between the effective tax rate and the
    U.S. Federal statutory rate were primarily due to tax
    holidays in Malaysia and Thailand that expire at various dates
    through 2022 and the current year generation of income tax
    credits.

We recognized a net $94 million increase in the liability
    for unrecognized tax benefits during 2010. As of July 2,
    2010, we had approximately $230 million of unrecognized tax
    benefits which, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax
    rate in subsequent years.



Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

We ended 2011 with total cash and cash equivalents of
    $3.5 billion, an increase of $756 million from
    July 2, 2010. The following table summarizes our statements
    of cash flows for the three years ended July 1, 2011 (in
    millions):

Our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to
    preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing return through
    the full investment of available funds. We believe our current
    cash, cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will
    be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital
    expenditure needs through the foreseeable future. Our ability to
    sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of
    risks that we discuss in Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities during 2011 was
    $1.7 billion as compared to $1.9 billion for 2010 and
    $1.3 billion for 2009. Cash flow from operating activities
    consists of net income, adjusted for non-cash charges, plus or
    minus working capital changes. This represents our principal
    source of cash. Net cash provided by working capital changes was
    $238 million for 2011 as compared to net cash used to fund
    working capital of $37 million for 2010 and net cash
    provided by working capital changes of $198 million for
    2009.

Our working capital requirements primarily depend on the
    effective management of our cash conversion cycle, which
    measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash
    through sales. The average quarterly cash conversion cycles for
    the three years ended 2011 were as follows:

For 2011, our average days sales outstanding (“DSOs”)
    increased by one day, days in inventory (“DIOs”)
    increased by four days, and days payables outstanding
    (“DPOs”) increased by three days. Changes in average
    DSOs and DIOs are generally related to linearity of shipments
    and the timing of inventory builds, respectively. Changes in
    DPOs are generally related to production volume and the timing
    of purchases during the period. From time to time, we modify the
    timing of payments to our vendors. We make modifications
    primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our
    cash flows, including our cash balances. Generally, we make the
    payment modifications through negotiations with our vendors or
    by granting to, or receiving from, our vendors’ payment
    term accommodations.

Investing
    Activities

Net cash used in investing activities for 2011 was
    $793 million as compared to $986 million for 2010 and
    $551 million for 2009. During 2011, cash used in investing
    activities consisted of capital expenditures of
    $778 million and $15 million for equipment related to
    the acquisition of a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility.
    During 2010, cash used in investing activities consisted
    primarily of $737 million for capital expenditures,
    $233 million used for the acquisition of the magnetic media
    sputtering operations of Hoya and $20 million used for the
    acquisition of the land and



building associated with the acquisition of a semiconductor
    wafer fabrication facility, offset by $3 million of sales
    related to our auction-rate securities. During 2009, cash used
    in investing activities consisted primarily of $519 million
    for capital expenditures and $63 million for the
    acquisition of SiliconSystems, net of cash acquired, partially
    offset by $29 million in proceeds from the sale of property
    and equipment. Capital expenditures in 2011 primarily consisted
    of the expansion of our head wafer fabrication facilities,
    continued investment in advanced head technologies and increased
    capacity for our broadening and growing product portfolio.

For fiscal 2012, we expect capital expenditures will be at the
    upper end of our business model range of between 7 and
    8 percent of revenue as we continue the conversion of our
    head wafer fabrication facilities to utilize

8-inch

wafers from

6-inch

wafers. We expect depreciation and amortization to be
    approximately $650 million for fiscal 2012.

Our cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid money market
    funds that are invested in U.S. Treasury securities,
    U.S. Treasury bills and U.S. Government agency
    securities. We also have $15 million of auction-rate securities,
    which are classified as available-for-sale securities.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash used in financing activities for 2011 was
    $106 million as compared to $16 million for 2010 and
    $64 million for 2009. Net cash used in financing activities
    for 2011 consisted of $106 million used to repay long-term
    debt and $50 million used to repurchase shares of our
    common stock, offset by a net $50 million related to
    employee stock plans. Net cash used in financing activities for
    2010 consisted of $82 million used to repay long-term debt,
    partially offset by a net $66 million provided by employee
    stock plans. Net cash used in financing activities for 2009
    consisted of $36 million used to repurchase shares of our
    common stock, $27 million used to repay long-term debt and
    a net $1 million used by employee stock plans.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Other than facility lease commitments incurred in the normal
    course of business and certain indemnification provisions (see
    “Contractual Obligations and Commitments” below), we
    do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or
    liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent
    interests in transferred assets, or any obligation arising out
    of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. We
    do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not
    included in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally,
    we do not have an interest in, or relationships with, any
    special-purpose entities.

Long-Term
    Debt

In February 2008, WDTI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
    Company, entered into a five-year credit agreement that provided
    for a $500 million term loan facility. As of July 1,
    2011, the remaining balance of the term loan facility was
    $294 million, which requires principal payments totaling
    $144 million in 2012 and $150 million in 2013. See
    Part II, Item 8, Note 3 in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.



On March 7, 2011, in connection with the planned
    acquisition of HGST, WD, WDTI and WDI entered into a commitment
    letter for the Senior Facility. Since entering into the
    commitment letter, Bank of America N.A. and Merrill Lynch,
    Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated led the effort to
    syndicate the Senior Facility for an amount of up to
    $3.0 billion, consisting of a $500 million revolving
    credit facility and up to $2.5 billion in term loans. As a
    result of such effort, WD, WDTI and WDI have fully negotiated
    definitive loan documents for the Senior Facility with the
    syndicate members and, subject to customary closing conditions,
    including completion of the acquisition in accordance with the
    terms, WD, WDTI and WDI fully expect all of these syndicate
    members to be part of the final lender group. We are required to
    pay a commitment fee at the rate of 0.35%, per annum, of the
    aggregate unfunded amount committed to be borrowed under the
    Senior Facility.

Purchase
    Orders

In the normal course of business, we enter into purchase orders
    with suppliers for the purchase of hard drive components used to
    manufacture our products. These purchase orders generally cover
    forecasted component supplies needed for production during the
    next quarter, are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the
    components, and generally may be changed or canceled at any time
    prior to shipment of the components. We also enter into purchase
    orders with suppliers for capital equipment that are recorded as
    a liability upon receipt of the equipment. Our ability to change
    or cancel a capital equipment purchase order without penalty
    depends on the nature of the equipment being ordered. In some
    cases, we may be obligated to pay for certain costs related to
    changes to, or cancellation of, a purchase order, such as costs
    incurred for raw materials or work in process of components or
    capital equipment.

We have entered into long-term purchase agreements with various
    component suppliers, which contain minimum quantity
    requirements. However, the dollar amount of the purchases may
    depend on the specific products ordered, achievement of
    pre-defined quantity or quality specifications or future price
    negotiations. The estimated related minimum purchase
    requirements are included in “Purchase obligations” in
    the table above. We have also entered into long-term purchase
    agreements with various component suppliers that carry fixed
    volumes and pricing which obligate us to make certain future
    purchases, contingent on certain conditions of performance,
    quality and technology of the vendor’s components. These
    arrangements are included under “Purchase obligations”
    in the table above.

We enter into, from time to time, other long-term purchase
    agreements for components with certain vendors. Generally,
    future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and
    determinable as they depend on our overall unit volume
    requirements and are contingent upon the prices, technology and
    quality of the supplier’s products remaining competitive.
    These arrangements are not included under “Purchase
    obligations” in the table above. Please see Item 1A of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for a discussion of risks related to these commitments.

Foreign
    Exchange Contracts

We purchase short-term, foreign exchange contracts to hedge the
    impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying
    assets, revenue, liabilities and commitments for operating
    expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies.
    See Part II, Item 7A, under the heading
    “Disclosure About Foreign Currency Risk,” for a
    description of our current foreign exchange contract commitments
    and Part II, Item 8, Notes 1 and 11 in the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, we may provide
    indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers,
    vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with
    respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to,
    losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, products or
    services to be provided by us, or from intellectual property
    infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have
    entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and
    certain of our officers that will require us, among other
    things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may
    arise by reason of their status or service as directors or
    officers. We maintain director and officer insurance, which may
    cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to
    indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances.

It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount
    under these indemnification agreements due to the limited
    history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and
    circumstances involved in each particular



agreement. Such indemnification agreements may not be subject to
    maximum loss clauses. Historically, we have not incurred
    material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements.

Unrecognized
    Tax Benefits

As of July 1, 2011, the cash portion of our total recorded
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $147 million.
    We estimate the timing of the future payments of these
    liabilities to be within the next one to five years. See
    Part II, Item 8, Note 9 in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K

for information regarding our total tax liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits.

Stock
    Repurchase Program

Our Board of Directors previously authorized us to repurchase
    $750 million of our common stock in open market
    transactions under a stock repurchase program through
    March 31, 2013. Since the inception of this program in
    2005, through July 1, 2011, we have repurchased
    20 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of
    $334 million. We repurchased 1.8 million shares for a
    total cost of $50 million during 2011. We may continue to
    repurchase our stock as we deem appropriate and market
    conditions allow. We expect stock repurchases to be funded
    principally by operating cash flows.

Planned
    Acquisition Termination Fee

If the planned acquisition of HGST has not closed by
    March 7, 2012 due to the failure to receive any required
    antitrust or competition authority’s consent, approval or
    clearance or any action by any certain governmental entities to
    prevent the planned acquisition for antitrust or competition
    reasons, we will, concurrently with such termination, be
    required to pay Hitachi a fee of $250 million in cash.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of
    the financial statements requires the use of judgments and
    estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues,
    expenses, assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity. We
    have adopted accounting policies and practices that are
    generally accepted in the industry in which we operate. We
    believe the following are our most critical accounting policies
    that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates
    made by us. If these estimates differ significantly from actual
    results, the impact to the consolidated financial statements may
    be material.

Revenue
    and Accounts Receivable

In accordance with standard industry practice, we provide
    distributors and retailers (collectively referred to as
    “resellers”) with limited price protection for
    inventories held by resellers at the time of published list
    price reductions, and we provide resellers and OEMs with other
    sales incentive programs. At the time we recognize revenue to
    resellers and OEMs, we record a reduction of revenue for
    estimated price protection until the resellers sell such
    inventory to their customers and we also record a reduction of
    revenue for the other programs in effect. We base these
    adjustments on several factors including anticipated price
    decreases during the reseller holding period, resellers’
    sell-through and inventory levels, estimated amounts to be
    reimbursed to qualifying customers, historical pricing
    information and customer claim processing. If customer demand
    for hard drives or market conditions differs from our
    expectations, our operating results could be materially
    affected. We also have programs under which we reimburse
    qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing
    expenditures, which are recorded as a reduction of revenue.
    These amounts generally vary according to several factors
    including industry conditions, seasonal demand, competitor
    actions, channel mix and overall availability of product. Since
    2009, total sales incentive and marketing programs have ranged
    from 7% to 12% of gross revenues per quarter. Changes in future
    customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust
    our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue from the
    current range. Adjustments to revenues due to changes in
    accruals for these programs related to revenues reported in
    prior periods have averaged 0.3% of quarterly gross revenue
    since the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Customer sales incentive
    and marketing programs are recorded as a reduction of revenue.

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing
    specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based
    on insolvency, disputes or other collection issues. In addition,
    we routinely analyze the different receivable aging



categories and establish reserves based on a combination of past
    due receivables and expected future losses based primarily on
    our historical levels of bad debt losses. If the financial
    condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in
    its inability to pay its accounts when due, or if our overall
    loss history changes significantly, an adjustment in our
    allowance for doubtful accounts would be required, which could
    materially affect operating results.

We establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for
    sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is
    recognized. We base these provisions on existing product return
    notifications. If actual sales returns exceed expectations, an
    increase in the sales return accrual would be required, which
    could materially affect operating results.

Warranty

We record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue
    is recognized. We generally warrant our products for a period of
    one to five years. Our warranty provision considers estimated
    product failure rates and trends, estimated repair or
    replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory
    claims related to product quality issues, if any. We use a
    statistical warranty tracking model to help prepare our
    estimates and assist us in exercising judgment in determining
    the underlying estimates. Our statistical tracking model
    captures specific detail on hard drive reliability, such as
    factory test data, historical field return rates, and costs to
    repair by product type. Our judgment is subject to a greater
    degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products
    because of limited field experience with those products upon
    which to base our warranty estimates. We review our warranty
    accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and
    which are still under warranty. Any changes in the estimates
    underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact
    current period gross margin and income. Such changes are
    generally a result of differences between forecasted and actual
    return rate experience and costs to repair. If actual product
    return trends, costs to repair returned products or costs of
    customer compensatory claims differ significantly from our
    estimates, our future results of operations could be materially
    affected. For a summary of historical changes in estimates
    related to pre-existing warranty provisions, refer to
    Part II, Item 8, Note 4 in the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

Inventory

We value inventories at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out and weighted average methods) or net realizable value.
    We use the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method to value the cost of the
    majority of our inventories, while we use the weighted-average
    method to value precious metal inventories. Weighted-average
    cost is calculated based upon the cost of precious metals at the
    time they are received by us. We have determined that it is not
    practicable to assign specific costs to individual units of
    precious metals and, as such, we relieve our precious metals
    inventory based on the weighted-average cost of the inventory at
    the time the inventory is used in production. The weighted
    average method of valuing precious metals does not materially
    differ from a FIFO method. We record inventory write-downs for
    the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net
    realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of
    future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory
    balances.

We evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and
    obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand,
    inventory on hand, sales levels and other information, and
    reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and
    obsolete inventory based on this analysis. Unanticipated changes
    in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in
    demand for one or more of our products, which may require a
    write down of inventory that could materially affect operating
    results.

Litigation
    and Other Contingencies

When we become aware of a claim or potential claim, we assess
    the likelihood of any loss or exposure. We disclose information
    regarding each material claim where the likelihood of a loss
    contingency is probable or reasonably possible. If a loss
    contingency is probable and the amount of the loss can be
    reasonably estimated, we record an accrual for the loss. In such
    cases, there may be an exposure to potential loss in excess of
    the amount accrued. Where a loss is not probable but is
    reasonably possible, and where a loss in excess of the amount
    accrued is reasonably possible, we disclose an estimate of the
    amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim if
    a reasonable estimate can be made, unless the amount of such
    reasonably possible losses is not material to our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows. The ability to
    predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments,
    estimates and inherent uncertainties. The actual



outcome of such matters could differ materially from
    management’s estimates. Refer to Part II, Item 8,
    Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Income
    Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability
    method, which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities
    be recognized for temporary differences between the financial
    reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities
    and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax
    credit carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance when it is
    more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be
    realized. Each period we evaluate the need for a valuation
    allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the
    valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets
    only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not
    that these deferred tax assets will be realized.

We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a
    two-step process. To the extent a tax position does not meet a
    more-likely-than-not level of certainty, no benefit is
    recognized in the financial statements. If a position meets the
    more-likely-than-not level of certainty, it is recognized in the
    financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater
    than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
    Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are
    recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions
    and are recorded in our provision for income taxes. The actual
    liability for unrealized tax benefits in any such contingency
    may be materially different from our estimates, which could
    result in the need to record additional liabilities for
    unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust
    previously-recorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits and
    materially affect our operating results.

Stock-based
    Compensation

We account for all stock-based compensation at fair value.
    Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date
    based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense
    over the vesting period. The fair values of all stock options
    granted are estimated using a binomial model, and the fair
    values of all Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)
    purchase rights are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton
    option-pricing model. Both the binomial and the
    Black-Scholes-Merton models require the input of highly
    subjective assumptions. We are required to use judgment in
    estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to
    be forfeited. If actual forfeitures differ significantly from
    the original estimate, stock-based compensation expense and our
    results of operations could be materially affected.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

For a description of recently issued and adopted accounting
    pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption and
    expected effects on our results of operations and financial
    condition, refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 1 of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this
    Annual Report on

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Disclosure
    About Foreign Currency Risk

Although the majority of our transactions are in
    U.S. dollars, some transactions are based in various
    foreign currencies. We purchase short-term, foreign exchange
    contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange
    fluctuations on certain underlying assets, revenue, liabilities
    and commitments for operating expenses and product costs
    denominated in foreign currencies. The purpose of entering into
    these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign
    currency fluctuations on our results of operations. The contract
    maturity dates do not exceed 12 months. We do not purchase
    foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes. Currently, we
    focus on hedging our foreign currency risk related to the Thai
    Baht, Malaysian Ringgit, Euro and British Pound Sterling. Thai
    Baht contracts are designated as either cash flow or fair value
    hedges. Malaysian Ringgit contracts are designated as cash flow
    hedges. Euro and British Pound Sterling contracts are designated
    as fair value hedges. See Part II, Item 8,
    Notes 1 and 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



As of July 1, 2011, we had outstanding the following

    equal to, at the option of WDTI, either (a) a LIBOR rate
    determined by reference to the cost of funds for Eurodollar
    deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing,
    adjusted for certain additional costs (the “Eurocurrency
    Rate”) or (b) a base rate determined by reference to
    the higher of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and
    (ii) the prime rate as announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank,
    N.A. (the “Base Rate”); in each case plus an
    applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under
    the term loan facility ranges from 1.25% to 1.50% with respect
    to borrowings at the Eurocurrency Rate and 0.0% to 0.125% with
    respect to borrowings at the Base Rate. The applicable margins
    for borrowings under the term loan facility are determined based
    upon a leverage ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries
    calculated on a consolidated basis. If the federal funds rate,
    prime rate or LIBOR rate increase, our interest payments could
    also increase. A one percent increase in the variable rate of
    interest on the term loan facility would increase interest
    expense by approximately $3 million annually.

REPORT
    OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Western Digital Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries as of July 1,
    2011 and July 2, 2010, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, shareholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended July 1, 2011. In connection
    with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we
    have also audited the related financial statement schedule.
    These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    July 1, 2011 and July 2, 2010, and the results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended July 1, 2011, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
    in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Western Digital Corporation’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of July 1, 2011, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report
    dated August 11, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

REPORT
    OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Western Digital Corporation:

We have audited Western Digital Corporation’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of July 1, 2011, based
    on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Western Digital Corporation maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of July 1, 2011, based on criteria established
    in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Western Digital Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of July 1, 2011 and July 2, 2010, the
    related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’
    equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended July 1, 2011, and the
    related financial statement schedule, and our report dated
    August 11, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule.

WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.  Organization
    and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Western Digital Corporation (the “Company” or
    “Western Digital” or “WD”) is a global
    provider of solutions for the collection, storage, management,
    protection and use of digital content, including audio and
    video. The Company’s principal products are hard drives,
    which are devices that use one or more rotating magnetic disks
    (“magnetic media”) to store and allow fast access to
    data. Hard drives are currently the primary storage medium for
    digital content. The Company’s hard drives are used in
    desktop and notebook computers, corporate and cloud computing
    data centers, home entertainment equipment and stand-alone
    consumer storage devices. In addition to hard drives, the
    Company’s other products include solid-state drives and
    home entertainment and networking products.

The Company has prepared its consolidated financial statements
    in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and has adopted
    accounting policies and practices which are generally accepted
    in the industry in which it operates. The Company’s
    significant accounting policies are summarized below.

Fiscal
    Year

The Company has a 52 or 53-week fiscal year. The 2011 fiscal
    year which ended on July 1, 2011 consisted of
    52 weeks. The 2010 and 2009 fiscal years, which ended on
    July 2, 2010 and July 3, 2009, respectively, consisted
    of 52 and 53 weeks each, respectively.

Basis of
    Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
    intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
    consolidation. The accounts of foreign subsidiaries have been
    remeasured using the U.S. dollar as the functional
    currency. As such, gains or losses resulting from remeasurement
    of these accounts from local currencies into U.S. dollars
    are reflected in the results of operations. These gains and
    losses were immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.

On June 30, 2010, the Company acquired the magnetic media
    sputtering operations of Hoya Corporation and Hoya Magnetics
    Singapore Pte. Ltd (together, “Hoya”). On
    March 27, 2009, the Company acquired SiliconSystems, Inc.
    (“SiliconSystems”). The acquisitions are further
    described in Note 14. The results of operations of Hoya and
    SiliconSystems since the dates of their acquisitions are
    included in the consolidated financial statements.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

The Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid
    investments in money market funds, which are invested in
    U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Treasury bills and
    U.S. Government agency securities with original maturities
    when purchased of three months or less.

Investments

The Company’s investments consist of auction-rate
    securities, which are primarily backed by insurance products
    with original maturities greater than three months. The Company
    has classified these investments as

available-for-sale

securities and they are carried at fair value within other
    non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
    investments, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate
    fair value for all periods presented because of the short-term
    maturity of these assets and liabilities or, in the case of
    investments, these are recorded using appropriate market
    information. The carrying amount of debt approximates fair value
    because of its variable interest rate.



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company sells its products to computer manufacturers,
    resellers and retailers throughout the world. The Company
    performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’
    financial condition and generally requires no collateral. The
    Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses, and
    such losses have historically been within management’s
    expectations. At any given point in time, the total amount
    outstanding from any one of a number of its customers may be
    individually significant to the Company’s financial
    results. At July 1, 2011 and July 2, 2010, the Company
    had reserves for potential credit losses of $5 million and
    $6 million, respectively, and net accounts receivable of
    $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.

The Company also has cash equivalent and investment policies
    that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial
    institution or investment instrument and requires that
    investments be made only with financial institutions or in
    investment instruments evaluated as highly credit-worthy.

Inventory

The Company values inventories at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first out and weighted average methods) or net realizable value.
    The

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method is used to value the cost of
    the majority of the Company’s inventories, while the
    weighted-average method is used to value precious metal
    inventories. Weighted-average cost is calculated based upon the
    cost of precious metals at the time they are received by the
    Company. The Company has determined that it is not practicable
    to assign specific costs to individual units of precious metals
    and, as such, precious metals are relieved from inventory based
    on the weighted-average cost of the inventory at the time the
    inventory is used in production. The weighted average method of
    valuing precious metals does not materially differ from a FIFO
    method. As of July 1, 2011 and July 2, 2010, 85% and
    82% of the inventory was valued using the FIFO method with the
    remainder valued using the weighted average method. Inventory
    write-downs are recorded for the valuation of inventory at the
    lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market
    conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to
    inventory costs and inventory balances.

The Company evaluates inventory balances for excess quantities
    and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated
    demand, inventory on hand, sales levels and other information,
    and reduces inventory balances to net realizable value for
    excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis.
    Unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could
    result in a decrease in demand for one or more of the
    Company’s products, which may require a write down of
    inventory that could materially affect operating results.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

The cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over
    the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The
    Company’s buildings are depreciated over periods ranging
    from fifteen to thirty years. The majority of the Company’s
    equipment is depreciated over periods of three to seven years.
    Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis. Leasehold
    improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated
    useful lives of the assets or the related lease terms.

Goodwill
    and Other Long-Lived Assets

The total purchase price in a business combination is allocated
    to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    based on their fair values at the acquisition date, with amounts
    exceeding the fair values being recorded as goodwill. Goodwill
    is not amortized. Instead, it is tested for impairment on an
    annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The
    Company did not record any impairment of goodwill during 2011,
    2010 or 2009.

Other intangible assets consist primarily of technology acquired
    in business combinations. Acquired intangibles are amortized on
    a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful
    lives. Long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying
    amounts may not be recoverable.



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company did not record any impairments to long-lived assets
    during 2011 or 2010. The Company recorded impairments to certain
    long-lived assets during 2009. See Note 13.

Revenue
    and Accounts Receivable

Revenue is recognized when the title and risk of loss have
    passed to the customer, there is persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement, delivery has occurred, or services have been
    rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
    collectability is reasonably assured. The Company establishes
    provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated
    sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is
    recognized based on existing product return notifications. If
    actual sales returns exceed expectations, an increase in the
    sales return accrual would be required, which could materially
    affect operating results.

In accordance with standard industry practice, the Company
    provides distributors and retailers (collectively referred to as
    “resellers”) with limited price protection for
    inventories held by resellers at the time of published list
    price reductions, and the Company provides resellers and OEMs
    with other sales incentive programs. At the time the Company
    recognizes revenue to resellers and OEMs, a reduction of revenue
    is recorded for estimated price protection until the resellers
    sell such inventory to their customers and the Company also
    records a reduction of revenue for the other programs in effect.
    The Company bases these adjustments on several factors including
    anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period,
    reseller’s sell-through and inventory levels, estimated
    amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers, historical
    pricing information and customer claim processing. If customer
    demand for hard drives or market conditions differ from the
    Company’s expectations, the Company’s operating
    results could be materially affected. The Company also has
    programs under which it reimburses qualified distributors and
    retailers for certain marketing expenditures, which are recorded
    as a reduction of revenue. Sales incentive and marketing
    programs are recorded as a reduction of revenue.

The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts by
    analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of
    loss based on insolvency, disputes or other collection issues.
    In addition, the Company routinely analyzes the different
    receivable aging categories and establishes reserves based on a
    combination of past due receivables and expected future losses
    based primarily on its historical levels of bad debt losses. If
    the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates
    resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due, or if
    the Company’s overall loss history changes significantly,
    an adjustment in the Company’s allowance for doubtful
    accounts would be required, which could materially affect
    operating results.

The Company establishes provisions against revenue and cost of
    revenue for sales returns in the same period that the related
    revenue is recognized. These provisions are based on existing
    product return notifications. If actual sales returns exceed
    expectations, an increase in the sales return accrual would be
    required, which could materially affect operating results.

Warranty

The Company records an accrual for estimated warranty costs when
    revenue is recognized. The Company generally warrants its
    products for a period of one to five years. The warranty
    provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends,
    estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for
    customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues,
    if any. A statistical warranty tracking model is used to help
    prepare estimates and assist the Company in exercising judgment
    in determining the underlying estimates. The statistical
    tracking model captures specific detail on hard drive
    reliability, such as factory test data, historical field return
    rates, and costs to repair by product type. Management’s
    judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with
    respect to newly introduced products because of limited field
    experience with those products upon which to base warranty
    estimates. Management reviews the warranty accrual quarterly for
    products shipped in prior periods and which are still under
    warranty. Any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual
    may result in adjustments that impact current period gross
    margin and income. Such changes are generally a result of
    differences between forecasted and actual return rate experience
    and costs to repair. If

actual product return trends, costs to repair returned products
    or costs of customer compensatory claims differ significantly
    from estimates, future results of operations could be materially
    affected.

Litigation
    and Other Contingencies

When the Company becomes aware of a claim or potential claim,
    the Company assesses the likelihood of any loss or exposure. The
    Company discloses information regarding each material claim
    where the likelihood of a loss contingency is probable or
    reasonably possible. If a loss contingency is probable and the
    amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company
    records an accrual for the loss. In such cases, there may be an
    exposure to potential loss in excess of the amount accrued.
    Where a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible and
    where a loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably
    possible, the Company discloses an estimate of the amount of the
    loss or range of possible losses for the claim if a reasonable
    estimate can be made, unless the amount of such reasonably
    possible losses is not material to the Company’s financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows. The ability to
    predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments,
    estimates and inherent uncertainties. The actual outcome of such
    matters could differ materially from management’s
    estimates. See Note 5.

Advertising
    Expense

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Selling, general and
    administrative expenses of the Company included advertising
    costs of $11 million, $7 million, and $5 million
    in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Income
    Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and
    liability method, which provides that deferred tax assets and
    liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the
    financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and
    liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating
    loss (“NOL”) and tax credit carryforwards. The Company
    records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not
    that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Each period,
    the Company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance for its
    deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowance so that
    the Company records net deferred tax assets only to the extent
    that it has concluded it is more likely than not that these
    deferred tax assets will be realized.

The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions
    based on a two-step process. To the extent a tax position does
    not meet a more-likely-than-not level of certainty, no benefit
    is recognized in the financial statements. If a position meets
    the more-likely-than-not level of certainty, it is recognized in
    the financial statements at the largest amount that has a
    greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
    settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
    benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain
    tax positions, as applicable, and are recorded in the provision
    for income taxes. The actual liability for unrealized tax
    benefits may be materially different from the Company’s
    estimates, which could result in the need to record additional
    liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust
    previously-recorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits, and
    may materially affect our operating results.

Income
    per Common Share

The Company computes basic income per common share using net
    income and the weighted average number of common shares
    outstanding during the period. Diluted income per common share
    is computed using net income and the weighted average number of
    common shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding
    during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares include
    certain dilutive outstanding employee stock options, rights to
    purchase shares of common stock under the Company’s
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) and restricted
    stock unit awards.

For purposes of computing diluted income per common share,
    certain potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from
    the calculation because their effect would have been
    anti-dilutive.

Stock-based
    Compensation

The Company accounts for all stock-based compensation at fair
    value. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant
    date based on the value of the award and is recognized as
    expense over the vesting period. The fair values of all stock
    options granted are estimated using a binomial model, and the
    fair values of all ESPP purchase rights are estimated using the
    Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. Both the binomial and
    the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing models require the input
    of highly subjective assumptions. The Company is required to use
    judgment in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are
    expected to be forfeited. If actual forfeitures differ
    significantly from the original estimate, stock-based
    compensation expense and the results of operations could be
    materially affected.

Other
    Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to revenue, expenses,
    gains and losses that are recorded as an element of
    shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net income. The
    Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of
    unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts.

Foreign
    Exchange Contracts

Although the majority of the Company’s transactions are in
    U.S. dollars, some transactions are based in various
    foreign currencies. The Company purchases short-term, foreign
    exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency
    exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets, revenue,
    liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product
    costs denominated in foreign currencies. The purpose of entering
    into these hedging transactions is to minimize the impact of
    foreign currency fluctuations on the Company’s results of
    operations. These contract maturity dates do not exceed
    12 months. All foreign exchange contracts are for risk
    management purposes only. The Company does not purchase foreign
    exchange contracts for trading purposes. The Company had
    outstanding foreign exchange contracts with commercial banks for
    Thai Baht, Malaysian Ringgit, Euro and British Pound Sterling
    with aggregate notional amounts of $1.5 billion and
    $1.1 billion at July 1, 2011 and July 2, 2010,
    respectively. Thai Baht contracts are designated as either cash
    flow or fair value hedges. Malaysian Ringgit contracts are
    designated as cash flow hedges. Euro and British Pound Sterling
    contracts are designated as fair value hedges.



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the
    effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative
    is initially deferred in other comprehensive income (loss), net
    of tax. These amounts are subsequently recognized into earnings
    when the underlying cash flow being hedged is recognized into
    earnings. Recognized gains and losses on foreign exchange
    contracts entered into for manufacturing-related activities are
    reported in cost of revenue. Hedge effectiveness is measured by
    comparing the hedging instrument’s cumulative change in
    fair value from inception to maturity to the underlying
    exposure’s terminal value. The Company determined the
    ineffectiveness associated with its cash flow hedges to be
    immaterial.

A change in the fair value of fair value hedges is recognized in
    earnings in the period incurred and is reported as a component
    of operating expenses. All fair value hedges were determined to
    be effective. The fair value and the changes in fair value on
    these contracts were not material to the consolidated financial
    statements for all years presented. See Notes 10 and 11 for
    additional disclosures related to foreign exchange contracts.

Use of
    Estimates

Company management has made estimates and assumptions relating
    to the reporting of certain assets and liabilities in conformity
    with U.S. GAAP. These estimates and assumptions have been
    applied using methodologies that are consistent throughout the
    periods presented. However, actual results could differ
    materially from these estimates.

Note 5.

Legal
    Proceedings

When the Company becomes aware of a claim or potential claim,
    the Company assesses the likelihood of any loss or exposure. The
    Company discloses information regarding each material claim
    where the likelihood of a loss contingency is probable or
    reasonably possible. If a loss contingency is probable and the
    amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company
    records an accrual for the loss. In such cases, there may be an
    exposure to potential loss in excess of the amount accrued.
    Where a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible and
    where a  loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably
    possible, the Company discloses an estimate of the amount of the
    loss or range of possible losses for the claim if a reasonable
    estimate can be made, unless the amount of such reasonably
    possible losses is not material to the Company’s financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows. For the matters
    described below, the Company has either recorded an accrual for
    losses that are probable and reasonably estimable or has
    determined that, while a loss is reasonably possible, a
    reasonable estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible
    losses with respect to the claim, including the amount of loss
    in excess of the amount accrued, cannot be made. The ability to
    predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments,
    estimates and inherent uncertainties. The actual outcome of such
    matters could differ materially from management’s estimates.

    Plaintiff is seeking injunctive relief and unspecified monetary
    damages, fees and costs. The asserted patents allegedly relate
    to devices used to test hard disk drive heads and media. The
    Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter.

On October 4, 2006, plaintiff Seagate Technology LLC
    (“Seagate”) filed a complaint against the Company and
    one of its employees formerly employed by Seagate in the
    Minnesota Fourth Judicial District Court. The complaint alleges
    claims based on supposed misappropriation of trade secrets and
    seeks injunctive relief and unspecified monetary damages, fees

Employment
    Litigation

On March 20, 2009, plaintiff Ghazala H. Durrani, a former
    employee of the Company, filed a putative class action complaint
    in the Alameda County (California) Superior Court. The complaint
    alleged that certain of the Company’s engineers had been
    misclassified as exempt employees under California state law and
    were, therefore, due unspecified amounts for unpaid hourly
    overtime wages and other amounts, as well as penalties for
    allegedly missed meal and rest periods. By court order dated
    April 24, 2009, the case was transferred to the Orange
    County (California) Superior Court. On or about June 16,
    2009, the Company was dismissed from the case without prejudice
    by stipulation, leaving WDTI as the sole remaining defendant. On
    or about June 4, 2009, WDTI filed its answer to the
    complaint, denying the substantive allegations thereof and
    raising several affirmative defenses. The parties participated
    in a mediation of the case on June 3, 2010, which led to a
    proposed settlement of the case. The proposed settlement, which
    was ultimately approved by the court, resolved the case on a

class-wide

basis for an immaterial amount that was accrued by the Company
    in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The court granted final
    approval of the settlement and entered judgment on
    February 7, 2011. A final accounting hearing took place on
    July 11, 2011, at which the court confirmed that the
    settlement amount was fully paid in accordance with the
    settlement agreement.

On February 26, 2010, and as thereafter amended on
    August 23, 2010 and December 22, 2010, plaintiff Tariq
    Sadaat, a former employee of the Company, filed a putative class
    action complaint in the Orange County (California) Superior
    Court against the Company, WDTI, Kelly Services, Inc., a
    Delaware corporation (“Kelly Services”), and certain
    other unnamed individuals. Plaintiff sought to represent certain
    hourly employees who were assigned to work at certain of the
    Company’s facilities by Kelly Services, a temporary
    staffing agency. In this regard, the complaint alleged that the
    hourly employees were due unspecified sums for unpaid overtime
    wages and other amounts, as well as penalties for allegedly
    missed meal and rest periods. The complaint sought unspecified
    damages including lost wages, penalties under the California
    Labor Code and other statutes, compensatory and punitive
    damages, declaratory relief, injunctive relief, interest,
    attorneys’ fees and costs. The Company’s response to
    the complaint was filed and served in January 2011. The parties
    participated in a mediation of the case, which led to a proposed
    settlement of Sadaat’s individual claims for an immaterial
    amount. The Court approved the proposed settlement on
    July 26, 2011, and dismissed the complaint in its entirety,
    with prejudice as to Sadaat’s individual claims and without
    prejudice as to the alleged class claims.

Other
    Matters

In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to
    other legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. Although the
    ultimate aggregate amount of probable monetary liability or
    financial impact with respect to these other matters is subject
    to many uncertainties and is therefore not predictable with
    assurance, management believes that any monetary liability or
    financial impact to the Company from these other matters,
    individually and in the aggregate, would not be material to the
    Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
    cash flows. However, there can be no assurance with respect to
    such result, and monetary liability or financial impact to the
    Company from these other matters could differ materially from
    those projected.

Note 7.  Western
    Digital Corporation 401(k) Plan

The Company has adopted the Western Digital Corporation 401(k)
    Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan covers substantially all
    domestic employees, subject to certain eligibility requirements.
    The Company makes a basic matching contribution on behalf of
    each participating eligible employee equal to fifty percent
    (50%) of the eligible participant’s pre-tax contributions
    for the contribution cycle not to exceed 5% of the eligible
    participant’s compensation; provided, however, that each
    eligible participant shall receive a minimum annual basic
    matching contribution equal to fifty percent (50%) of the first
    $4,000 of pre-tax contributions for any calendar year. Company
    contributions vest over a

5-year

period of employment. For 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company made
    Plan contributions of $9 million, $9 million, and
    $7 million, respectively.

Note 8.  Shareholders’
    Equity

Stock
    Incentive Plans

The Company maintains four stock-based incentive plans
    (collectively referred to as the “Stock Plans”): the
    amended and restated 2004 Performance Incentive Plan, the
    Employee Stock Option Plan, the Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan
    and the Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors. No new
    awards may be granted under the Employee Stock Option Plan, the
    Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan or the Stock Option Plan for
    Non-Employee Directors (collectively referred to as the
    “Prior Stock Plans”). As of July 1, 2011, options
    to purchase 1.2 million shares of the Company’s common
    stock remained outstanding and exercisable under the Prior Stock
    Plans. Other than for such options, no restricted stock or other
    awards were outstanding under the Prior Stock Plans as of
    July 1, 2011. Options granted under the Prior Stock Plans
    expire either five or ten years from the date of grant.



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The types of awards that may be granted under the 2004
    Performance Incentive Plan include stock options, stock
    appreciation rights, restricted stock units (“RSUs”),
    stock bonuses and other forms of awards granted or denominated
    in the Company’s common stock or units of the
    Company’s common stock, as well as cash bonus awards.
    Persons eligible to receive awards under the 2004 Performance
    Incentive Plan include officers or employees of the Company or
    any of its subsidiaries, directors of the Company and certain
    consultants and advisors to the Company or any of its
    subsidiaries. The vesting of awards under the Performance
    Incentive Plan is determined at the date of grant. Each award
    expires on a date determined at the date of grant; however, the
    maximum term of options and stock appreciation rights under the
    2004 Performance Incentive Plan is ten years after the grant
    date of the award. RSUs granted under the 2004 Performance
    Incentive Plan typically vest over periods ranging from one to
    five years from the date of grant.

As of July 1, 2011, the maximum number of shares of the
    Company’s common stock that was authorized for award grants
    under the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan was 37.2 million
    shares. Any shares subject to awards under the Prior Stock Plans
    that are canceled, forfeited or otherwise terminate without
    having vested or been exercised, as applicable, will become
    available for other award grants under the 2004 Performance
    Incentive Plan. Shares issued in respect of stock options and
    stock appreciation rights granted under the 2004 Performance
    Incentive Plan count against the plan’s share limit on a

one-for-one

basis, whereas shares issued in respect of any other type of
    award granted under the plan count against the plan’s share
    limit as 1.35 shares for every one share actually issued in
    connection with such award. The 2004 Performance Incentive Plan
    will terminate on September 20, 2014 unless terminated
    earlier by the Company’s Board of Directors.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

The Company maintains an ESPP. Under the ESPP, eligible
    employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their
    eligible compensation during prescribed offering periods to
    purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at 95% of the
    fair market value of common stock on either the first day of
    that offering period or on the applicable exercise date,
    whichever is less. A participant may participate in only one
    offering period at a time, and a new offering period generally
    begins each June 1st and December 1st. Each
    offering period is generally 24 months and consists of four
    exercise dates (each, generally six months following the start
    of the offering period or the preceding exercise date, as the
    case may be). If the fair market value of the Company’s
    common stock is less on a given exercise date than on the date
    of grant, employee participation in that offering period ends
    and participants are automatically re-enrolled in the next new
    offering period.

Stock-based
    Compensation Expense

The Company recognized in expense $37 million,
    $37 million and $24 million for stock-based
    compensation related to the vesting of options granted by the
    Company under the Stock Plans and the ESPP in 2011, 2010 and
    2009, respectively. As of July 1, 2011, total compensation
    cost related to unvested stock options granted under the Stock
    Plans and ESPP rights issued to employees but not yet recognized
    was $60 million and will be amortized on a straight-line
    basis over a weighted average service period of approximately
    2.2 years.

The Company recognized in expense $32 million,
    $23 million and $23 million related to restricted
    stock and restricted stock unit awards granted under the Stock
    Plans that vested during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As
    of July 1, 2011, the aggregate unamortized fair value of
    all unvested restricted stock unit awards granted under the
    Stock Plans was $41 million, which will be recognized on a
    straight-line basis over a weighted average vesting period of
    approximately 1.3 years.

If an option has an exercise price that is less than the quoted
    price of the Company’s common stock at the particular time,
    the aggregate intrinsic value of that option at that time is
    calculated based on the difference between the exercise price of
    the options and the quoted price of the Company’s common
    stock at that time. As of July 1, 2011, the Company had
    options outstanding to purchase an aggregate of
    10.1 million shares with an exercise price below the quoted
    price of the Company’s stock on that date resulting in an
    aggregate intrinsic value of $145 million at that date.
    During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the aggregate intrinsic value of
    options exercised under the Stock Plans was $25 million,
    $72 million and $8 million, respectively, determined as of
    the date of exercise.

    Model

The fair value of ESPP purchase rights issued is estimated at
    the date of grant of the purchase rights using the

Black-Scholes-Merton

option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing
    model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
    traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
    transferable. The Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model
    requires the input of highly subjective assumptions such as the
    expected stock price volatility and the expected period until
    options are exercised. Purchase rights under the current ESPP
    provisions are granted on either June 1 or December 1 of each
    year.

The fair values of all ESPP purchase rights granted on or prior

The fair value of each RSU is the market price of our stock on
    the date of grant. The aggregate value of RSUs that became
    fully-vested during 2011 and 2010 was $23 million and
    $43 million, respectively, determined as of the vest date.
    RSUs are generally payable in an equal number of shares of the
    Company’s common stock at the time of vesting of the units.
    The grant-date fair value of the shares underlying the
    restricted stock awards at the date of grant was
    $26 million, $45 million and $19 million in 2011,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. These amounts are being recognized
    to expense over the corresponding vesting periods. For purposes
    of valuing these awards, the Company has assumed a forfeiture
    rate of 1.82%, 1.55%, and 0.0% during 2011, 2010, and 2009,
    respectively, based on a historical analysis indicating
    forfeitures for these types of awards.

Stock
    Repurchase Program

The Company’s Board of Directors previously authorized the
    repurchase of $750 million of common stock in open market
    transactions under a stock repurchase program through
    March 31, 2013. Since the inception of this program in
    2005, through July 1, 2011, the Company has repurchased
    20 million shares of its common stock for a total cost of
    $334 million. The Company repurchased 1.8 million
    shares for a total cost of $50 million during 2011. The
    Company may continue to repurchase stock as the Company deems
    appropriate and market conditions allow. The Company expects
    stock repurchases to be funded principally by operating cash
    flows.

Stock
    Purchase Rights

On April 6, 2001, the Company adopted a plan to protect
    shareholders’ rights in the event of a proposed takeover of
    the Company (the “2001 Rights Plan”). The 2001 Rights
    Plan expired on April 6, 2011. During the term of the 2001
    Rights Plan, each share of the Company’s outstanding common
    stock carried one Right to Purchase Series A Junior
    Participating Preferred Stock (the “Right”). The Right
    enabled the holder, under certain circumstances, to purchase
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of Western
    Digital at an exercise price of $50.00 per share ten days after
    a person or group publicly announced it had acquired or had
    tendered an offer for 15%, or more, of the Company’s
    outstanding common stock. The Rights were redeemable by the
    Company at $0.001 per Right.

Tax
    Holidays and Carryforwards

A substantial portion of the Company’s manufacturing
    operations in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand operate under
    various tax holidays and tax incentive programs which will
    expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2023.
    Certain of the holidays may be extended if specific conditions
    are met. The net impact of these tax holidays and tax incentives
    was to increase the Company’s net earnings by
    $362 million ($1.54 per diluted share), $560 million
    ($2.40 per diluted share), and $241 million ($1.07 per
    diluted share) in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

As of July 1, 2011, the Company had federal and state NOL
    carryforwards of $185 million and $52 million,
    respectively. In addition, as of July 1, 2011, the Company
    had various federal and state tax credit carryforwards of
    $251 million combined. The NOL carryforwards available to
    offset future federal and state taxable income expire at various
    dates from 2021 to 2030 and 2015 to 2020, respectively.
    Approximately $140 million of the credit carryforwards
    available to offset future taxable income expire at various
    dates from 2012 to 2030. The remaining amount is available
    indefinitely. NOLs and credits relating to Komag, Incorporated
    (“Komag”), which was acquired by the Company on
    September 5, 2007, are subject to limitations under
    Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code. The
    Company does not expect these limitations to result in a
    reduction in the total amount of NOLs and credits ultimately
    realized.

Uncertain
    Tax Positions

The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions
    based on a two-step process. First, the tax position is
    evaluated for recognition by determining if it is more likely
    than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including
    resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
    If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be
    sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the
    amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements.
    The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest
    amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
    upon ultimate settlement. With the exception of certain
    unrecognized tax benefits that are directly associated with the
    tax position taken, unrecognized tax benefits are presented
    gross in the Company’s balance sheet. Interest and
    penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on
    liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are
    recorded in the provision for income taxes. As of July 1,
    2011, such interest and penalties were not material.

As of July 1, 2011, the Company had $245 million of
    unrecognized tax benefits.

The entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits at July 1,

The Company files U.S. Federal, U.S. state, and
    foreign tax returns. For both federal and state tax returns,
    with few exceptions, the Company is subject to examination for
    fiscal years 2008 through 2011. In foreign jurisdictions, with
    few exceptions, the Company is subject to examination for all
    years subsequent to fiscal 2006. The Company is no longer
    subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service
    (“IRS”) for periods prior to 2006, although carry
    forwards generated prior to those periods may still be adjusted
    upon examination by the IRS or state taxing authority if they
    either have been or will be used in a subsequent period.

The IRS is currently examining fiscal years 2006 and 2007 for
    the Company and calendar years 2005 and 2006 for Komag. The IRS
    has completed its field work and proposed certain adjustments.
    Certain issues have been agreed upon by the Company and the IRS
    and certain issues remain unresolved. The Company has received
    Revenue Agent Reports (“RARs”) for the agreed issues.
    The Company has also received RARs from the IRS for the
    unresolved issues which seek adjustments to income before income
    taxes of $970 million for the Company and $380 million
    for Komag. The issues in dispute relate primarily to transfer
    pricing and certain other intercompany transactions. The Company
    disagrees with the proposed adjustments. In May 2011, the
    Company filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office regarding
    the proposed adjustments. The Company is continuing discussions
    with the IRS to resolve the Komag issues.

The Company believes that adequate provision has been made for
    any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However,
    the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If
    any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are
    resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s
    expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its
    provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.
    As of July 1, 2011, it is not possible to estimate the
    amount of change, if any, in the unrecognized tax benefits that
    is reasonably possible within the next twelve months. Any
    significant change in the amount of the Company’s
    unrecognized tax benefits would most likely result from
    additional information or settlements relating to the
    examination of the Company’s uncertain tax positions.

Note 10.  Fair
    Value Measurements

Financial assets and liabilities that are remeasured and
    reported at fair value at each reporting period are classified
    and disclosed in one of the following three levels:

Level 1.

Quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2.

Inputs other than Level 1
    that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as
    quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices
    in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are
    observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
    substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3.

Inputs that are unobservable for
    the asset or liability and that are significant to the fair
    value of the assets or liabilities.

    market funds are funds that invest in U.S. Treasury
    securities and are recorded within cash and cash equivalents in
    the consolidated balance sheets. Money market funds are valued
    based on quoted market prices.



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

U.S. Treasury Securities.

The
    Company’s U.S. Treasury securities are investments in
    Treasury bills with original maturities of three months or less,
    are held in custody by a third party and are recorded within
    cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.
    U.S. Treasury securities are valued using a market approach
    which is based on observable inputs including market interest
    rates from multiple pricing sources.

U.S. Government Agency Securities.

The
    Company’s U.S. Government agency securities are
    investments in fixed income securities sponsored by the
    U.S. Government with original maturities of three months or
    less, are held in custody by a third party and are recorded
    within cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance
    sheets. U.S. Government agency securities are valued using
    a market approach which is based on observable inputs including
    market interest rates from multiple pricing sources.

Auction-Rate Securities.

The Company’s
    auction-rate securities have maturity dates through 2050, are
    primarily backed by insurance products and are accounted for as

available-for-sale

securities. These investments are expected to be held until
    secondary markets become available and as a result, are
    classified as long-term investments and recorded within other
    non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
    Auction-rate securities are valued using an income approach
    which is based on a discounted cash flow model or a credit
    default model. The inputs to the discounted cash flow model
    include market interest rates and a discount factor to reflect
    the illiquidity of the investments. The inputs to the credit
    default model include market interest rates, yields of similar
    securities, and probability-weighted assumptions related to the
    creditworthiness of the underlying assets.

Foreign Exchange Contracts.

The Company’s
    foreign exchange contracts are short-term contracts to hedge the
    Company’s foreign currency risk related to the Thai Baht,
    Malaysian Ringgit, Euro and British Pound Sterling. Foreign
    exchange contracts are classified within other current assets in
    the consolidated balance sheets. Foreign exchange contracts are
    valued using an income approach which is based on a present
    value of future cash flows model. The market-based observable
    inputs for the model include forward rates and credit default
    swap rates.

Restructuring
    and Sale of Facility

During 2009, the Company announced and completed a restructuring
    plan to realign its cost structure as a result of a softer
    demand environment. This resulted in the closure of one of the
    Company’s hard drive manufacturing facilities in Thailand,
    the disposal of its substrate manufacturing facility in Sarawak,
    Malaysia, and headcount reductions throughout the world of
    approximately 3,300 people. Restructuring costs totaled
    $112 million and consisted of $81 million of asset



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

impairment charges, $27 million of employee termination
    benefits and $4 million of contract termination and other
    exit costs. Total cash expenditures related to the restructuring
    activities were $31 million. The asset impairment charge of
    $81 million consisted of $76 million primarily related
    to the land, buildings, machinery and equipment at the
    manufacturing facilities in Thailand and Malaysia and
    $5 million related to a customer relationship intangible
    asset acquired from Komag. The impairment charge is based on the
    excess of the carrying values over the estimated fair values of
    the assets. The fair values of the land, buildings, and
    equipment were estimated using the market approach. The
    intangible asset was valued using the income approach.

During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company sold its
    substrate manufacturing facility, and related assets, in
    Sarawak, Malaysia for net proceeds of $29 million,
    resulting in a gain of $18 million. The closure and
    disposal of the Company’s manufacturing facilities was to
    realign its manufacturing capacity with the Company’s
    expectations regarding demand at that time. Total restructuring
    charges of $112 million, partially offset by the
    $18 million gain on sale of assets, is included in
    restructuring and other, net within operating expenses in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Note 14.

Acquisitions

Planned
    Acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies

On March 7, 2011, the Company entered into a stock purchase
    agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Hitachi,
    Ltd. (“Hitachi”), Viviti Technologies Ltd., until
    recently known as Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Holdings
    Pte. Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Hitachi
    (“HGST”), and Western Digital Ireland, Ltd., an
    indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
    (“WDI”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, WDI
    agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding

paid-up

share capital of HGST from Hitachi. The planned acquisition is
    intended to result in a more efficient and innovative
    customer-focused storage company, with significant operating
    scale, strong global talent and the industry’s broadest
    product lineup backed by a rich technology portfolio. The
    aggregate purchase price of the planned acquisition is estimated
    to be approximately $4.3 billion, due at closing, and will
    be funded with existing cash, new debt, and 25 million
    newly issued shares of the Company’s common stock. The
    Purchase Agreement contains certain termination rights for both
    the Company and Hitachi, including the right to terminate the
    Purchase Agreement if the planned acquisition has not closed by
    March 7, 2012. If the planned acquisition has not closed by
    March 7, 2012 due to the failure to receive any required
    antitrust or competition authority’s consent, approval or
    clearance or any action by any certain governmental entities to
    prevent the planned acquisition for antitrust or competition
    reasons, the Company will, concurrently with such termination,
    be required to pay Hitachi a fee of $250 million in cash.
    During 2011, the Company incurred $17 million of expenses
    related to the planned acquisition of HGST which are included
    within selling, general and administrative expense in the
    consolidated statements of income.

On March 7, 2011, in connection with the planned
    acquisition of HGST, the Company, WDTI and WDI entered into a
    commitment letter with Bank of America, N.A. and Merrill Lynch,
    Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated regarding a new
    credit facility for an amount of $2.5 billion, consisting
    of a $500 million revolving credit facility and
    $2.0 billion in term loans, to be entered into in
    connection with the closing of the planned acquisition (the
    “Senior Facility”). Since entering into the commitment
    letter, Bank of America N.A. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
    Fenner & Smith Incorporated led the effort to
    syndicate the Senior Facility for an amount of up to
    $3.0 billion, consisting of a $500 million revolving
    credit facility and up to $2.5 billion in term loans. As a
    result of such effort, the Company, WDTI and WDI have fully
    negotiated definitive loan documents for the Senior Facility
    with the syndicate members and, subject to customary closing
    conditions including completion of the acquisition in accordance
    with its terms, the Company, WDTI and WDI fully expect all of
    these syndicate members to be part of the final lender group. In
    addition, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee at the
    rate of 0.35%, per annum, of the aggregate unfunded amount
    committed to be borrowed under the Senior Facility. For 2011,
    the Company incurred debt commitment fees of $2 million
    related to the acquisition.

The planned acquisition of HGST is subject to several closing
    conditions, including the receipt of antitrust approvals or the
    expiration of applicable waiting periods in certain
    jurisdictions. The Company has received requests for



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

additional information and is engaged in more in-depth reviews
    of the pending acquisition initiated by regulatory authorities
    in the United States, the European Union, the People’s
    Republic of China, Japan and Korea. The Company is cooperating
    fully with each of the regulatory authorities reviewing the
    proposed transaction. Subject to obtaining the required
    regulatory approvals or expiration of applicable waiting
    periods, the Company expects the transaction to close in its
    second quarter of fiscal 2012.

Magnetic
    Media Operations

On June 30, 2010, the Company acquired the facilities,
    equipment, intellectual property and working capital of the
    magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya. The cost of the
    acquisition was $233 million and was funded with available
    cash. The Company identified and recorded the assets, including
    specifically identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities
    assumed from Hoya at their estimated fair values as of the date
    of acquisition, and allocated the remaining value to goodwill.
    The allocation was as follows (in millions):

    intangibles will be amortized to cost of revenue over the
    weighted average useful life of 3 years.

Semiconductor
    Wafer Fabrication Facility

On May 25, 2010, the Company agreed to purchase a
    semiconductor wafer fabrication facility consisting of land, a
    building, equipment and certain intangible assets for a total
    acquisition cost of $35 million. The land and building were
    acquired for $20 million during the fourth fiscal quarter
    of 2010. The Company completed the acquisition by acquiring the
    equipment for $15 million during the fourth fiscal quarter
    of 2011.

SiliconSystems

On March 27, 2009, the Company acquired SiliconSystems, a
    supplier of solid-state drives for the embedded systems market.
    The total acquisition cost of SiliconSystems was
    $66 million, consisting of $65 million in cash paid to
    SiliconSystems shareholders and $1 million of other direct
    acquisition costs. The Company identified and recorded the
    assets, including specifically identifiable intangible assets,
    and liabilities assumed from SiliconSystems at their estimated
    fair values as of the acquisition date, and allocated the
    remaining value to goodwill. The allocation was as follows (in

    research and development of $14 million relates to projects
    that had not reached technological feasibility and had no
    alternative future use, and therefore, did not qualify for
    capitalization and was recorded as an operating expense during
    2009 in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As required by SEC

Rule 13a-15(b)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”), we carried out an evaluation, under
    the supervision and with the participation of our management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
    disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period
    covered by this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over
    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in
    reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
    and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable
    assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to
    permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts
    and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
    authorizations of our management and our directors; and
    (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
    of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial
    statements.

Our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework.

Based on this evaluation, our management
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm,
    which audited the consolidated financial statements included in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

has issued an audit report on our internal control over
    financial reporting. See page 46 herein.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended July 1,
    2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations of Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our
    Chief Financial Officer, does not expect our internal controls
    over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A
    control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
    provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
    objectives of the control system are met. Further, the benefits
    of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
    of the inherent limitations in a system of internal control over
    financial reporting, no evaluation of controls can provide
    absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
    fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations
    include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be
    faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or
    mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the
    individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
    people, or by management override of the control. The design of
    any system of controls is also based in part upon certain
    assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
    be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
    stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of
    the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
    misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
    detected.
