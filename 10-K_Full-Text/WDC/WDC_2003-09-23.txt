PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Western Digital Corporation (the
“Company” or “Western Digital”) designs,
develops, manufactures and markets hard drives, one of the key
components found in most computers and data storage subsystems.
A hard drive is a device that stores data on one or more
rotating magnetic disks to allow fast access to non-volatile
data for computing needs. The Company’s hard drives are
used in desktop personal computers, servers, network attached
storage devices, video game consoles, digital video recording
devices, and satellite and cable set-top boxes. The
Company’s hard drive products currently include 1.0-inch
high, 3.5-inch form factor drives with capacities ranging from
8 gigabytes (“GB”) to 250 GB, rotation
speeds of 5400, 7200 and 10,000 revolutions per minute
(“RPM”), and offer interfaces including Enhanced
Integrated Drive Electronics (“EIDE”), Serial Advanced
Technology Attachment (“SATA”),
1394/FireWire/i.Link

TM

and Universal Serial Bus
(“USB”). The Company sells its products worldwide to
computer manufacturers for inclusion in their computer systems
or subsystems and to distributors, resellers and retailers. The
Company’s hard drive products are currently manufactured in
Malaysia and Thailand. For geographical financial data, see the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 8
thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Industry

Desktop Personal Computer (“PC”)
Market.

According to TrendFOCUS, Inc.
(“TrendFOCUS”) quarterly reports for 2003 and calendar
year 2002, the desktop computer segment is the largest segment
of the worldwide personal computer market, accounting for
approximately 75% of global personal computer shipments in 2003.
Approximately 90% of Western Digital’s hard drive unit
shipments in 2003 were sold to this market, with the remaining
shipments ultimately being used in other applications such as
enterprise and consumer electronics markets. Desktop PC’s
for entry level to experienced users are used in both commercial
and consumer environments. The demand for both hard drive
capacity and unit volume of hard drives has grown in part due to:

Desktop PC’s are used in a number of
environments, ranging from homes to businesses and multi-user
networks. Software applications are used on desktop PC’s
primarily for word processing, spreadsheet, desktop publishing,
database management, multimedia, entertainment and other related
applications. Hard drives store these software applications and
the data used by these software applications.

The industry continues to supply increased
capacity per unit as users’ system needs increase and
technological and manufacturing advances continue to make higher
capacity drives more affordable. In the mainstream desktop PC
market, the Company believes that the rate of increase in
storage capacity per unit has decreased from historical norms.
This may result in consumer demand for storage increases being
balanced with the rate of improvement in the storage capacity
per unit. In contrast to currently established markets, the
emerging use of hard drives to record and play back audio and
video content in the audio-video market is expected to create
demand for storage capacity at a rate that may exceed the growth
in demand for increased capacity in the desktop PC market.

Increased consolidation in the industry has
resulted in highly efficient operations, improved economies of
scale, continued intense competition and supply chain
optimization, all of which tend to reduce the average selling
price per hard drive unit. The Company believes that metrics
such as customer quality, total cost of ownership, supply chain
optimization and a stable supply of hard drives at attractive
price levels will continue to be critical to its future success
in serving both the audio-video and desktop PC markets.



Since 1997, the PC industry has experienced
decreasing average selling prices for desktop PC’s, with
large growth in both the sub-$1,000 and sub-$600 segments.
TrendFOCUS estimates that approximately 82% of all desktop
PC’s sold in 2003 were priced below $1,000, while 22% were
priced below $600. Manufacturers of these systems typically have
a lower budget for both hard drive component cost and hard drive
warranty expense and, consequently, the average selling price
for hard drives to this segment of the desktop PC market has
also declined.

The Company believes that three additional
factors are impacting the growth of the PC market. First, the
Company believes that first-time buyers of PC’s in the
United States and Western European PC markets are near
saturation; therefore, new system sales in these regions are
driven by replacement of older systems through technology
obsolescence. Second, the Company believes that the cycle time
in which existing PC owners replace their PC’s has
lengthened from two to three years to approximately three to
five years. Third, uncertain economic conditions may have
influenced potential customers to delay upgrading their overall
information technology infrastructure. For an additional
discussion of changes in the PC market, see Part II,
Item 7, under the heading “Risk Factors That May
Affect Future Results.”

According to a March 2003 report published by
TrendFOCUS, the worldwide desktop PC hard drive market
(excluding emerging product markets) was forecasted to grow from
approximately 155 million units in calendar year 2002 to
approximately 197 million units in calendar year 2006,
reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 6%.
Revenue growth is expected to be slightly lower due to the
impact of price competition. TrendFOCUS forecasted that revenue
from sales of desktop PC hard drives would grow from
approximately $11.9 billion in calendar year 2002 to
approximately $14.7 billion in calendar year 2006,
reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5%.

Small Computer System Interface
(“SCSI”) Substitution
Market.

In certain circumstances, SCSI
hard drives are being replaced by parallel Advanced Technology
Attachment (“ATA”) or SATA hard drives in enterprise
storage applications. SATA is a relatively new interface
technology that potentially improves the reliability,
availability, scalability and performance attributes of parallel
ATA for enterprise environments. TrendFOCUS estimates that in
calendar year 2003, approximately 19% of the enterprise drive
market will utilize ATA/SATA hard drives, and it forecasts that
this amount will increase to 36% by 2006. Western Digital
currently offers its WD Raptor

TM

hard drive, a
10,000 RPM enterprise-class drive with the SATA interface, and
the WD Caviar® SATA hard drive, a 7200 RPM large
capacity hard drive for both desktop and “near-line”
enterprise storage demand.

Emerging Markets.

Future demand growth for desktop
computer hard drives also may be driven by new and emerging hard
drive markets, such as the audio-video and video game console
markets, and accelerated growth in new “near-line”
markets, such as tape replacement. According to a March 2003
report published by TrendFOCUS, the non-desktop PC 3.5-inch form
factor hard drive market was forecasted to grow from
approximately 9 million units in calendar year 2002 to
approximately 54 million units in calendar year 2006,
reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 57%.
For an additional discussion of the non-desktop PC hard drive
market, see Part II, Item 7, under the heading
“Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results.”

Audio-Video Market.

Traditionally, home users have
“time shifted” television content by recording onto
video tape by using a video cassette recorder (“VCR”)
to view the content at a later time. This market is experiencing
the introduction of an alternative to VCRs, where the video tape
is being replaced by a hard drive that remains in the device.
These hard drive-based recorders, commonly called personal video
recorders (“PVRs”) or digital video recorders
(“DVRs”), offer the end-user additional features that
are not available using VCRs. Hard drive technology makes it
possible to simultaneously record and play back content; to
pause and skip forward and backward, while recording during live
broadcasts; and to rapidly access large amounts of audio-video
content.

Because the market for audio-video products using
hard drives has not yet developed, accurate forecasts for future
growth remain challenging. For further discussion of the
audio-video market, see Part II, Item 7, under the
heading “Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results.”

Video Game Market.

According to TrendFOCUS, home
electronic game devices that include hard disk drives and that
are played on home entertainment systems had sales of
approximately 7 million units in calendar year 2002, with
an expected compound annual growth rate of approximately 29%
through calendar year 2006. In calendar year 2001, Microsoft
introduced the Xbox® video game system that uses a hard
disk drive for game use. In addition, in May 2003, Sony
announced plans to release the PSX

TM

product
combining their PlayStation® 2 architecture with a
120 GB hard



drive. Depending on the continued success of the
current Xbox® video game system architecture and the
acceptance of new combination devices such as Sony’s
PSX

TM

product, the video game market may continue to
drive additional hard drive unit and revenue growth. For an
additional discussion of the video game market, see
Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk Factors
That May Affect Future Results.”

“Near-Line” Storage
Market.

Traditional disaster recovery
and back-up of enterprise data has been done primarily on tape
media used in tape and optical libraries, which are devices that
enable access to large volumes of data. During the past few
years, a new data back-up market opportunity has started to
develop with EIDE/ATA hard drives augmenting tape media. This
new trend, popularly referred to as “near-line”
storage, has become an emerging technology due to both the
ability of hard drives to back up data more quickly than tape
solutions and the overall cost reduction trend in EIDE/ATA class
hard drives which is progressing at a faster rate than tape
media cost reduction trends. While an insignificant part of the
overall market in 2003, the use of EIDE/ATA drives as back-up
and disaster recovery technology has seen significant attention
and product introductions.

Other Market Opportunities.

The Company continuously evaluates
opportunities to apply its data storage core competencies beyond
traditional markets for hard drives. Currently, new business
opportunities are evaluated for their direct impact on the
Company’s ability to increase the sale of hard drives.
These opportunities include the design of hard drives for use in
consumer devices, such as gaming devices, PVRs and DVRs, and for
use in higher-end computer applications, such as servers and
server appliances. The Company monitors the development of new
markets related to data or content storage and storage
management, the transfer, use and storage of digital content and
the continuing development of networking protocols, and may from
time to time offer new products or services to address
appropriate new form factors, interfaces or markets. Conversely,
depending on the development of such markets and the
Company’s ability to achieve its goals, the Company may,
from time to time, withdraw from certain markets.

Products

The Company offers a broad line of hard disk
drives designed for various market segments. Western
Digital’s products are marketed under the
WD Caviar®, WD Protégé® and
WD Raptor

TM

brand names, and each product line
is designed for a particular market segment. The Company’s
WD Caviar and WD Protégé hard drive products are
designed to serve distinct portions of the desktop PC market.
WD Caviar hard drives are designed for the advanced
performance segment of the desktop PC market and the entry-level
server market, and WD Protégé hard drives are designed
for the value segment of the desktop PC market, the entry-level
PC’s and the game console market. The WD Raptor hard drive
is a SATA hard drive designed for the enterprise storage market
and high-end desktop PC applications.

Desktop PC and Entry-Level Server Hard Drive
Products.

The WD Caviar and WD
Protégé hard drive families currently consist of
1.0-inch high, 3.5-inch form factor products with capacities
ranging from 8 GB to 250 GB and rotation speeds of
5400 and 7200 RPM. These products utilize either the EIDE
interface or the SATA interface, providing high performance
while retaining ease of use and overall low cost of connection.
The type of EIDE interface currently used in a majority of the
Company’s hard drives is ATA/100, which signifies a burst
data transfer rate of 100 megabytes per second. The SATA
interface available in certain of the Company’s WD Caviar
Special Edition

TM

hard drives enables transfer rates
as high as 150 megabytes per second. The Company also sells
a line of external hard drives and related adapters which are
designed to accommodate external storage interfaces including
1394/FireWire/i.Link and USB. The 1394/FireWire/i.Link interface
is a high speed interface that can be used to add additional
storage capacity to a computer.

The Western Digital product line generally
leverages a common platform for various products within product
families with different capacities to serve the differing market
needs. This platform strategy results in commonality of
components across different products within product families,
which reduces exposure to changes in demand, facilitates
inventory management and allows the Company to achieve lower
costs through economies of scale purchasing. This platform
strategy also enables computer manufacturer customers to
leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product
models. The Company expects to continue to utilize this platform
strategy as it continues to develop products for the emerging
market for hard drives specifically designed for audio-video
applications, such as digital video recording devices.



Consumer Electronics Products.

The Company offers design capabilities
and hard drive technologies for consumer applications; however,
where practical, the Company intends to leverage its existing
product line architectures for the various products in the
consumer electronics market. The Company currently offers two
hard drive products designed for use in consumer audio-video
applications. It also offers products for the video game console
market, such as the Microsoft® Xbox® video game
system, and provides hard drives for other consumer electronics
products.

Mobile Hard Drive
Products.

The mobile hard drive market
includes such products as notebook PC’s, portable digital
music players, digital cameras, and personal digital assistants
(PDAs). Hard drives used in these products typically include
2.5-, 1.8- or 1.0-inch form factor hard drives. Although the
desktop PC market accounts for a majority of hard drive sales,
unit shipments of hard drives for the mobile market are
increasing. TrendFOCUS forecasts that unit sales of hard drives
to the mobile market will grow from approximately
33 million in calendar year 2002 to approximately
53 million in calendar year 2006, reflecting a compound
annual growth rate of approximately 13%. The Company
continuously evaluates the mobile market and has moved from
technology staging to active design work on a 2.5-inch form
factor drive to target the mobile market.

Technology and Product Development

Hard drives are used to record, store and
retrieve digital data. Their performance attributes are
currently better than removable or floppy disks, optical disk
drives and tapes, and they are more cost effective than
semiconductor technology. The primary measures of hard drive
performance include:

All of the Company’s hard drive products
employ similar technology. The main components of the hard drive
are the head disk assembly and the printed circuit board. The
head disk assembly includes the head, media (disks), head
positioning mechanism (actuator) and spin motor. These
components are contained in a hard base plate protective package
in a contamination-controlled environment. The printed circuit
board includes both standard and custom integrated circuits, an
interface connector to the host computer and a power connector.

The head disk assembly is comprised of one or
more disks positioned around a spindle hub that rotates the
disks by a spin motor. Disks are made of a smooth substrate to
which a thin coating of magnetic materials is applied. Each disk
has a head suspended directly above it, which can read data from
or write data to the spinning disk. The sensor element of the
head, also known as the slider, is getting progressively
smaller, requiring more accurate manufacturing processes.

The integrated circuits on the printed circuit
board typically include a drive interface and a controller. The
drive interface receives instructions from the computer, while
the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and
controls the heads. The location of data on each disk is
logically maintained in concentric tracks that are divided into
sectors. The computer sends instructions to the controller to
read data from or write data to the disks based on track and
sector locations. Guided by instructions from the controller,
the head stack assembly is pivoted and swung across the disk by
a head actuator or motor until it reaches the selected track of
a disk, where the data is recorded or retrieved.



Industry standard interfaces are utilized to
allow the disk drive to communicate with the computer.
Currently, the primary interface for desktop PC’s is EIDE,
and the primary interface for enterprise systems is SCSI. As
computer performance continues to improve, the hard drive will
need to deliver information faster than these interfaces can
handle. The Company believes that the desktop PC industry plans
to transition to higher speed interfaces, such as SATA, to
handle the higher data transfer rates. The Company currently
offers its WD Caviar Special Edition SATA hard drive, a
7200 RPM drive featuring capacities as large as 250 GB
and designed for the high-end PC, workstation and entry-level
server markets. The Company believes that SATA is also becoming
a more popular interface in the enterprise market. Western
Digital currently offers its WD Raptor hard drive, a
10,000 RPM enterprise-class drive with the SATA interface.
The Company is working to develop additional products that will
support these higher speed interfaces.

Storage capacity of the hard drive is determined
by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density, which
is a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the
recording surface of the disk. Areal density is generally
measured in megabits per square inch of disk surface. The higher
the areal density, the more information can be stored on a
single platter. As the areal density increases, fewer disks
and/or heads are required to achieve a given drive capacity,
thus reducing product costs through reduced component
requirements.

Head technology is one of the variables affecting
areal density. Due to rapid technological changes, there have
been several generations of head technology in a relatively
short period of time. Currently, the desktop hard drive industry
uses giant magnetoresistive head technology, which allows
significantly higher storage capacities than the previously
utilized thin-film head technology. All of the Company’s
hard drive product offerings currently employ giant
magnetoresistive head technology.

Constant innovations in research and development
are essential to the Company’s ability to compete. Hard
drive providers are evaluating or implementing a number of
technological innovations designed to further increase hard
drive performance and reduce product costs, including
simplifying the electronic architecture by combining the
traditional controller, channel, microprocessor and
servo-interface management functions of traditional hard drive
microprocessors on a single integrated circuit. Moreover, to
consistently achieve timely introduction and rapid volume
production of new products, some hard drive providers, including
the Company, are striving to simplify their product design
processes by focusing on creating extendible core technology
platforms which utilize common firmware and mechanical designs
and reuse of manufacturing tooling and application-specific
integrated circuits across various product generations and
product lines.

For an additional discussion of technological
innovations, see Part II, Item 7, under the heading
“Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results.”

Sales and Distribution

The Company sells its products globally to
computer manufacturers, distributors, resellers, systems
integrators and retailers. Manufacturers typically purchase
components such as hard drives and assemble them into the
computer systems they build. Distributors typically sell the
Company’s drives to small computer manufacturers, dealers,
systems integrators and other resellers.

Manufacturers.

Sales
to manufacturers accounted for 52%, 54% and 48% of the
Company’s revenue in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
During 2003, the Company’s major computer manufacturer
customers included Dell, E-Machines, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard,
IBM, and Microsoft. Typically, revenue from sales to certain
manufacturers account for more than 10% of the Company’s
revenue. For example, during 2003, sales to Dell and
Hewlett-Packard (including sales to Compaq Computer after its
merger with Hewlett-Packard in 2002) accounted for 20% and 13%
of revenue, respectively. During 2002, sales to Dell and
Hewlett-Packard (including sales to Compaq Computer prior to its
merger with Hewlett-Packard in 2002) accounted for 15% and 13%
of revenue, respectively. During 2001, sales to Dell and Compaq
Computer accounted for 16% and 12% of revenue, respectively. The
Company believes that its success depends on its ability to
maintain and improve its strong relationships with the leading
computer manufacturers. Since 2000, Western Digital, Maxtor
(which merged with Quantum in 2000) and Seagate have had the
highest market share with these manufacturers.



In 2003, the top seven desktop personal computer
manufacturers accounted for approximately 49% of all shipments
of desktop PC’s in the desktop PC market. As a result,
maintaining customer satisfaction with these leading computer
manufacturers is critical.

Computer manufacturers evaluate and select their
hard drive suppliers based on a number of factors, including
overall quality, storage capacities, performance
characteristics, price, service and support, ease of doing
business, and the supplier’s long-term financial stability.
They typically seek to qualify two or three providers for each
generation of hard drives, and once a computer manufacturer has
chosen its qualified hard drive vendors for a given product, it
generally will purchase hard drives from those vendors for the
life of that product. To achieve success with computer
manufacturers’ qualifications, a hard drive supplier must
consistently offer hard drives featuring leading technology,
quality and high capacity per disk. Suppliers must quickly
achieve volume production of high quality and reliable hard
drives. To quickly achieve high volume production, a hard drive
supplier must have access to flexible, high-capacity,
high-quality manufacturing capabilities.

Many of the Company’s computer manufacturer
customers (also referred to as original equipment manufacturers
or “OEMs”) have adopted just-in-time inventory
management processes or supply chain business models that
combine “build-to-order” (computer manufacturer does
not build until there is a firm order) and “contract
manufacturing” (computer manufacturer contracts assembly
work to a contract manufacturer who purchases components and
assembles the computer based on the computer manufacturer’s
instructions). For certain key OEMs the Company maintains a base
stock of several weeks, on average, of current, finished goods
inventory in facilities located adjacent to the OEM’s
operations. Inventory at these locations usually includes minor
product customizations (such as labeling) for the related
computer manufacturer. If subsequent to its initial order the
computer manufacturer changes its requirements, inventory held
at these facilities can be sold to other computer manufacturers
or distributors “as is” or with minor modifications
(such as a change in labeling) at little or no additional cost.
Therefore, changes in an OEM’s requirements have minimal
impact on inventory valuation.

For an additional discussion of the need to adapt
to customers’ business models and maintain customer
satisfaction, refer to Part II, Item 7, under the
headings “Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results.”

Distributors.

The
Company uses a select group of distributors to sell its products
to small computer manufacturers, resellers, dealers and systems
integrators. During 2003, the Company’s major distributor
customers included ASI, Digiland, eSys Distribution, Ingram
Micro, Tech Data and TSR Silicon Resources. Distributors
accounted for approximately 40%, 39% and 45% of the
Company’s revenue for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Distributors generally enter into non-exclusive agreements for
specific territories with the Company for purchase and
redistribution of product on a quick turnover basis. Blanket
purchase orders are placed on a quarterly basis and shipments
are made based upon a distributor’s weekly authorization.
The Company grants its distributors price protection, and
certain distributors have limited rights to return product on an
inventory rotation basis.

Retailers.

The
Company sells its retail-packaged products directly to a select
group of major retailers such as computer superstores, warehouse
clubs and computer electronics stores, and authorizes sales
through distributors to smaller retailers. During 2003, major
retailers to whom the Company sold directly included Best Buy,
Circuit City, CompUSA, Fry’s Electronics, OfficeMax and
Sam’s Club. Retailers accounted for approximately 8%, 7%
and 7% of the Company’s revenue for each of 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. The Company’s current retail customer
base is primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe. The
retail channel complements the Company’s other sales
channels while helping to build brand awareness for the Company
and its products. Retailers supply the aftermarket
“upgrade” sector in which end-users purchase and
install products to upgrade their computers. The Company grants
certain of its retailers price protection and limited rights to
return product on an inventory rotation basis. The Company also
sells its retail-packaged products through the Internet, at its
web site.

The Company maintains sales offices throughout
North America, Eastern and Western Europe, the Middle East,
Japan and Asia/ Pacific. Field application engineering is
provided to strategic computer manufacturer accounts, and
localized end-user technical support services are provided
within the United States, Canada and Europe. The Company’s
localized end-user technical support is currently supplied by
employees and a third party provider through telephone support,
and via the Company’s web site.



The Company’s international sales, which
include sales to foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies but
do not include sales to U.S. subsidiaries of foreign
companies, represented 59%, 50% and 47% of the Company’s
revenue for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Sales to
international customers may be subject to certain risks not
normally encountered in domestic operations, including exposure
to tariffs, various trade regulations and fluctuations in
currency exchange rates. See Part II, Item 7, under
the heading “Risk Factors That May Affect Future
Results.”

For additional information concerning revenue
recognition, sales by geographic region and significant customer
information, see Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The Company’s marketing and advertising
functions are performed both internally and through an outside
firm. Advertising, worldwide packaging and marketing materials
are targeted to various reseller and end-user segments. Western
Digital utilizes both consumer media and, to a lesser extent,
trade publications. The Company has programs under which
qualifying distributors and retailers are reimbursed for certain
marketing expenditures. Western Digital also maintains customer
relationships by communicating with its resellers and providing
end-users with pre-sale and post-sale information and support
through its web site.

Competition

The Company competes primarily with manufacturers
of 3.5-inch hard disk drives for desktop and server computers.
The Company’s competitors in the hard drive market include
Fujitsu, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (a joint venture
formed in 2003 between Hitachi and IBM), Maxtor, Samsung and
Seagate. Over the last three years, the hard drive industry has
experienced consolidation, decreasing the number of major
competitors. In particular, Maxtor acquired the hard drive
business of Quantum, Fujitsu exited the desktop hard drive
market, and IBM sold its hard drive business to Hitachi Global
Storage Technologies.

The hard drive industry is intensely competitive,
with hard drive suppliers competing for sales to a limited
number of major customers. Hard drives manufactured by different
competitors are highly substitutable due to the industry mandate
of technical form, fit and function standards. Hard drive
manufacturers compete on the basis of product quality and
reliability, storage capacity, unit price, product performance,
production volume capabilities, delivery capability, leadership
in time-to-market, time-to-volume and time-to-quality, service
and support, and ease of doing business. The relative importance
of these factors varies between different customer and market
segments. The Company believes that it is generally competitive
in all of these factors.

Based on quarterly reports published by
TrendFOCUS in 2003 and calendar year 2002, the Company believes
that its market share of hard disk drives sold worldwide during
2003, based on units shipped, increased approximately 4%, from
approximately 13% to approximately 17%. During 2003, Western
Digital, Seagate, Maxtor, and Hitachi Global Storage
Technologies (including sales by IBM and Hitachi prior to the
formation of the joint venture in 2003) supplied approximately
85% of the total hard drive market.

The Company believes that there are no
substantial barriers to entry for competitors to offer competing
products. Therefore, the Company believes that it cannot
differentiate its hard drive products solely on attributes such
as storage capacity, buffer size or time-to-market. Accordingly,
the Company also differentiates itself by designing and
incorporating into its hard drives desirable product performance
attributes, focusing on seek time, data transfer rates,
intelligent caching, failure prediction, remote diagnostics,
acoustics and data recovery. In addition, the Company emphasizes
non-product related attributes, including rapid response with
its computer manufacturer and distribution customers. Rapid
response requires accelerated design cycles, customer delivery,
production flexibility and timely service and support, which
contribute to customer satisfaction. The Company also relies on
the strength of the Western Digital brand name with value-added
resellers and solution providers to whom the Company sells its
hard drive products directly and indirectly. The Company
believes that trust in a manufacturer’s reputation and the
establishment of strategic relationships have become important
factors in the selection of a hard drive, particularly within
such a rapidly changing technology environment.

The desktop hard drive market is characterized by
several large competitors; therefore, it has traditionally been
subject to periods of sustained and severe price competition,
and factors such as time-to-market, time-to-volume and
time-to-quality can have a pronounced effect on the success of
any particular product.



Advances in magnetic, optical or other data
storage technologies could result in competitive products that
have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than
the Company’s hard drive products. High-speed semiconductor
memory could compete with the Company’s hard drive products
in the future. Semiconductor memory is much faster than magnetic
disk drives, but currently is not competitive from a cost
standpoint. Flash memory, a non-volatile semiconductor memory,
is currently much more costly and, while it has higher
“read” performance than hard drives, it has lower
“write” performance. Flash memory could become
competitive in the near future for applications requiring less
storage capacity than that provided by hard drives.

For an additional discussion of competition, see
Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk Factors
That May Affect Future Results.”

Service and Warranty

Western Digital generally warrants its newly
manufactured hard drives against defects in materials and
workmanship for a period of one to five years from the date of
sale. The Company’s warranty obligation is generally
limited to repair or replacement of the hard drive. The Company
has engaged third parties in Brazil, China, Germany, India,
Korea, Russia, and Singapore to process and test returned hard
drives for the Company’s customers. In addition, the
Company has contracted with a third party in Canada to process
returned hard drives, and until July 2002 had engaged a third
party to perform a similar service in the United States. In July
2002, Western Digital assumed the processing and testing of hard
drives in the United States and terminated the outsourcing of
this function to the third party. The Company has engaged third
parties to refurbish or repair its products at service
facilities located in Singapore and Germany.

Manufacturing

To be competitive, Western Digital must
manufacture high quality hard drives with industry leading
time-to-volume production at competitive unit costs. The Company
strives to maintain manufacturing flexibility and high
manufacturing yields, while insisting that its suppliers provide
high-quality components at competitive prices. The critical
elements of Western Digital’s hard drive production are
high volume, low cost assembly and testing, and establishment
and maintenance of key vendor relationships. By establishing
partner relationships with its strategic component suppliers,
the Company believes it is able to access
“best-of-class” manufacturing quality. In addition,
the Company believes that its sourcing strategy currently
enables it to have the business flexibility needed to select the
highest quality low cost suppliers as product designs and
technologies evolve.

Hard drive manufacturing is a complex process
involving the assembly of precision components with narrow
tolerances and extensive testing to ensure reliability. The
assembly process occurs in a “clean room” environment
which demands skill in process engineering and efficient
utilization of the “clean room” layout in order to
reduce the high operating costs of this manufacturing
environment. The Company’s clean room manufacturing process
consists of modular production units, each of which contains a
number of work cells.

The Company produces hard drives in two plants,
one in Malaysia and one in Thailand. The Company continually
evaluates its manufacturing processes in an effort to increase
productivity, sustain and improve quality and decrease
manufacturing costs. For example, in order to improve efficiency
and reduce costs, the Company closed two manufacturing
facilities in Singapore during 1999 and 2000 and relocated its
hard drive production to Malaysia. During 2002, in response to
an increase in demand and in order to capitalize on the local
supplier base, the Company completed the acquisition of a
Thailand manufacturing facility. The Company continually
evaluates which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit
from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can
improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs. Currently,
the Company purchases all of the standard mechanical components
and micro controllers for its hard drives from external
suppliers.

In July 2003, the Company purchased substantially
all of the assets of Read-Rite Corporation, formerly one of the
Company’s suppliers of heads, including its wafer
fabrication equipment in Fremont, California and its slider
fabrication facility in Bang Pa-In, Thailand. The Company uses
these facilities to design and manufacture head gimbal
assemblies (“HGAs”) and head stack assemblies
(“HSAs”) for use in disk drives it manufactures.



For an additional discussion of manufacturing,
see Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk
Factors That May Affect Future Results.”

Research and Development

The Company devotes substantial resources to
development of new products and improvement of existing
products. The Company focuses its engineering efforts on
coordinating its product design and manufacturing processes in
order to bring its products to market in a cost-effective and
timely manner. Research and development expenses for continuing
operations totaled $135 million, $120 million and
$113 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

For further discussion of product development,
see Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk
Factors That May Affect Future Results.”

Materials and Supplies

The principal components currently used in the
manufacture of the Company’s hard drives are magnetic heads
and related HSAs, media, controllers, spindle motors and
mechanical parts used in the head disk assembly. In addition to
custom semiconductor devices, the Company also uses standard
semiconductor components such as logic, memory and
microprocessor devices obtained from other manufacturers and a
wide variety of other parts, including connectors, cables, and
other interconnect technology.

The Company acquires all of the components,
except for a portion of its heads, for its products from third
party suppliers. In general, the Company tries to have multiple
suppliers for each of its component requirements. For example,
during 2003 the Company bought giant magnetoresistive heads from
ALPS Electric Co., Ltd., Read-Rite Corporation and TDK
Corporation’s subsidiary, SAE Magnetics Ltd. In June 2003,
Read-Rite commenced voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy
proceedings. Western Digital subsequently purchased
substantially all of the assets of Read-Rite, including its
wafer fabrication equipment in Fremont, California and its
slider fabrication facility located in Bang Pa-In, Thailand. The
Company uses the assets purchased from Read-Rite to design and
manufacture HGAs and HSAs for use in disk drives it
manufactures. For additional information regarding the Read-Rite
acquisition, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements and Part II, Item 7, under the
heading “Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results.”
During 2003, the Company’s media requirements were
purchased from several outside vendors including Fuji Electric
Company Ltd., Komag, Showa Denko KK and Trace Storage Technology
Corporation. The Company has a volume purchase agreement with
Komag. Under this agreement, which expires in April 2005, the
Company is obligated to purchase a substantial percentage of its
requirements for hard disk media from Komag as long as
Komag’s prices, technology and quality remain competitive.

Some custom integrated circuits are currently
sole-sourced from STMicroelectronics, IBM and Marvell
Semiconductor, Inc. The Company has entered into volume purchase
agreements with IBM and Marvell to purchase read channel devices
at negotiated quantities and prices. Because of their custom
nature, these products require significant design-in periods and
long lead times. There has been a trend in integrated circuit
design toward increased integration of various separate
circuits. The Company expects this trend to continue in the area
of custom integrated circuits for hard drives.

For an additional discussion of component
supplies, see Part II, Item 7, under the heading
“Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results.”

Backlog

Historically, a substantial portion of the
Company’s orders has been for shipments within 30 to
60 days of the placement of the order. The Company
generally negotiates pricing, order lead times, product support
requirements and other terms and conditions prior to receiving a
computer manufacturer’s first purchase order for a product.
Customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with
relatively short notice to the Company, with little or no cost
to the customer, or modified by customers to provide for
delivery at a later date. In addition, certain of the
Company’s sales to computer manufacturers are made under
just-in-time delivery contracts that do not generally require
firm order commitments by the customer until the time of sale.
Instead, the Company receives a periodic forecast of
requirements from the customer, and the customer is invoiced
upon shipment of the product from the just-in-time warehouse.



Therefore, backlog information as of the end of a
particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels
of the Company’s revenue and profit and may not be
comparable to earlier periods.

Patents, Licenses and Proprietary
    Information

The Company owns numerous patents and has many
patent applications in process. The Company believes that,
although its patents and patent applications have considerable
value, the successful manufacturing and marketing of its
products depends primarily upon the technical and managerial
competence of its personnel. Accordingly, the patents held and
applied for do not assure the Company’s future success.

In addition to patent protection of certain
intellectual property rights, the Company considers elements of
its product designs and processes to be proprietary and
confidential. The Company believes that its non-patented
intellectual property, particularly some of its process
technology, is an important factor in its success. Western
Digital relies upon non-disclosure agreements and contractual
provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect its
proprietary information. Despite these safeguards, there is a
risk that competitors may obtain and use such information. The
laws of foreign jurisdictions in which the Company conducts
business also may provide less protection for confidential
information than the United States.

The Company relies on certain technology that is
licensed from other parties in order to manufacture and sell its
products. The Company believes that it has adequate
cross-licenses and other agreements in place in addition to its
own intellectual property portfolio to compete successfully in
the hard drive industry.

For additional discussion of intellectual
property, see Part II, Item 7, under the heading
“Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results.”

Environmental Regulation

The Company is subject to a variety of
regulations in connection with its operations. It believes that
it has obtained or is in the process of obtaining all necessary
environmental permits for its operations.

Employees

As of June 27, 2003, the Company employed a
total of 11,508 employees worldwide. This represents an
increase in headcount of approximately 21% since June 28,
2002 and an increase of approximately 46% since June 29,
2001. The increase is primarily the result of the purchase of a
manufacturing facility in Thailand during 2002 in response to an
increase in unit sales. The Company employed
1,158 employees in the United States, 7,475 employees in
Malaysia, 2,764 employees in Thailand, 19 employees in
Singapore and 92 employees at its international sales
offices as of June 27, 2003. In addition, in connection
with the acquisition of Read-Rite’s assets in July 2003, as
of August 29, 2003 the Company had hired 659 employees
to work in its new Fremont, California facility and
4,074 employees to work in its newly acquired Bang Pa-In,
Thailand facility. Combined, as of August 29, 2003, the
Company employed a total of 16,241 employees worldwide.

Many of the Company’s employees are highly
skilled, and the Company’s continued success depends in
part upon its ability to attract and retain such employees.
Accordingly, the Company offers employee benefit programs which
it believes are at least equivalent to those offered by its
competitors. Despite these programs, the Company has, along with
most of its competitors, experienced difficulty at times in
hiring and retaining certain skilled personnel. When the Company
is unable to hire personnel in the ordinary course of business,
it uses third parties to help satisfy its personnel needs. In
addition, the Company has utilized consultants and contract
personnel to fill these needs until full-time employees could be
recruited. The Company has never experienced a work stoppage,
none of its domestic employees are represented by a labor
organization, and the Company considers its employee relations
to be good.

Description of the Business

Western Digital designs, develops, manufactures
and markets hard drives for digital information storage. The
Company’s hard drives are used in desktop PC’s,
servers, network attached storage devices and an expanding list
of consumer electronics (“CE”) products such as video
game consoles, digital video recorders and satellite and cable
set-top boxes. Western Digital markets its hard drives directly
to PC manufacturers, including large, brand name PC
manufacturers such as Dell and HP; to CE manufacturers; and to
distributors, resellers and retailers that serve a wide range of
end users. Unless otherwise noted, all references to market
share and industry data included in this discussion are
according to the March 2003 report published by TrendFOCUS, the
July 2003 report published by International Data Corporation
(“IDC”) and the June 2003 report published by Gartner,
Inc. (“Gartner”).

Western Digital builds hard drives in two
assembly facilities, one in Malaysia and one in Thailand,
procuring components from industry-leading technology companies
that work with the Company from design and development through
manufacturing.

Hard-drive industry dynamics have changed
significantly over the last several years. In calendar year
2002, seven hard drive vendors competed in the
$20 billion-a-year hard drive market, compared to
15 vendors two years ago. Consolidation in the industry has
produced more efficient operations, tighter supply chain
management, leaner cost structures and more predictable
operating results. According to TrendFOCUS quarterly reports for
2003 and calendar year 2002, Western Digital, Seagate
Technologies, Maxtor Corporation, and Hitachi Global Storage
Technologies (including sales by IBM and Hitachi prior to the
formation of the joint venture in 2003) supplied approximately
85% of the total hard drive market during 2003.

Western Digital believes that its business model
allows the Company to benefit from leading-edge component
technologies and cost-saving innovations while minimizing
investment expenditures. High-efficiency facilities, lean
staffing and careful control of costs and working capital enable
Western Digital to fund a growing revenue stream without
commensurate operating expenses and to convert substantial
portions of incremental revenue into earnings. The Company
focuses on providing quality products, superior customer service
and flexibility by intensively managing the aspects of the
business it can control: technology deployment, manufacturing,
cost, delivery, quality and reliability.

Western Digital’s growth will be influenced
greatly by developments in the PC hard drive market. TrendFOCUS
estimates that desktop PC hard drive shipments totaled
approximately 155 million units in calendar year 2002 and
that this market will grow by approximately 6% per year through
calendar year 2006. The Company has increased its resources to
address the fast-growing emerging markets of Asia, Latin America
and Eastern Europe, where its revenue grew to 34% of total
Company revenue in fiscal year 2003 from 32% a year earlier.
Gartner estimates that demand for



desktop hard drives in emerging markets will
increase 13% per year through calendar year 2007. Geographical
financial data may be found in Note 8 to the Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

Because CE demand for hard drives is relatively
new, with many consumer applications employing the same hard
drive technology as is found in desktop PC’s, Western
Digital believes it can grow in this developing market without
significant increases in operating expenses. TrendFOCUS
estimates that unit shipments of hard drives in CE markets,
which totaled approximately 9 million units in calendar
year 2002, will grow by approximately 57% per year through
calendar year 2006.

The Company is pursuing new revenue opportunities
in enterprise storage through its application of the new SATA
interface, which, the Company believes, over the next few years
will replace the present parallel ATA interface in desktop
PC’s. The SATA interface contains many of the same benefits
of the Small Computer Systems Interface, or
“SCSI” — the predominant interface currently
used in most enterprise hard drive applications — at a
lower cost. TrendFOCUS estimates that 36% of enterprise hard
drive unit shipments will use the ATA/ SATA interface by
calendar year 2006. In addition, the Company is evaluating
entering the mobile hard drive market. TrendFOCUS forecasts that
unit sales of hard drives to the mobile market will grow from
approximately 33 million in calendar year 2002 to approximately
53 million in calendar year 2006, reflecting a compound
annual growth rate of approximately 13%.

Fiscal 2003 Overview

According to the June 2003 IDC PC Tracker data,
the desktop PC market, the primary market for Western
Digital’s products, grew by less than 1% in fiscal year
2003. Despite minimal growth in this market, IDC estimates that
the hard disk drive market increased by 11% based on unit
shipments. In this environment, Western Digital produced strong
financial results by delivering high-quality products at the
right time and continuing to improve its efficiencies by
controlling expenses and intensively managing working capital.

Western Digital, in 2003, produced a net revenue
increase of 26%, to $2.7 billion, on unit shipments of
39.7 million. Based on quarterly reports published by
TrendFOCUS in 2003 and calendar 2002, the Company believes that
its market share in hard disk drives increased to 17% from 13%
in 2002. Greater revenue and strong cost control enabled the
Company to increase operating income by 268%, to
$187 million. Operating margins increased to 6.9% as a
percentage of net revenue, compared with 2.4% in 2002. Strong
fiscal management enabled Western Digital to generate
$281 million in cash flow from operations in 2003. The
Company also retired all of its convertible debt and finished
the year with $393 million in cash and cash equivalents, an
increase of $170 million from the prior year’s total.

Recent Developments

In June 2003, Read-Rite Corporation, one of the
Company’s suppliers of heads, commenced voluntary
Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings. On July 31, 2003, in
an effort to increase the Company’s operational flexibility
and ensure access to future head technologies, Western Digital
purchased substantially all of the assets of Read-Rite
Corporation, including the wafer fabrication equipment in
Fremont, California and the manufacturing facility in Bang
Pa-In, Thailand. The total cost of the acquisition will be
between $170 million and $180 million. This includes
cash consideration of approximately $95 million, assumed
debt obligations of the Thailand operations of approximately $60
million and direct costs of the acquisition and other
miscellaneous assumed obligations totaling approximately
$15 million to $25 million. As of August 29,
2003, the Company has hired 4,733 employees to continue the
operations in California and Thailand.

As a result of the acquisition, the Company
anticipates that its average gross margin will improve during
the second half of 2004 as the acquired assets are integrated
with those of the Company. However, gross margin for the first
quarter of 2004 is expected to be lower due to start-up
expenses, including factory employee severance costs and
under-absorbed overhead related to low initial head production
volumes. The Company expects that first quarter net income will
be negatively impacted by one-time charges of up to
$50 million for the aforementioned start-up costs and
acquired in-process research and development costs.



Results of Operations

Summary of 2003,
2002 and 2001 Comparison

The following table sets forth, for the periods
indicated, summary information from the Company’s statement
of operations (in millions).

Net
Revenue

Net revenue was $2.7 billion for fiscal year
2003, an increase of 26%, or $567 million, from fiscal year
2002. Total unit shipments increased to 39.7 million for the
year as compared to 29.1 million from the prior year as a
result of the Company’s improved market share as well as an
increase in demand for hard drives in the PC market. Average
selling price (“ASP”) decreased to $68 per unit for
the year from $74 in 2002. Historically, ASP’s in the
desktop hard drive industry have generally declined annually in
the 10-20% range. However, those price declines have moderated
over the past few quarters given longer product life cycles,
industry consolidation, improved supply/ demand management and
fewer component cost reduction opportunities.

Net revenue increased $198 million or 10% in
2002 from 2001. This increase in net revenue was primarily due
to an increase in unit shipments to 29.1 million in 2002
from 22.3 million in 2001, partially offset by a decrease
in ASP’s to $74 per unit from $88 per unit. The significant
change in units and ASP’s in 2002 from 2001 is primarily
due to expansion of the Company’s hard drive product line
into lower-end desktop PC and consumer electronics markets.

Gross
Margin

For fiscal year 2003, gross margin percentage
increased to 16.3% from 13.1% for 2002. The increase in gross
margin percentage over the prior year was primarily the result
of a more moderate pricing environment, manufacturing
efficiencies associated with higher unit volume and continuing
cost reduction efforts, offset by an $18.5 million charge
related to the Cirrus Logic, Inc. (“Cirrus”)
litigation settlement. For fiscal year 2002, gross margin
percentage increased to 13.1% from 10.6% for 2001. The increase
in gross margin in 2002 from 2001 was primarily a result of more
cost efficient designs and higher unit volume, partially offset
by lower ASP’s.

Operating
Expenses

Total operating expenses, consisting of research
and development (“R&D”) and selling, general and
administrative (“SG&A”), decreased to 9.4% of net
revenue in fiscal 2003 as compared to 10.7% of net revenue in
fiscal 2002 and 11.7% of net revenue in fiscal 2001. Absolute
dollar increases in operating expenses over the prior years is
primarily due to higher pay-for-performance and retention plan
expenses, resulting from improved Company performance.

R&D expense was $135 million,
$120 million and $113 million for fiscal year 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in R&D expense in
2003 from 2002 of $15 million and in 2002 from 2001 of
$7 million was due to increases in new development programs
and higher employee incentive payments, partially offset by
expense reduction efforts.



SG&A expense was $121 million,
$111 million and $116 million for fiscal year 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in SG&A expense in
2003 from 2002 of $10 million was primarily related to
higher incentive payments resulting from improved operational
results. The decrease in SG&A expense in 2002 from 2001 of
$5 million was primarily due to expense reduction efforts,
partially offset by higher employee incentive payments.

Interest and
Other Income (Expense)

Net interest and other income (expense) was
$1.6 million, $1.4 million and ($30.7) million in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. This includes net investment
gains of $3.4 million in 2003, $4.8 million in 2002,
and investment write-offs and related lease contingency accruals
of $52.4 million, offset by gains on the redemption of
debenture of $22.4 million in 2001. Excluding these items,
net interest and other expense was $1.8 million,
$3.4 million and $0.7 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The decrease in net expense in 2003 was primarily
due to the Company’s redemption of its convertible
debentures resulting in lower interest expense. The increase in
net expense in 2002 was primarily due to a decrease in interest
income as a result of lower interest rates.

Income Tax
Expense (Benefit)

Income tax expense was $7.6 million in 2003
as compared to the income tax benefit of $1.1 million in
2002. The increase in the income tax expense of
$8.7 million from 2002 is primarily related to an increase
in earnings within certain tax jurisdictions. Differences
between the effective tax rate for 2003 of 4%, as compared to
the U.S. federal statutory rate, are primarily due to
earnings of certain subsidiaries which are taxed at
substantially lower tax rates as compared with U.S. statutory
rates and the partial utilization of net operating loss
(“NOL”) carryforwards. The Company’s 2002 net
income tax benefit of $1.1 million included a federal
income tax refund of $3.1 million for a loss carryback
available as a result of tax legislation enacted during the
year. During 2001, the Company did not record an income tax
benefit, as no loss carrybacks were available at that time. See
Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Discontinued
Operations

During 2002, the Company discontinued the
operations of new business ventures, including Connex, Inc.
(“Connex”), SANavigator, Inc.
(“SANavigator”) and Keen Personal Media, Inc.
(“Keen”). The Company sold substantially all of the
assets of its Connex and SANavigator businesses for a net gain
of $24.5 million and terminated the Keen operations. These
operating losses for the periods reported and the net gain
recognized on the sale of Connex and SANavigator have been
segregated from continuing operations and reported separately on
the statements of operations as discontinued operations. During
2003, the Company settled the remaining debt obligations related
to one of the discontinued operations and as a result of a
favorable settlement, recorded a gain of $1.3 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company had cash and cash equivalents of
$393 million at June 27, 2003 and $224 million at
June 28, 2002. Net cash provided by continuing operations
was $281 million and $83 million during 2003 and 2002,
respectively. This $198 million improvement in cash provided by
continuing operations consists of a $149 million
improvement in the Company’s net income, net of non-cash
items, and a $49 million increase in cash provided by
working capital. These improvements are due to significantly
better operating performance by the Company, including higher
sales volume and improved cost management.

The Company’s cash conversion cycle, which
represents the sum of the number of days sales outstanding
(“DSO”) and days inventory outstanding
(“DIO”) less days payable outstanding
(“DPO”), was negative 9 days for 2003 and 2002.
Accounts receivable at June 27, 2003 was higher than the
prior year as a result of higher fourth quarter revenue combined
with longer average collection days. However, this increase in
average collection days was offset by improved inventory turns
and longer payment days with suppliers. The allowance for
doubtful accounts decreased to $5 million at June 27,
2003 from $8 million at June 28, 2002 as a result of
the write-off of fully reserved accounts receivable balances
which management determined to be uncollectable.

Other uses of cash during 2003 included net
capital expenditures of $62 million, primarily to upgrade the
Company’s desktop hard drive production capabilities and
for the normal replacement of existing assets, $88 million
for the extinguishment or redemption of the Company’s
remaining 5.25% zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures



due February 18, 2018 and $6 million
for the repayment of a subsidiary’s loan. Other sources of
cash during 2003 included $44 million received in
connection with stock option exercises and Employee Stock
Purchase Plan purchases.

Other uses of cash during 2002 included net
capital expenditures of $48 million, primarily for normal
replacement of existing assets and the purchase of assets for
the Company’s manufacturing facility in Thailand and
$18 million for debenture redemptions.

Other sources of cash during 2002 included
$10 million received from the sale of assets, and
$10 million received in connection with stock option and
warrant exercises and Employee Stock Purchase Plan purchases.

In 2003, discontinued operations used
$3 million of cash. In 2002, discontinued operations,
provided $18 million of cash, which included approximately
$37 million net proceeds from asset sales.

As discussed above under the heading “Recent
Developments,” Western Digital purchased substantially all
of the assets of Read-Rite Corporation, including the wafer
fabrication equipment in Fremont, California and the
manufacturing facility in Bang Pa-In, Thailand for
$95 million, plus the assumption of liabilities and other
costs of between $75 million and $80 million. The
Company funded the purchase of these assets through working
capital. For additional discussion on this acquisition, see
below, under the heading “Risk Factors That May Effect
Future Results.”

On August 22, 2003, the Company agreed to
settle its outstanding litigation with Cirrus. Under the terms
of the agreement, the Company will make a one-time payment to
Cirrus on or before October 17, 2003 of $45 million.
Western Digital had previously recorded an obligation totaling
approximately $26.5 million related to the disputed
payables. The difference of approximately $18.5 million
between the settlement amount and the amount previously recorded
was included in the cost of sales for the fourth quarter and
year ended June 27, 2003.

The Company anticipates that capital expenditures
in 2004 will be between $140 million to $160 million,
including between $70 million and $90 million relating
to the Company’s new head manufacturing operations.

On September 19, 2003, the Company entered
into a new $125 million five-year credit facility
(“Senior Credit Facility”) replacing the facility that
matured on September 20, 2003. The new Senior Credit
Facility provides up to $75 million in revolving credit and
a term loan of $50 million (subject to outstanding letters
of credit and a borrowing base calculation). Both the term loan
and revolving credit facility mature on September 19, 2008,
and are secured by the Company’s accounts receivable,
inventory, 65% of its stock in its foreign subsidiaries and
other assets. At the option of the Company, borrowings bear
interest at either LIBOR (with option periods of one to three
months) or a base rate, plus a margin. The Senior Credit
Facility requires the Company to maintain certain levels of
income, prohibits the payment of cash dividends on common stock,
and contains a number of other covenants. The $50 million term
loan was funded on September 22, 2003 and requires
quarterly principal payments of $3 million beginning in
October 2004. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the
term loan to repay obligations incurred as a result of the
Read-Rite asset acquisition. There were no borrowings under the
revolving credit facility. However, the Company has issued a
$25 million standby letter of credit under the facility to
Cirrus concerning the $26.5 million in disputed accounts
payable. As discussed in the Company’s Consolidated
Financial Statements, the Cirrus litigation has been settled and
upon payment of the settlement on or before October 17,
2003, the letter of credit will be released (refer to
Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, Note 5 “Legal Proceedings” included
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

The Company believes its current cash and cash
equivalents will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs
through the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that
the Senior Credit Facility will continue to be available to the
Company. Also, the Company’s ability to sustain its working
capital position is dependent upon a number of factors that are
discussed below under the headings “Risk Factors That May
Affect Future Results.”



Commitments

The following is a summary of the Company’s
significant contractual cash obligations and commercial
commitments at June 27, 2003:

Operating
Leases

The Company leases certain facilities and
equipment under long-term, non-cancelable operating leases which
expire at various dates through 2012. The following table
summarizes the future payments of these leases (in millions):

In connection with its acquisition of the assets
of Read-Rite in July 2003, the Company will assume
Read-Rite’s lease of an approximately 181,000 square foot
facility in Fremont, California that is used for wafer
fabrication. The lease expires in February 2008 with annual
rental payments of $1.9 million.

Purchase
Orders

In the normal course of business, to reduce the
risk of component shortages, the Company enters into purchase
commitments with suppliers for the purchase of hard drive
components used to manufacture the Company’s products.
These commitments generally cover forecasted component supplies
needed for production during the next quarter, become payable
upon receipt of the components and may be non-cancelable
(cancellation charges may be significant). The Company’s
relationship with suppliers allows for some flexibility within
these commitments and quantities are subject to change as a
quarter progresses and the Company’s needs change.

Forward Exchange
Contracts

Although the majority of the Company’s
transactions are in U.S. Dollars, some transactions are
based in various foreign currencies. The Company purchases
short-term, forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets,
liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product
costs denominated in foreign currencies. The Company does not
purchase short-term forward exchange contracts for trading
purposes. As of June 27, 2003, the Company had
$36 million outstanding of purchased foreign currency
forward exchange contracts. The contracts have maturity dates
that do not exceed three months. At June 27, 2003, the
carrying value of the contracts approximates fair value.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company has prepared the accompanying
consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. The
preparation of the financial statements requires the use of
judgment and estimates that affect the reported amounts of
revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities. The Company has
adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally
accepted in the industry in which it operates. The Company
believes the following are its most critical accounting policies
that affect significant areas and involve management’s
judgment and estimates. If these estimates differ materially
from actual results, the impact to the consolidated financial
statements may be material.



Revenue and
Accounts Receivable

In accordance with standard industry practice,
the Company has agreements with resellers that provide price
protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of
published list price reductions. In addition the Company may
have agreements with resellers that provide for stock rotation
on slow-moving items and other incentive programs. In accordance
with current accounting standards, the Company recognizes
revenue upon shipment or delivery to resellers and records a
reduction to revenue for estimated price protection and other
programs in effect until the resellers sell such inventory to
their customers. Adjustments are based on anticipated price
decreases during the reseller holding period, estimated amounts
to be reimbursed to qualifying customers, as well as historical
pricing information. If end-market demand for hard drives
declines significantly, the Company may have to increase
sell-through incentive payments to resellers, resulting in an
increase in price protection allowances, which could adversely
impact operating results.

The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful
accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing
the risk of loss based on insolvency, disputes or other
collection issues. In addition, the Company routinely analyzes
the different receivable aging categories and establishes
reserves based on the length of time receivables are past due.
If the financial condition of a significant customer
deteriorates resulting in their inability to pay their accounts
when due, an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts
would be required, which could negatively affect operating
results.

The Company records provisions against revenue
and cost of revenue for estimated sales returns in the same
period that the related revenue is recognized. The Company bases
these provisions on existing product return notifications as
well as historical returns by product type (see
“Warranty”). If actual sales returns exceed
expectations, an increase in the sales return provision would be
required, which could negatively affect operating results.

Warranty

The Company records an accrual for estimated
warranty costs when revenue is recognized. Warranty covers cost
of repair or replacement of the hard drive over the warranty
period, which ranges from one to five years. The Company has
comprehensive processes with which to estimate accruals for
warranty, which include specific detail on hard drives in the
field by product type, historical field return rates and costs
to repair. If actual product return rates or costs to repair
returned products increase above expectations, an increase in
the warranty provision would be required, which could negatively
affect operating results.

Inventory

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Inventory
write-downs are recorded for the valuation of inventory at the
lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market
conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to
inventory costs and inventory balances.

The Company evaluates inventory balances for
excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by
analyzing backlog, estimated demand, inventory on hand, sales
levels and other information. The Company writes down inventory
balances for excess and obsolete inventory based on the
analysis. Unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand
could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our
products, which may require an increase in inventory
write-downs, which could negatively affect operating results.

Litigation and
Other Contingencies

The Company applies Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for
Contingencies” (“SFAS 5”) to determine when
and how much to accrue for and disclose related to legal and
other contingencies. Accordingly, the Company accrues loss
contingencies when management, in consultation with its legal
advisors, concludes that a loss is probable and reasonably
estimable. (Refer to Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, Note 5 “Legal Proceedings”
included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

Deferred Tax
Assets

The Company’s deferred tax assets, which
consist primarily of net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards, are fully reserved due to management’s
determination that it is “more likely than not” that
these assets will not be realized. This determination is based
on the weight of available evidence, the most significant of
which is the Company’s loss



history in the related tax jurisdictions. Should
this determination change in the future, some amount of deferred
tax assets could be recognized, resulting in a tax benefit or a
reduction of future tax expense.

Risk Factors That May Affect Future
Results

Our operating results depend on optimizing
    time-to-market and time-to-volume, overall quality of new
    technologies and costs of new and established
    products.

To achieve consistent success with computer
manufacturer customers, we must balance four key attributes:
time-to-market, time-to-volume, quality and cost. If we fail to:

our operating results would be adversely affected.

Product life cycles require continuous
    technical innovation associated with higher areal
    densities.

New products may require higher areal densities
(the gigabyte of storage per disk) than previous product
generations, posing formidable technical challenges. Higher
areal densities require fewer heads and disks to achieve a given
drive capacity, which means that existing head technology must
be improved or new technology developed to accommodate more data
on a single disk. In addition, our introduction of new products
during a technology transition increases the likelihood of
unexpected quality concerns. Our failure to bring high quality
new products to market on time and at acceptable costs would put
us at a competitive disadvantage to companies that achieve these
results.

Increases in areal density may outpace
    customers’ demand for storage capacity.

The rate of increase in areal density may be
greater than the increase in our customers’ demand for
aggregate storage capacity. This could lead to our
customers’ storage capacity needs being satisfied with more
lower-cost single-surface drives, thereby decreasing our
revenue. As a result, even with increasing aggregate demand for
storage capacity, our ASP’s could decline, which could
adversely affect our results of operations.

Short product life cycles make it difficult to
    recover the cost of development.

Product life cycles have extended during the past
twelve months due to a decrease in the rate of hard drive areal
density growth. However, there can be no assurance that this
trend will continue. Historically, more rapid increases in areal
density resulted in shorter product life cycles, with each
generation of hard drives being more cost efficient than the
previous one. Shorter product life cycles makes it more
difficult to recover the cost of product development before the
product becomes obsolete. Although we believe that the current
rate of growth in areal density is lower than in the past
several years and will continue to decrease in the near term, we
expect that areal density will continue to increase. Our failure
to recover the cost of product development in the future could
adversely affect our operating results.

Increasing product life cycles may require us
    to reduce our costs to remain competitive.

Longer product life cycles have resulted from a
decrease in the rate of areal density growth in the past twelve
months. If longer product life cycles continue, we may need to
develop new technologies or programs, such as system-on-a-chip,
to reduce our costs on any particular product in order to
maintain competitive pricing for such product. This may



result in an increase in our overall expenses and
a decrease in our gross margins, both of which could adversely
affect our operating results.

If we fail to qualify our products with our
    customers, they may not purchase any units of a particular
    product line, which would have a significant adverse impact on
    our sales.

We regularly engage in new product qualification
with our customers. To be considered for qualification we must
be among the leaders in time-to-market with our new products.
Once a product is accepted for qualification testing, failures
or delays in the qualification process can result in our losing
sales to that customer until the next generation of products is
introduced. The effect of missing a product qualification
opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume
computer manufacturers, most of which continue to consolidate
their share of the PC market. If product life cycles continue to
be extended due to a decrease in the rate of areal density
growth, we may have a significantly longer period to wait before
we have an opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer,
which could harm our competitive position. These risks are
increased because we expect cost improvements and competitive
pressures to result in declining gross margins on our current
generation products.

Unexpected technology advances in the hard
    drive industry could harm our competitive position.

If one of our competitors were able to implement
a significant advance in head or disk drive technology that
enables a “step-change” increase in areal density that
permits greater storage of data on a disk, it could put us at a
competitive disadvantage and harm our operating results.

Advances in magnetic, optical, semiconductor or
other data storage technologies could result in competitive
products that have better performance or lower cost per unit of
capacity than our products. If these products prove to be
superior in performance or cost per unit of capacity, we could
be at a competitive disadvantage to the companies offering those
products.

The decline in ASP’s in the hard disk
    drive industry could adversely affect our operating
    results.

The hard disk drive industry has experienced
declining ASP’s in recent years. Although the rate of
decline has decreased in recent quarters, there can be no
assurance that this trend will continue. Increases in areal
density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and
disks for the same capacity, and therefore lower component cost.
Because of the competitiveness of the hard drive industry, lower
costs generally mean lower prices. This is true even for those
products that are competitive and introduced into the market in
a timely manner. Our ASP’s decline even further when
competitors lower prices as a result of decreased costs or to
absorb excess capacity, liquidate excess inventories,
restructure or attempt to gain market share. A continued decline
in ASP’s could cause our operating results to suffer.

The hard drive industry is highly competitive
    and characterized by rapid shifts in market share among the
    major competitors.

The price of hard drives has fallen over time due
to increases in supply, cost reductions, technological advances
and price reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess
inventories or attempting to gain market share. In addition,
rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and
profitability of sales of existing products and increase the
risk of inventory obsolescence. These factors, taken together,
result in significant and rapid shifts in market share among the
industry’s major participants. For example, during the
first quarter of 2000, the Company lost market share as a result
of a product recall. Similar losses in market share could
adversely affect our operating results.

Our prices and margins are subject to declines
    due to unpredictable end-user demand and oversupply of hard
    drives.

Demand for our hard drives depends on the demand
for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage
upgrades to existing systems. The demand for systems has been
volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on
the demand for hard drives in any given period. As a result, the
hard drive market has experienced periods of excess capacity,
which has led to intense price competition. During the middle of
2003, the industry experienced weak PC demand in the U.S. and
other markets due in part to general economic conditions
worldwide. If intense price competition occurs as a result of
weak demand, we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more
than expected, which could result in lower revenue and gross
margins.



Changes in the markets for hard drives require
    us to develop new products.

Over the past few years the consumer market for
desktop computers has shifted significantly towards lower priced
systems. According to data released by International Data
Corporation Tracker in December 2002, systems priced below $600
currently comprise the fastest growing segment of the consumer
market for desktop computers. Although we were late to market
with a value line hard drive to serve the low-cost PC market, we
are now offering such value line products at prices that we view
as competitive. However, if we are not able to continue to offer
a competitively priced value line hard drive for the low-cost PC
market, our share of that market will likely fall, which could
harm our operating results.

In addition, the PC market is fragmenting into a
variety of computing devices and products. Some of these
products may not contain a hard drive. On the other hand, many
industry analysts expect, as do we, that as communications are
increasingly converted to digital technology from the older,
analog technology, the technology of computers and consumer
electronics will continue to converge, and hard drives will be
found in many consumer products other than computers. For
example, several game console manufacturers have expressed
support for hard drives in their products. However, market
acceptance of the use of hard drives in game consoles remains in
its early stages. In addition, some consumer electronics, such
as PVRs and DVRs, may require attributes not currently offered
in our products, which may result in a need to expend capital,
increasing our overall operational expense. If we are not
successful in using our hard drive technology and expertise to
develop new products for the emerging consumer electronics
market, or if we are required to incur significant costs in
developing such products, it may harm our operating results.

If we do not successfully expand into new hard
    drive market segments, our business may suffer.

To remain a significant supplier of hard disk
drives, we will need to offer a broad range of disk drive
products to our customers. We currently offer a variety of
3.5-inch form factor hard disk drives for the desktop computer
market. However, demand for desktop hard drives may shift to
products in smaller form factors, which we do not currently
offer, but which some of our competitors offer. In addition, the
desktop PC industry is transitioning to higher speed interfaces
such as SATA to handle higher data transfer rates and 80 GB per
platter technology for increased capacity. The Company currently
offers SATA and 80 GB per platter products, however, the
transition of technology and the introduction of new products is
challenging and creates risks. While we continue to develop new
products and look to expand into non-desktop applications such
as consumer electronics and mobile products, the success of our
new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors,
including difficulties faced in manufacturing ramp, market
acceptance, effective management of inventory levels in line
with anticipated product demand, and the risk that our new
products will have quality problems or other defects in the
early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the
design of those products. If we fail to successfully develop and
manufacture new products, customers may decrease the amount of
our products that they purchase, and we may lose business to our
competitors who offer these products or who use their dominance
in the enterprise or mobile market to encourage sales of desktop
hard drives.

We depend on our key personnel and skilled
    employees.

Our success depends upon the continued
contributions of our key personnel and skilled employees, many
of whom would be extremely difficult to replace. Worldwide
competition for skilled employees in the hard drive industry is
intense. Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock
price may adversely affect our ability to retain key personnel
or skilled employees who have been granted stock options. If we
are unable to retain our existing key personnel or skilled
employees or hire and integrate new key personnel or skilled
employees, our operating results would likely be harmed.

Loss of market share with a key customer could
    harm our operating results.

A majority of our revenue comes from a few
customers. For example, during 2003, sales to our top 10
customers accounted for approximately 55% of revenue. These
customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and
therefore can make substantial demands on us. Even if we
successfully qualify a product with a customer, the customer
generally is not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of
products from us and is able to terminate its relationship with
us at any time. Our ability to maintain strong relationships
with our principal customers is essential to our future
performance. If we lose a key customer, or if any of our key
customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to
reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs, our
operating results would likely be harmed. For example, this
occurred with



our SCSI enterprise hard drive product line early
in the third quarter of 2000 and is one of the factors which led
to our decision to exit the SCSI enterprise hard drive market.

Dependence on a limited number of qualified
    suppliers of components could lead to delays, lost revenue or
    increased costs.

Because we depend on a limited number of
suppliers for certain hard drive components, an extended
shortage of required components or the failure of key suppliers
to remain in business, adjust to market conditions, or to meet
our quality, yield or production requirements could
significantly harm our operating results. A number of the
components used by us are available from only a single or
limited number of qualified outside suppliers, and there is
continued attrition and consolidation in our supplier base. In
June 2003, Read-Rite Corporation, one of our suppliers of heads,
commenced voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings. In
July 2003, we acquired the assets of Read-Rite in an effort to
increase our operational flexibility and ensure our access to
future head technologies. Although it is anticipated that our
acquisition will reduce our dependence on outside suppliers for
heads, we may not be able to supply all of our head needs, and,
therefore, we may still be required to purchase heads, as well
as other hard drive components, from outside sources. If a
component is in short supply, or a supplier fails to qualify or
has a quality issue with a component, we may experience delays
or increased costs in obtaining that component. In addition, if
a component becomes unavailable, we could suffer significant
loss of revenue. For example, we lost revenue in September 1999
when we had to shut down production of a product line for
approximately two weeks as a result of a faulty power driver
chip that was sole-sourced from a third party supplier.

To reduce the risk of component shortages, we
attempt to provide significant lead times when buying these
components. As a result, we may have to pay significant
cancellation charges to suppliers if we cancel orders, as we did
in 1998 when we accelerated our transition to giant
magnetoresistive head technology, and as we did in 2000 as a
result of our decision to exit the SCSI enterprise hard drive
market.

In some cases, not only are we dependent on a
limited number of suppliers, but we also have entered into
contractual commitments that require us to buy a substantial
number of components from certain suppliers. For example in
April 1999, we entered into a three-year volume purchase
agreement with Komag under which we buy a substantial portion of
our media components from Komag. In October 2001, we amended the
Komag volume purchase agreement to extend the initial term to
six years. Similarly, we have entered into contractual
commitments with both IBM and Marvell for the supply of our read
channel devices. In February 2001, we entered into a two-year
volume purchase agreement with IBM under which we buy a portion
of our read channel devices from IBM. Effective June 2002, we
amended the IBM volume purchase agreement to extend the initial
term through December 31, 2003. In addition, in June 2002,
we entered into a five-year volume purchase agreement with
Marvell under which we buy a portion of our read channel devices
from Marvell. These relationships have increased our dependence
on each of Komag, IBM and Marvell as a supplier. Our future
operating results may depend substantially on Komag’s
ability to timely qualify its media components in our new
development programs, and each of Komag’s, IBM’s and
Marvell’s ability to supply us with these components in
sufficient volume to meet our production requirements. A
significant disruption in Komag’s ability to manufacture
and supply us with media components or IBM’s or
Marvell’s ability to manufacture and supply us with read
channel devices could harm our operating results.

If we are unable to timely and cost
    effectively develop heads with leading technology, our ability
    to sell our products may be significantly diminished, which
    could materially and adversely affect our business and financial
    results.

As a result of our acquisition of the assets of
Read-Rite, we are developing and manufacturing heads for use in
the hard drives we manufacture. Consequently, we will be more
dependent upon our own development efforts and less able to take
advantage of head technologies developed by other head
manufacturers. In November 2002, Read-Rite announced that it had
achieved an areal density of 146 gigabits per square inch using
perpendicular recording technology. There can be no assurance,
however, that we will be successful in timely and cost
effectively developing and manufacturing heads for products
using perpendicular recording technology, or other future
technologies. We also may not achieve acceptable manufacturing
yields using such technologies necessary to satisfy our
customers’ product needs. In addition, we may not have
access to external sources of supply without incurring
substantial costs. If we fail to timely manufacture heads
containing leading technology, or if we are unable to achieve
acceptable manufacturing yields of heads, our ability to sell
our products may be adversely affected. Moreover, if we fail to
develop new technologies in a timely manner, and if our



competitors succeed in doing so or have access to
external sources of supply that incorporate such new
technologies, our business and financial results could suffer.

If we are unable to successfully integrate the
    assets of Read-Rite Corporation into our business in a timely
    manner, our business and financial results could be adversely
    affected.

In July 2003, we acquired the assets of Read-Rite
Corporation, formerly one of our suppliers of heads, and we are
in the process of integrating the acquired assets into our
company. We may not successfully address the integration
challenges in a timely manner, or at all. Integration requires
varying levels of management resources, which may divert our
attention from other business operations. It may be difficult
for us to successfully integrate the assets, products,
technologies or personnel of Read-Rite, which could materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

In connection with our acquisition of
    Read-Rite’s assets, we will experience additional costs and
    risks.

Our acquisition of Read-Rite’s assets
represents a fundamental change in our operating structure, as
we are now manufacturing heads for use in the hard drives we
manufacture. Due to the vertical integration of part of our
supply chain, we carry a higher percentage of fixed costs than
traditionally assumed in our overall business model. If the
overall level of production decreases for any reason, the
acquired assets may face under-utilization that may impact our
results of operations. We are therefore subject to additional
risks related to overall asset utilization, including:

•

the need to operate at high levels of utilization
    to drive competitive costs;

•

the greater need for predictability of quarterly
    production to ensure best utilization of assets to drive
    competitive costs; and

•

the need for assured supply of components,
    especially hard drive media, that is optimized to work with our
    heads.

Moreover, capital expenditures and working
capital investments required to operate Read-Rite’s assets
will utilize additional cash. For example, while the purchased
assets of Read-Rite, including intellectual property, head
designs, and manufacturing equipment, would indicate successful
internal qualification of a Western Digital-manufactured 80 GB
per platter giant magnetoresistive head, we expect significant
investment in research and development and investigation of new
recording technologies to extend recording technology will be
required. The Company expects its capital expenditures, viewed
as an average over several years, to increase by approximately
$70 million to $90 million to support the acquired
manufacturing operations of Read-Rite.

In addition, we may incur additional costs,
expenses and risks, including:



•

we could incur substantial costs, including clean
    up costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as a result of
    violations of or liabilities under environmental laws applicable
    to our new Fremont, California facility, including those
    governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water.

If we do not adequately address the challenges
related to the acquisition, our ongoing operations could be
disrupted, resulting in a decrease in our revenue or profit
margins, and negatively impacting our operating results.

To develop new products we must maintain
    effective partner relationships with our strategic component
    suppliers.

Under our business model, we do not manufacture
any of the component parts used in our hard drives, other than
heads as a result of our recent acquisition of the assets of
Read-Rite. As a result, the success of our products depends on
our ability to gain access to and integrate parts that are
“best in class” from reliable component suppliers. To
do so we must effectively manage our relationships with our
strategic component suppliers. We must also effectively
integrate different products from a variety of suppliers, each
of which employs variations on technology, which can impact, for
example, feasible combinations of heads and media components.
Until recently, we were engaged in litigation with Cirrus, a
supplier who previously was the sole source of read channel
devices for our hard drives. We settled this litigation in
August 2003. As a result of the disputes that gave rise to the
litigation, our business operations were at risk until another
supplier’s read channel devices could be designed into our
products. Similar disputes with other strategic component
suppliers could adversely affect our operating results.

Some of our customers have adopted a
    subcontractor model that increases our credit risk and could
    result in an increase in our operating costs.

Some of our OEM customers have adopted a
subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with
companies that provide manufacturing services to our OEM
customers. Because these subcontractors are generally not as
well capitalized as our direct OEM customers, this subcontractor
model exposes us to increased credit risks. Our agreements with
our OEM customers may not permit us to increase our product
prices to alleviate this increased credit risk. Any credit
losses we may suffer as a result of this increased risk would
increase our operating costs, which may negatively impact our
operating results.

We have only two high-volume hard-drive
    manufacturing facilities and two head manufacturing facilities,
    which subjects us to the risk of damage or loss of any of these
    facilities.

The majority of our hard drive manufacturing
volume comes from one facility in Malaysia. During 2002, we
acquired a second, smaller manufacturing facility in Thailand.
In addition, following our acquisition of the assets of
Read-Rite in July 2003, we are operating a wafer fabrication
facility in Fremont, California and a slider fabrication
facility in Thailand. A fire, flood, earthquake or other
disaster, condition or event that adversely affects any of these
facilities or our ability to manufacture could result in a loss
of sales and revenue and harm our operating results.

Terrorist attacks may adversely affect our
    business and operating results.

The terrorist attacks on the United States on
September 11, 2001, the United States-led military response
to counter terrorism and the continued threat of terrorist
activity and other acts of war or hostility have created
uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have
significantly increased the political, economic and social
instability in some of the geographic areas in which the Company
operates. Further acts of terrorism, either domestically or
abroad, could create further uncertainties and instability. To
the extent this results in disruption or delays of our
manufacturing capabilities or shipments of our products, our
business, operating results and financial condition could be
adversely affected.

Manufacturing our products abroad subjects us
    to numerous risks.

We are subject to risks associated with our
foreign manufacturing operations, including:

•

obtaining requisite United States and foreign
    governmental permits and approvals;

•

currency exchange rate fluctuations or
    restrictions;

•

political instability and civil unrest;



We have attempted to manage the impact of foreign
currency exchange rate changes by, among other things, entering
into short-term, forward exchange contracts. However, those
contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by
the issuer if currency controls are put in place, which occurred
in Malaysia during the first quarter of 1999. As a result of the
Malaysian currency controls, we are no longer hedging the
Malaysian currency risk. Currently, we hedge the Euro, Thai Baht
and British Pound Sterling.

The nature of our business and our reliance on
    intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects
    us to the risk of significant litigation.

The hard drive industry has been characterized by
significant litigation. This includes litigation relating to
patent and other intellectual property rights, product liability
claims and other types of litigation. Litigation can be
expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business
operations. Moreover, the results of litigation are inherently
uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions. We may
enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We are currently evaluating notices of alleged
patent infringement or notices of patents from patent holders.
We also are a party to several judicial and other proceedings
relating to patent and other intellectual property rights. If
claims or actions are asserted against us, we may be required to
obtain a license or cross-license, modify our existing
technology or design a new non-infringing technology. Such
licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly. We may
also be liable for any past infringement. If there is an adverse
ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit, an injunction
could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing
product. It could also result in a damage award equal to a
reasonable royalty or lost profits or, if there is a finding of
willful infringement, treble damages. Any of these results would
likely increase our costs and harm our operating results.

Our reliance on intellectual property and
    other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these
    key ingredients of our business could be copied by
    competitors.

Our success depends, in significant part, on the
proprietary nature of our technology, including non-patentable
intellectual property such as our process technology. Despite
safeguards, to the extent that a competitor is able to reproduce
or otherwise capitalize on our technology, it may be difficult,
expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal
protection. Also, the laws of some foreign countries may not
protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the
laws of the United States. In addition to patent protection of
intellectual property rights, we consider elements of our
product designs and processes to be proprietary and
confidential. We rely upon employee, consultant and vendor
non-disclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a
system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary
information. However, any of our registered or unregistered
intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by
others in the industry, which might harm our operating results.

We are subject to risks related to product
    defect, which could subject us to warranty claims in excess of
    our warranty provisions or which are greater than anticipated
    due to the unenforceability of liability limitations.

We generally warrant our products for one to five
years. The standard warranties used by us contain limits on
damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages
and for negligent or improper use of the products. We record an
accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is
recognized. We may incur additional operating expenses if our
warranty provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving
issues related to defects in our products. If these additional
expenses are significant, it could adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.



Inaccurate
projections of demand for our product can cause large
fluctuations in our quarterly results.

We often book and ship a high percentage (at
times in excess of 50%) of our total quarterly sales in the
third month of the quarter, which makes it difficult for us to
forecast our financial results prior to the end of the quarter.
In addition, our quarterly projections and results may be
subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of
other factors including:

Rapidly
changing market conditions in the hard drive industry make it
difficult to estimate actual results.

We have made and continue to make a number of
estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial
reporting. The rapidly changing market conditions with which we
deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our
estimates and assumptions. Key estimates and assumptions for us
include:

The
market price of our common stock is volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been,
and may continue to be, extremely volatile. Factors such as the
following may significantly affect the market price of our
common stock:



•

conditions and trends in the hard drive, data and
    content management, storage and communication industries; and

•

changes in financial estimates by securities
    analysts relating specifically to us or the hard drive industry
    in general.

In addition, general economic conditions may
cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume
fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the
stock prices of many high technology companies. These
fluctuations often appear to be unrelated to the operating
performance of the companies.

Securities class action lawsuits are often
brought against companies after periods of volatility in the
market price of their securities. A number of such suits have
been filed against us in the past, and should any new lawsuits
be filed, such matters could result in substantial costs and a
diversion of resources and management’s attention.

We may be unable to raise future capital
    through debt or equity financing.

Due to the risks described herein, in the future
we may be unable to maintain adequate financial resources for
capital expenditures, expansion or acquisition activity, working
capital and research and development. We have a credit facility,
which matures on September 19, 2008. If we decide to
increase or accelerate our capital expenditures or research and
development efforts, or if results of operations do not meet our
expectations, we could require additional debt or equity
financing. However, we cannot ensure that additional financing
will be available to us or available on acceptable terms. An
equity financing could also be dilutive to our existing
stockholders.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Disclosure About Foreign Currency
Risk

Although the majority of the Company’s
transactions are in U.S. Dollars, some transactions are
based in various foreign currencies. The Company purchases
short-term, forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets,
liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product
costs denominated in foreign currencies. The purpose of entering
into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations on the results of operations. The
resulting impact from these hedge contracts is to offset a
majority of the currency gains and losses in the Company’s
local currency operating expenses. The contract maturity dates
do not exceed three months. The Company does not purchase
short-term forward exchange contracts for trading purposes.
Currently, the Company focuses on hedging its foreign currency
risk related to the Thai Baht, British Pound Sterling and the
Euro.

As of June 27, 2003, the Company had
outstanding the following purchased foreign currency forward
exchange contracts (in millions, except weighted average
contract rate):

In 2003, 2002 and 2001, total realized
transaction and forward exchange contract currency gains and
losses were not material to the consolidated financial
statements. Based on historical experience, the Company does not
expect that a significant change in foreign exchange rates would
materially affect the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

Disclosure About Other Market Risks

Fixed Interest Rate Risk

During 2003, the Company redeemed its remaining
outstanding 5.25% zero coupon convertible subordinated
debentures due February 18, 2018 (the
“Debentures”) and paid $88 million in cash and
issued approximately 0.1 million shares of common stock.
The aggregate principal amount at maturity was $194 million.



Variable Interest Rate Risk

At the option of the Company, borrowings under
the Senior Credit Facility would bear interest at either LIBOR
(with option periods of one to three months) or a base rate,
plus a margin determined by the borrowing base. This is the only
Company borrowing facility which does not have a fixed-rate of
interest. At June 27, 2003, there were no borrowings
outstanding under the Facility.

Fair Value Risk

During 2003, the Company sold all of its
remaining shares of Vixel Corporation common stock resulting in
a gain of $3.4 million.

Statement Schedule



INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’
REPORT

The Board of Directors

Western Digital Corporation:

We have audited the consolidated financial
statements of Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries as
listed in the accompanying index. In connection with our audits
of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited
the financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying
index. These consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and the financial statement
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Western Digital Corporation
and subsidiaries as of June 27, 2003 and June 28,
2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended
June 27, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion,
the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed its method of revenue
recognition with respect to certain sales commencing on
July 1, 2000 in order to conform with SEC Accounting
Bulletin No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements.”

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.

Organization and Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies

Western Digital Corporation (“Western
Digital” or the “Company”) has prepared its
consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States and has
adopted accounting policies and practices which are generally
accepted in the industry in which it operates. Following are the
Company’s significant accounting policies:

Fiscal Year

The Company has a 52 or 53-week fiscal year. The
2003, 2002 and 2001 fiscal years ended on June 27, 28 and
29 respectively, and consisted of 52 weeks each. All general
references to years relate to fiscal years unless otherwise
noted.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. The accounts of foreign
subsidiaries have been remeasured using the U.S. dollar as
the functional currency. As such, foreign exchange gains or
losses resulting from remeasurement of these accounts are
reflected in the results of operations. These foreign exchange
gains and losses were immaterial to the consolidated financial
statements. Monetary and nonmonetary asset and liability
accounts have been remeasured using the exchange rate in effect
at each year end and using historical rates, respectively.
Income statement accounts have been remeasured using average
monthly exchange rates.

Cash Equivalents

The Company’s cash equivalents represent
highly liquid investments, primarily money market funds and
commercial paper, with original maturities of three months or
less.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company designs, develops, manufactures and
markets hard drives to personal computer manufacturers,
resellers and retailers throughout the world. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’
financial condition and generally requires no collateral. The
Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses, and such
losses have historically been within management’s
expectations. At June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002, the
Company had reserves for potential credit losses of
$5.2 million and $7.6 million, respectively. The
Company also has cash equivalent policies that limit the amount
of credit exposure to any one financial institution or
investment instrument, and require that investments be made only
with financial institutions or in investment instruments
evaluated as highly credit-worthy.

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or
net realizable value. Cost is on a first-in, first-out basis for
raw materials and is computed on a currently adjusted standard
basis (which approximates first-in, first-out) for work in
process and finished goods.

Property and Equipment

The cost of property and equipment is depreciated
over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The
majority of the Company’s property and equipment is being
depreciated over three years. Depreciation is computed on a
straight-line basis. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the
related lease terms.



WESTERN DIGITAL
CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenue Recognition

The Company adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin
101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements”
(“SAB 101”), during its quarter ended
June 29, 2001. SAB 101 extends the point at which
revenue is recognized to include the transfer of the risks of
ownership. Generally, this occurs at the time of shipment for
the Company’s original equipment manufacturer
(“OEM”) customers, and at the time of delivery for its
reseller customers. Accordingly, the Company changed its revenue
recognition policy effective July 1, 2000 to recognize
revenue on certain product shipments upon delivery rather than
shipment. The accounting change resulted in a net increase to
revenue for 2001 of $13.1 million, of which $16.9 million
had previously been recorded in 2000. The cumulative effect on
the 2001 net loss of this accounting change was
$1.5 million.

In accordance with standard industry practice,
the Company’s agreements with certain resellers (including
distributors and retailers) provide price protection for
inventories held by the resellers at the time of published list
price reductions and, under certain circumstances, stock
rotation for slow-moving items. Either party may terminate these
agreements upon written notice. In the event of termination, the
Company may be obligated to repurchase a certain portion of the
resellers’ inventory. The Company recognizes revenue at the
time of delivery to resellers and accrues for estimated pricing
adjustments and sales returns. Net revenue recognized on sales
to resellers was approximately $1.3 billion,
$1.0 billion and $1.0 billion for 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Repurchases of reseller inventory were not
material in 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Warranty

The Company records an accrual for estimated
warranty costs as products are sold. Warranty covers cost of
repair or replacement of the hard drive during the warranty
period, which ranges from one to five years and is recorded in
the accompanying balance sheet as current or long term based
upon when the expenditure is expected to occur. The Company has
comprehensive processes with which to estimate accruals for
warranty, which include specific detail on hard drives in the
field by product type, historical field return rates and costs
to repair. Although the Company believes that it has the
continued ability to reasonably estimate warranty reserves,
unforeseeable changes in factors used to estimate the accrual
for warranty could occur. These unforeseeable changes could
cause a material change in the Company’s warranty accrual
estimate. Such a change would be recorded in the period in which
the change was identified.

Advertising Expense

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Selling, general and administrative expenses of the Company
include advertising costs of $3.4 million, $6.0 million and
$7.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the
liability method, which provides that deferred tax assets and
liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the
financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the
Company’s assets and liabilities and expected benefits of
utilizing net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards.
The Company records a valuation allowance where it is “more
likely than not” that the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates
and laws, if any, are applied to the years during which
temporary differences are expected to be settled and reflected
in the consolidated financial statements in the period of
enactment (see Note 10).

Per Share Information

The Company computes basic income (loss) per
share using the net income (loss) and the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
income (loss) per share is computed using the net income (loss)
and the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive
potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive
potential common shares include outstanding employee stock
options, employee stock purchase plan shares and restricted
stock awards.

CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

For the years ended June 27, 2003,
June 28, 2002 and June 29, 2001, 19.9 million,
24.7 million and 23.3 million shares, respectively,
relating to the possible exercise of outstanding stock options
were not included in the computation of diluted income (loss)
per share. Also, for the years ended June 28, 2002 and
June 29, 2001, an additional 2.9 million and
4.0 million shares, respectively, issuable upon conversion
of the convertible debentures were excluded from the computation
of diluted income (loss) per share. The effects of these items
were not included in the computation of diluted income (loss)
per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

Stock-Based
Compensation

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), establishes the
financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based
compensation plans. As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company
elected to continue accounting for stock-based employee
compensation plans in accordance with Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” and related interpretations (“APB Opinion
No. 25”) and to follow the pro forma net income
(loss), pro forma earnings (loss) per share, and stock-based
compensation plan disclosure requirements set forth in
SFAS 123. The following table sets forth the computation of
basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for each of the past
three fiscal years and illustrates the effect on net income
(loss) and earnings (loss) per share as if the Company had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123
to stock-based employee compensation.

The pro forma earnings (loss) per share
information is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model. The Black Scholes model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. This model also
requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including
the expected stock price volatility and expected period until
options are exercised (see Note 6 for additional
information on fair value disclosures). The pro forma impact of
applying SFAS 123 at June 27, 2003 is not necessarily
representative of future periods.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents
approximates fair value for all periods presented because of the
short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying
amounts of all other financial instruments in the consolidated
balance sheets approximate fair values.

Other
Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to
revenue, expenses, gains and losses that are recorded as an
element of shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net
income (loss). The Company’s other comprehensive income
(loss) is comprised of unrealized gains and losses on marketable
securities categorized as “available for sale” under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115
“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities” (“SFAS 115”).

Foreign
Exchange Contracts

Although the majority of the Company’s
transactions are in U.S. Dollars, some transactions are
based in various foreign currencies. The Company purchases
short-term, forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets,
liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product
costs denominated in foreign currencies. The purpose of entering
into these hedge contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign
currency fluctuations on operations. The resulting impact from
these hedge contracts is to offset a majority of the currency
gains and losses in the Company’s local currency operating
expenses. The contracts have maturity dates that do not exceed
three months. The Company does not purchase short-term forward
exchange contracts for trading purposes.

The Company applies the provisions of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“SFAS 133”), as amended by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, “Accounting
for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”
and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities.” SFAS 133, as amended, establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. The
Company had outstanding forward exchange contracts with
commercial banks for the Thai Baht, British Pound Sterling and
Euro with values of $35.8 million and $5.0 million at
June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002, respectively. Any
changes in fair value on these contracts were recorded through
the results of operations for the years ended June 27, 2003
and June 28, 2002.

Use
of Estimates

Company management has made estimates and
assumptions relating to the reporting of certain assets and
liabilities in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. These estimates and assumptions have been applied
using methodologies which are consistent throughout the periods
presented. However, actual results could differ from these
estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior years’ amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

2.     Supplemental Financial Statement
Data (in millions)

(1)

During the fourth quarter of 2001, as a result of
    Komag’s public announcement regarding its intention not to
    pay certain debt and interest amounts when due, and due to the
    market value trend of its common stock, the carrying amount of
    the equity investment in Komag was determined to have suffered
    an “other than temporary” decline in market value.
    Accordingly, the Company recorded nonoperating charges totaling
    $52.4 million to adjust the carrying values of equity
    investments in and notes receivable from Komag and to accrue for
    the contingent guarantees of the Komag equipment and facility
    leases. On August 24, 2001, Komag announced its voluntary
    Chapter 11 reorganization filing. During 2002, the Company
    sold its creditor position and remaining investments in Komag to
    an unrelated party for $9.0 million.

3.     Convertible Debentures and Line
of Credit

Convertible
Debentures

During 2003, the Company redeemed its remaining
outstanding 5.25% zero coupon convertible subordinated
debentures due February 18, 2018 (the
“Debentures”) and paid $88.3 million in cash and
issued approximately 0.1 million shares of common stock.
The book value of the redeemed Debentures was
$88.6 million, and the aggregate principal amount at
maturity was $193.5 million. During 2002, the Company paid
$17.6 million in cash and issued 2.6 million shares of
common stock in exchange for Debentures with a book value of
$31.6 million and an aggregate principal amount at maturity
of $72.4 million. During 2001, the Company issued
16.0 million shares of common stock in exchange for
Debentures with a book value of $120.3 million and an
aggregate principal amount at maturity of $295.7 million.
These redemptions were private, individually negotiated
transactions with certain institutional investors

and resulted in a loss of $0.1 million
during 2002 and gain of $22.4 million during 2001. The net
loss of the redeemed Debentures was not material in 2003.

On June 29, 2002, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145,
“Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64,
Amendment of FASB Statement 13, and Technical
Corrections” (“SFAS 145”). As a result, the
loss of $0.1 million in 2002 and the gain of
$22.4 million in 2001 from the redemption of debentures
were reclassified as other income (expense) instead of
extraordinary items.

Debenture issuance costs were included in other
assets and amortized over the term of the Debentures. During
2002 and 2001, approximately $0.4 million and
$2.4 million, respectively, of unamortized issuance costs
were included with the loss or gain in connection with the
redemptions. As of June 27, 2003 the balance of unamortized
Debenture issuance costs was zero.

Line
of Credit

On September 19, 2003, the Company entered
into a new $125 million five-year credit facility
(“Senior Credit Facility”) replacing the facility that
matured on September 20, 2003. The new Senior Credit
Facility provides up to $75 million in revolving credit and
a term loan of $50 million (subject to outstanding letters
of credit and a borrowing base calculation). Both the term loan
and revolving credit facility mature on September 19, 2008,
and are secured by the Company’s accounts receivable,
inventory, 65% of its stock in its foreign subsidiaries and
other assets. At the option of the Company, borrowings bear
interest at either LIBOR (with option periods of one to three
months) or a base rate, plus a margin. The Senior Credit
Facility requires the Company to maintain certain levels of
income, prohibits the payment of cash dividends on common stock,
and contains a number of other covenants. The $50 million
term loan was funded on September 22, 2003 and requires
quarterly principal payments of $3.1 million beginning in
October 2004. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the
term loan to repay obligations incurred as a result of the
Read-Rite asset acquisition (see Note 11). At June 27,
2003 there were no borrowings under the revolving credit
facility. However, the Company has issued a $25 million
standby letter of credit under the facility to Cirrus Logic,
Inc. (“Cirrus”) concerning the $26.5 million in
disputed accounts payable. As discussed in Note 5, the
Cirrus litigation has been settled and upon payment of the
settlement on or before October 17, 2003, the letter of
credit will be released.

Contingencies

Operating
Lease Commitments

The Company leases certain facilities and
equipment under long-term, non-cancelable operating leases which
expire at various dates through 2012. Rental expense under these
leases, including month-to-month rentals, was
$11.4 million, $11.7 million and $15.4 million in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Future minimum rental payments under
non-cancelable operating leases as of June 27, 2003 are as

Warranty Liability

The Company records a provision for estimated
warranty costs as products are sold to cover the cost of repair
or replacement of the hard drive during the warranty period.
This provision is based on estimated future returns within the
warranty period and costs to repair, using historical field
return rates by product type and current average repair cost.

5.     Legal Proceedings

In June 1994, Papst Licensing (“Papst”)
brought suit against the Company in the United States District
Court for the Central District of California, alleging
infringement by the Company of five disk drive motor patents
owned by Papst. In December 1994, Papst dismissed its case
without prejudice. In July 2002, Papst filed a new complaint
against the Company and several other defendants. The suit
alleges infringement by the Company of seventeen of Papst’s
patents related to disk drive motors that the Company purchased
from motor vendors. Papst is seeking an injunction and damages.
The Company filed an answer on September 4, 2002, denying
Papst’s complaint. On December 11, 2002, the lawsuit
was transferred to the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Louisiana and included in the consolidated
pre-trial proceedings occurring there. The lawsuit was stayed
pending the outcome of certain other related litigation. A
potential loss, if any, cannot presently be reasonably
estimated. The Company intends to vigorously defend the suit.

On July 5, 2001, the Company’s Western
Digital Technologies, Inc. subsidiary (“WDT”) and its
Malaysian subsidiary (“WDM”) filed suit (the
“complaint”) against Cirrus for breach of contract and
other claims resulting from Cirrus’ role as a strategic
supplier of read channel devices for the Company’s hard
disk drives. WDM also stopped making payments to Cirrus for past
deliveries of devices and terminated all outstanding purchase
orders from Cirrus for such devices. The complaint alleges that
Cirrus’ unlawful conduct caused damages in excess of any
amounts alleged to be owing on outstanding invoices or arising
out of any alleged breach of the outstanding purchase orders. On
August 20, 2001, Cirrus filed an answer and cross-complaint
denying the allegations contained in the complaint and asserting
counterclaims against the plaintiffs for, among other things,
the amount of the outstanding invoices and the plaintiffs’
alleged breach of the outstanding purchase orders. The disputed
payable, which is included in the Company’s balance sheet
in accounts payable, is approximately $27 million. Cirrus
claims that the canceled purchase orders, which are not
reflected in the Company’s financial statements, total
approximately $26 million. On November 2, 2001, Cirrus
filed Applications for Right to Attach Orders and for Writs of
Attachment against WDT and WDM in the amount of
$25.2 million as security for the approximately
$27 million allegedly owed for read-channel devices
purchased from Cirrus that is disputed by WDT and WDM. On
December 20, 2001, the Court granted Cirrus’
Applications. Pursuant to agreement with Cirrus, the Company
posted a letter of credit in the amount of $25.2 million in
satisfaction of the Writs of Attachment.

On November 26, 2002, WDT and WDM filed a
motion for summary adjudication as to Cirrus’ second and
third causes of action. The parties fully briefed the motion,
which was scheduled to be heard on December 24, 2002. On
December 24, 2002, the Court continued the summary judgment
motion until February 4, 2003, and then, on
February 4, 2003, further continued the motion until
April 1, 2003, to allow Cirrus to conduct additional
discovery. On December 3, 2002, Cirrus filed a motion for
summary adjudication as to WDT and WDM’s first, second,
third, fourth, fifth, and seventh causes of action. The parties
fully briefed the motion, which was scheduled to be heard on
December 31, 2002. On December 31, 2002, after hearing
arguments from both sides, the Court granted Cirrus’ motion



WESTERN DIGITAL
CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

as to the first, second, fourth, fifth and
seventh causes of action, and denied Cirrus’ motion as to
the third cause of action. On January 30, 2003, Cirrus
filed another motion for summary adjudication as to the third
cause of action. The parties completed briefing on the motion
and the motion was scheduled to be heard on April 15, 2003.

On March 4, 2003, WDT filed a motion for
leave to amend its second amended complaint, seeking to add
causes of action for intentional and fraudulent
misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation. The Court
granted WDT’s motion on March 25, 2003. On
March 18, 2003, WDT filed a motion to continue the trial
date from May 19, 2003. On April 8, 2003, the Court
granted Western Digital’s motion and moved the trial date
to December 1, 2003. As a result, of its ruling to continue
the trial date, the Court continued the mandatory settlement
conference originally scheduled for April 25, 2003, and
continued indefinitely the hearings on WDT’s motion for
summary judgment and Cirrus’ motion for summary judgment
originally scheduled for April 1, 2003 and April 15,
2003, respectively. The Court also moved the discovery cutoff
date from April 18, 2003 to September 2003.

On April 22, 2003, Cirrus filed a demurrer
to WDT’s claims for promissory estoppel, intentional and
fraudulent misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation.
The Court scheduled a hearing on the demurrer for May 13,
2003. On May 13, 2003, the Court referred the case to the
panel on complex litigation for a determination as to whether
the case should be regarded as complex. The Court also continued
indefinitely the hearing on Cirrus’ demurrer to WDT’s
claims for promissory estoppel, intentional and fraudulent
misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation, which had
been scheduled for that day. On June 13, 2003 the complex
litigation panel accepted the case. The case was assigned to a
new judge who vacated all hearing dates that had previously been
set.

In July 2003, the parties agreed to attempt to
resolve their claims through mediation, and scheduled a
mediation for August 22, 2003. On August 22, 2003, the
Company and Cirrus reached a settlement of this litigation.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will make a
one-time payment to Cirrus on or before October 17, 2003 of
$45 million in exchange for a mutual release of claims. The
letter of credit previously posted by the Company will also be
released. Western Digital had previously recorded an obligation
totaling approximately $26.5 million related to the
disputed payables. The difference of approximately
$18.5 million between the settlement amount and the amount
previously recorded was included in the cost of sales for the
fourth quarter and year ended June 27, 2003. The Company
expects that formal dismissals of claims will be entered with
the Court in this matter in the near future.

In the normal course of business, the Company is
subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims.
Although the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or
financial impact with respect to these matters is subject to
many uncertainties and is therefore not predictable with
assurance, management believes that any monetary liability or
financial impact to the Company from these matters, individually
and in the aggregate, beyond that provided at June 27,
2003, would not be material to the Company’s financial
condition. However, there can be no assurance with respect to
such result and results could differ materially from those
projected.

6.     Shareholders’
Equity

Equity
Facility

During 2001, the Company issued 23.5 million
shares of common stock under an equity facility for net cash
proceeds of approximately $110.5 million. Under shelf
registrations (the “equity facility”) previously in
effect with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”), the Company issued shares of common stock to
institutional investors for cash. Shares sold under the equity
facility were at the market price of the Company’s common
stock less a discount ranging from 2.75% to 4.25%. During 2002,
the Company withdrew these shelf registrations.

Stock
Reserved for Issuance

The following table summarizes all shares of
common stock reserved for issuance at June 27, 2003 (in
millions):

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has an employee stock purchase plan
(“ESPP”) that operates in accordance with
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code whereby eligible
employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their
salary to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at
85% of the fair market value of common stock on the date of
grant or the exercise date, whichever is less. Approximately
3.5 million shares of common stock remain reserved for
issuance under this plan. Approximately 2.1 million,
1.3 million and 1.2 million shares were issued under
this plan during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Stock Option Plans

Western Digital’s Employee Stock Option Plan
(“Employee Plan”) is administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors (“Compensation
Committee”), which determines the vesting provisions, the
form of payment for the shares and all other terms of the
options. Terms of the Employee Plan require that the exercise
price of options be not less than the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of grant. Options granted generally
vest 25% one year from the date of grant and in twelve quarterly
increments thereafter and have a ten-year term. As of
June 27, 2003, options to purchase 7.7 million shares
of common stock were exercisable and 6.5 million shares
were available for grant under this plan. Pursuant to the terms
of the Employee Plan, participants are permitted to utilize
previously purchased common stock as consideration to purchase
additional common stock upon exercise of options or to exercise
on a cashless basis through the Company designated broker.

The Company has a Broad-Based Stock Incentive
Plan (the “Broad-Based Plan”) under which options to
purchase shares of common stock and stock awards may be granted
to employees of the Company and others. This plan is intended to
qualify as “broadly-based” under the New York Stock
Exchange shareholder approval policy. The Compensation Committee
determines the vesting provisions and other terms of the options
and stock. To date, the options granted vest either one year,
two years or four years from the date of grant. As of
June 27, 2003, options to purchase 4.7 million shares
of common stock were exercisable and 1.5 million shares
were available for grant as options or stock awards, under this
plan.

Under the Broad-Based Plan, the Company issued to
certain employees 0.2 million (net of cancellations) and
1.3 million shares of restricted stock during 2002 and
2001, respectively. The stock vests on the second and third
anniversary dates of the grant provided that the recipient is
still employed by the Company. The aggregate market value (net
of cancellations) of the restricted stock at the dates of
issuance was $1.1 million and $4.4 million for 2002
and 2001, respectively. These amounts have been recorded as
deferred compensation, a separate component of
shareholders’ equity, and are being amortized over the
three-year vesting period. No restricted stock was issued during
fiscal year 2003.

The Company has a Stock Option Plan for
Non-Employee Directors (“Director Plan”) and has
reserved 2.6 million shares for issuance thereunder. The
Director Plan provides for initial option grants to new
directors of 75,000 shares per director and additional
grants of options to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock
per director each year upon their reelection as a director at
the annual shareholders’ meeting. Terms of the Director
Plan require that options have a ten-year term and that the
exercise price of options be not less than the fair market value
at the date of grant. Options granted

generally vest 25% one year from the date of
grant and in twelve quarterly increments thereafter and have a
ten-year term. As of June 27, 2003, options to purchase
0.5 million shares of common stock were exercisable and
0.8 million shares were available for grant under this plan.

The following table summarizes activity under the
Employee, Broad-Based and Director Plans (in millions, except
per share amounts):

Fair Value Disclosures

Pro forma information regarding net income (loss)
and earnings (loss) per share is required by SFAS 123. This
information is required to be determined as if the Company had
accounted for its stock options (including shares issued under
the Stock Option Plans and the ESPP, collectively called
“options”) granted subsequent to July 1, 1995,
under the

fair value method of that statement (see
Note 1 for further information on pro forma net income
(loss) and earnings (loss) per share).

The fair value of options granted in 2003, 2002
and 2001 reported below has been estimated at the date of grant
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions:

The following is a summary of the per share
weighted average fair value of stock options granted in the
years listed below:

Stock Purchase Rights

In 1989, the Company implemented a plan to
protect shareholders’ rights in the event of a proposed
takeover of the Company. Under the plan, each share of the
Company’s outstanding common stock carried one Right to
Purchase Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the
“Right”). The Right enabled the holder, under certain
circumstances, to purchase common stock of Western Digital or of
an acquiring company at a substantially discounted price ten
days after a person or group publicly announces it has acquired
or has tendered an offer for 15% or more of the Company’s
outstanding common stock. On September 10, 1998 the
Company’s Board of Directors approved the adoption of a new
Rights plan to replace the previous plan, which expired in
September 1998. The Rights under the 1998 plan were similar to
the rights under the 1989 plan except they were redeemable by
the Company at $.01 per Right and expired in 2008. In connection
with the establishment of a holding company structure on
April 6, 2001, the Company terminated the Rights under the
1998 plan and adopted a new Rights plan. The 2001 plan is
similar to the terminated 1998 plan, except that the exercise
price was reduced from $150.00 to $50.00 per share, and the
expiration date for the 2001 Rights plan was extended to April
2011.

Note
7.     Savings and Profit Sharing
Plan

Effective July 1, 1991, the Company adopted
a Savings and Profit Sharing Plan, the Western Digital
Corporation Retirement Savings and Profit Sharing Plan (the
“Plan”). The Plan includes an employee 401(k) plan.
The Plan covers substantially all domestic employees, subject to
certain eligibility requirements. The Company may make annual
contributions to the 401(k) plan at the discretion of the Board
of Directors. For 2003, 2002 and 2001 the Company made
contributions to the 401(k) plan of $1.8 million,
$1.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively.

distributors. General and corporate expenses of
$47.8 million, $47.1 million and $50.0 million in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, have been excluded in
determining operating income (loss) by geographic region. Asia

respectively and sales to Hewlett-Packard (including sales to
Compaq Computer prior to its merger with Hewlett-Packard in
2002) accounted for 13% of the Company’s revenue in both
years. During 2001, sales to Dell Computer accounted for 16% of
the Company’s revenue and sales to Compaq Computer
accounted for 12% of the Company’s revenue.

Note 9.

Discontinued
    Operations

The Company acquired Connex, Inc.
(“Connex”), a storage systems and solutions startup,
in 1999. SANavigator, Inc. (“SANavigator”) was formed
as a subsidiary of Connex in 2001 and developed and marketed
storage area network management software.

During 2000, the Company formed Keen Personal
Media, Inc. (“Keen PM”), to develop and sell
interactive personal video recorder and set-top box software,
services and hardware for broadband television content
management and commerce.

In 2002, the Company discontinued Connex,
SANavigator and Keen. The disposals have been accounted for as
discontinued operations and, accordingly, the consolidated
financial statements for all periods presented have been
reclassified. In August 2001, substantially all of the operating
assets of Connex were sold to Quantum Corporation for cash
proceeds of $11.0 million, and in September 2001
substantially all of the operating assets of SANavigator were
sold to McData Corporation for cash proceeds of
$29.8 million. These transactions generated a gain of
$24.5 million, net of costs incurred from the measurement
date of July 1, 2001 through the end of the period to
shutdown the businesses.

During 2002, in connection with the disposal of
Keen, the Company assumed certain remaining debt commitments, as
Western Digital was the guarantor of these obligations. In 2003,
the Company repaid these obligations resulting in a gain of
$1.3 million due to a favorable settlement.

Note 10.

Income Taxes

The domestic and international components of
income (loss) before income taxes are as follows (in
millions):

The components of the income tax expense
(benefit) are as follows (in millions):

The tax benefits associated with employee
exercises of non-qualified stock options, disqualifying
dispositions of stock acquired with incentive stock options, and
disqualifying dispositions of stock acquired under the employee
stock purchase plan generally reduce taxes currently payable.
However, no tax benefits were recorded to additional paid-in
capital in 2003, 2002 and 2001 because their realization was not
believed to be “more likely than not.” Consequently, a
valuation allowance was recorded against the entire benefit.
Benefits to be recognized in the future related to stock option
deductions are approximately $23.7 million.

During 2002, the company received a refund of
U.S. federal income taxes of $3.1 million. This refund was
for alternative minimum taxes paid in prior years and was made
in accordance with legislation enacted during 2002.

Temporary differences and carryforwards, which
give rise to a significant portion of deferred tax assets and
liabilities at June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002 are as
follows (in millions):



WESTERN DIGITAL
CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Reserves and accrued expenses not currently
deductible include the following (in millions):

During 2002, the Company repatriated a
significant amount of prior years’ earnings of its foreign
subsidiaries. As a result, there was a significant reduction in
net operating loss carryforwards. The repatriation occurred
following the enactment in 2002 of favorable but temporary
U.S. tax law changes. Remaining net undistributed earnings
from foreign subsidiaries at June 27, 2003, on which no
U.S. tax has been provided, amounted to approximately
$217.3 million. The net undistributed earnings are intended
to finance local operating requirements. Accordingly, an
additional United States tax provision has not been made on
these earnings.

The Company determines deferred taxes for each of
its tax-paying subsidiaries within each tax jurisdiction. The
deferred tax assets indicated above are attributable primarily
to tax jurisdictions where a history of earnings has not been
established. The taxable earnings in these tax jurisdictions are
also subject to volatility. Therefore, the Company believes a
valuation allowance is needed to reduce the deferred tax asset
to an amount that is “more likely than not” to be
realized.

Reconciliation of the United States Federal
statutory rate to the Company’s effective tax rate is as
follows:

Certain income of selected subsidiaries is taxed
at substantially lower income tax rates as compared to local
statutory rates. The lower rates reduced income taxes and
improved the net income or loss by $33.6 million ($0.16 per
diluted share), $29.3 million ($0.15 per diluted share) and
$30.0 million ($0.18 per diluted share) in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. These lower rates are in effect through
fiscal year 2004.

At June 27, 2003, the Company had Federal
and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$640.5 million and $471.8 million, respectively. In
addition, the Company had various Federal and state tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $40.4 million. The loss
carryforwards are available to offset future Federal and state
taxable income through 2022 and 2014, respectively.
Approximately $24.0 million of the credit carryforwards are
available to offset future taxable income through 2023. The
remaining $16.4 million are available indefinitely.

Controls and
    Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in the Company’s Exchange Act reports is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and
evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and management is
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures.

As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), the
Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of the Company’s management,
including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
