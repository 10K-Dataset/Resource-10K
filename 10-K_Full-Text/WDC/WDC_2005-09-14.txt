PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Western Digital Corporation (the “Company” or
“Western Digital” or “WD”) designs,
develops, manufactures and sells hard disk drives. A hard disk
drive is a device that stores data on one or more rotating
magnetic disks to allow fast access to data. Hard disk drives
are one of the key components found in most computers and data
storage subsystems.

The Company’s hard disk drives are used in desktop personal
computers (“PCs”), notebook computers, enterprise
applications such as servers, workstations, network attached
storage and storage area networks, and in consumer electronics
(“CE”) products such as personal/digital video
recorders (“DVRs”) and satellite and cable set-top
boxes (“STBs”). In addition, the Company’s hard
disk drives are used in external hard disk drive products that
feature high speed buses such as 1394/
FireWire/iLink

tm

,
Universal Serial Bus (“USB”) and Ethernet.

Hard disk drives provide non-volatile data storage, which means
that the data is not lost when power is no longer applied to the
device. The Company’s hard disk drive products currently
include 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch form factor drives. The 3.5-inch
form factor drives have capacities ranging from 40 gigabytes
(“GB”) to 400 GB, nominal rotation speeds of 5400,
7200 and 10,000 revolutions per minute (“RPM”), and
offer interfaces including Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics
(“EIDE”) and Serial Advanced Technology Attachment
(“SATA”). The 2.5-inch form factor drives have
capacities ranging from 40 GB to 80 GB, nominal rotation speed
of 5400 RPMs, and offer the EIDE interface. In addition, the
Company has plans to enter the 1.0-inch hard disk drive market
in the future. The Company anticipates that 1.0 inch hard
disk drive products could be used in a variety of handheld
consumer devices such as MP3 players, cameras, and cell phones.

The Company sells its products worldwide to original equipment
manufacturers (“OEMs”) for inclusion in computer
systems or subsystems, and to distributors, resellers and
retailers. The Company’s hard disk drive products are
currently manufactured in Malaysia and Thailand. For
geographical financial data, see the Company’s Consolidated
Financial Statements and Note 9 thereto included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Industry

Western Digital’s primary business focus is the design,
development, manufacture and sale of hard disk drives to the
desktop PC, mobile, enterprise and consumer electronics markets.

The Company believes based on industry data that historically
the sale of personal computers and hard disk drives were similar
in volume, however, during the last five years, the Company
believes the growth in hard disk drive sales has outpaced growth
in personal computer sales. For example, based on industry data
the Company believes in calendar 2001 there were approximately
34% more hard disk drives sold in the market than personal
computers. In contrast, in calendar 2004 there were
approximately 61% more hard disk drives sold in the market than
personal computers. The Company believes that this accelerating
growth of hard disk drive sales is driven primarily by the
following:

•

Alternative products such as consumer electronics products that
    use hard disk drives for the playing, retention, and creation of
    digital content for personal use; the commercial market for hard
    disk drives used in consumer electronic devices did not largely
    exist seven years ago and a strong growth opportunity for this
    market exists.

•

The growth of the external hard disk drive market, which allows
    users to add additional hard disk drives to their computers in a
    more convenient fashion allowing increased storage of data such
    as music or digital photographs.

•

The increased use of multiple hard disk drives in personal
    computers for data safety and higher storage capacity.

Desktop PC Market.

Desktop PCs are used in a number of environments, ranging from
homes to businesses and multi-user networks. Software
applications are used on desktop PCs for word processing,
spreadsheet, desktop publishing, database management,
multimedia, entertainment and other related applications. Hard
disk drives store both software applications


and the data used by these software applications. The Company
believes that the demand for hard disk drives in the PC market
has grown in part due to:

In addition, the Company believes the rate of PC unit growth is
affected by several factors, including maturing PC markets in
North America and Western Europe, an increase in first-time
buyers of PCs in Eastern Europe and Asia, and the lengthening of
PC replacement cycles. For an additional discussion of changes
in the PC market, see Part II, Item 7, under the
heading “Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results.”

Mobile Computing Market.

The Company expects the mobile computing market, which is
primarily notebook computers, to grow faster than the desktop PC
or enterprise markets in the next three years. The Company
entered this market in October 2004 with the introduction of its
WD
Scorpio

tm

product, a 2.5-inch form factor hard disk drive.

The Company believes that the demand for mobile drives has grown
from approximately 16% of the overall hard disk drive market in
2002 to 24% of the overall hard disk drive market in 2004. The
Company believes that this growth trend will continue as people
continue to buy notebook computers in increasing numbers.

Enterprise Market.

The enterprise market for hard disk drives focuses on customers
that make workstations, servers, network attached storage,
storage area networks, and other computing systems or
subsystems. This market has been traditionally served by hard
disk drives that use the small-computer-systems-interface
(“SCSI”) standard. Recently, however, SCSI hard disk
drives are being supplemented by SATA hard disk drives in
certain enterprise storage applications. SATA is an interface
technology supported by industry standards. In most
applications, SATA hard disk drives cost less than SCSI while
maintaining reliability, scalability and performance necessary
for many mainstream enterprise applications.

The Company believes that the use of SATA hard disk drives in
the enterprise hard disk drive market will continue to increase.
For example, during the past few years a new disk-based back-up
application has emerged with high-capacity SATA hard disk drives
augmenting SCSI, tape and optical media. This new trend,
popularly referred to as “near-line” storage, has
created a growth market due to the ability of hard disk drives
to back-up or access data more quickly than tape or optical
solutions, and to quickly retrieve critical back-up or near-line
data. The increasing use of hard disk drives in near-line
storage applications is also being enhanced by the availability
of SATA hard disk drive solutions, which are more cost
competitive as compared to SCSI hard disk drives.

In addition, SATA drives are also being used in unique
clustering applications for databases, scientific computing, web
caching and electronic mail. These applications have become an
important market for large capacity SATA hard disk drives and
the Company believes that this market will continue to consume a
growing portion of the Company’s highest capacity hard disk
drives in the next three years.

Consumer Electronics Market.

The use of hard disk drives in consumer electronic products has
been a new growth area in recent years. Currently, the three
largest uses for hard disk drives in this area are as follows:

•

the storing and playing of digital television content in
    applications such as personal video recorders;

•

the storing and playing of audio content in applications such as
    MP3 players; and

•

the use of hard disk drives in game consoles.

Since 1999, hard disk drive-based recorders of audio and video
content have been available for use in home entertainment
systems. Commonly called personal video recorders
(“PVRs”) or digital video recorders
(“DVRs”), these


consumer devices offer the end-user enhanced features such as
pausing live television, simplifying the process of recording
and cataloging recorded television programs and quickly
forwarding or returning to any section of a recorded television
program. In addition, hard disk drives are being increasingly
incorporated into DVD recorders to allow for PVR/ DVR
functionality and faster recording of content onto removable
DVDs. In general, the market for these products favor large
capacity hard disk drives, and there is a growing market for
these products in Japan and North America, and strong interest
in Europe and the rest of Asia Pacific. The Company believes
that growth in this market may increase the demand for higher
capacity hard disk drives.

The Company has plans to enter the 1.0-inch hard disk drive
market in the future, and anticipates offering 1.0-inch hard
disk drives for use in CE products to store and play audio
content. In addition, the Company believes that there may be
opportunities for growth in sales of 1.0-inch hard disk drives
for use in future versions of cameras and cell phones. The
strong growth in demand for hard disk drive storage in CE
products to store and play audio content increased significantly
in the third calendar quarter of 2004. The Company believes
based on industry data that a total over 2 million hard
disk drive based MP3 players were sold in the market for the
third calendar quarter of 2004. The majority of hard disk drives
used in MP3 players are either 1.0-inch or 1.8-inch products.
Sales of hard disk drive based MP3 players featuring 1.0-inch or
1.8-inch products continued with strong growth into calendar
2005.

For further discussion of the audio-video market, see
Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk Factors
That May Affect Future Results.”

Hard disk drives continue to be used in game consoles, although
game console sales have fallen over the last four years.
Although the Company has provided hard disk drives for game
consoles in the past, the overall market growth for hard disk
drives in game consoles continues to be challenged.

For an additional discussion of the video game market, see
Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk Factors
That May Affect Future Results.”

The External Hard Disk Drive Market.

Most new desktop PC systems are equipped with high-speed
external interfaces, such as 1394/ FireWire/i.Link, USB or
Ethernet. As a result, end users are able to supplement the
storage space of their PC systems with the use of external hard
disk drive products that connect via these high-speed
interfaces. External hard disk drive products are commonly used
for storing additional programs or multimedia content, or for
backing up internal hard disk drives. While the external hard
disk drive market continues to be a small part of the overall
hard disk drive market, the Company believes that sales of
external hard disk drives will continue to grow. In general,
external storage may often be the easiest, quickest or only way
of adding additional storage capacity to either a notebook or
desktop computer. In addition, the Company believes that in the
future there is opportunity for acceptance of external storage
in CE products as a way or expanding storage in these devices.

Other Market Opportunities.

The Company continuously evaluates opportunities to apply its
knowledge of data storage technology beyond current markets for
hard disk drives. New business opportunities are evaluated for
their direct impact on the Company’s ability to increase
the sale of hard disk drives. The Company monitors the
development of new markets related to data or content storage
and may, from time to time, offer new products or services to
address appropriate new form factors, interfaces or markets.
Conversely, depending on the development of such markets and the
Company’s ability to achieve its goals, the Company may,
from time to time, withdraw from certain markets.

Products

The Company offers a broad line of hard disk drives designed for
various markets. Western Digital’s hard disk drives are
marketed under the WD Caviar®, WD Raptor® and WD
Scorpio

tm

brand names. These hard disk drives service the desktop,
enterprise, external hard disk drive and consumer electronics
markets, and can be found in products including but not limited
to advanced performance desktop and workstations, gaming
consoles, video surveillance equipment, networking products,
enterprise storage and notebook computers.

Consumer Electronics Products.

The Company offers design
capabilities and hard disk drive technologies for consumer
applications. The Company currently offers hard disk drive
products designed for use in digital video recording


products such as personal video recorders (PVRs), digital video
recorders (DVRs), and satellite and cable set-top boxes (STBs).
These products are designed to meet the unique requirements of
this specialized storage-enabled market and the hard disk drives
deliver the characteristics CE manufacturers seek
most — quiet operation, low temperature and power
consumption specifications, high reliability and optimized
streaming capabilities. The Company also offers products for the
video game console market. In addition, the Company has plans to
enter the 1.0-inch hard disk drive market in the future. The
Company anticipates that 1.0-inch hard disk drive products could
be used in a variety of handheld consumer devices such as MP3
players, cameras and cell phones.

Mobile Hard Disk Drive Products.

Hard disk drives used in
mobile products typically include 2.5-inch form factor drives
for notebook computers. Although the desktop PC market accounts
for a majority of hard disk drive sales, unit shipments of hard
disk drives for notebook computers are increasing. In 2005, the
Company introduced its WD Scorpio hard disk drive family
consisting of 2.5-inch form factor products with capacities
ranging from 40 GB to 80 GB and a nominal rotation speed of 5400
RPM. These products utilize the EIDE interface.

Desktop PC Hard Disk Drive Products.

WD hard disk drives
designed for the desktop PC market currently consist of 3.5-inch
form factor products with capacities ranging from 40 GB to 400
GB and nominal rotation speeds of 7200 RPM. These products
utilize either the EIDE or SATA interfaces, providing high
performance while retaining ease of use and overall low cost of
connection. The type of EIDE interface currently used in the
Company’s hard disk drives is ATA/100, which signifies a
burst data transfer rate of 100 megabytes per second, which
is the maximum specified data transition that can be sustained
under ideal conditions. The SATA interface available in certain
of the Company’s hard disk drives enable transfer rates of
up to 300 megabytes per second.

Enterprise Hard Disk Drive Products.

Western Digital
currently offers multiple products to address enterprise market
needs, including the WD Raptor and Caviar RAID Edition
(RE) hard disk drive lines. The WD Raptor line is a 10,000
RPM enterprise-class drive with the SATA interface for
enterprise applications requiring high performance and high
reliability. The WD Caviar RE hard disk drive is a 7200 RPM
drive with capacities ranging from 120 GB to 400 GB. The WD
Caviar RE hard disk drive includes both SATA and EIDE interfaces
and has enhanced reliability features and ratings when
contrasted to our desktop products. Both WD Raptor and WD Caviar
RE drives may be used in, but not limited to, applications such
as databases, e-commerce and super computing in life science,
oil and gas and similar industries, business records management,
e-mail, file serving, web serving, near-line storage, medical
records, engineering data management, video broadcasting and
video security.

External Hard Disk Drive Products.

Western Digital also
sells a line of external hard disk drive products and related
adapters that are designed to accommodate external storage
interfaces including 1394/ FireWire/i.Link, USB and Ethernet. In
general, these interfaces provide a high-speed interface that
can be used to add additional external, portable storage
capacity to desktop and laptop computers. Most new computers
sold today include one or multiple of these high speed external
interfaces, thereby supporting the ability to quickly add
external hard disk drive storage. One of Western Digital’s
external hard disk drive products now shipping is the WD
Passport, a 80GB 5400 RPM portable 2.5-inch hard disk drive.

Technology and Product Development

Hard disk drives are used to record, store and retrieve digital
data. Performance attributes of hard disk drives, such as their
ability to access and transmit data and storage capacity, are
currently better than removable or floppy disks, optical hard
disk drives and tapes, and they are more cost effective than
semiconductor technology. The primary measures of hard disk
drive performance include:

“Storage capacity” — the amount of data that
    can be stored on the hard disk drive — commonly
    expressed in gigabytes. As defined in the hard disk drive
    industry, a gigabyte means one billion bytes. A byte is a
    digital character, typically comprised of eight bits. A bit is a
    binary digit, the smallest unit of information in a digital
    system.

“Average seek time” — the time needed to
    position the heads over a selected track on the disk
    surface — commonly expressed in milliseconds.


“Internal data transfer rate” — the
    sustained rate at which data is transferred to and from the
    disk — commonly expressed in megabits per second. One
    megabit is equal to one million bits.

“Spindle rotational speed” — the nominal
    rotational speed of the disks inside the hard disk
    drive — commonly expressed in RPMs, revolutions per
    minute or latency. While the reference to spindle rotational
    speeds of 5400, 7200 and 10,000 RPMs is commonly used, in some
    cases these speeds are approximations.

“Acoustics” — the sound power that is
    emitted while the hard disk drive is operating —
    commonly expressed in decibels.

All of the Company’s hard disk drive products employ
similar technology. The main components of the hard disk drive
are the head disk assembly and the printed circuit board. The
head disk assembly includes the head, media (disks), head
positioning mechanism (actuator) and spindle motor. These
components are contained in a hard base plate protective package
in a contamination-controlled environment. The printed circuit
board includes both standard and custom integrated circuits, an
interface connector to the host computer and a power connector.

The head disk assembly is comprised of one or more disks
positioned around a spindle hub that rotates the disks by a
spindle motor. Disks are made of a smooth substrate to which a
thin coating of magnetic materials is applied. Each disk has a
head suspended directly above it, which can read data from or
write data to the spinning disk.

The integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically
include a drive interface and a controller. The drive interface
receives instructions from the computer, while the controller
directs the flow of data to or from the disks and controls the
heads. The location of data on each disk is logically maintained
in concentric tracks that are divided into sectors. The computer
sends instructions to the controller to read data from or write
data to the disks based on logical track and sector locations.
Guided by instructions from the controller, the head stack
assembly is pivoted and swung across the disk by a head actuator
or motor until it reaches the selected track of a disk, where
the data is recorded or retrieved.

Industry standard interfaces are utilized to allow the hard disk
drive to communicate with the computer. Currently, the primary
interface for desktop PCs is EIDE, and the primary interface for
enterprise systems is SCSI. As computer performance continues to
improve, the hard disk drive will need to deliver information
faster than these interfaces can handle. The Company believes
that the desktop PC industry plans to transition to higher speed
interfaces, such as SATA, to handle the higher data transfer
rates. The Company currently offers its WD Caviar products,
7200 RPM drives with the SATA interface and featuring
capacities as large as 400 GB. These products are designed
for the PC, workstation, server, and external storage markets.
The Company believes that SATA is also becoming a more popular
interface in the enterprise market. Western Digital currently
offers its WD Raptor hard disk drive, a 10,000 RPM
enterprise-class drive with the SATA interface, and the WD
Caviar RE2 and RE hard disk drives, 7200 RPM drives
manufactured to enterprise-class standards and available with a
SATA interface.

Storage capacity of the hard disk drive, as manufactured by
Western Digital, is determined by the number of disks and each
disk’s areal density, which is a measure of the amount of
data that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk.
The higher the areal density, the more information can be stored
on a single platter. As the areal density increases, fewer disks
and/or heads are required to achieve a given drive capacity,
thus reducing product costs through reduced component
requirements.

Head technology is one of the variables affecting areal density.
Historically, there have been rapid technological changes
resulting in several generations of head technology in a
relatively short period of time. However, in recent years the
time has lengthened between changes in generations of head
technology. Currently, the desktop hard disk drive industry uses
giant magnetoresistive head technology, which allows
significantly higher storage capacities than the previously
utilized thin-film head technology. All of the Company’s
hard disk drive product offerings currently employ giant
magnetoresistive head technology. In addition, significant
development efforts have been undertaken across the industry to
implement perpendicular recording technology. The Company
anticipates using perpendicular recording heads in certain
products in the future.

The Western Digital product line generally leverages a common
platform for various products within product families with
different capacities to serve the differing market needs. This
platform strategy results in commonality of components across
different products within product families and, in some cases,
across product families, which reduces


exposure to changes in demand, facilitates inventory management
and allows the Company to achieve lower costs through economies
of scale purchasing. This platform strategy also enables
computer manufacturer customers to leverage their qualification
efforts onto successive product models. The Company expects to
continue to utilize this platform strategy as it continues to
develop products for the mobile market and the emerging markets
for hard disk drives specifically designed for handheld
applications, such as digital music players and audio-video
applications, such as digital video recording devices.

In addition to the development of the overall hard disk drive,
WD also spends considerable effort and expense in the
development of WD head technology used in the majority of its
hard disk drive products. In general, the design and
manufacturing of WD heads consists of engineering and
fabricating a read element for reading data from a disk, a write
element for writing data to a disk, and slider. The slider
functions similar to an airplane wing and allows the read and
write elements to fly over the surface of the disk drive and to
land, on either the disk substrate or a special ramp, when power
is not applied to the hard disk drive.

For an additional discussion of technological innovations, see
Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk Factors
That May Affect Future Results.”

Sales and Distribution

The Company sells its products globally to Original Equipment
Manufacturers, or “OEMs,” distributors and retailers.
OEMs purchase the Company’s hard disk drives and assemble
them into the computer or other consumer electronic systems they
build. Distributors typically sell the Company’s hard disk
drives to small computer manufacturers, dealers, systems
integrators and other resellers. Retailers typically sell the
Company’s hard disk drive products directly to end-users.

Original Equipment Manufacturers.

Sales to OEMs accounted
for 58%, 51% and 52% of the Company’s revenue in 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively. During 2005, the Company’s major
OEM customers included Dell and Hewlett-Packard. During 2005 and
2004, sales to Dell accounted for 16% and 14%, respectively of
the Company’s revenue. During 2003, sales to Dell and
Hewlett-Packard accounted for 20% and 13% of revenue,
respectively. The Company believes that its success depends on
its ability to maintain and improve its strong relationships
with the leading OEMs.

OEMs evaluate and select their hard disk drive suppliers based
on a number of factors, including overall quality and
reliability, storage capacities, performance characteristics,
price, service and support, ease of doing business, and the
supplier’s long-term financial stability. They typically
seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of
hard disk drives, and once an OEM has chosen its qualified hard
disk drive vendors for a given product, it generally will
purchase hard disk drives from those vendors for the life of
that product. To achieve success with OEMs qualifications, a
hard disk drive supplier must consistently offer hard disk
drives featuring leading technology, quality, reliability and
acceptable capacity per disk. Suppliers must quickly achieve
volume production of each new generation of high quality and
reliable hard disk drives. To quickly achieve high volume
production, a hard disk drive supplier must have access to
flexible, high-capacity, high-quality manufacturing capabilities.

Many of the Company’s OEM customers utilize just-in-time
inventory management processes or supply chain business models
that combine “build-to-order” (in which the OEM does
not build until there is a firm order) and “contract
manufacturing” (in which the OEM contracts assembly work to
a contract manufacturer who purchases components and assembles
the computer based on the OEM’s instructions). For certain
OEMs, the Company maintains a base stock of finished goods
inventory in facilities located near or adjacent to the
OEM’s operations.

For an additional discussion of the need to adapt to
customers’ business models and maintain customer
satisfaction, refer to Part II, Item 7, under the
heading “Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results.”

Distributors.

The Company uses a select group of
distributors to sell its products to small computer
manufacturers, resellers, dealers and systems integrators.
Distributors accounted for approximately 36%, 42% and 40% of the
Company’s revenue for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Distributors generally enter into non-exclusive agreements for
specific territories with the Company for purchase and
redistribution of product. The Company grants its distributors
limited price protection rights.


Retailers.

The Company sells its retail-packaged products
directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer
superstores, warehouse clubs and computer electronics stores,
and authorizes sales through distributors to smaller retailers.
Retailers accounted for approximately 6%, 7% and 8% of the
Company’s revenue for each of 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The Company’s current retail customer base is
primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe. The retail
channel complements the Company’s other sales channels
while helping to build brand awareness for the Company and its
products. Retailers supply the aftermarket “upgrade”
and data back-up sectors in which end-users purchase and install
products to upgrade their computers and externally store their
data for back-up purposes. The Company grants its retailers
price protection and limited rights to return product on an
inventory rotation basis. The Company also sells its
retail-packaged products through the Internet, at its web site.

The Company maintains sales offices in selected parts of the
world including the major geographies of the Americas, Asia
Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. Field application
engineering is provided to strategic computer manufacturer
accounts, and localized end-user technical support services are
provided within the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. The
Company’s localized end-user technical support is currently
supplied by employees and third party providers through
telephone support, and via the Company’s web site.

The Company’s international sales, which include sales to
foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies but do not include
sales to U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies,
represented 65%, 63% and 59% of the Company’s revenue for
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Sales to international
customers may be subject to certain risks not normally
encountered in domestic operations, including exposure to
tariffs and various trade regulations. See Part II,
Item 7, under the heading “Risk Factors That May
Affect Future Results.”

For additional information concerning revenue recognition, sales
by geographic region and significant customer information, see
Notes 1 and 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The Company’s marketing and advertising functions are
performed both internally and through outside firms.
Advertising, worldwide packaging and marketing materials are
targeted to various reseller and end-user categories. Western
Digital utilizes both consumer media and, to a lesser extent,
trade publications. The Company has programs under which
qualifying distributors and retailers are reimbursed for certain
marketing expenditures. Western Digital also maintains customer
relationships by communicating with its resellers and providing
end-users with information and support through its web site.

Competition

The Company competes primarily with manufacturers of hard disk
drives for desktop PC, mobile, enterprise and CE products.
The Company’s competitors in the hard disk drive market
include Seagate Technology, Maxtor Corporation, Fujitsu Limited,
Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, Samsung Electronics
Incorporated and Toshiba Corporation.

The hard disk drive industry is intensely competitive, with hard
disk drive suppliers competing for sales to a limited number of
major customers. Hard disk drives manufactured by different
competitors are highly substitutable due to the industry mandate
of technical form, fit and function standards. Hard disk drive
manufacturers compete on the basis of product quality and
reliability, storage capacity, unit price, product performance,
production volume capabilities, delivery capability, leadership
in time-to-market, time-to-volume and time-to-quality, service
and support, and ease of doing business. The relative importance
of these factors varies between different customer and market
segments. The Company believes that it is generally competitive
in all of these factors.

The Company believes that there are no substantial barriers for
existing competitors to offer competing products. Therefore, the
Company believes that it cannot differentiate its hard disk
drive products solely on attributes such as storage capacity,
buffer size or time-to-market. Accordingly, the Company
differentiates itself by focusing on high product quality and
reliability, and designing and incorporating into its hard disk
drives desirable product performance attributes. Such
performance attributes focus on seek times, data transfer rates,
intelligent caching, failure prediction, remote diagnostics,
acoustics and data recovery. In addition, the Company emphasizes
non-product related attributes, including rapid response with
its customers. Rapid response requires accelerated design
cycles, customer delivery, production flexibility and timely
service and support, which contribute to customer satisfaction.
The Company also relies on the strength of the Western Digital
brand name with value-added resellers and solution providers to
whom the


Company sells its hard disk drive products directly and
indirectly. The Company believes that trust in a
manufacturer’s reputation and the establishment of
strategic relationships have become important factors in the
selection of a hard disk drive, particularly in a rapidly
changing technology environment.

Advances in magnetic, optical or other data storage technologies
could result in competitive products that have better
performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than the
Company’s hard disk drive products. High-speed
semiconductor memory could compete with the Company’s hard
disk drive products in the future. Semiconductor memory is much
faster than magnetic hard disk drives, but currently is not
competitive from a cost standpoint. Flash memory, a non-volatile
semiconductor memory, is currently much more costly and, while
it has higher “read” performance attributes than hard
disk drives, it has lower “write” performance
attributes. Flash memory could become competitive in the near
future for applications requiring less storage capacity than
that provided by hard disk drives.

For an additional discussion of competition, see Part II,
Item 7, under the heading “Risk Factors That May
Affect Future Results.”

Service and Warranty

Western Digital generally warrants its newly manufactured hard
disk drives against defects in materials and workmanship for
periods of from one to five years from the date of sale
depending on the type of product. The Company’s warranty
obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement of the
hard disk drive. The Company has engaged third parties in
Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Hungary, India,
Korea, Russia, Singapore, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates
to provide various levels of testing, processing and/or
recertification of returned hard disk drives for the
Company’s customers. In addition, the Company processes,
tests and recertifies returned hard disk drives at its own
facility in the United States.

Manufacturing

Western Digital believes that it has significant know-how,
unique product manufacturing process, and human resources to
continue to be successful and have the ability to grow, as
necessary, its manufacturing operations. To be competitive,
Western Digital must manufacture high quality hard disk drives
with industry leading time-to-volume production at competitive
unit costs. The Company strives to maintain manufacturing
flexibility, high manufacturing yields, and reliable products,
while insisting that its suppliers provide high-quality
components at competitive prices. The critical elements of
Western Digital’s hard disk drive production are high
volume, low cost assembly and testing, and establishment and
maintenance of key supplier relationships. By establishing close
relationships with its strategic component suppliers, the
Company believes it is able to access best-of-class
manufacturing quality. In addition, the Company believes that
its sourcing strategy currently enables it to have the business
flexibility needed to select the highest quality low cost of
ownership suppliers as product designs and technologies evolve.

Hard disk drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the
assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and
thorough testing. The assembly process occurs in a “clean
room” environment that demands skill in process engineering
and efficient utilization of the “clean room” layout
in order to reduce the high operating costs of this
manufacturing environment. The Company’s clean room
manufacturing process consists of modular production units, each
of which contains a number of work cells.

The Company manufactures hard disk drives in Malaysia and
Thailand. The Company continually evaluates its manufacturing
processes in an effort to increase productivity, sustain and
improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs. For example,
during 2002, in response to an increase in demand and in order
to capitalize on the local supplier base, the Company completed
the acquisition of a Thailand manufacturing facility. The
Company continually evaluates which steps in the manufacturing
process would benefit from automation and how automated
manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce
manufacturing costs.

In July 2003, the Company purchased substantially all of the
assets of Read-Rite Corporation, formerly one of the
Company’s suppliers of heads, including its wafer
fabrication equipment in Fremont, California and its slider
fabrication facility in Bang Pa-In, Thailand. These assets are
upgraded and enhanced as necessary to meet the demands of newer
technologies consistent with the Company’s hard disk drive
production facilities. The Company uses these facilities to


design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads, head
gimbal assemblies (“HGAs”) and head stack assemblies
(“HSAs”) for use in hard disk drives it manufactures.

For an additional discussion of manufacturing, see Part II,
Item 7, under the heading “Risk Factors That May
Affect Future Results.”

Research and Development

The Company devotes substantial resources to development of new
products and improvement of existing products. The Company
focuses its engineering efforts on coordinating its product
design and manufacturing processes in order to bring its
products to market in a cost-effective and timely manner.
Research and development expenses totaled $239 million,
$201 million and $135 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

For further discussion of product development, see Part II,
Item 7, under the heading “Risk Factors That May
Affect Future Results.”

Materials and Supplies

The principal components currently used in the manufacture of
the Company’s hard disk drives are magnetic heads and
related HSAs, media, controllers, spindle motors and mechanical
parts used in the head disk assembly. In addition to custom
semiconductor devices, the Company also uses standard
semiconductor components such as logic, memory and
microprocessor devices obtained from other manufacturers and a
wide variety of other parts, including printed circuit boards,
connectors, cables, and other interconnect technology.

The Company designs and manufactures a substantial portion of
the heads required for the hard disk drives it manufactures. The
Company also purchases a portion of these components from third
party suppliers. During 2005, the Company bought giant
magnetoresistive heads from ALPS Electric Co., Ltd. and
TDK Corporation’s subsidiary, SAE Magnetics Ltd.

The Company acquires all of the remaining components for its
products from third party suppliers. The Company generally
obtains multiple suppliers for each of its component
requirements, however, in some instances for business reasons
the Company is sole sourced. For example, during 2005, the
Company’s media requirements were purchased from several
outside vendors including Fuji Electric, Hoya Corp., Komag Inc.
and Showa Denko KK. The Company has volume purchase agreements
with Komag Inc. and Showa Denko KK under which the Company is
obligated to purchase from each supplier, and each supplier is
obligated to sell to the Company, certain specified media
volumes in accordance with the terms in the agreements.

Some components are currently sole-sourced. For example, some
custom integrated circuit devices for certain products are
currently sole-sourced from STMicroelectronics and Marvell
Semiconductor, Inc. Because of their custom nature, these
products require significant design-in periods and long lead
times. There has been a trend in integrated circuit design
toward increased integration of various separate circuits. The
Company expects this trend to continue in the area of custom
integrated circuits for hard disk drives.

For an additional discussion of component supplies, see
Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk Factors
That May Affect Future Results.”

Backlog

Historically, a substantial portion of the Company’s orders
has been for shipments of hard disk drives within 30 to
60 days of the placement of the order. The Company
generally negotiates pricing, order lead times, product support
requirements and other terms and conditions prior to receiving a
computer manufacturer’s first purchase order for a product.
Customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with
relatively short notice to the Company, with little or no cost
to the customer, or modified by customers to provide for
delivery at a later date. In addition, many of the
Company’s sales to OEMs are made under just-in-time
delivery contracts that do not generally require firm order
commitments by the customer until the time of sale. Instead, the
Company receives a periodic forecast of requirements from the
customer, and the customer is invoiced upon shipment of the
product from the just-in-time warehouse.


Therefore, backlog information as of the end of a particular
period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of the
Company’s revenue and profit and may not be comparable to
earlier periods.

Patents, Licenses and Proprietary Information

The Company owns numerous patents and has many patent
applications in process. The Company believes that, although its
patents and patent applications have considerable value, the
successful manufacturing and marketing of its products depends
primarily upon the technical and managerial competence of its
personnel. Accordingly, the patents held and applied for do not
assure the Company’s future success.

In addition to patent protection of certain intellectual
property rights, the Company considers elements of its product
designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential. The
Company believes that its non-patented intellectual property,
particularly some of its process technology, is an important
factor in its success. Western Digital relies upon
non-disclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a
system of internal safeguards to protect its proprietary
information. Despite these safeguards, there is a risk that
competitors may obtain and use such information. The laws of
foreign jurisdictions in which the Company conducts business
also may provide less protection for confidential information
than the United States.

The Company relies on certain technology that is licensed from
other parties in order to manufacture and sell its products. The
Company believes that it has adequate cross-licenses and other
agreements in place in addition to its own intellectual property
portfolio to compete successfully in the hard disk drive
industry.

For additional discussion of intellectual property, see
Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk Factors
That May Affect Future Results.”

Environmental Regulation

The Company is subject to a variety of regulations in connection
with its operations. It believes that it has obtained or is in
the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for
its operations.

Employees

As of July 1, 2005, the Company employed a total of 23,161
employees worldwide. This represents an increase in headcount of
approximately 33% since July 2, 2004 and an increase of
approximately 101% since June 27, 2003. The increase is
primarily the result of increased production in the
Company’s manufacturing facilities, the Company’s
expansion of its product offerings and the Company’s
acquisition of Read-Rite’s assets in July 2003.

Many of the Company’s employees are highly skilled, and the
Company’s continued success depends in part upon its
ability to attract and retain such employees. Accordingly, the
Company offers employee benefit programs, which it believes are,
in the aggregate, approximately comparable to those offered by
its competitors. Despite these programs, the Company has, along
with most of its competitors, experienced difficulty at times in
hiring and retaining certain skilled personnel. In addition, the
Company has utilized consultants and contract personnel to fill
these needs until full-time employees could be recruited. The
Company has never experienced a work stoppage, none of its
domestic employees are represented by a labor organization, and
the Company considers its employee relations to be good.

The Company

Western Digital Corporation designs, develops, manufactures and
sells hard disk drives. A hard disk drive is a device that
stores data on one or more rotating magnetic disks to allow fast
access to data. Hard disk drives are one of the key components
found in most computers and data storage subsystems.

The Company’s hard disk drives are used in desktop personal
computers (“PCs”), notebook computers, enterprise
applications such as servers, workstations, network attached
storage and storage area networks, and in consumer electronics
(“CE”) products such as personal/digital video
recorders (“DVRs”) and satellite and cable set-top
boxes (“STBs”). In addition, the Company’s hard
disk drives are used in external hard disk drive products that
feature high speed buses such as 1394/
FireWire/iLink

tm

,
Universal Serial Bus (“USB”) and Ethernet.

Hard disk drives provide non-volatile data storage, which means
that the data is not lost when power is no longer applied to the
device. The Company’s hard disk drive products currently
include 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch form factor drives. The 3.5-inch
form factor drives have capacities ranging from 40 gigabytes
(“GB”) to 400 GB, nominal rotation speeds of 5400,
7200 and 10,000 revolutions per minute (“RPM”), and
offer interfaces including Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics
(“EIDE”) and Serial Advanced Technology Attachment
(“SATA”). The 2.5-inch form factor drives have
capacities ranging from 40 GB to 80 GB, nominal rotation speed
of 5400 RPMs, and offer the EIDE interface. In addition, the
Company has plans to enter the 1.0-inch hard disk drive market
in the future. The Company anticipates that 1.0 inch hard
disk drive products could be used in a variety of handheld
consumer devices such as MP3 players, cameras, and cell phones.

The Company sells its products worldwide to original equipment
manufacturers (“OEMs”) for inclusion in computer
systems or subsystems, and to distributors, resellers and
retailers. The Company’s hard disk drive products are
currently manufactured in Malaysia and Thailand. For
geographical financial data, see the Company’s Consolidated
Financial Statements and Note 9 thereto included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Market Overview

For calendar year 2004, the Company believes that the total
market for hard disk drives was more than 300 million
units, or almost $24 billion. Over half of these unit
shipments were to the desktop PC market. Thus, total hard disk
drive unit growth depends greatly on developments in the PC
market. WD believes that the demand for hard disk drives in the
PC market will continue to grow in part due to:


The Company believes the rate of hard disk drive unit growth in
the desktop PC market is affected by several factors, including
maturing PC markets in North America and Western Europe, an
increase in first-time buyers of PCs in Eastern Europe and Asia,
the lengthening of PC replacement cycles and an increasing
preference for notebook systems.

The Company expects that the mobile computing market, which is
primarily notebook computers, to grow faster than the desktop PC
market due to customer preference in the next three years.
Western Digital entered the mobile hard disk drive market in
October 2004, commencing volume production of its WD
Scorpio

tm

family of 2.5-inch hard disk drives for notebooks.

As the market for consumer applications expands, additional
investments by the Company will be required. For example, CE
products such as handheld digital audio players currently
utilize sub-2.5-inch form factor hard disk drives. In January
2005, Western Digital announced it has plans to enter the
miniature hard disk drive market with a 1.0-inch 6-gigabyte
product. In addition, while CE products may require hard disk
drives that are similar in nature to desktop hard disk drives,
these products have often required specialized features or
functions driving additional development versus desktop products.

The enterprise market for hard disk drives focuses on customers
that make workstations, servers, network attached storage
devices, storage area networks, and other computing systems or
subsystems. Western Digital serves this market through its
application of the SATA interface. The SATA interface contains
many of the same benefits of the
small-computer-systems-interface, or SCSI — the
predominant interface currently used in most enterprise hard
disk drive applications. The Company believes that the use of
the SATA interfaces in enterprise hard disk drives is growing.

Results of Operations

Fiscal 2005 Overview

In 2005, Western Digital’s net revenue increased by 19% to
$3.6 billion on unit shipments of 61.4 million as
compared to 48.3 million in 2004. In 2005, 21% of WD’s
revenue was derived from non-desktop PC sources including CE
products, enterprise applications, notebook PCs and retail sales
as compared to 14% in 2004. Gross margin increased to 16.2% from
15.2% in 2004. Operating income increased by $42 million to
$197 million, which included the impact of a
$19 million charge for the settlement of a patent
infringement lawsuit. Operating margins increased to 5.4% as a
percentage of net revenue in 2005 compared with 5.1% in 2004.
Western Digital generated $461 million in cash flow from
operations in 2005 compared with $190 million in 2004,
finishing the year with $598 million in cash and short-term
investments, an increase of $221 million from the prior
year.

Historically, industry unit shipments have increased 5% to 10%
between the June and September quarters. The Company anticipates
traditional seasonal demand trends for the hard disk drive
industry in the September 2005 quarter. WD also expects to
continue to benefit from its growing participation in the CE
market and the on-going volume ramp of its Scorpio 2.5-inch hard
disk drives.

Summary of 2005, 2004 and 2003 Comparison

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated,
summary information from the Company’s statements of income
(in millions).


Net Revenue

Net revenue was $3.6 billion for 2005, an increase of 19%
or $592 million from 2004. Total unit shipments increased
to 61.4 million for the year as compared to
48.3 million for the prior year. This unit increase
resulted from the Company’s higher desktop market share,
stronger overall demand for hard disk drives in the desktop PC
market and WD’s increasing focus on the non-desktop PC
market. For example, WD shipped 6.6 million units to the CE
market in 2005 as compared to 2.8 million units in 2004.
The growth in total unit shipments was partially offset by a
$4 per unit decline in average selling prices
(“ASPs”) to $59 per unit for 2005.

Revenue contribution by geographic region for 2005 was 38% from
the Americas, 29% from Europe and 33% from Asia compared to 41%,
30% and 29%, respectively, for 2004 and 48%, 30% and 22%,
respectively, for 2003. These changes reflect the Company’s
continued focus on revenue growth in emerging geographic
markets, primarily in Asia.

Revenue contribution by sales channel for 2005 was 58% from
OEMs, 36% from distributors and 6% from the retail channel,
compared to 51%, 42% and 7%, respectively, for 2004 and 52%, 40%
and 8%, respectively for 2003. WD’s revenue contribution
from OEM’s increased in 2005 due to higher sales to the
non-desktop PC markets, which are serviced primarily by
OEM’s.

Net revenue increased $328 million, or 12%, in 2004 from
2003. This increase in net revenue was primarily due to the
Company’s improved market share as well as an increase in
demand for hard disk drives in the PC market. Unit shipments
increased to 48.3 million in 2004 from 39.7 million in
2003, while ASPs decreased to $63 per unit in 2004 from
$68 per unit in 2003.

Gross Margin

Gross margin percentage increased to 16.2% for 2005 from 15.2%
for 2004. The Company’s 2004 gross margin was impacted by
start-up expenses and other charges totaling $18 million
relating to the Company’s head manufacturing operations
acquired in July 2003. The increase in gross margin percentage
over the prior year was also impacted by continuing improvements
in quality, manufacturing cost efficiencies and product mix,
partially offset by unit price declines. The gross margin
percentage for 2003 was 16.3%, which included the impact of a
$19 million charge for the settlement of litigation. The
decrease in gross margin percentage from 2003 to 2004 was
primarily a result of the $18 million of start-up expenses
incurred in 2004 relating to the acquisition of the
Company’s head manufacturing operations as well as
aggressive pricing pressures. WD was able to partially offset
the 2004 impact of these pricing conditions and start-up related
costs with the ongoing accretive benefit of its head
manufacturing operations.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses, consisting of research and development
(“R&D”) and selling, general and administrative
(“SG&A”), were 10.8% of net revenue in 2005, as
compared to 10.1% of net revenue in 2004 and 9.4% of net revenue
in 2003. Operating expenses are expected to increase slightly
for the first fiscal quarter of 2006 as a result of the
Company’s continued investment in the expansion of its
product and technology portfolio and the costs associated with
expensing stock options.

R&D expense was $239 million, $201 million and
$135 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
increase of $38 million in R&D expense in 2005 over
2004 was primarily related to development of new product
platforms in support of WD’s entry into new markets,
expenditures for advanced head technologies and an increase of
$26 million in employee incentive compensation programs.
The increase of $66 million in R&D in 2004 over 2003
was due to head-design, mobile and enterprise platform
development, as well as a $26 million charge for acquired
in-process research and development related to the Read-Rite
asset acquisition.

SG&A expense was $154 million, $106 million and
$121 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
$48 million increase in SG&A expense in 2005 from 2004
was primarily due to an expansion of sales resources to support
increasing PC demand in certain geographic regions and the
growing mobile and CE markets, an increase of $15 million
in employee incentive compensation programs and a
$19 million charge for the settlement of a patent
infringement lawsuit. The $15 million decrease in SG&A
expense in 2004 from 2003 was primarily related to a reduction
in employee incentive compensation programs and continuing cost
reductions.


Interest and Other Income

Net interest and other income was $5 million, $0 and
$3 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This
includes net investment gains of $4 million in 2003.
Excluding these net gains, net interest and other income
(expense) was $5 million, $0 and ($1) million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in net interest
income in 2005 over 2004 was primarily due to a higher average
cash and short-term investments balance as well as an increase
in the rates of return on investments, yielding higher interest
income in 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in net interest
income in 2004 over net interest expense in 2003 was primarily
due to the Company’s redemption of its convertible
debentures during the third quarter of 2003, resulting in lower
interest expense in 2004.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense was $4 million, $4 million and
$8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Tax
expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 1.9%, 2.5%
and 4.0% for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Differences
between the effective tax rates and the U.S. Federal
statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in Malaysia and
Thailand that expire at various times ranging from 2008 to 2019.
The 2005 effective tax rate benefited by approximately 0.7% from
the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies. The
decrease in income tax expense from 2003 to 2004 is primarily
related to lower overall earnings in 2004 and a more favorable
mix of earnings within certain tax jurisdictions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Western Digital ended fiscal 2005 with total cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments of $598 million, an
increase of $220 million from July 2, 2004. The
Company’s investment policy is to manage its investment
portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing
return through the full investment of available funds. A large
portion of Western Digital’s available funds is invested in
auction rate securities, which are short-term investments in
bonds with original maturities greater than 90 days. The
following table summarizes the results of the Company’s
statements of cash flows for the three-year periods ended
July 1, 2005, July 2, 2004 and June 27, 2003.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities during 2005 was
$461 million as compared to $190 million during 2004
and $258 million for 2003. Cash flow from operations
consists of net income, adjusted for non-cash charges, plus or
minus working capital changes. This represents the
Company’s principal source of cash. Net cash provided by
working capital changes was $128 million for 2005 as
compared to net cash used to fund working capital of
$89 million for 2004 and net cash provided by working
capital of $45 million for 2003.


Western Digital’s working capital requirements depend upon
the effective management of its cash conversion cycle, which
measures how quickly a company can convert its products into
cash through sales. The cash conversion cycles for 2005, 2004
and 2003 were as follows:

The improvement in the cash conversion cycle for 2005 was
primarily due to better alignment in the timing of the
Company’s inventory build and sales schedules. Cash flow
from operations for 2005 also benefited from an increase in
other expenses that did not require the use of cash in 2005. The
decrease in the 2004 cash conversion cycle as compared to 2003
was primarily due to a higher accounts receivable balance
associated with changes in the Company’s mix of customers
and higher work in process inventory associated with the head
manufacturing operations. Cash flow from operations for 2004 was
also impacted by the payment of a $45 million litigation
settlement.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities for 2005 was
$314 million as compared to $259 million for 2004 and
$59 million for 2003. During 2005, cash used in investing
activities consisted of $233 million for capital
expenditures and $81 million for short-term investments.
The net cash used in investing activities for 2004 consisted of
$132 million for capital expenditures, $95 million for
the Read-Rite asset acquisition and $32 million for
short-term investments. The increase in capital expenditures in
2005 was primarily a result of assets purchased to upgrade the
Company’s head manufacturing capabilities, increased
desktop and mobile hard disk drive production capabilities and
for the normal replacement of existing assets. The increase in
short-term investments in 2005 was a result of additional
investments in auction rate securities. The 2003 investing
activities related primarily to capital expenditures. The
increase in capital expenditures in 2004 was primarily for
assets purchased to upgrade the Company’s head
manufacturing capabilities, increase desktop hard disk drive
production capabilities and for the normal replacement of
existing assets. For 2006, capital expenditures are expected to
be approximately $275 million to $300 million. This
increase in capital expenditures is expected to consist
primarily of investments in advanced head technologies, new
product platforms and capacity for WD’s broadening and
growing product portfolio.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities for 2005 was
$7 million as compared to net cash provided by financing
activities of $21 million for 2004 and net cash used in
financing activities of $30 million for 2003. The net cash
used in financing activities in 2005 consisted of
$45 million used for common stock repurchases and
$20 million for debt payments partially offset by
$58 million received upon issuance of common stock under
employee plans. The net cash provided by financing activities
for 2004 consisted primarily of $24 million received upon
issuance of common stock under employee plans and
$14 million in net proceeds from long-term debt partially
offset by $16 million used for common stock repurchases.
The net cash used by financing activities for 2003 consisted
primarily of $68 million used for redemption of the
Company’s remaining convertible debentures, partially
offset by $44 million received upon issuance of common
stock under employee plans.

Long-Term Debt

The Company has a $125 million credit facility
(“Senior Credit Facility”) consisting of a revolving
credit line (subject to outstanding letters of credit and a
borrowing base calculation) and a term loan of $38 million.
Both the revolving credit facility and the term loan mature on
September 19, 2008 and are secured by the Company’s
accounts receivable, inventory, 65% of its stock in its foreign
subsidiaries and other assets. For the year ended July 1,
2005, the Company had no borrowings on the revolving credit line
and the average variable rate on the Company’s term loan
was 4.5%.

The Senior Credit Facility prohibits the payment of cash
dividends on common stock and contains specific financial
covenants. The Company is required to maintain an available
liquidity level of $300 million at the end of each quarter.
Available liquidity is defined as cash plus eligible trade
receivables. As of July 1, 2005, the Company was in
compliance with this covenant. Should the Company’s
available liquidity be less than $300 million, the Company
would then be subject to minimum EBITDA (earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) requirements and
capital expenditure limitations.

The term loan requires quarterly principal payments of
approximately $3 million. Principal payments made on the
term loan increase the amount of revolving credit available. At
July 1, 2005, $85 million was available for borrowing
under the revolving credit line and the Company had
$3 million in outstanding letters of credit.

Purchase Orders

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into
purchase orders with suppliers for the purchase of hard disk
drive components used to manufacture the Company’s
products. These purchase orders generally cover forecasted
component supplies needed for production during the next
quarter, are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the
components, and generally may be changed or canceled at any time
prior to shipment of the components. In some cases the Company
may be obligated to pay for certain costs related to changes to,
or cancellation of, a purchase order, such as costs incurred for
raw materials or work in process.

The Company has entered into long-term purchase agreements with
various component suppliers. The commitments are subject to
minimum quality requirements. In addition, the dollar amount of
the purchases may depend on the specific products ordered and
future price negotiations. The estimated related minimum
purchase requirements are included in “Purchase
Obligations” in the table above.

The Company enters into, from time to time, other long-term
purchase agreements for components with certain vendors.
Generally, future purchases under these agreements are not fixed
and determinable as they depend on the Company’s overall
unit volume requirements and are contingent upon the prices,
technology and quality of the supplier’s products remaining
competitive. These arrangements are not included under
“Purchase Obligations” in the table above. See below
under the heading “Risk Factors That May Affect Future
Results” for a discussion of these commitments.


Forward Exchange Contracts

The Company purchases short-term, forward exchange contracts to
hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain
underlying assets, liabilities and commitments for operating
expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies.
See Part II, Item 7A, under the heading
“Disclosure About Foreign Currency Risk,” for the
Company’s current forward exchange contract commitments.

Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide
indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers,
vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with
respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to,
losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, services to
be provided by us, or from intellectual property infringement
claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has
entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and
certain of its officers that will require it, among other
things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may
arise by reason of their status or service as directors or
officers. The Company maintains director and officer insurance,
which may cover certain liabilities arising from its obligation
to indemnify its directors and officers in certain circumstances.

It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount
under these indemnification agreements due to the limited
history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and
circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such
indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss
clauses. Historically, the Company has not incurred material
costs as a result of obligations under these agreements.

Stock Repurchase Program

WD announced a stock repurchase program on May 5, 2004.
Under the program, the Company may purchase on the open market
up to $100 million of its common stock depending on market
conditions and other corporate considerations. Stock repurchases
are expected to be funded principally by operating cash flow.
During 2005, WD repurchased 4.8 million shares of common
stock at a total cost of $45 million. In addition, between
July 2, 2005 and September 9, 2005 the Company
repurchased 0.4 million shares of common stock at a cost of
$6 million. Since the inception of the program and through
September 9, 2005, the Company has repurchased
7.1 million shares for a total cost of $67 million
(including commissions). WD may continue to repurchase its stock
as it deems appropriate and market conditions allow.

Western Digital believes its current cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments will be sufficient to meet its working
capital needs through the foreseeable future. There can be no
assurance that the Senior Credit Facility will continue to be
available to the Company. Also, WD’s ability to sustain its
working capital position is dependent upon a number of factors
that are discussed below under the heading “Risk Factors
That May Affect Future Results.” The Company currently
anticipates that it will continue to utilize its liquidity and
cash flows to improve the efficiency and capability of its
existing hard disk drive and head manufacturing operations.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company has prepared the accompanying consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. The preparation of the financial
statements requires the use of judgment and estimates that
affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and
liabilities. The Company has adopted accounting policies and
practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which
it operates. The Company believes the following are its most
critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and
involve management’s judgment and estimates. If these
estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact
to the consolidated financial statements may be material.

Revenue and Accounts Receivable

In accordance with standard industry practice, Western Digital
has agreements with resellers that provide limited price
protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of
published list price reductions and other incentive programs. In
accordance with current accounting standards, the Company
recognizes revenue upon shipment or delivery


to resellers and records a reduction to revenue for estimated
price protection and other programs in effect until the
resellers sell such inventory to their customers. Adjustments
are based on anticipated price decreases during the reseller
holding period, estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying
customers, as well as historical pricing information. If
end-market demand for hard disk drives declines significantly,
the Company may have to increase sell-through incentive payments
to resellers, resulting in an increase in price protection
allowances, which could adversely impact operating results.

Western Digital establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts
by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk
of loss based on insolvency, disputes or other collection
issues. In addition, the Company routinely analyzes the
different receivable aging categories and its bad debt loss
history and establishes reserves based on a combination of past
due receivables and expected future losses based primarily on
the Company’s historical levels of bad debt losses. If the
financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates
resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due, or if
the overall loss history of the Company changes significantly,
an adjustment in the Company’s allowance for doubtful
accounts would be required, which could affect operating results.

Western Digital records provisions against revenue and cost of
revenue for estimated sales returns in the same period that the
related revenue is recognized. The Company bases these
provisions on existing product return notifications as well as
historical returns by product type (see “Warranty”).
If actual sales returns exceed expectations, an increase in the
sales return provision would be required, which could negatively
affect operating results.

Warranty

Western Digital records an accrual for estimated warranty costs
when revenue is recognized. Warranty covers costs of repair or
replacement of the hard disk drive over the warranty period,
which generally ranges from one to five years. The Company has
comprehensive processes with which to estimate accruals for
warranty, which include specific detail on hard disk drives in
the field by product type, historical field return rates and
costs to repair. If actual product return rates or costs to
repair returned products differ significantly from current
expectations, a change in the warranty provision would be
required. For a summary of historical changes in estimates
related to pre-existing warranty provisions, refer to
Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, Note 5 “Commitments and
Contingencies” included in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Inventory

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out
basis) or net realizable value. Inventory write-downs are
recorded for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or
net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and
estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs
and inventory balances.

The Company evaluates inventory balances for excess quantities
and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing backlog,
estimated demand, inventory on hand, sales levels and other
information, and reduces inventory balances to net realizable
value for excess and obsolete inventory based on the analysis.
Unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could
result in a decrease in demand for one or more of the
Company’s products, which may require an increase in
inventory balance adjustments that could negatively affect
operating results.

Litigation and Other Contingencies

Western Digital applies Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,”
to determine when and how much to accrue for and disclose
related to legal and other contingencies. Accordingly, the
Company accrues loss contingencies when management, in
consultation with its legal advisors, concludes that a loss is
probable and reasonably estimable. (Refer to Part II,
Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
Note 6 “Legal Proceedings” included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K). The ability to predict the
ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates
and inherent uncertainties. The actual outcome of such matters
could differ materially from management’s estimates.


Deferred Tax Assets

Western Digital’s deferred tax assets, which consist
primarily of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards,
are fully reserved due to management’s determination that
it is more likely than not that these assets will not be
realized. This determination is based on the weight of available
evidence, the most significant of which is the Company’s
loss history in the related tax jurisdictions. Should this
determination change in the future, some amount of deferred tax
assets could be recognized, resulting in a tax benefit or a
reduction of future tax expense. The Company records estimated
tax liabilities to the extent the contingencies are probable and
can be reasonably estimated. However, the actual liability in
any such tax contingencies may be materially different from our
estimates, which could result in the need to record additional
tax liabilities or potentially adjust previously recorded tax
liabilities.

New Accounting Standards

In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB
No. 43, Chapter 4” (SFAS No. 151),
which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material
(spoilage) and requires those items be recognized as current
period charges regardless of whether they meet the definition of
“so abnormal”. SFAS No. 151 is effective for
inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2005. The Company does not expect the adoption of
SFAS No. 151 to have a material impact on its
financial statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued revised statement
SFAS No. 123, “Share-Based Payment”
(SFAS No. 123-R), which supersedes APB Opinion
No. 25 and replaces the current SFAS No. 123.
SFAS No. 123-R requires companies to expense the
estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar
awards and provides guidance on the valuation methods used in
determining the estimated fair value. The provisions of
SFAS No. 123-R will be effective beginning with the
Company’s first quarter of fiscal year 2006. Under
SFAS No. 123-R, compensation expense for existing
awards where the requisite service period has not been completed
by the effective date will be charged to expense over the
remaining service period using the same fair value currently
calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under
SFAS No. 123. For fiscal year 2005, the proforma net
impact of stock option expense as reported in footnote 1 to
the consolidated financial statements was approximately
$25 million. The Company is currently in the process of
determining the impact of SFAS 123-R on its 2006 financial
statements. The actual effect of adopting SFAS 123R will be
dependent on several factors including the levels and timing of
future share-based payment grants, the assumed award forfeiture
rate and the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over
the service period.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47, “Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of
FASB Statement No. 143” (“FIN 47”),
which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair
value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred
if the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated.
FIN 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2005. The Company does not expect the adoption
of FIN 47 to have a material impact on its financial
statements.

Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results

Declines in average selling prices (“ASPs”) in the
    hard disk drive industry adversely affect our operating
    results.

The hard disk drive industry historically has experienced
declining ASPs. Although the rate of decline has moderated in
recent years, there can be no assurance that this trend will
continue. Our ASPs tend to decline when competitors lower prices
as a result of decreased costs or to absorb excess capacity,
liquidate excess inventories, restructure or attempt to gain
market share. Our ASPs also decline when there is a shift in the
mix of product sales, and sales of lower priced products
increase relative to those of higher priced products.


Our operating results depend on optimizing time-to-market and
    time-to-volume, overall quality, and costs of new and
    established products.

To achieve consistent success with our customers who
manufacturer computers, systems and consumer electronic
products, we must balance several key attributes such as
time-to-market, time-to-volume, quality, cost, service, price
and a broad product portfolio. If we fail to:

our operating results could be adversely affected.

Product life cycles influence our financial results.

Product life cycles have been extending since the middle of
calendar year 2002 due in large part to a decrease in the rate
of hard disk drive areal density growth. However, there can be
no assurance that this trend will continue. If longer product
life cycles continue, we may need to develop new technologies or
programs to reduce our costs on any particular product in order
to maintain competitive pricing for such product. This may
result in an increase in our overall expenses and a decrease in
our gross margins, both of which could adversely affect our
operating results. If product life cycles shorten, it may be
more difficult to recover the cost of product development before
the product becomes obsolete. Our failure to recover the cost of
product development in the future could adversely affect our
operating results.

Product life cycles in the desktop hard disk drive market
    require continuous technical innovation associated with higher
    areal densities.

New products in the desktop hard disk drive market may require
higher areal densities than previous product generations, posing
formidable technical and manufacturing challenges. Higher areal
densities require existing head technology to be improved or new
technology developed to accommodate more data on a single disk.
In addition, our introduction of new products during a
technology transition increases the likelihood of unexpected
quality concerns. Our failure to bring high quality new products
to market on time and at acceptable costs may put us at a
competitive disadvantage to companies that achieve these
results. In addition, technology improvements may require us to
reduce the price on existing products to remain competitive.

The difficulty of introducing hard disk drives with higher
    levels of areal density and the challenges of reducing other
    costs may impact our ability to achieve historical levels of
    cost reduction.

Storage capacity of the hard disk drive, as manufactured by us,
is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal
density. Areal density is a measure of the amount of magnetic
bits that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk.
Generally, the higher the areal density, the more information
can be stored on a single platter. Historically, we have been
able to achieve a large percentage of cost reduction through
increases in areal density. Increases in areal


density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and
disks for the same capacity and, therefore, may result in a
lower component cost. However, because increases in areal
density have become more difficult in the hard disk drive
industry, such increases may require increases in component
costs. In addition, other opportunities to reduce costs may not
continue at historical rates. Our inability to achieve cost
reductions could adversely affect our operating results.

Increases in areal density may outpace customers’ demand
    for storage capacity.

Historically, the industry has experienced periods of increased
areal density growth rates. Although in recent years there has
been a decrease in the rate of areal density growth, if industry
conditions return to periods of increased growth rates, the rate
of increase in areal density may exceed the increase in our
customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity. This
could lead to our customers’ storage capacity needs being
satisfied with more lower-cost single-surface drives, thereby
decreasing our revenue. As a result, even with increasing
aggregate demand for storage capacity, our ASPs could decline,
which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Changes in the markets for hard disk drives require us to
    develop new products and new technology.

Over the past few years the consumer market for desktop
computers has shifted significantly towards lower priced
systems. If we are not able to offer a competitively priced hard
disk drive for the low-cost PC market, our share of that market
will likely fall, which could harm our operating results.

The market for hard disk drives is also fragmenting into a
variety of devices and products. Many industry analysts expect,
as do we, that as communications are increasingly converted to
digital technology from the older, analog technology, the
technology of computers and consumer electronics will continue
to converge, and hard disk drives will be found in many CE
products other than computers.

In addition, we expect that the consumer market for multi-media
applications, including audio-video products, incorporating a
hard disk drive will continue to grow. However, because this
market remains relatively new, accurate forecasts for future
growth remain challenging. Moreover, some of the devices, such
as personal video recorders and digital video recorders, or
other products outside of the CE market, may require attributes
not currently offered in our products, which have resulted in a
need to expend capital to develop new interfaces, form factors,
technical specifications or hard disk drive features, increasing
our overall operational expense without corresponding
incremental revenue at this stage. If we are not successful in
using our hard disk drive technology and expertise to develop
new products for the emerging CE market, or if we are required
to incur significant costs in developing such products, it may
harm our operating results.

If we do not successfully expand into new hard disk drive
    markets, our business may suffer.

To remain a significant supplier of hard disk drives, we will
need to offer a broad range of hard disk drive products to our
customers. We currently offer a variety of 3.5-inch hard disk
drives for the desktop computer and CE markets, and we also
offer 2.5-inch form factor hard disk drives for the mobile
market. However, demand for hard disk drives may shift to
products in smaller form factors, which our competitors may
already offer. We recently announced our entry into the
sub-2.5-inch hard disk drive market with a family of 1.0-inch
drives, which we expect to ship in the future. We face various
challenges in manufacturing a 1.0-inch hard disk drive because
it requires the development of new manufacturing technologies
and processes. If we are not able to adequately address these
challenges, our expected shipment of this product may be
delayed, resulting in a delay in our ability to realize revenue
from this product.

In addition, the enterprise and desktop PC markets are
transitioning from the PATA interface to higher speed interfaces
such as SATA to handle higher data transfer rates. We currently
offer SATA products; however, the transition of technology and
the introduction of new products are challenging and create
risks. For example, acceptance of the SATA interface may not
continue to grow, or customers may choose to purchase
alternative interfaces that may not be compatible with future
generations of SATA hard disk drives. Moreover, our customers
may require new SATA features that we may not be able to deliver
in a timely and cost effective manner.

While we continue to develop new products and look to expand
into other applications, the success of our new product
introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including
difficulties faced in manufacturing ramp, market acceptance,
effective management of inventory levels in line with
anticipated product demand, and the risk that our new


products may have quality problems or other defects in the early
stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design
of those products. If we fail to successfully develop and
manufacture new products, customers may decrease the amount of
our products that they purchase, and we may lose business to our
competitors who offer these products or who use their dominance
in the enterprise or mobile market to encourage sales of hard
disk drives.

If we do not successfully expand into the 2.5-inch and
    sub-2.5-inch markets, our business may suffer.

We began shipping 2.5-inch form factor hard disk drives for the
mobile market during calendar year 2004. Although many of our
customers who purchase 3.5-inch form factor hard disk
drives also purchase the 2.5-inch form factor drives, the
markets are characterized by different competitors, different
sales channels and different overall requirements. If we are
unable to adapt to these differences, we would have a
competitive disadvantage to companies that are successful in
this regard, and our business and financial results could
suffer. In addition, if we incur significant costs in
manufacturing and selling the 2.5-inch and sub-2.5-inch form
factor hard disk drives, and if we are unable to recover those
costs from sales of the products, then we may not be able to
compete successfully in this market and our operating results
may suffer.

Selling to the retail market is an important part of our
    business, and if we fail to maintain and grow our market share
    or gain market acceptance of our retail products, our operating
    results could suffer.

We sell our retail-packaged products directly to a select group
of major retailers such as computer superstores and CE stores,
and authorize sales through distributors to other retailers. Our
current retail customer base is primarily in the United States,
Canada and Europe. We are facing increased competition from
other companies for shelf space at major retailers, which could
result in lower gross margins. If we fail to successfully
maintain our market share in North America, our operating
results may be adversely affected. In certain markets, we are
trying to grow market share, and in the process may face strong
competition, which could result in lower gross margins. We will
continue to introduce new products in the retail market that
incorporate our disk drives. There can be no assurance that
these products gain market acceptance, and if they do not, our
operating results could suffer.

To develop new products, we must maintain effective partner
    relationships with our major component suppliers.

Under our business model, we do not manufacture any of the
component parts used in our hard disk drives, other than heads.
As a result, the success of our products depends on our ability
to gain access to and integrate parts that are “best in
class” from reliable component suppliers. To do so, we must
effectively manage our relationships with our major component
suppliers. We must also effectively integrate different products
from a variety of suppliers, each of which employs variations on
technology, which can impact, for example, feasible combinations
of heads and media components. In August 2003, we settled
litigation we were engaged in with a supplier who previously was
the sole source of read channel devices for our hard disk
drives. As a result of the disputes that gave rise to the
litigation, our profitability was at risk until another
supplier’s read channel devices could be designed into our
products. Similar disputes with other strategic component
suppliers could adversely affect our operating results.

Dependence on a limited number of qualified suppliers of
    components and manufacturing equipment could lead to delays,
    lost revenue or increased costs.

Because we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain
hard disk drive components and manufacturing equipment, an
increase in the cost of such components or equipment, an
extended shortage of required components or equipment, failure
of a key supplier’s business process, or the failure of key
suppliers to remain in business, adjust to market conditions, or
to meet our quality, yield or production requirements could
significantly harm our operating results. Our future operating
results may also depend substantially on our suppliers’
ability to timely qualify their components in our programs, and
their ability to supply us with these components in sufficient
volumes to meet our production requirements. A number of the
components that we use are available from only a single or
limited number of qualified outside suppliers, and may be used
across multiple product lines. In addition, some of the
components (or component types) used in our products are used in
other devices, such as mobile telephones and digital cameras. If
there is a significant simultaneous upswing in demand for such a
component (or component type) from several high volume
industries, resulting in a supply reduction, or a component is
otherwise in short supply, or if a supplier fails to qualify or
has a quality issue with a component, we may experience delays
or increased costs in obtaining that component. For


example, the hard disk drive industry is currently facing a
tightness in the availability of media (rotating magnetic disks)
components. We may experience production delays if we are unable
to obtain the necessary components or sufficient quantities of
components. If a component becomes unavailable, we could suffer
significant loss of revenue.

To reduce the risk of component shortages, we attempt to provide
significant lead times when buying these components. As a
result, we may be subject to cancellation charges if we cancel
orders, which may occur when we make technology transitions. In
addition, we may enter into contractual commitments with certain
component suppliers in an effort to increase and stabilize the
supply of those components, and enable us to purchase such
components at favorable prices. These commitments may require us
to buy a substantial number of components from the supplier or
make significant cash advances to the supplier.

In addition, certain equipment we use in our manufacturing or
testing processes is available only from a limited number of
suppliers. Some of this equipment uses materials that at times
could be in short supply. If these materials are not available,
or are not available in the quantities we require for our
manufacturing and testing processes, our ability to manufacture
our products could be impacted, and we could suffer significant
loss of revenue.

Rising Costs of Commodity Materials May Result in Lower
    Operating Margins.

The cost and availability of certain commodity materials used to
manufacture hard disk drives and key components is critical to
our success. Shortages of such materials such as steel and
aluminum and the rising cost of oil increase our costs and may
result in lower operating margins if we are unable to pass such
increased costs through to our customers.

A fundamental change in recording technology could result in
    significant increases in our operating expenses and could put us
    at a competitive disadvantage.

Currently the hard disk drive industry uses giant
magnetoresistive head technology, which allows significantly
higher storage capacities than the previously utilized thin-film
head technology. However, the industry is developing new
recording technologies that may enable greater recording
densities than currently available using magnetoresistive head
technology, including perpendicular, current
perpendicular-to-plane, and tunneling junction technology. If
the industry experiences a fundamental shift in recording
technology, hard disk drive manufacturers would need to timely
adjust their designs and processes to accommodate the new
technology in order to remain competitive. As a result, we could
incur substantial costs in developing new technologies, media,
and tools to remain competitive. We may also become more
dependent on suppliers to ensure our access to components that
accommodate the new technology. These results would increase our
operating costs, which may negatively impact our operating
results.

We experience additional costs and risks in connection with
    our head manufacturing operations.

Our vertical integration of head manufacturing has resulted in a
fundamental change in our operating structure, as we are now
manufacturing heads for use in the hard disk drives we
manufacture. Consequently, we make more capital investments than
we would if we were not vertically integrated and carry a higher
percentage of fixed costs than assumed in our prior financial
business model. If the overall level of production decreases for
any reason, and we are unable to reduce our fixed costs to match
sales, our head manufacturing assets may face under-utilization
that may impact our results of operations. We are therefore
subject to additional risks related to overall asset
utilization, including the need to operate at high levels of
utilization to drive competitive costs, and the need for assured
supply of components, especially hard disk drive media, that is
optimized to work with our heads.

In addition, we may incur additional risks, including:

•

we may not have sufficient head sources in the event that we are
    unable to manufacture a sufficient supply of heads to satisfy
    our needs;

•

third party head suppliers may not continue to do business with
    us or may not do business with us on the same terms and
    conditions we have previously enjoyed;

•

we may be subject to claims that our manufacturing of heads may
    infringe certain intellectual property rights of other
    companies; and


•

it may be difficult and time-consuming for us to locate suitable
    manufacturing equipment for our head manufacturing processes and
    replacement parts for such equipment.

If we do not adequately address the challenges related to our
head manufacturing operations, our ongoing operations could be
disrupted, resulting in a decrease in our revenue or profit
margins and negatively impacting our operating results.

If we are unable to timely and cost-effectively develop heads
    with leading technology and overall quality, our ability to sell
    our products may be significantly diminished, which could
    materially and adversely affect our business and financial
    results.

As a result of our head manufacturing operations, we are
developing and manufacturing a substantial portion of the heads
used in the hard disk drives we manufacture. Consequently, we
are more dependent upon our own development and execution
efforts and less able to take advantage of head technologies
developed by other head manufacturers. There can be no
assurance, however, that we will be successful in timely and
cost-effectively developing and manufacturing heads for products
using perpendicular recording technology, or other future
technologies. We also may not achieve acceptable manufacturing
yields using such technologies necessary to satisfy our
customers’ product needs, or we may encounter quality
problems with the heads we manufacture. In addition, we may not
have access to external sources of supply without incurring
substantial costs. For example, the Company anticipates using
perpendicular recording heads in certain products in the future.
If we fail to develop new technologies such as perpendicular
recording in a timely manner, or if we encounter quality
problems with the heads we manufacture, and if we do not have
access to external sources of supply that incorporate new
technologies, we would have a competitive disadvantage to
companies that are successful in this regard, and our business
and financial results could suffer.

We have two high-volume hard-drive manufacturing facilities
    and two facilities supporting our head manufacturing operations,
    which subjects us to the risk of damage or loss of any of these
    facilities.

Our hard disk drives are manufactured in facilities in Malaysia
and Thailand. In addition, we operate a head wafer fabrication
and research and development facility in Fremont, California and
a slider fabrication, head gimbal assembly, head stack assembly,
and research and development facility in Thailand. A fire,
flood, earthquake or other disaster, condition or event such as
a power outage that adversely affects any of these facilities or
our ability to manufacture could result in a loss of sales and
revenue and harm our operating results.

Manufacturing our products abroad subjects us to numerous
    risks.

We are subject to risks associated with our foreign
manufacturing operations, including:

Because we manufacture our products abroad, our operating costs
are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Further fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Thai Baht and
of the Malaysian Ringgit may negatively impact our operating
results.


The Thai Baht is a free floating currency while the Malaysian
Ringgit exchange rate policy recently defined by the Malaysian
government is one of a managed float. We have attempted to
manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by,
among other things, entering into short-term, forward contracts.
However, these contracts do not cover our full exposure and can
be canceled by the issuer if currency controls are put in place.
Currently, we hedge the Thai Baht, Euro and British Pound
Sterling with forward contracts.

There has been a trend toward a weakening U.S. dollar
relative to most foreign currencies. If this trend continues,
the U.S. dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs
could increase because a significant portion of our production
costs are foreign-currency denominated. Conversely, there would
not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are
substantially U.S. dollar denominated.

If we fail to qualify our products with our customers, they
    may not purchase any units of a particular product line, which
    would have a significant adverse impact on our sales.

We regularly engage in new product qualification with our
customers. To be considered for qualification, we must be among
the leaders in time-to-market with our new products. Once a
product is accepted for qualification testing, failures or
delays in the qualification process can result in our losing
sales to that customer until the next generation of products is
introduced. The effect of missing a product qualification
opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume
computer manufacturers, most of which continue to consolidate
their share of the PC market. If product life cycles continue to
be extended due to a decrease in the rate of areal density
growth, we may have a significantly longer period to wait before
we have an opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer,
which could harm our competitive position. These risks are
increased because we expect cost improvements and competitive
pressures to result in declining gross margins on our current
generation products.

The hard disk drive industry is highly competitive and can be
    characterized by rapid shifts in market share among the major
    competitors.

The price of hard disk drives has fallen over time due to
increases in supply, cost reductions, technological advances and
price reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess
inventories or attempting to gain market share. In addition,
rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and
profitability of sales of existing products and increase the
risk of inventory obsolescence. We also face competition from
other companies that produce alternative storage technologies
like flash memory. These factors, taken together, may result in
significant and rapid shifts in market share among the
industry’s major participants. In addition, product recalls
can lead to a loss of market share, which could adversely affect
our operating results.

Our current competitors or a future competitor may gain a
    technology advantage or an advantageous cost structure that we
    cannot match.

It may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain
an advantage in product technology, manufacturing technology, or
process technology, which may allow them to offer products or
services that have a significant advantage over the products and
services that we offer. Advantages could be in capacity,
performance, reliability, serviceability, or other attributes.
If we are unable to match these technology advantages due to the
proprietary nature of the technology, limitations on process
capability or other factors, we could be at a competitive
disadvantage to those competitors.

Advances in magnetic, optical, semiconductor or other data
storage technologies also could result in competitive products
that have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity
than our products. High-speed semiconductor memory could compete
with the Company’s hard disk drive products in the future.
Semiconductor memory is much faster than magnetic hard disk
drives, but currently is not competitive from a cost standpoint.
Flash memory, a non-volatile semiconductor memory, is currently
much more costly and, while it has higher “read”
performance than hard disk drives, it has lower
“write” performance. Flash memory could become
competitive in the near future for applications requiring less
storage capacity than that provided by hard disk drives. If
these products prove to be superior in performance or cost per
unit of capacity, we could be at a competitive disadvantage to
the companies offering those products.

In addition, if our competitors are able to achieve a lower cost
structure for manufacturing hard disk drives by moving
manufacturing facilities to advantageous locations or through
other restructuring activities, and we are unable to


match their cost structure, we could be at a competitive
disadvantage to those competitors as they may be able to sell
hard disk drives at lower margins while remaining profitable.

Some of our competitors with diversified business units
    outside the hard disk drive industry may be able to sell disk
    drives at lower margins that we cannot match.

Some of our competitors earn a significant portion of their
revenue from business units outside the hard disk drive
industry. Because they do not depend solely on sales of hard
disk drives to achieve profitability, they may be able to sell
hard disk drives at lower margins and still remain profitable.
In addition, if these competitors can increase sales of non hard
disk drive products to the same customers, they may benefit from
selling their hard disk drives at low margins. Our results of
operations may be adversely affected if we can not successfully
compete with these companies.

The nature of our business and our reliance on intellectual
    property and other proprietary information subjects us to the
    risk of significant litigation.

The hard disk drive industry has been characterized by
significant litigation. This includes litigation relating to
patent and other intellectual property rights, product liability
claims and other types of litigation. Litigation can be
expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations.
Moreover, the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and
may result in adverse rulings or decisions. We may enter into
settlements or be subject to judgments that may, individually or
in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations.

We are currently evaluating notices of alleged patent
infringement or notices of patents from patent holders. If
claims or actions are asserted against us, we may be required to
obtain a license or cross-license, modify our existing
technology or design a new non-infringing technology. Such
licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly. In
addition, we may decide to settle a claim or action against us,
which settlement could be costly. We may also be liable for any
past infringement. If there is an adverse ruling against us in
an infringement lawsuit, an injunction could be issued barring
production or sale of any infringing product. It could also
result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost
profits or, if there is a finding of willful infringement,
treble damages. Any of these results would likely increase our
costs and harm our operating results.

Our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary
    information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients
    of our business could be copied by competitors.

Our success depends, in significant part, on the proprietary
nature of our technology, including non-patentable intellectual
property such as our process technology. Despite safeguards, to
the extent that a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise
capitalize on our technology, it may be difficult, expensive or
impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection. Also,
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our
intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the
United States. In addition to patent protection of intellectual
property rights, we consider elements of our product designs and
processes to be proprietary and confidential. We rely upon
employee, consultant and vendor non-disclosure agreements and
contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to
protect our proprietary information. However, any of our
registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be
challenged or exploited by others in the industry, which might
harm our operating results.

We depend on our key personnel and skilled employees.

Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key
personnel and skilled employees, many of whom would be extremely
difficult to replace. Worldwide competition for skilled
employees in the hard disk drive industry is intense. Volatility
or lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely
affect our ability to retain key personnel or skilled employees
who have been granted stock options. If we are unable to retain
our existing key personnel or skilled employees, or hire and
integrate new key personnel or skilled employees, our operating
results would likely be harmed.


Our prices and margins are subject to declines due to
    unpredictable end-user demand and oversupply of hard disk
    drives.

Demand for our hard disk drives depends on the demand for
systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to
existing systems. The demand for systems has been volatile in
the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand
for hard disk drives in any given period. As a result, the hard
disk drive market has experienced periods of excess capacity
which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories and intense
price competition. If intense price competition occurs, we may
be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected, which
could result in lower revenue and gross margins.

Our failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand
    for our products could adversely affect our business and
    financial results.

The hard disk drive industry faces difficulties in accurately
forecasting market and customer demand for its products. The
variety and volume of products we manufacture is based in part
on these forecasts. If our forecasts exceed actual market
demand, or if market demand decreases significantly from our
forecasts, then we could experience periods of product
oversupply and price decreases, which could impact our financial
performance. If our forecasts do not meet actual market demand,
of if market demand increases significantly beyond our
forecasts, then we may not be able to satisfy customer product
needs, which could result in a loss of market share if our
competitors are able to meet customer demands.

We also use forecasts in making decisions regarding investment
of our resources. For example, as the hard disk drive industry
transitions from the PATA interface to the SATA interface, we
may invest more resources in the development of products using
the SATA interface. If our forecasts regarding the replacement
of the PATA interface with the SATA interface are inaccurate, we
may not have products available to meet our customers’
needs.

In addition, although we receive forecasts from our customers,
they are not obligated to purchase the forecasted amounts. We
consider these forecasts in determining our component needs and
our inventory requirements. If we fail to accurately forecast
our customers’ product demands, we may have inadequate or
excess inventory of our products or components, which could
adversely affect our operating results

Loss of market share with a key customer could harm our
    operating results.

A majority of our revenue comes from a few customers. For
example, during 2005, one customer, Dell, accounted for 16% of
our revenue, and sales to our top 10 customers, including Dell,
accounted for 46% of revenue. These customers have a variety of
suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial
demands on us, including demands on product pricing and on
contractual terms, which often results in the allocation of risk
to us as the supplier. Even if we successfully qualify a product
with a customer, the customer generally is not obligated to
purchase any minimum volume of products from us and is able to
terminate its relationship with us at any time. Our ability to
maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is
essential to our future performance. If we lose a key customer,
if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products
or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce
costs, or if a key customer suffers financial hardship then our
operating results would likely be harmed. In addition, if
customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that
our gross margins are diminished, we could decide not to sell
our products to a particular customer, which could result in a
decrease in our revenue.

Environmental costs could harm our operating results.

We may be subject to various state, federal and international
laws and regulations governing the environment, including those
restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic
products and making producers of those products financially
responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and
disposal of certain products. Such laws and regulations have
been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate,
including various European Union member countries. For example,
the European Union has enacted the Restriction of the Use of
Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic
Equipment Directive (“RoHS”). RoHS prohibits the use
of certain substances, including lead, in certain products,
including hard disk drives, put on the market after July 1,
2006. Similar legislation may be enacted


in other locations where we manufacture or sell our products. We
will need to ensure that we comply with such laws and
regulations as they are enacted, and that our component
suppliers also timely comply with such laws and regulations. If
we fail to timely comply with such legislation, our customers
may refuse to purchase our products, which would have a
materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

We could incur substantial costs in connection with our
compliance with such environmental laws and regulations, and we
could also be subject to governmental fines and liability to our
customers if we were found to be in violation of these laws. If
we have to make significant capital expenditures to comply with
environmental laws, or if we are subject to significant capital
expenses in connection with a violation of these laws, our
financial condition or operating results could suffer.

We are subject to risks related to product defects, which
    could result in product recalls and could subject us to warranty
    claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater
    than anticipated due to the unenforceability of liability
    limitations.

We warrant our products for up to five years. We test our hard
disk drives in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of
means. However, there can be no assurance that our testing will
reveal latent defects in our products, which may not become
apparent until after the products have been sold into the
market. Accordingly, there is a risk that product defects will
occur, which could require a product recall. Product recalls can
be expensive to implement and, if a product recall occurs during
the product’s warranty period, we may be required to
replace the defective product. In addition, a product recall may
damage our relationship with our customers, and we may lose
market share with our customers, including our OEM customers.

Our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions
of liability for consequential damages and for misuse, improper
installation, alteration, accident or mishandling while in the
possession of someone other than the Company. We record an
accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is
recognized. We may incur additional operating expenses if our
warranty provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving
issues related to defects in our products. If these additional
expenses are significant, it could adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Some of our customers have adopted a subcontractor model that
    increases our credit risk and could result in an increase in our
    operating costs.

Some of our OEM customers have adopted a subcontractor model
that requires us to contract directly with companies that
provide manufacturing services to our OEM customers. Because
these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as
our direct OEM customers, this subcontractor model exposes us to
increased credit risks. Our agreements with our OEM customers
may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate
this increased credit risk. Any credit losses we may suffer as a
result of this increased risk would increase our operating
costs, which may negatively impact our operating results.

Terrorist attacks may adversely affect our business and
    operating results.

The continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war
or hostility, including the war in Iraq, have created
uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have
significantly increased the political, economic and social
instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate.
Acts of terrorism, either domestically or abroad, could create
further uncertainties and instability. To the extent this
results in disruption or delays of our manufacturing
capabilities or shipments of our products, our business,
operating results and financial condition could be adversely
affected.

Our failure to timely and efficiently transition our
    enterprise resource planning software from the version we
    currently use to a new version, or our failure to maintain our
    current software, could adversely affect our business and
    financial results.

We use enterprise resource planning software in the operation of
our business and maintenance of business and financial data
related to our daily operations. We are in the process of
upgrading this software and we anticipate transitioning to new
enterprise resource planning software during the next year. We
may experience unexpected


difficulties in transitioning to the new software, including
difficulties related to the failure or inefficient operation of
the new software. Such difficulties or failures could result in
our inability to access business and financial information
stored on the system or the loss of such information. Any
inability to access, or loss of, such information as a result of
the transition or otherwise could affect our daily operations,
including our ability to ship products and invoice our
customers, which could have a significant adverse impact on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Inaccurate projections of demand for our product can cause
    large fluctuations in our quarterly results.

We often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in
the third month of the quarter, which makes it difficult for us
to forecast our financial results prior to the end of the
quarter. In addition, our quarterly projections and results may
be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number
of other factors including:

Rapidly changing market conditions in the hard disk drive
    industry make it difficult to estimate actual results.

We have made and continue to make a number of estimates and
assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting.
The rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means
that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates
and assumptions. Key estimates and assumptions for us include:

The market price of our common stock is volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue
to be, extremely volatile. Factors such as the following may
significantly affect the market price of our common stock:

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;

•

announcements of technological innovations by us or our
    competitors which may decrease the volume and profitability of
    sales of our existing products and increase the risk of
    inventory obsolescence;


In addition, general economic conditions may cause the stock
market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from
time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many
high technology companies. These fluctuations often appear to be
unrelated to the operating performance of the companies.

Securities class action lawsuits are often brought against
companies after periods of volatility in the market price of
their securities. A number of such suits have been filed against
us in the past, and should any new lawsuits be filed, such
matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of
resources and management’s attention.

We may be unable to raise future capital through debt or
    equity financing.

Due to the risks described herein, in the future we may be
unable to maintain adequate financial resources for capital
expenditures, expansion or acquisition activity, working capital
and research and development. We have a credit facility, which
matures on September 19, 2008. If we decide to increase or
accelerate our capital expenditures or research and development
efforts, or if results of operations do not meet our
expectations, we could require additional debt or equity
financing. However, we cannot ensure that additional financing
will be available to us or available on acceptable terms. An
equity financing could also be dilutive to our existing
stockholders.

Although the majority of the Company’s transactions are in
U.S. Dollars, some transactions are based in various
foreign currencies. The Company purchases short-term, forward
exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency
fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities and
commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated
in foreign currencies. The purpose of entering into these hedge
transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency
fluctuations on the results of operations. The resulting impact
from these hedge contracts is to offset a majority of the
currency gains and losses in the Company’s local currency
expenses. The contract maturity dates do not exceed six months.
The Company does not purchase short-term forward exchange
contracts for trading purposes. Currently, the Company focuses
on hedging its foreign currency risk related to the Thai Baht,
the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. Thai Baht contracts are
designated as cash flow hedges under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” while all
other contracts are designated as fair value hedges under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52
“Foreign Currency Translation.”


As of July 1, 2005, the Company had outstanding the
following purchased foreign currency forward exchange contracts

Disclosure About Other Market Risks

Variable Interest Rate Risk

At the option of the Company, borrowings under the Senior Credit
Facility would bear interest at either LIBOR (with option
periods of one to three months) or a base rate, plus a margin.
If LIBOR or the base rate increases, the Company’s interest
payments would also increase. At July 1, 2005, the Company
had a $38 million term loan outstanding under the Senior
Credit Facility. A one percent increase in the variable rate of
interest on the Senior Credit Facility would increase interest
expense by approximately $0.4 million annually.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors

Western Digital Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries as of July 1,
2005 and July 2, 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders’ equity and
comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended July 1, 2005. In connection with
our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also
have audited the financial statement schedule as listed in the
accompanying index. These consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries as of
July 1, 2005 and July 2, 2004, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended July 1, 2005, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of July 1, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated
September 9, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of,
internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
    ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors

Western Digital Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that Western
    Digital Corporation maintained effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of July 1, 2005, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO). Western Digital Corporation
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
    assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Western
Digital Corporation maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of July 1, 2005, is fairly stated,
in all material respects, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Also, in our opinion, Western Digital Corporation
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of July 1, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Western Digital Corporation and
subsidiaries as of July 1, 2005 and July 2, 2004, and
the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
flows, and the related financial statement schedule for each of
the years in the three-year period ended July 1, 2005, and
our report dated September 9, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements and the
related financial statement schedule.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Note 1.

Organization and Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies

Western Digital Corporation (the “Company” or
“Western Digital” or “WD”) designs,
develops, manufactures and sells hard disk drives. A hard disk
drive is a device that stores data on one or more rotating
magnetic disks to allow fast access to data. The Company’s
hard disk drives are used in desktop personal computers,
notebook computers, external storage devices, enterprise
applications such as servers, workstations, network attached
storage and storage area networks and in consumer electronics
products such as personal/digital video recorders, satellite and
cable set-top boxes and video game consoles. The Company sells
its products worldwide to original equipment manufacturers
(“OEMs”) for inclusion in computer systems or
subsystems, and to distributors, resellers and retailers.

Western Digital has prepared its consolidated financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and has adopted accounting
policies and practices which are generally accepted in the
industry in which it operates. The Company’s significant
accounting policies are summarized below.

Fiscal Year

The Company has a 52 or 53-week fiscal year. The 2005 and 2003
fiscal years, which ended on July 1, 2005 and June 27,
2003, respectively, consisted of 52 weeks each. Fiscal year
2004, which ended on July 2, 2004, was a 53-week year.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. The accounts of foreign subsidiaries have been
remeasured using the U.S. dollar as the functional
currency. As such, gains or losses resulting from remeasurement
of these accounts from local currencies into U.S. dollars
are reflected in the results of operations. These gains and
losses were immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.
Monetary and nonmonetary asset and liability accounts have been
remeasured using the exchange rate in effect at each year-end
and using historical rates, respectively. Income statement
accounts have been remeasured using historical monthly exchange
rates.

Cash Equivalents

The Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid
investments, primarily money market funds and commercial paper,
with original maturities of three months or less.

Short-Term Investments

The Company’s short-term investments consist primarily of
auction rate securities, which are short-term investments in
bonds with original maturities greater than 90 days. The
Company has classified these investments as “available for
sale” securities under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 115 “Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS 115”).
These investments are carried at fair value.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments approximate fair value for all periods presented
because of the short-term maturity of these financial
instruments. The carrying amount of the Company’s term loan
also approximates fair value.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets hard
disk drives to personal computer manufacturers, resellers and
retailers throughout the world. The Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition
and generally requires no collateral. The Company maintains
allowances for potential credit losses, and such


WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

losses have historically been within management’s
expectations. At any given point in time, the total amount
outstanding from any one of a number of our customers may be
individually significant to the Company’s financial
results. At July 1, 2005 and July 2, 2004, the Company
had reserves for potential credit losses of $3.0 million
and $6.1 million, respectively. The Company also has cash
equivalent and short-term investment policies that limit the
amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or
investment instrument and require that investments be made only
with financial institutions or in investment instruments
evaluated as highly credit-worthy.

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Cost is on a first-in, first-out basis for raw materials
and is computed on a currently adjusted standard basis (which
approximates first-in, first-out) for work in process and
finished goods.

Property and Equipment

The cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The
Company’s buildings are being depreciated over periods
ranging from seven to fifteen years. The majority of the
Company’s equipment is being depreciated over periods of
three and five years. Depreciation is computed on a
straight-line basis. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the
related lease terms.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets consist of purchased technology acquired
during a 2004 asset acquisition. These assets are being
amortized over a weighted average period of three years.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition
in Financial Statements” (“SAB 104”). Under
SAB 104 revenue is recognized when the title and risk of
loss have passed to the customer, there is persuasive evidence
of arrangement, delivery has occurred, or services have been
rendered, the sales price is determinable and collectibility is
reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized at the time of
shipment for the Company’s OEM customers and at the time of
delivery for its reseller customers.

In accordance with standard industry practice, the Company has
agreements with resellers that provide price protection for
inventories held by resellers at the time of published list
price reductions and other incentive programs. Either party may
terminate these agreements upon written notice. In the event of
termination, the Company may be obligated to repurchase a
certain portion of the resellers’ inventory. The Company
records a reduction to revenue for estimated price protection
and other programs in effect until the resellers sell such
inventory to their customers. Adjustments are based on
anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period,
estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers, as
well as historical pricing information. If end-market demand for
hard disk drives declines significantly, the Company may have to
increase sell-through incentive payments to resellers, resulting
in an increase in price protection allowances, which could
adversely impact operating results. Net revenue recognized on
sales to resellers was approximately $1.5 billion,
$1.5 billion and $1.3 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Repurchases of reseller inventory were not
material in 2005, 2004 or 2003.

Western Digital establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts
by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk
of loss based on insolvency, disputes or other collection
issues. In addition, the Company routinely analyzes the
different receivable aging categories and its bad debt loss
history and establishes reserves based on a combination of past
due receivables and expected future losses based primarily on
the Company’s historical levels of bad debt losses. If the


WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates
resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due, or if
the overall loss history of the Company changes significantly,
an adjustment in the Company’s allowance for doubtful
accounts would be required, which could affect operating results.

Warranty

The Company records an accrual for estimated warranty costs as
products are sold. Warranty covers costs of repair or
replacement of the hard disk drive over the warranty period,
which ranges from one to five years and is recorded in the
accompanying balance sheet as current or long-term based upon
when the expenditure is expected to occur. The Company has
comprehensive processes with which to estimate accruals for
warranty, which include specific detail on hard disk drives in
the field by product type, historical field return rates and
costs to repair. Although the Company believes that it has the
continued ability to reasonably estimate warranty reserves,
unforeseeable changes could cause a material change in the
Company’s warranty accrual estimate. Such a change would be
recorded in the period in which it was identified.

Advertising Expense

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Selling, general and
administrative expenses of the Company include advertising costs
of $1.5 million, $1.5 million and $3.4 million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and
liability method, which provides that deferred tax assets and
liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the
financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the
Company’s assets and liabilities and expected benefits of
utilizing net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards.
The Company records a valuation allowance where it is more
likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates
and laws, if any, are applied to the years during which
temporary differences are expected to be settled and reflected
in the consolidated financial statements in the period of
enactment. The Company records estimated tax liabilities to the
extent the contingencies are probable and can be reasonably
estimated. However, the actual liability for any such tax
contingencies may be materially different from the estimates,
which could result in the need to record additional tax
liabilities or adjust previously recorded tax liabilities.

Per Share Information

The Company computes basic income per share using the net income
and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted income per share is computed using
the net income and the weighted average number of common shares
and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the
period. Potentially dilutive common shares include outstanding
employee stock options, employee stock purchase plan shares and
restricted stock awards.


WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table illustrates the computation of basic and
diluted income per common share (in millions, except per share
data):

For the years ended July 1, 2005, July 2, 2004 and
June 27, 2003, 6.0 million, 6.0 million and
9.0 million shares, respectively, relating to the possible
exercise of outstanding stock options were not included in the
computation of diluted income per share. The effects of these
items were not included in the computation of diluted income per
share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
(“SFAS 123”), establishes the financial
accounting and reporting standards for stock-based compensation
plans. As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company elected to
continue accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans
(including shares issued under the Company’s stock option
plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”),
collectively called “Options”) in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and its
related interpretations (“APB Opinion No. 25”),
and to follow the pro forma net income, pro forma income per
share, and stock-based compensation plan disclosure requirements
set forth in SFAS 123. The following table sets forth the
computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for each of
the past three fiscal years and


WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as
if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions
of SFAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation.

The pro forma income per share information for all stock options
granted on or prior to December 31, 2004, as well as all
ESPP shares granted on or prior to July 1, 2005, is
estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The
Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. For stock options
granted subsequent to December 31, 2004, the pro forma
income per share information is estimated using a binomial
model. Both the Black-Scholes and the binomial option pricing
models require the input of highly subjective assumptions such
as the expected stock price volatility and expected employee
exercise behavior. The resulting fair value of employee stock
options is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period of the options.

Other Comprehensive Income

Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains
and losses that are recorded as an element of shareholders’
equity but are excluded from net income. The Company’s
other comprehensive income is comprised of unrealized gains and
losses on foreign currency contracts and marketable securities
categorized as available for sale under SFAS 115.

Foreign Exchange Contracts

Although the majority of the Company’s transactions are in
U.S. Dollars, some transactions are based in various
foreign currencies. The Company purchases short-term, forward
exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency
fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities and
commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated
in foreign currencies. The contracts have maturity dates that do
not exceed six months. The Company does not purchase short-term
forward exchange contracts for trading purposes.

The Company applies the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“SFAS 133”), as amended by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, “Accounting
for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”
and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149
“Amendment of Statement 133


WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”
SFAS 133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments embedded in other contracts
and for hedging activities. The Company had outstanding forward
exchange contracts with commercial banks for the Thai Baht,
British Pound Sterling and Euro with values of
$151.4 million and $173.7 million at July 1, 2005
and July 2, 2004, respectively. Thai Baht contracts are
designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133
while all other contracts are designated as fair value hedges
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52
“Foreign Currency Translation.” Changes in fair value
on these contracts were not material to the consolidated
financial statements for all years presented.

Use of Estimates

Company management has made estimates and assumptions relating
to the reporting of certain assets and liabilities in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. These estimates
and assumptions have been applied using methodologies, which are
consistent throughout the periods presented. However, actual
results could differ from these estimates.

New Accounting Standards

In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an Amendment of
ARB No. 43, Chapter 4”
(“SFAS No. 151”), which clarifies the
accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage) and
requires those items be recognized as current period charges
regardless of whether they meet the definition of “so
abnormal”. SFAS No. 151 is effective for
inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2005. The Company does not expect the adoption of
SFAS No. 151 to have a material impact on its
financial statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued revised statement
SFAS No. 123, “Share-Based Payment”
(SFAS No. 123-R), which supersedes APB Opinion
No. 25 and replaces the current SFAS No. 123.
SFAS No. 123-R requires companies to expense the
estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar
awards and provides guidance on the valuation methods used in
determining the estimated fair value. The provisions of
SFAS No. 123-R will be effective beginning with the
Company’s first quarter of fiscal year 2006. Under
SFAS No. 123-R, compensation expense for existing
awards where the requisite service period has not been completed
by the effective date will be charged to expense over the
remaining service period using the same fair value currently
calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under
SFAS No. 123. For fiscal year 2005, the proforma net
impact of stock option expense as reported in footnote 1 to
the consolidated financial statements was approximately
$25 million. The Company is currently in the process of
determining the impact of SFAS 123-R on its 2006 financial
statements. The actual effect of adopting SFAS 123R will be
dependent on several factors including the levels and timing of
future share-based payment grants, the assumed award forfeiture
rate and the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over
the service period.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47, “Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of
FASB Statement No. 143” (“FIN 47”),
which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair
value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred
if the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated.
FIN 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2005. The Company does not expect the adoption
of FIN 47 to have a material impact on its financial
statements.

Read-Rite Asset Acquisition

In June 2003, Read-Rite Corporation (“Read-Rite”),
then one of the Company’s suppliers of magnetic recording
heads, commenced voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy
proceedings. On July 31, 2003, Western Digital purchased
substantially all of the assets of Read-Rite, including its
wafer fabrication equipment in Fremont, California and
manufacturing facility in Bang Pa-In, Thailand. The cost of the
acquisition was $172.0 million and consisted of cash
consideration of $94.8 million, assumed debt obligations of
the Thailand operations of approximately $60.2 million and


WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

direct costs of the acquisition and other miscellaneous assumed
obligations totaling $17.0 million. The Company accounted
for this transaction as an asset acquisition. The estimated fair
value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as
follows (in millions):

Current assets

$

172.0

As of the date of the acquisition, Read-Rite had two in-process
research and development (“IPR&D”) projects: 120
gigabyte per platter and 160 gigabyte per platter products. The
fair value allocated to these projects as part of the
acquisition was $17.8 million and $7.8 million,
respectively. The multi-period excess earnings method, a
discounted cash flow income approach, was used to determine the
value allocated to the IPR&D. The rate utilized to discount
the cash flows to their present values was based on the weighted
average cost of capital and an additional risk premium based on
an analysis of the technology and the IPR&D stages of
completion. Based on these factors, 27% was used as the annual
discount rate. These acquired IPR&D projects had not reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use.
Accordingly, the Company recorded the $25.6 million as a
charge to research and development expense at the time of the
acquisition.

Approximately $38.8 million of the purchase price related
to purchased technology and is being amortized over a weighted
average period of three years. Accumulated amortization related
to these assets was $27.6 million and $13.2 million at
July 1, 2005 and July 2, 2004, respectively. During
the fiscal years ended July 1, 2005 and July 2, 2004,
the Company recorded $14.4 million and $13.2 million
of amortization expense related to these intangible assets,
respectively. Amortization expense is estimated to be
$4.4 million, $3.4 million and $3.4 million for
fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively.

Line of Credit

The Company has a $125 million credit facility
(“Senior Credit Facility”) revolving credit line
(subject to outstanding letters of credit and a borrowing base
calculation) and a term loan of $38 million. Both the
revolving credit facility and the term loan mature on
September 19, 2008 and are secured by the Company’s
accounts receivable, inventory, 65% of its stock in its foreign
subsidiaries and other assets. For the year ended July 1,
2005, the Company had no borrowings on the revolving credit line
and the average variable rate on the Company’s term loan
was 4.5%.

The Senior Credit Facility prohibits the payment of cash
dividends on common stock and contains specific financial
covenants. The Company is required to maintain an available
liquidity level of $300 million at the end of each quarter.
Available liquidity is defined as cash plus eligible trade
receivables. As of July 1, 2005, the Company was in
compliance

with this covenant. Should the Company’s available
liquidity be less than $300 million, the Company would then
be subject to minimum EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization) requirements and capital
expenditure limitations.

The term loan requires quarterly principal payments of
approximately $3 million. Principal payments made on the
term loan increase the amount of revolving credit available. At
July 1, 2005, $84.5 million was available for
borrowing under the revolving credit line and the Company had
$3 million in outstanding letters of credit.

Commitments and Contingencies

Lease Commitments

The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under
long-term, non-cancelable operating and capital leases. The
Company’s operating leases consist of leased property and
equipment that expire at various dates through 2012. Rental
expense under these operating leases, including month-to-month
rentals, was $16.2 million, $14.9 million and
$11.4 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
Company’s capital leases consist of leased equipment. These
leases have maturity dates through August 31, 2007 and
interest rates averaging approximately 4.5%. Future minimum
lease payments under operating and capital leases that have
initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one
year at July 1, 2005 are as follows (in millions):

Product Warranty Liability

The Company records a provision for estimated warranty costs as
products are sold to cover the cost of repair or replacement of
the hard disk drive during the warranty period. This provision
is based on estimated future returns within the warranty period
and costs to repair, using historical field return rates by
product type and current average repair cost. Changes in the
warranty provision were as follows for the years ended

Long-term Purchase Agreements

The Company has entered into long-term purchase agreements with
various component suppliers. The commitments depend on specific
products ordered and may be subject to minimum quality
requirements and future price negotiations. For 2006, 2007, and
2008, WD expects these commitments to total approximately
$460 million, $670 million, and $340 million,
respectively. No purchases were made under these long-term
purchase agreements in 2005. In conjunction with these
agreements, the Company has advanced approximately
$13 million related to 2006 purchase commitments, which is
included in other current assets as of July 1, 2005.

Legal Proceedings

In June 1994, Papst Licensing (“Papst”) brought suit
against the Company in the United States District Court for the
Central District of California, alleging infringement by the
Company of five hard disk drive motor patents owned by Papst. In
December 1994, Papst dismissed its case without prejudice. In
July 2002, Papst filed a new complaint against the Company and
several other defendants. The suit alleged infringement by the
Company of seventeen of Papst’s patents related to hard
disk drive motors that the Company purchased from motor vendors.
Papst sought an injunction and damages. The Company filed an
answer on September 4, 2002, denying Papst’s
complaint. On December 11, 2002, the lawsuit was
transferred to the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Louisiana and included in the consolidated pre-trial
proceedings occurring there. The lawsuit was stayed pending the
outcome of certain other related litigation.

On July 4, 2005, the Company entered into a Settlement and
License Agreement with Papst. In connection with the settlement,
the Company made a one-time payment of $24 million to Papst
on July 29, 2005, of which $19 million represented a
charge to selling, general and administrative expense for the
Company’s fiscal fourth quarter and $5 million had
been accrued in a prior year. In exchange for the payment, Papst
has dismissed with prejudice its lawsuit pending against the
Company, granted the Company a fully-paid license to certain
patents owned by Papst, and released the Company of all past,
present and future claims alleging infringement by the Company
of those Papst patents. The Settlement and License Agreement
resolved all outstanding litigation between the two companies
without any admission of infringement by the Company.

In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to
legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. Although the
ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial
impact with respect to these matters is subject to many
uncertainties and is therefore not predictable with assurance,
management believes that any monetary liability or financial
impact to the Company from these matters, individually and in
the aggregate, beyond that provided at July 1, 2005, would
not be material to the Company’s financial condition.
However, there can be no assurance with respect to such result,
and monetary liability or financial impact to the Company from
these legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims could differ
materially from those projected.

Note 7.

Shareholders’ Equity

Stock Incentive Plans

The Company has four stock-based incentive plans (collectively
referred to as the “Stock Plans”): The 2004
Performance Incentive Plan, the Employee Stock Option Plan, the
Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan and the Stock Option Plan for
Non-Employee Directors. Subsequent to the expiration of the
Employee Stock Option Plan on November 10, 2004 and
approval of the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan by the
Company’s shareholders on November 18, 2004, no new
awards are permitted under the Employee Stock Option Plan, the
Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan or the Stock Option Plan for
Non-Employee Directors (collectively referred to as the
“Prior Stock Plans”). As of July 1, 2005, options
to purchase 17.4 million shares of the Company’s
common stock remain outstanding under the Prior Stock Plans, of
which 11.4 million shares were exercisable and
0.3 million shares of restricted stock remain unvested.
Options granted under the Prior Stock Plans were generally
issued at the fair market value at the date of grant


WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and vested over periods from one to four years. Options granted
under the Prior Stock Plans expire either five or ten years from
the date of grant.

In November 2004, the Company’s shareholders approved the
2004 Performance Incentive Plan. The types of awards that may be
granted under the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan include stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock
bonuses and other forms of awards granted or denominated in the
Company’s common stock or units of the Company’s
common stock, as well as certain cash bonus awards. Persons
eligible to receive awards under the 2004 Performance Incentive
Plan include officers or employees of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, directors of the Company and certain consultants
and advisors to the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The
vesting of awards under the Performance Incentive Plan is
determined at the date of grant by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors. Each award expires on a date determined
at the date of grant; however, the maximum term of options,
stock appreciation rights and other rights to acquire common
stock under the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan is ten years
after the grant date of the award.

As of July 1, 2005, the maximum number of shares of the
Company’s common stock that are authorized for award grants
under the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan is 8.4 million
shares. Any shares subject to awards under the Prior Stock Plans
that are cancelled, forfeited, or otherwise terminate without
having vested or been exercised, as applicable, will become
available for other award grants under the 2004 Performance
Incentive Plan. The 2004 Performance Incentive Plan will
terminate on September 21, 2014 unless terminated earlier
by the Company’s Board of Directors.

Deferred Stock Compensation

The Company granted approximately 1.6 million and
0.1 million shares of restricted stock during 2005 and
2004, respectively. No shares of restricted stock were issued in
2003. The restricted stock vests annually over periods from two
to four years. The aggregate market value of the restricted
stock at the date of issuance was $17.1 million and
$1.3 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts
have been recorded as deferred compensation, a separate
component of shareholders’ equity, and are being amortized
to operating expense over the corresponding vesting periods.

During 2005, the Company also awarded certain executives and
other key employees 0.5 million restricted stock units with
performance-based vesting (“Performance Shares”). The
Performance Shares which are earned will become payable in
August 2008 in the form of Western Digital common stock on a
one-for-one basis. Compensation expense related to these
performance shares was $0.7 million in 2005.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company had an employee stock purchase plan
(“ESPP”) that operated in accordance with
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code whereby eligible
employees could authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of
their salary to purchase shares of the Company’s common
stock at 85% of the fair market value of common stock on the
date of grant or the exercise date, whichever was less.
Approximately 2.8 million shares of common stock remained
unissued under this plan at July 1, 2005. Approximately
1.6 million, 2.2 million and 2.1 million shares
were issued under this plan during 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Effective August 1, 2005, the Company
suspended its ESPP.

Fair Value Disclosures

Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per
share is required by SFAS 123. This information is required
to be determined as if the Company had accounted for its stock
options (including shares issued under the Stock Incentive Plans
and the ESPP, collectively called “Options”) granted
subsequent to July 1, 1995, under the fair value method of
that statement (see Note 1 for further information on pro
forma net income and earnings per share).

The pro forma income per share information for all stock options
granted on or prior to December 31, 2004 as well as all
ESPP shares granted on or prior to July 1, 2005 was
estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The
Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. The Black-Scholes
option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective
assumptions such as the expected stock price volatility and the
expected period until options are exercised. The pro forma
impact of applying SFAS 123 at July 1, 2005 is not
necessarily representative of future periods.

The fair values of the 2.5 million stock options granted on
or prior to December 31, 2004, all ESPP shares granted on
or prior to July 1, 2005 as well as all stock options
granted in fiscal years 2004 and 2003 have been estimated at the
date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with
the following weighted average assumptions:

Effective for the 1.9 million options granted after
December 31, 2004, the pro forma income per share
information was estimated using a binomial model. The binomial
model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions
including the expected stock price volatility, the expected
price multiple at which employees are likely to exercise options
and the expected employee termination rate.

The fair value of 2005 options valued using the binomial model
has been estimated using the following assumptions:

Stock Repurchase Program

WD announced a stock repurchase program on May 5, 2004.
Under the program, the Company may purchase on the open market
up to $100 million of its common stock depending on market
conditions and other corporate considerations. Stock repurchases
are expected to be funded principally by operating cash flow.
During 2005, WD repurchased 4.8 million shares of common
stock at a total cost of $45.0 million. In addition,
between July 2, 2005 and September 9, 2005 the company
repurchased 0.4 million shares of common stock at a cost of
$5.6 million. Since the inception of the program, and
through September 9, 2005, the Company has repurchased
7.1 million shares for a total cost of $66.6 million
(including commissions). WD may continue to repurchase its stock
as it deems appropriate and market conditions allow.

Stock Purchase Rights

In 1989, the Company implemented a plan to protect
shareholders’ rights in the event of a proposed takeover of
the Company. Under the plan, each share of the Company’s
outstanding common stock carried one Right to Purchase
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the
“Right”). The Right enabled the holder, under certain
circumstances, to purchase common stock of Western Digital or of
an acquiring company at a substantially discounted price ten
days after a person or group publicly announces it has acquired
or has tendered an offer for 15% or more of the Company’s
outstanding common stock. On September 10, 1998, the
Company’s Board of Directors approved the adoption of a new
Rights plan to replace the previous plan, which expired in
September 1998. The Rights under the 1998 plan were similar to
the rights under the 1989 plan except they were redeemable by
the Company at $.01 per Right and expired in 2008. In
connection with the establishment of a holding company structure
on April 6, 2001, the Company terminated the Rights under
the 1998 plan and adopted a new Rights plan. The 2001 plan is
similar to the terminated 1998 plan, except that the exercise
price was reduced from $150.00 to $50.00 per share and the
expiration date for the 2001 Rights plan was extended to April
2011.

The Western Digital Corporation 401(k)
    Plan

Effective July 1, 1991, the Company adopted the Western
Digital Corporation 401(k) Plan (the “Plan”) formerly
known as the Western Digital Corporation Retirement Savings and
Profit Sharing Plan. The Plan covers substantially all domestic
employees, subject to certain eligibility requirements. The
Company may make annual contributions to the Plan at the
discretion of the Board of Directors. For 2005, 2004 and 2003
the Company made contributions to the Plan of $3.0 million,
$2.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively.

The tax benefits associated with the exercise of non-qualified
stock options, the disqualifying disposition of stock acquired
with incentive stock options and the disqualifying disposition
of stock acquired under the employee stock purchase plan
generally reduce taxes currently payable. However, no amounts
were recorded to additional paid-in capital in 2005, 2004 and
2003 because their realization did not meet the “more
likely than not” standard and, consequently, a valuation
allowance was recorded against the entire benefit. The valuation
allowance attributable to benefits to be potentially recognized

Remaining net undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries
at July 1, 2005 on which no United States tax has been
provided amounted to approximately $606.2 million. The net
undistributed earnings are intended to finance local operating
requirements. Accordingly, an additional United States tax
provision has not been made on these earnings.

The Company determines deferred taxes for each of its tax-paying
subsidiaries within each tax jurisdiction. The deferred tax
assets indicated above are attributable primarily to tax
jurisdictions where a history of earnings has not been
established. The taxable earnings in these tax jurisdictions are
subject to volatility. Therefore, the Company believes a
valuation allowance is needed to reduce the deferred tax asset
to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

Reconciliation of the United States Federal statutory rate to
the Company’s effective tax rate is as follows for the
years ended July 1, 2005, July 2, 2004 and

impact of these tax holidays and tax incentives was to increase
the Company’s net earnings by $66.7 million

Item 9A.

Controls and
    Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that
are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding
required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives, and management is required to apply its
judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures.

As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), the Company carried out
an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of the Company’s management, including the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
covered by this report.

Based on the foregoing, the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the
end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that the
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

The Company’s management evaluated the effectiveness of its
internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

. Based on its evaluation, the
Company’s management concluded that its internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the
Company’s last fiscal year.

KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that
audited the consolidated financial statements included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation
report on management’s assessment of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. See page 40
herein.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

There has been no change in the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting during the Company’s most recent
fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting.


Inherent Limitations of Effectiveness of Controls

The Company’s management, including its Chief Executive
Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that
its disclosure controls and procedures or its internal control
over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. Further, the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty,
and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or
mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the
individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
people, or by management override of the control. The design of
any system of controls is also based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of
the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
detected.
