PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Western Digital Corporation (the “Company” or
“Western Digital”) designs, develops, manufactures and
markets hard drives featuring leading-edge technology. A hard
drive is a storage device found in most computers that stores
data on one or more rotating magnetic disks that provide fast
access to data that must be readily available to users of
computers or other devices. The Company’s hard drives are
designed for the desktop PC market and for the emerging market
for hard drives specially designed for digital audio-visual
applications, such as new digital video recording devices,
digital cable set-top boxes, satellite television boxes, audio/
visual juke boxes and video game devices. The Company’s hard
 drive products currently include 3.5-inch form factor hard
drives ranging in storage capacity from 7.5 gigabytes
(“GB”) to 45.0 GB. The Company sells its products
worldwide to computer manufacturers for inclusion in their
computer systems or subsystems and to distributors, resellers and
 retailers. The Company’s products are currently
manufactured in Malaysia. In January 2000, the Company
announced its decision to exit the market for hard drives
manufactured for enterprise computer systems and closed its
Rochester, Minnesota enterprise hard drive design center.

The Company continuously evaluates opportunities to extend its
data storage product offerings and to expand beyond the
traditional market for hard drives into new markets which meet
certain predefined criteria. The Company considers new or high
growth markets for data or content storage, management, and
communication which have few entrenched competitors and offer the
 prospect of a sustained competitive advantage through unique or
proprietary technology. In February 1999, the Company
acquired Connex, Inc. (“Connex”), a San Jose-based
startup company formed to develop storage solutions for the
Windows NT and UNIX server environments for the rapidly changing
storage market. Connex’s first product, the
“N3000™” is a network attached storage
(“NAS”) appliance targeted at workgroups and small
departments where multiple users access shared data files over a
local area network. Connex has also developed a suite of software
 products for the management of a storage area network
(“SAN”). For further discussion of Connex, see under
the heading “Products — Products Developed by
Connex”, and see Part II, Item 7, under the
heading “Risk factors relating to Western Digital
particularly.”

In February 2000, the Company contributed the assets
comprising its emerging business in analytical software for data
warehouses to a newly formed subsidiary, SageTree, Inc.
(“SageTree”). The Company formed this subsidiary in
anticipation of the possibility of obtaining financing from
outside the Company for the operation and development of this
emerging business. In June 2000, SageTree received a direct
investment from NCR Corporation in exchange for a minority
interest in SageTree. SageTree has expanded the functionality of
its software and now offers SageQuest™, a software package
for enterprise-wide supply chain management, product lifecycle
management and decision support in the manufacturing industry.
For further discussion of SageTree, see Part II,
Item 7, under the heading “Risk factors relating to
Western Digital particularly.”

The Company will monitor the development of new markets related
to data or content storage and storage management, and
communication of digital content and network intelligence, and
may from time to time offer new products or services to address
appropriate new markets.

Industry

Desktop PC Market.

According to International Data
Corporation, the desktop computer segment is the largest segment
of the worldwide personal computer market, accounting for
approximately 78% of global personal computer shipments in
calendar 1999. As a result, desktop computers were the leading
source of demand for hard drives, accounting for more than 70% of
 all hard drive units shipped worldwide in calendar 1999,
according to International Data Corporation. Over 90% of Western
Digital’s hard drive unit shipments in 2000 were sold to
this market. Desktop personal computers for entry level to
experienced users are used in


both commercial and consumer environments. The demand for hard
drive capacity continues to grow in part due to:

Future demand growth for desktop computer hard drives also may be
 driven by new and emerging hard drive markets. In
August 2000, International Data Corporation forecasted that
the worldwide desktop computer hard drive market would grow from
approximately 133 million units in calendar 1999 to 247 million
units in calendar 2004, reflecting a compound annual growth rate
of approximately 13.2%. However, it forecasts that revenue growth
 will only be approximately 3.6% through calendar 2004,
reflecting the impact of severe price competition. See
Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk factors
related to the hard drive industry in which we operate.”

Desktop PCs are used in a number of environments, ranging from
homes to businesses and multi-user networks. Software
applications are used on desktop PCs primarily word processing,
spreadsheet, desktop publishing, database management, multimedia,
 entertainment and other related applications. Desktop PCs
typically utilize the Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics
(“EIDE”) interface for their hard drives. The Company
believes the minimum storage requirements in the past year for
entry-level PCs were generally 6.8 GB to 10.2 GB of
formatted capacity.

The industry continues to supply increased capacity per unit as
users’ system needs increase and technological and
manufacturing advances continue to make higher capacity drives
more affordable. In the mainstream desktop PC market, the Company
 believes that the rate of increase in storage capacity per unit
has recently outpaced the rate of increase in demand for such
capacity. This will result in the Company changing its product
mix, with an increasing percentage of lower capacity hard drives
manufactured with fewer heads and disks per unit. The Company
believes that even though units demanded will increase, this
changing product mix will reduce the average selling price per
hard drive unit in the desktop PC market. In contrast, the
emerging use of hard drives to record and play back audio and
video content in the audio-visual market is expected to create
demand for storage capacity that will exceed the growth in demand
 for increased capacity in the desktop PC market. Overall,
industry sources believe that the current rate of increase in
storage capacity per unit shipped will continue for the
foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Company believes that
time-to-market, time-to-volume and time-to-quality leadership
with higher capacity drives at attractive price levels will
continue to be critical to its future success in serving this
market.

Users of desktop PCs, especially entry-level desktop PCs, have
become increasingly price sensitive. In 1999 the market for
desktop PC’s priced below $1,000 grew significantly, and in
2000 the market for desktop PC’s priced below $800 was the
fastest growing segment of the market. These systems typically do
 not contain high performance hard drives, but the growth of
these segments has placed downward price pressure on higher cost
systems as well, thereby contributing to the increasing price
pressures on desktop hard drives. The Company has development
efforts underway to specifically address the entry-level consumer
 PC market. See Part II, Item 7, under the heading
“Risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we
 operate.”

Products

The Company’s WD Caviar® and WD Protege™ brand
products are designed to serve the advanced and value portions,
respectively, of the desktop PC hard drive market, and its WD
Performer™ brand products are designed to serve the emerging
 audio-visual portion of the hard drive market.

Desktop PC Products.

The WD Caviar family currently
consists of 1.0” high, 3.5-inch form factor products with
capacities ranging from 7.5 GB to 45.0 GB and rotation
speeds of 5400 and 7200 revolutions per minutes
(“rpm”). In 1998 the Company introduced the Data
Lifeguard™ feature, an exclusive data reliability


feature which is now implemented in all of the Company’s
hard drives. Data Lifeguard protects end-user data by
automatically detecting, isolating, and repairing possible
problem areas on the hard drive before data loss can occur. The
WD Caviar products utilize the EIDE interface, providing high
performance while retaining ease of use and overall low cost of
connection. The type of EIDE interface currently used in
substantially all of the Company’s desktop PC hard drives is
 ATA/ 66, which signifies an internal data transfer rate of 66
megabytes per second, approximately twice as fast as the previous
 generation of EIDE interface. The Company currently sells a line
 of hard drives and related adapters which are designed to
accommodate an interface known as “1394/ Firewire/
i.Link”, for use primarily in connecting digital consumer
electronic devices, such as digital video camcorders.

The WD Caviar product line generally leverages a common
architecture or “platform” for various products with
different capacities to serve the differing needs of the desktop
PC market. This platform strategy results in commonality of
components across different products, which reduces exposure to
changes in demand, facilitates inventory management and allows
the Company to achieve lower costs through economies of scale
purchasing. This platform strategy also enables computer
manufacturer customers to leverage their qualification efforts
onto successive product models. The Company expects to utilize
the WD Caviar platform strategy as it develops products for the
emerging market for hard drives specifically designed for
audio-visual applications, such as new digital video recording
devices.

Products for Emerging Audio-visual Markets.

Audio-visual
content stored for entertainment has historically been stored on
removable media, such as compact disks (“CDs”), digital
 video disks (“DVDs”), and videotape. These media have
also been used to transport and deliver the content. The
emergence of broadband communications as a means of delivery of
digital content makes it unnecessary to use the removable media
itself for delivery. This allows hard drives to become the
storage media for this digital, audio-visual content as it is
delivered through broadband communications. This has led to the
use of hard drives in products for consumer broadband
communications networks, such as cable and satellite networks.
Audio-visual applications such as digital video recording devices
 represent a developing market opportunity for the Company’s
 hard drive technologies. Hard drive technology makes it possible
 to simultaneously record and play back content; to pause and
skip forward and backward during live broadcasts; and to rapidly
access large amounts of audio-visual content.

The Company offers customized design capabilities and unique hard
 drive technologies for consumer applications; however, where
practical, the Company intends to leverage its existing product
line architectures for the various products for the audio-visual
market. The Company is currently offering the WD Performer™
hard drive line, designed for use in consumer audio-video
applications. It is also developing hard drives and products
incorporating hard drive technology for consumer electronics
products including digital cable set-top boxes, satellite
television boxes, audio-visual juke boxes and video game devices.
 Because the market for these products has not yet developed, it
is too early to project the likely size and growth of such
market. For further discussion of this product development
effort, see Part II, Item 7, under the heading
“Risk factors relating to Western Digital
particularly.”

Products Developed by Connex.

Connex offers a network
attached storage appliance, the N3000™, featuring a fully
integrated controller, up to six hard drives, an integrated tape
for backup, automatic connectivity for remote management, and
plug-and-play installation capability. The system includes
Connex’s storage management software. Connex is offering an
expanded version of this product, the N3100™, which features
 up to eight hard drives. The systems are marketed to workgroups
and small departments where multiple users access shared data
files over a local area network. Connex has also developed a
suite of software products for the management of a storage area
network. A storage area network is a network of storage devices
connected by Fibre Channel or other high-speed network, which
allows an enterprise to store and manage large amounts of data in
 a centralized method off of an enterprise’s local area
network. Connex’s SANavigator™ product, manages the
overall SAN, discovers SAN devices, physically and logically maps
 devices, manages data paths, launches other applications,
monitors the health of the SAN and remedies problems through an
intuitive, easy-to-use graphical user interface. Connex sells its
 products through distributors and value-added resellers and is
targeting select original equipment manufacturers. Its hardware
products are manufactured by third parties under contract
manufacturing arrangements, in accordance with


Connex’s designs and specifications. For further discussion
of Connex, see Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk
 factors relating to Western Digital particularly.”

Products Developed by SageTree.

SageTree offers analytical
 software, branded SageQuest™, and services for
enterprise-wide supply chain intelligence, product lifecycle
intelligence and decision support in the manufacturing industry.
The SageQuest™ software is a Web-based suite of packaged
analytic applications designed for the manufacturing industry.
The applications collect and synthesize dissimilar data across an
 enterprise and transform the data into customized, accurate
reports that assist management in solving business and
operational issues. This allows rapid analysis and management of
a manufacturer’s products and components at all stages of
the product lifecycle, including products in manufacturing and in
 the field. The applications use advanced analytics and data
warehousing technology to create “supply chain
intelligence”. The objectives of supply chain intelligence
include improved manufacturing yield, product quality and
reliability, and customer satisfaction. The Company expects to
begin selling SageQuest software in 2001.

SageTree also offers professional services for data warehousing
and analytic applications, including manufacturing and supply
chain consulting, implementation services, advanced analytics,
training and post-implementation support.

Technology and Product Development

Hard drives are used to record, store and retrieve digital data.
Their performance attributes are currently better than removable
or floppy disks, optical disk drives and tape, and they are more
cost effective than semiconductor technology. The primary
measures of hard drive performance include:

All of the Company’s hard drive products employ similar
technology. The main components of the hard drive are the head
disk assembly and the printed circuit board. The head disk
assembly includes the head, media (disks), head positioning
mechanism (actuator) and spin motor. These components are
contained in a hard base plate protective package in a
contamination-free environment. The printed circuit board
includes custom integrated circuits, an interface connector to
the host computer and a power connector.

The head disk assembly is comprised of one or more disks
positioned around a spindle hub that rotates the disks by a spin
motor. Disks are made of a smooth substrate to which a thin
coating of magnetic materials is applied. Each disk has a head
suspended directly above it, which can read data from or write
data to the spinning disk. The sensor element of the head, also
known as the slider, is getting progressively smaller, resulting
in reduced material costs.

The integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically
include a drive interface and a controller. The drive interface
receives instructions from the computer, while the controller
directs the flow of data to or from the disks and controls the
heads. The location of data on each disk is logically maintained
in concentric tracks which are divided into sectors. The computer
 sends instructions to the controller to read data from or write
data to the disks based on track and sector locations. Guided by
instructions from the controller, the head stack assembly is
pivoted and swung across the disk by a head actuator or motor
until it reaches the selected track of a disk, where the data is
recorded or retrieved.

Industry standard interfaces are utilized to allow the disk drive
 to communicate with the computer. Currently, the primary
interface for desktop PCs is EIDE. Increasingly, work station
computers are using the EIDE interface as well. As computer
performance continues to improve, the hard drive will need to
deliver information faster than this interface can handle.
Accordingly the desktop PC industry plans to transition to


higher speed interfaces to handle the higher data transfer rates.
 The Company is working to develop products that will support
these higher speed interfaces.

Storage capacity of the hard drive is determined by the number of
 disks and each disk’s areal density, which is a measure of
the amount of data that can be stored on the recording surface of
 the disk. Areal density is generally measured in megabits per
square inch of disk surface. The higher the areal density, the
more information can be stored on a single platter. As the areal
density increases, fewer disks and/or heads are required to
achieve a given drive capacity, thus reducing product costs
through reduced component requirements.

Head technology is one of the variables affecting areal density.
The desktop hard drive industry has completed a transition to
magnetoresistive head technology, which allows significantly
higher storage capacities than the previously utilized thin-film
head technology. Magnetoresistive heads have discrete read and
write structures which provide more signal than the older
thin-film inductive heads. This allows significantly higher areal
 densities, which increases storage capacity per disk and
improves manufacturing margin and product reliability. The
Company completed the transition to magnetoresistive head
technology in 1999 and in 2000 completed the transition to the
next generation of head technology, known as giant
magnetoresistive. Certain of the Company’s competitors in
the desktop PC hard drive market moved more quickly than the
Company into magnetoresistive head technology, achieving
time-to-market leadership at higher capacity points; however, the
 Company was a leader in the transition to giant magnetoresistive
 head technology. The Company began volume shipments of its first
 giant magnetoresistive-based hard drive products for the desktop
 PC market in the third quarter of 1999, and currently all of the
 Company’s desktop product offerings employ giant
magnetoresistive head technology.

Constant innovations in research and development are essential to
 the Company’s ability to compete. Hard drive providers are
evaluating or implementing a number of technological innovations
designed to further increase hard drive performance and reduce
product costs, including simplifying the electronic architecture
by combining the traditional controller, channel, microprocessor
and servo-interface management functions of traditional hard
drive microprocessors on a single integrated circuit. Moreover,
to consistently achieve timely introduction and rapid volume
production of new products, some hard drive providers are
striving to simplify their product design processes by focusing
on creating extendible core technology platforms which utilize
common firmware and mechanical designs and re-use of
manufacturing tooling and application specific integrated
circuits across various product generations and product lines.

Sales and Distribution

The Company sells its products globally to computer
manufacturers, distributors, value-added resellers, dealers,
system integrators, retailers and internet-based retailers.
Manufacturers typically purchase components such as hard drives
and assemble them into the computer systems they build.
Distributors typically sell the Company’s drives to small
manufacturers, dealers, system integrators and other resellers.

Manufacturers.

Sales to manufacturers accounted for 69%,
70% and 65% of consolidated revenues in 1998, 1999 and 2000,
respectively. The Company’s major computer manufacturer
customers include Apple Computer, Compaq Computer, Dell Computer,
 Fujitsu, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Micron
Electronics and NEC. During 1998, 1999 and 2000, sales to Compaq
accounted for 14%, 21%, and 21% of revenues, respectively. The
Company believes that its success depends on its ability to
maintain and improve its strong relationships with the leading
computer manufacturers. Western Digital, Quantum, Maxtor and
Seagate have historically had the highest market share with these
 manufacturers. The increase in the number of qualified suppliers
 to the leading manufacturers, combined with the continued growth
 of the sub-$1,000 PC market, has placed continuous downward
pressure on hard drive prices. This pressure, in turn, has
reduced average gross margins for hard drive suppliers.

The leading PC computer manufacturers have been gaining market
share, which has increased their purchasing leverage over
component suppliers. In calendar year 1999, the top ten desktop
personal computer manufacturers accounted for more than 40% of
all shipments and a significant amount of the growth in the


desktop PC market. As a result, maintaining customer satisfaction
 with these leading computer manufacturers has become even more
critical.

Computer manufacturers typically seek to qualify up to three or
four providers for each generation of hard drives. Once a
computer manufacturer has chosen its qualified hard drive vendors
 for a given product, it generally will purchase hard drives from
 those vendors for the life of that product. To achieve
consistent success with computer manufacturers’
qualifications, a hard drive supplier must be an early provider
of next generation hard drives featuring leading technology and
high capacity per disk. Suppliers must quickly achieve volume
production of high quality and reliable hard drives. To quickly
achieve high volume production, a hard drive supplier must have
access to flexible, high-capacity, high-quality manufacturing
capabilities. Factors on which computer manufacturers evaluate
their hard drive suppliers include overall quality, storage
capacities, performance characteristics, price, ease of doing
business, and the supplier’s long-term financial stability.

The business models of computer manufacturers are in the process
of changing, and these changes have impacted and will continue to
 impact Western Digital’s sales, inventory and distribution
patterns. The forecast-driven, long-production-run logistics
model, which most of the computer industry has used, exposes
manufacturers and others in the distribution chain to the risk of
 carrying excess or obsolete inventories. The historical model
limits the computer manufacturers’ flexibility to react to
rapid technology changes and component pricing fluctuations. In
response, the leading manufacturers require their hard drive
suppliers to maintain a small base stock of finished product in
locations adjacent to the customers’ manufacturing
facilities. In addition, some of the Company’s customers
have implemented a supply chain logistics model that combines
“build-to-order” (computer manufacturer does not build
until there is an order backlog) and “contract
manufacturing” (computer manufacturer contracts assembly
work to a contract manufacturer who purchases components and
assembles the computer based on the computer manufacturer’s
instructions.) The Company then ships hard drives directly to the
 assembler for installation at its location. The Company has
adapted its logistics model to effectively align with these
industry shifts. These changes require greater skill in managing
finished goods inventory and more flexibility in manufacturing,
both of which in turn require even closer relationships between
the Company and its computer manufacturer and contract
manufacturer customers. To meet these challenges the Company is
expanding its use of Internet technology and web-based supply
chain planning tools. In June 2000, the Company invested as a
founder in a start-up company, eHitex, Inc., formed by major
suppliers and purchasers of components for personal computer
manufacturing to operate an Internet marketplace for such
components. For an additional discussion of the changes in
customer models, refer to Part II, Item 7, under the
headings “Risk factors related to Western Digital
particularly,” and “Risk factors related to the hard
drive industry in which we operate.”

The Company maintains a base stock of two to three weeks of
current, finished goods inventory for certain key computer
manufacturer customers in facilities located adjacent to their
operations. Inventory at these locations usually includes minor
product customizations (such as labeling) for the related
computer manufacturer. If subsequent to its initial order the
computer manufacturer changes its requirements, inventory held at
 these facilities can be sold to other computer manufacturers or
distributors as is or with minor modifications (such as a change
in labeling) at little or no additional cost. Therefore, these
arrangements, even if not fulfilled, have minimal impact on
inventory valuation.

Distributors.

The Company uses a select group of
distributors to sell its products to small computer
manufacturers, value-added resellers, resellers and systems
integrators. The Company’s major distributor customers
include ASI, CHS, Decision Support Systems, ELD, Ingram Micro,
Merisel, Servex, Synnex and Tech Data. Distributors and retailers
 combined accounted for approximately 31%, 30%, and 35% of disk
drive revenue for 1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively.
Distributors generally enter into non-exclusive agreements with
the Company for purchase and redistribution of product on a quick
 turnover basis. Purchase orders are placed and revised on a
weekly basis.

Retailers.

The Company sells its retail-packaged products
directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer
superstores, warehouse clubs and computer electronics stores and
authorizes sales through distributors to smaller retailers. Major
 retailers to whom the Company sells directly include Best Buy,
Carrefour, Circuit City, CompUSA, Dixons, Office Depot and Vobis.
 Retailers accounted for approximately


5%, 6%, and 5% of revenue for 1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively.
 The Company’s current retail customer base is in the United
 States and Canada. The retail channel complements the
Company’s other sales channels while helping to build brand
awareness for the Company and its products. Retailers supply the
aftermarket “upgrade” sector in which end-users
purchase and install products to upgrade their computers. The
Company grants certain of its retailers price protection and
limited rights to return product on a rotation basis. The Company
 also sells its retail-packaged products through the Internet, at
 its Web Site, http://www.westerndigital.com.

The Company maintains sales offices throughout North America,
Eastern and Western Europe, the Middle East, Japan and Southeast
Asia. Field application engineering is provided to strategic
computer manufacturer accounts, and end-user technical support
services are provided within the United States and Europe. The
Company’s end-user technical support is supplied by both
employees and qualified third-party support organizations through
 telephone support during business hours and via the
Company’s web site.

The Company’s international sales, which include sales to
foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies, represented 43%, 45%, and
 53% of revenues for fiscal years 1998, 1999 and 2000,
respectively. Sales to international customers may be subject to
certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations,
including exposure to tariffs, various trade regulations and
fluctuations in currency exchange rates. See Part II,
Item 7, under the heading “Risk factors relating to
Western Digital particularly.”

For information concerning revenue recognition, sales by
geographic region and significant customer information, see
Notes 1 and 7, respectively, of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The Company’s marketing and advertising functions are
performed both internally and through outside firms. Advertising,
 direct marketing, worldwide packaging and marketing materials
are targeted to various end-user segments. Western Digital
utilizes both consumer media and trade publications. The Company
has programs under which qualifying manufacturers and resellers
are reimbursed for certain advertising expenditures. Western
Digital also invests in direct marketing and customer
satisfaction programs. The Company maintains ongoing contact with
 end users through primary and secondary market research, focus
groups, product registrations and technical support databases.

Competition

In the desktop product market, the Company competes primarily
with Fujitsu, IBM, Maxtor, Quantum, Samsung and Seagate.

The hard drive industry is intensely competitive, with hard drive
 suppliers competing for a limited number of major customers.
Hard drives manufactured by different competitors are highly
substitutable due to the industry mandate of technical form, fit
and function standards. Hard drive manufacturers compete on the
basis of product quality and reliability, storage capacity, unit
price, product performance, production volume capabilities,
delivery capability, leadership in time-to-market, time-to-volume
 and time-to-quality and ease of doing business. The relative
importance of these factors varies among different customer and
market segments. The Company believes that it is generally
competitive in all of these factors.

The Company believes that it cannot differentiate its hard drive
products solely on attributes such as storage capacity;
therefore, the Company also differentiates itself by designing
and incorporating into its hard drives desirable product
performance attributes and by emphasizing rapid response with its
 computer manufacturer and distribution customers and brand
equity with its end users. These product performance attributes
include seek time, data transfer rates, intelligent caching,
failure prediction, remote diagnostics, acoustics and data
recovery. Rapid response requires accelerated design cycles,
customer delivery and production flexibility, which contribute to
 customer satisfaction. Data storage has become strategically
critical for computer end users. Consequently, the Company
believes that trust in a manufacturer’s reputation has
become an important factor in the selection of a hard drive,
particularly within such a rapidly changing technology
environment. The Company believes it has strong brand equity with
 its end users.

The Company’s market share eroded in 1998, primarily due to
competitive conditions in the hard drive industry (with resulting
 cutbacks in production), the timing of the Company’s
transition from thin film to


magnetoresistive head technology and certain manufacturing and
performance issues encountered as the Company extended thin film
head technology to its limits. The Company completed its
transition to magnetoresistive technology in 1999 and completed
its transition to giant magnetoresistive technology in 2000.
During the first quarter of 2000, the Company lost market share
as a result of a previously announced product recall; however,
the Company recovered some of its market share as it regained a
leadership position in quality and time-to-market during the
remainder of 2000.

The desktop hard drive market is characterized by more
competitors and shorter product life cycles than the enterprise
hard drive market; therefore, it has traditionally been subject
to periods of sustained and severe price competition, and factors
 such as time-to-market can have a more pronounced effect on the
success of any particular product.

In the network attached storage market, Connex competes primarily
 with established server companies like Compaq and Dell and with
network attached storage makers Hewlett Packard and ProComm. The
Company expects that the products under development by Connex
will face significant competition from established manufacturers
of servers and of network attached storage devices. For an
additional discussion of the challenges facing Connex, see
Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk factors
related to Western Digital particularly.”

Advances in magnetic, optical or other data storage technologies
could result in competitive products that have better performance
 or lower cost per unit of capacity than the Company’s hard
drive products. High-speed semiconductor memory could compete
with the Company’s hard drive products in the future.
Semiconductor memory is much faster than magnetic disk drives,
but currently is volatile (i.e., subject to loss of data in the
event of power failure) and much more costly. Flash memory, a
nonvolatile semiconductor memory, is currently much more costly
and, while it has higher “read” performance than hard
drives, it has lower “write” performance. Flash memory
could become competitive in the near future for applications
requiring less storage capacity than hard drives can provide.

For an additional discussion of competition, see Part II,
Item 7, under the heading “Risk factors related to the
hard drive industry in which we operate.”

Service and Warranty

Western Digital generally warrants its newly manufactured hard
drives against defects in materials and workmanship for a period
of one to three years from the date of sale. The Company’s
warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement
 of the hard drive. The Company has contracted with a third party
 in the United States to process and test returned hard drives
for the Company’s end users. The Company refurbishes or
repairs its products at a third-party service facility located in
 Singapore and at a third-party service facility located in
Germany.

Manufacturing

To be competitive, Western Digital must manufacture high quality
hard drives with industry leading time-to-volume production at
competitive unit cost. The Company strives to maintain
manufacturing flexibility, rapidly achieve high manufacturing
yields and acquire high-quality components in required volumes at
 competitive prices. The critical elements of Western
Digital’s hard drive production are high volume, low cost
assembly and testing, and establishment and maintenance of key
vendor relationships in order to create “virtual vertical
integration.” By establishing partner relationships with its
 strategic component suppliers, the Company believes it is able
to access “best-of-class” manufacturing quality without
 the substantial capital investment associated with actual
vertical integration. In addition, the Company believes that its
virtual vertical integration model enables it to have the
business flexibility needed to select the highest quality low
cost suppliers as product designs and technologies evolve.

Hard drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the
assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and
extensive testing to ensure reliability. The assembly process
occurs in a “clean room” environment which demands
skill in process engineering and efficient utilization of the
“clean room” layout in


order to reduce the high operating costs of this manufacturing
environment. The Company’s clean room manufacturing process
consists of modular production units, each of which contains a
number of work cells. With the completed transition to
magnetoresistive head technology for desktop PC hard drives, the
Company has recently increased its factory yields on desktop PC
hard drives to its historically high levels.

The Company produces hard drives in one plant in Malaysia. As a
continuation of its virtual vertical integration model, the
Company sold its media manufacturing division in 1999 to Komag,
Inc. (“Komag”). With the sale of this division, the
Company now purchases all of the standard mechanical components
and micro controllers for its hard drives from external
suppliers.

The Company continually evaluates its manufacturing processes in
an effort to increase productivity and decrease manufacturing
costs. In order to address inventory oversupply, the Company has
reduced excess manufacturing capacity by closing two
manufacturing facilities in Singapore and relocating desktop hard
 drive production to Malaysia. The Company continually evaluates
which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from
automation and how automated manufacturing processes support the
Company’s business plans.

For an additional discussion of manufacturing, see Part II,
Item 7, under the heading “Risk factors relating to
Western Digital particularly.”

Research and Development

The Company devotes substantial resources to development of new
products and improvement of existing products. The Company
focuses its engineering efforts on coordinating its product
design and manufacturing processes in order to bring its products
 to market in a cost-effective and timely manner. Research and
development expenses totaled $203.7, $217.0, and $163.2 million
in 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively. Research and development
expenditures included approximately $22.0 million, primarily
related to the initiation of the IBM relationship in 1998, and
approximately $12.0 million related to the acquisition of Connex
in 1999.

For a discussion of product development, see Part II,
Item 7, under the heading “Risk factors related to the
hard drive industry in which we operate.”

Materials and Supplies

The principal components currently used in the manufacture of the
 Company’s hard drives are magnetic heads and related head
stack assemblies, media, controllers, spindle motors and
mechanical parts used in the head-disk assembly. In addition to
its own proprietary semiconductor devices, the Company also uses
standard semiconductor components such as logic, memory and
microprocessor devices obtained from other manufacturers and a
wide variety of other parts, including connectors, cables, and
other interconnect technology.

Unlike some of its competitors, the Company acquires all of the
components for its products from third-party suppliers. In
general, the Company tries to have at least two or three
suppliers for each of its component requirements. For example,
the Company currently buys giant magnetoresistive heads from IBM,
 Read-Rite and SAE. Media requirements are purchased from several
 outside vendors including Komag, IBM and HMT Technology. Komag
and HMT Technology have publicly announced a plan to merge. In
connection with the sale of its media manufacturing division to
Komag in April 1999, the Company entered into a three-year
volume purchase agreement with Komag. Under this Agreement, the
Company is obligated to purchase a substantial portion of its
requirements for hard disk media from Komag. The Agreement does
not require the Company to purchase a fixed minimum amount of
media from Komag.

Some custom integrated circuits are currently sole-sourced from
Cirrus Logic and STMicroelectronics. Because of their custom
nature, these products require significant design-in periods and
long lead times. There has been a trend in integrated circuit
design toward increased integration of various separate circuits.
 The Company expects this trend to continue in the area of custom
 integrated circuits for hard drives.

For an additional discussion of component supplies, see Part II,
Item 7, under the heading “Risk factors relating to
Western Digital particularly.”


Backlog

At September 18, 2000, the Company’s backlog,
consisting of orders scheduled for delivery within the next
twelve months, was approximately $294 million, compared with a
backlog at August 21, 1999 of approximately $388 million.
The Company expects all this backlog to be delivered within the
current fiscal year. Historically, a substantial portion of the
Company’s orders has been for shipments within 30 to
60 days of the placement of the order. The Company generally
 negotiates pricing, order lead times, product support
requirements and other terms and conditions prior to receiving a
computer manufacturer’s first purchase order for a product.
Manufacturers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled
with relatively short notice to the Company, with little or no
cost to the customer, or modified by customers to provide for
delivery at a later date. Also, certain of the Company’s
sales to computer manufacturers are made under
“just-in-time” delivery contracts that do not generally
 require firm order commitments by the customer until the time of
 sale. Therefore, backlog information as of the end of a
particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels
of the Company’s revenue and profit and may not be
comparable to earlier periods.

Patents, Licenses and Proprietary Information

The Company owns numerous patents and has many patent
applications in process. The Company believes that, although its
patents and patent applications have significant value, the
successful manufacturing and marketing of its products depends
primarily upon the technical competence and creative ability of
its personnel. Accordingly, the patents held and applied for do
not assure the Company’s future success.

In addition to patent protection of certain intellectual property
 rights, the Company considers elements of its product designs
and processes to be proprietary and confidential. The Company
believes that its nonpatented intellectual property, particularly
 some of its process technology, is an important factor in its
success. Western Digital relies upon employee, consultant, and
vendor non-disclosure agreements and a system of internal
safeguards to protect its proprietary information. Despite these
safeguards, there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use
such information. The laws of foreign jurisdictions in which the
Company does business also may provide less protection for
confidential information than the United States.

The Company relies on certain technology that is licensed from
other parties in order to manufacture and sell its products. The
Company has cross-licensing agreements with several competitors,
customers and suppliers, and the Company believes that it has
adequate licenses and other agreements in place in addition to
its own intellectual property portfolio to compete successfully
in the hard drive industry.

For additional discussion of intellectual property, see Part II,
Item 7, under the heading “Risk factors relating to
Western Digital particularly.”

Environmental Regulation

The Company is subject to a variety of regulations in connection
with its operations. It believes that it has obtained or is in
the process of obtaining all necessary permits for its domestic
operations.

Employees

As of June 30, 2000, the Company employed a total of 7,321
full-time employees worldwide. This represents a reduction in
headcount of approximately 30% since July 3, 1999, as the
Company responded to the industry downturn and its decrease in
sales by restructuring and exiting the enterprise hard drive
market. The Company employed 1,090 employees in the United
States, 6,040 employees in Malaysia, 85 in Singapore, and 106 at
its international sales offices as of such date.

Many of the Company’s employees are highly skilled, and the
Company’s continued success depends in part upon its ability
 to attract and retain such employees. Accordingly, the Company
offers employee benefit programs which it believes are at least
equivalent to those offered by its competitors. Despite these
programs, the Company has, along with most of its competitors,
experienced difficulty at times in hiring and retaining certain
skilled personnel. In critical areas, the Company has utilized
consultants and contract personnel to fill these needs until
full-time employees could be recruited. The Company has never
experienced a work


stoppage, none of its domestic employees are represented by a
labor organization, and the Company considers its employee
relations to be good.

Item 2.

Properties

The Company’s worldwide headquarters, located on leased
property in Irvine, California, house management, research and
development, administrative and sales personnel. The Company has
extended the current lease of this facility through
January 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company
 signed a new 10-year lease agreement and plans to relocate its
worldwide headquarters to a facility in Lake Forest, California,
commencing in November 2000. The Company leases facilities in San
 Jose, California and Irvine, California, for research and
development activities. The San Jose leases expire at various
times beginning in December 2002 through July 2006. The
 Irvine research and development facility lease expires in
September 2010. Western Digital owns a manufacturing
facility in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. During 2000 the Company sold
approximately 34 acres of land in Irvine, California, upon which
it had previously planned to build a new corporate headquarters,
for $26 million (the approximate cost of the land). The Company
also sold its enterprise drive manufacturing facility in Tuas,
Singapore for $11.0 million (for a gain of $3.1 million) and its
Rochester, Minnesota enterprise research and development facility
 for $29.7 million (for a loss of $1.9 million).

The Company also leases office space in various other locations
throughout the world primarily for sales and technical support.
The Company’s present facilities are adequate for its
current needs, although the process of upgrading its facilities
to meet technological and market requirements is expected to
continue. The hard drive industry does not generally require long
 lead time to develop and begin operations in new manufacturing
facilities.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These
statements relate to the Company’s legal proceedings
described below. Litigation is inherently uncertain and may
result in adverse rulings or decisions. Additionally, the Company
 may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
 operations or liquidity. In addition, the costs of defending
such litigation, individually or in the aggregate, may be
material, regardless of the outcome. Accordingly, actual results
could differ materially from those projected in the
forward-looking statements.

In 1992 Amstrad plc (“Amstrad”) brought suit against
the Company in California State Superior Court, County of Orange,
 alleging that disk drives supplied to Amstrad by the Company in
1988 and 1989 were defective and caused damages to Amstrad of not
 less than $186 million. The suit also sought punitive damages.
The Company denied the material allegations of the complaint and
filed cross-claims against Amstrad. The case was tried, and in
June 1999 the jury returned a verdict in favor of Western
Digital. Amstrad has appealed the judgment and the Company has
filed motions to recover a portion of its legal and other costs
of defense. The Company does not believe that the outcome of this
 matter will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
financial position, results of operation or liquidity.

In 1994 Papst Licensing (“Papst”) brought suit against
the Company in federal court in California alleging infringement
by the Company of five of its patents relating to disk drive
motors that the Company purchased from motor vendors. Later that
year Papst dismissed its case without prejudice, but it has
notified the Company that it intends to reinstate the suit if the
 Company does not enter into a license agreement with Papst.
Papst has also put the Company on notice with respect to several
additional patents. The Company does not believe that the outcome
 of this matter will have a material adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position, results of operation or
liquidity.

On October 23, 1998, Censtor Corporation
(“Censtor”) initiated an arbitration proceeding against
 the Company in California, alleging that it is owed royalties
under a license agreement between Censtor and the Company. In
response, the Company filed a complaint in federal court in
California seeking a determination that the patents at issue are
invalid. The federal court action has been stayed pending
completion of the


arbitration procedures. The Company does not believe that the
outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on its
 consolidated financial position, results of operation or
liquidity.

On June 9, 2000 a suit was brought against the Company in
California State Superior Court on behalf of a class of former
employees of the Company who were terminated as a result of a
reduction in force in December 1999. The complaint asserts
claims for unpaid wages, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, breach
of contract, and unfair business practices. The Company has
removed the suit to federal court in California on the ground
that all of the claims are preempted by the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974. The Company denies the material
allegations of the complaint and intends to vigorously defend
this action. The Company does not believe that the outcome of
this matter will have a material adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position, results of operation or
liquidity.

In the normal course of business, the Company receives and makes
inquiries regarding possible intellectual property matters,
including alleged patent infringement. Where deemed advisable,
the Company may seek or extend licenses or negotiate settlements.
 Although patent holders often offer such licenses, no assurance
can be given that in a particular case a license will be offered
or that the offered terms will be acceptable to the Company. One
such matter currently pending involves Discovision Associates,
which has recently brought patents it holds to the Company’s
 attention. The Company does not believe that the ultimate
resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect
on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.

From time to time the Company receives claims and is a party to
suits and other judicial and administrative proceedings
incidental to its business. Although occasional adverse decisions
 (or settlements) may occur, the Company does not believe that
the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material
adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of
 operations or liquidity.

Overview

Western Digital is a longtime leader in the data storage industry
 and is leveraging its core strengths to extend its data storage
product offerings and expand beyond the traditional market for
hard drives into new markets which meet certain predefined
criteria. The Company considers new or high growth markets for
data or content storage, management, and communication which have
 few entrenched competitors and offer the prospect of a sustained
 competitive advantage through unique or proprietary technology.

The hard drive industry, the Company’s primary business, is
intensely competitive and has experienced a great deal of growth,
 entry and exit of firms, and technological change over the past
several years. This industry is characterized by short product
life cycles, dependence upon highly skilled engineering and other
 personnel, significant expenditures for product development and
recurring periods of oversupply. As a result of operating losses
incurred in 1998, the Company initiated restructuring programs
for its hard drive operations in 1999 and 2000 to reduce costs
and improve operating efficiency. During 1999, the Company
combined its Personal Storage Division and Enterprise Storage
Group into a single hard drive operating unit, closed its Tuas,
Singapore facility and moved production of its enterprise drives
to the Company’s nearby manufacturing facility in Chai-Chee,
 Singapore. The combination resulted in a $41.0 million charge to
 operations in the third quarter of 1999. Also during 1999, the
Company sold its Santa Clara disk media operations to Komag,
recording a charge to operations of $20.0 million, in the fourth
quarter of 1999.

During 2000, the Company reorganized its operational and
management responsibilities, transferred its hard drive
production from Singapore to Malaysia and closed its Singapore
operations. These actions resulted in a net reduction of
worldwide headcount of approximately 1,600 and net charges to
operations of $52.6 million. Also in 2000, the Company
exited the enterprise hard drive market, shifting its strategic
focus and resources in the enterprise storage market to data
content management systems and management software for storage
systems. In connection with this decision, the Company closed its
 Rochester, Minnesota enterprise hard drive design center.
Approximately 402 employees were terminated and restructuring and
 other charges totaling $72.9 million were recorded.

During the first quarter of 2000, the Company announced a recall
of its 6.8GB per platter series of WD Caviar® desktop hard
drives because of a reliability problem resulting from a faulty
power driver chip manufactured by a third-party supplier. As a
result, revenues of approximately $100 million were reversed and
the Caviar product line was shut down for approximately two
weeks, eliminating approximately $70 million of forecasted
revenue. In addition, charges totaling $37.7 million for
estimated costs to recall and repair the affected drives were
recorded to cost of revenues in 2000.

In February 1999, the Company acquired its Connex subsidiary
 for approximately $12.0 million. Connex delivers
enterprise-class storage functionality for the department and
mid-sized business markets, including storage management
software, network attached storage and storage area networks. In
2000, the Company formed Sagetree, Inc. (“Sagetree”),
to design and market packaged analytical applications and related
 services for supply chain and product lifecycle intelligence. In
 addition, the Company is developing products for consumer audio
and video applications. Total operating losses for Connex,
Sagetree and other developing new ventures amounted to $38.9
million in 2000.


Results of Operations

Summary of 1998, 1999 and 2000 Comparison

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, items
in the Company’s statements of operations expressed as a
percentage of total revenue.

The Company reported losses before taxes and extraordinary gains
of $292.0, $492.7 and $374.4 million in 1998, 1999 and 2000,
respectively. The 1998 loss included charges of $140.0 million in
 cost of revenues for the Company’s transition to
magnetoresistive head technology, and $30.0 million in
research and development expenses for start up of a technology
agreement and terminated engineering programs. The 1999 loss
included charges of approximately $77.0 million for incremental
thin-film warranty provisions, approximately $7.5 million in
Malaysian currency losses, $12.0 million of in-process research
and development write-offs associated with the acquisition of
Connex and restructuring charges of $61.0 million for the
consolidation of the Company’s personal storage and
enterprise storage divisions and the sale of its media operation.
 The 2000 loss included net restructuring charges totaling $85.8
million for the closure of the Company’s Singapore
operations and exit from the enterprise hard drive market. The
2000 loss also included charges to cost of revenues of $34.8
million for vendor settlements, incremental warranty, and
inventory write-downs associated with the exit from the
enterprise market and $37.7 million for costs to repair recalled
drives. Excluding the aforementioned restructuring and other
charges, losses before taxes and extraordinary gains were $122.0,
 $335.2 and $216.1 million in 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively.
The increase in losses from 1998 to 1999 resulted from a $774.3
million, or 21.9%, decrease in revenues, a 4.1% decrease in gross
 margin percentage and a $27.6 million, or 7.5% increase in
operating expenses. The decrease in losses from 1999 to 2000
resulted from a 1.4% increase in gross margin percentage on lower
 revenues ($809.6 million, or a 29.3% decrease over 1999) and a
$91.9 million, or 23.4%, decrease in operating expenses. In
addition, the 2000 loss included $38.9 million in operating
losses for Connex, Sagetree and other early stage ventures
compared with $8.2 million in 1999 and $0 in 1998.

Net Revenue

Consolidated net revenues in 1999 of $2.8 billion decreased
21.9%, or $0.8 billion, from 1998 as a result of a 5% decrease in
 unit shipments stemming from the Company’s transition to
magnetoresistive head technology, combined with lower average
selling prices (ASP’s). Consolidated net revenues of $2.0
billion in 2000, decreased $0.8 billion or 29.3% from 1999, due
to the Company’s decision in the third quarter of 2000 to
exit the enterprise hard drive market, a decline in the
ASP’s of desktop hard drive products due to an intensely


competitive market, and a decline in desktop hard drive unit
shipments of approximately 8%, due largely to the product recall
in the first quarter of 2000.

Gross Profit

Gross profit totaled $100.0 million, or 2.8% of revenue in 1998,
negative $2.8 million, or (0.1)% of revenue in 1999 and $8.1
million, or 0.4% of revenue in 2000. Gross profit for 1998
included $140.0 million of special charges to cost of revenues to
 accelerate the Company’s transition to magnetoresistive
head technology. Gross profit for 1999 included $77.0 million of
special charges to cost of revenues for incremental thin-film
warranty provision related to a higher lifetime return rate being
 applied to a larger base of products as a result of the
transition in desktop product line technology. Gross profit for
2000 includes $72.5 million of special charges to costs of
revenues, related directly to the exit from the enterprise hard
drive market and the product recall. Excluding special charges,
gross profit was $240.0 million, or 6.8% of revenue, $74.2
million, or 2.7% of revenue and $80.6 million, or 4.1% of
revenue, for 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively. The reduction of
gross profit margin from 1998 to 1999 (excluding special charges)
 was primarily due to continued competitive pricing pressure in
the desktop hard drive market and lower sales of higher margin
enterprise hard drive products. The increase in the gross profit
margin from 1999 to 2000 (excluding special charges) was
primarily the result of lower manufacturing costs due to the
consolidation of desktop hard drive production to a single,
highly utilized facility in Malaysia, offset by lower volumes and
 lower ASPs.

Operating Expenses

Research and development expense was $217.0 million in 1999, an
increase of $13.3 million from 1998. The increase was primarily
due to the third quarter $12.0 million charge for in-process
research and development related to the acquisition of Connex.
Research and development expense for 2000 was $163.2 million, a
decrease of $53.8 million from 1999. The decrease was primarily
due to the Company’s exit from the enterprise hard drive
market and expense reduction efforts, partially offset by
increased spending at Connex, Sagetree, and other new ventures.

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
expense was $196.0 million in 1999, an increase of $3.8 million
from 1998. The increase was primarily the result of a $7.5
million charge on terminated Malaysian Ringgit hedging contracts
recorded in 1999, partially offset by decreased marketing
expenditures. SG&A expense in 2000 was $138.3 million, a
decrease of $57.6 million from 1999. The decrease in SG&A
expense was primarily due to the Company’s exit from the
enterprise hard drive market, expense reductions in its desktop
hard drive business, a $11.0 million accrual reduction in the
fourth quarter of 2000 and the nonrecurrence of a $7.5 million
charge on the terminated hedging contracts recorded in 1999. The
decrease was partially offset by increased spending at Connex,
Sagetree and other of the Company’s developing ventures in
2000.

Interest and Other Income/ Expense, Extraordinary
Item and Tax Benefit

Net interest and other income (expense) was $3.8 million,
($15.9) million and $4.9 million in 1998, 1999 and 2000,
respectively. The change from 1998 to 1999 was primarily due to a
 full year’s accrual of original issue discount on the
Company’s convertible debentures and a full year of interest
 expense incurred on a $50.0 million term loan. The increase in
net interest and other income in 2000 was due to a $14.8 million
gain on disposition of certain investment securities and lower
interest expense due to lower average debt balances resulting
from the payment in 2000 of an outstanding term loan of $50.0
million and redemption of convertible bonds, offset by a reduced
amount of interest income due to lower cash and cash equivalent
balances.

During 2000, the Company recognized extraordinary gains of $166.9
 million upon retirement of convertible debentures. The Company
issued 26.7 million shares of common stock in exchange for $735.6
 million in face value of its convertible debentures (with a book
 value of $284.1 million) which were retired in non-cash
transactions. These redemptions were private, individually
negotiated transactions with certain institutional investors.


The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $1.8 million in
1998 for the expected benefit of loss carrybacks, partially
offset by provisions for income taxes recorded in certain
jurisdictions where the Company had positive earnings, and an
income tax benefit of $19.5 million in 2000 for adjustment of its
 current tax accruals and certain deferred tax amounts. These
accruals were previously established over time and primarily
relate to unremitted income of foreign subsidiaries. However, due
 to the significant increase of net operating loss carryforwards
in recent years and reevaluation of the accruals after the
substantial international restructurings in 2000, the Company
believes these accruals are no longer necessary. In 1999, no tax
benefit was recorded because additional loss carrybacks were not
available and management believed it was “more likely than
not” that the deferred tax benefits generated would not be
realized (see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements).

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $226.1 million at
July 3, 1999 and $184.0 million at June 30, 2000. Net
cash used in operations was $139.5 million during 1999 as
compared to $152.0 million during 2000. Excluding cash used for
restructuring and product recall activities, cash used for
operations was $122.8 million during 1999 as compared to $104.5
million during 2000. Cash used for restructuring activities
during 1999 was $16.7 million and consisted of expenditures
for severance and outplacement and facility renovation costs.
Cash used for restructuring and other nonrecurring activities was
 $47.5 million during 2000 and consisted of expenditures for
severance and outplacement, lease cancellations and product
recall costs.

The Company’s cash conversion cycle decreased 12 days in
1999 and another 17 days in 2000. The conversion cycles
consist of the following: days of sales outstanding
(“DSO”) of 44 in 1999 and 28 in 2000; days of payables
outstanding (“DPO”) of 50 in 1999 and 52 in 2000; and
days of inventory on hand of 22 in 1999 and 23 in 2000. Despite
this improvement, the cash flows provided by changes in working
capital accounts decreased from $147.3 million in 1999 to
$67.5 million in 2000 due to an approximate 30% decrease in
2000 revenues and corresponding cost of revenues as compared to
1999, and the utilization in 2000 of significant accruals
recorded in 1999 and 2000 for thin-film warranty, restructuring
and other charges.

Other uses of cash during 2000 included the repayment of bank
debt of $50.0 million, strategic cost-method investments of $12.9
 million and net capital expenditures of $22.0 million. Other
sources of cash during 2000 included proceeds of $111.8 million
received upon issuance of 24.6 million shares of the
Company’s stock under the Company’s equity facility,
$10.0 million received by Sagetree upon issuance of preferred
stock, $6.2 million received in connection with stock option
exercises and Employee Stock Purchase Plan purchases, and $66.8
million received from sales of real property.

Capital expenditures in 1999 amounted to $106.6 million to
upgrade and expand the Company’s production capability,
replace existing assets, and further develop the Company’s
information systems. The Company received $15.3 million in
connection with stock option exercises and Employee Stock
Purchase Plan purchases in 1999.

The Company anticipates that capital expenditures in 2001 will
not be more than $50.0 million and will relate to
accommodating new product lines, normal replacement of existing
assets and expansion of production capabilities in Malaysia. The
Company also anticipates cash expenditures of not more than $20.0
 million to be paid in the first half of 2001 related to
restructuring and special charges accrued during 2000, primarily
for settlements with vendors on existing purchase orders related
to the Company’s exit from the enterprise hard drive market.

In February 1998, the Company received gross proceeds of
$460.1 million (before the Initial Purchasers’ discount)
from an offering of zero coupon convertible subordinated
debentures due February 18, 2018 (the
“Debentures”). The Debentures are subordinated to all
senior debt; are redeemable at the option of the Company any time
 after February 18, 2003 at the issue price plus accrued
original issue discount to the date of redemption; and at the
holder’s option, will be repurchased by the Company, as of
February 18, 2003, February 18, 2008 or February 18,
2013, or if there is a Fundamental Change (as defined in the
Debenture documents), at the issue price plus accrued original
issue discount to the date of repurchase. (The repurchase


price may be paid in cash or common stock, at the Company’s
option.) The Debentures are convertible into shares of the
Company’s common stock at the rate of 14.935 shares per
$1,000 principal amount at maturity. The principal amount at
maturity of the Debentures when issued was $1.3 billion. During
2000, the Company issued 26.7 million shares of common stock in
exchange for Debentures with a book value of $284.1 million, and
an aggregate principal amount at maturity of $735.6 million.
These redemptions were private, individually negotiated
transactions with certain institutional investors and resulted in
 extraordinary gains of $166.9 million. As of June 30, 2000,
 the book value of the remaining outstanding Debentures was
$225.5 million and the aggregate principal amount at maturity was
 $561.6 million. Between July 1, 2000 and September 26,
 2000, the Company issued 6.3 million shares of common stock in
exchange for Debentures with a book value of $49.8 million and an
 aggregate principal amount at maturity of $122.7 million. As of
September 26, 2000, the aggregate principal amount at
maturity was $438.9 million.

Subsequent to June 30, 2000, the Company entered into a new
three-year Senior Credit Facility for its hard drive solutions
division (“HDS”), replacing a previous facility that
had matured on March 31, 2000. The new Senior Credit
Facility provides up to $125 million in revolving credit (subject
 to a borrowing base calculation), is secured by HDS’s
accounts receivable, inventory, 65% of the stock in its foreign
subsidiaries and other assets. At the option of HDS, borrowings
bear interest at either LIBOR (with option periods of one to
three months) or a base rate, plus a margin determined by the
borrowing base. The Senior Credit Facility requires HDS to
maintain certain amounts of tangible net worth, prohibits the
payment of cash dividends on common stock and contains a number
of other covenants. As of the date hereof, the Company was in
compliance with these covenants and there were no borrowings
under the Facility.

Under an existing shelf registration statement (the “equity
facility”), the Company may issue shares of common stock to
institutional investors for cash. The equity facility provides
for up to $190.0 million in cash proceeds of which $111.8 million
 had been utilized as of June 30, 2000. Shares sold under
the facility are at the market price of the Company’s common
 stock less a discount ranging from 2.75% to 4.25%. Between
July 1, 2000 and September 5, 2000, the Company issued
6.1 million shares for cash proceeds of $27.6 million. As of
September 21, 2000, $139.4 million of the equity facility
had been utilized.

The Company had a shareholders’ deficiency of $109.8 million
 as of June 30, 2000 and expects to continue to incur operating
losses in 2001. However, at June 30, 2000, the Company had
cash and cash equivalent balances of $184.0 million and working
capital of $6.3 million. The Company has achieved significant
reductions in manufacturing labor and overhead, capital
expenditures and operating expenses resulting from the sale in
late 1999 of the Company’s media operations, the closure in
2000 of the Company’s two Singapore based manufacturing
facilities and its enterprise design center and the reduction in
worldwide headcount from 10,503 at July 3, 1999 to 7,321 at
June 30, 2000. In addition, the Company had the following
additional sources of liquidity available:

•

As of September 21, 2000, $50.6 million remaining available
	under the equity facility;

•

As of September 21, 2000, a Senior Credit Facility providing
	 up to $125 million in revolving credit (subject to a borrowing
	base calculation); and

•

Other equity investments that may be disposed of during the next
	twelve months, including 6.5 million shares of Komag common
	stock (of which 4.9  million shares were sold during
	September 2000 for net proceeds of $15.0 million) and 1.3
	million shares of Vixel common stock. The combined market value
	of the remaining 1.6 million Komag shares which can be sold
	in the next twelve months and the 1.3 million shares of
	Vixel common stock is approximately $15.4 million as of
	September 21, 2000 (an additional 3.2 million shares of
	Komag common stock will become available for disposition in
	October 2001).

Based on the above factors, the Company believes its current cash
 and cash equivalent balances, its existing equity and credit
facilities, and other liquidity sources currently available to
it, will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs through
2001. There can be no assurance that the Senior Credit Facility
or the equity facility will continue to be available to the
Company. Also, the Company’s ability to sustain its working


capital position is dependent upon a number of factors that are
discussed below under the heading “Risk factors relating to
Western Digital particularly.”

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”).
SFAS 133 was effective for all fiscal quarters for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 1999. In August 1999, the FASB
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 137,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities — Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB
Statement No. 133, an amendment of FASB Statement
No. 133” (“SFAS 137”), which defers the
effective date of SFAS 133 to all fiscal quarters for fiscal
 years beginning after June 15, 2000. In June 2000, the
 FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments
 and Certain Hedging Activities, an Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 133”. SFAS 133, as amended, establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. The
application of these statements is not expected to have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations or liquidity, and the Company
does not anticipate recording a significant adjustment as a
result of the transition to these statements.

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 101
(“SAB101”) “Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements”. This Staff Accounting Bulletin summarizes
certain of the staff’s views in applying generally accepted
accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial
statements. The Company will be required to follow the guidance
in SAB101 no later than its fourth quarter of 2001, with
restatement of earlier quarters in 2001 required, if necessary.
The SEC has recently indicated it intends to issue further
guidance with respect to adoption of specific issues addressed by
 SAB101. Until such time as this additional guidance is issued,
the Company is unable to assess the impact, if any, SAB101 may
have on its consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

In March 2000, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 44
“Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation — an interpretation of APB Opinion
No. 25” (“FIN 44”). This Interpretation
clarifies the definition of an employee for purposes of applying
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
 for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”),
the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a
noncompensatory plan, the accounting consequence of various
modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or
award, and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation
awards in a business combination. This Interpretation is
effective July 1, 2000, but certain conclusions in this
Interpretation cover specific events that occur after either
December 15, 1998 or January 12, 2000. The adoption of
FIN 44 is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

Year 2000

On January 1, 2000, the Company incurred nominal impact on
its products, equipment, computer systems and applications as a
result of the Year 2000 issue. The Company attributes this to its
 Year 2000 readiness efforts. As of December 31, 1999,
systems remediation and integration testing and development of
the Company’s contingency plans had been completed. Supplier
 management is an ongoing process, and no material impact was
felt from lack of supplier readiness at January 1, 2000.
Although the Company did not experience any material problems
related to the Year 2000 issue, there can be no assurances that
problems relating to the Year 2000 issue will not manifest
themselves in the future. Expenditures related to the Year 2000
project, excluding normal replacement of existing capital assets,
 totaled approximately $12.2 million.


Risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we
operate

Our operating results depend on our being among the
	first-to-market and first-to-volume with our new products.

To achieve consistent success with computer manufacturer
customers we must be an early provider of next generation hard
drives featuring leading technology and high quality. If we fail
to:

then our market share would be adversely affected, which would
harm our operating results.

Short product life cycles make it difficult to recover the
	cost of development.

Over the past few years hard drive areal density (the gigabytes
of storage per disk) has increased at a much more rapid pace than
 previously, and we expect this trend to continue. Higher areal
densities mean that fewer heads and disks are required to achieve
 a given drive capacity. This has significantly shortened product
 life cycles, since each generation of drives is more cost
effective than the previous one. Shorter product cycles make it
more difficult to recover the cost of product development.

Short product life cycles force us to continually qualify new
	products with our customers.

Due to short product life cycles, we must regularly engage in new
 product qualification with our customers. To be considered for
qualification we must be among the leaders in time-to-market with
 our new products. Once a product is accepted for qualification
testing, any failure or delay in the qualification process can
result in our losing sales to that customer until the next
generation of products is introduced. The effect of missing a
product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited
number of high volume computer manufacturers, most of which
continue to consolidate their share of the PC market. These risks
 are magnified because we expect cost improvements and
competitive pressures to result in declining sales and gross
margins on our current generation products.

Our average selling prices are declining.

We expect that our average selling prices for hard disk drives
will continue to decline. Rapid increases in areal density mean
that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks, and is
therefore lower cost. Because of the competitiveness of the hard
drive industry, lower costs generally mean lower prices. This is
true even for those products that are competitive and introduced
into the market in a timely manner. Our average selling prices
decline even further when competitors lower prices to absorb
excess capacity, liquidate excess inventories, restructure or
attempt to gain market share.

Unexpected technology advances in the hard drive industry
	could harm our competitive position.

If one of our competitors were able to implement a significant
advance in head or disk drive technology that enables a
step-change increase in areal density allowing greater storage of
 data on a disk, it would harm our operating results.

Advances in magnetic, optical, semiconductor or other data
storage technologies could result in competitive products that
have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than
our products. If these products prove to be superior in
performance or cost per unit of capacity, we could be at a
competitive disadvantage to the companies offering those
products.


The hard drive industry is highly competitive and
	characterized by rapid shifts in market share among the major
	competitors.

The price of hard drives has fallen over time due to increases in
 supply, cost reductions, technological advances and price
reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess inventories
 or gain market share. In addition, rapid technological changes
often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing
products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence. These
factors, taken together, result in significant and rapid shifts
in market share among the industry’s major participants. For
 example, during 1998 and 1999, we lost significant share of the
desktop market. During the first quarter of 2000, the Company
lost market share as a result of a previously announced product
recall; however, we recovered some market share during the
remainder of 2000, but our share is still significantly below its
 1997 level.

Our prices and margins are subject to declines due to
	unpredictable end-user demand and oversupply of hard disk drives.

Demand for our hard drives depends on the demand for computer
systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to
existing systems. The demand for computer systems has been
volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on
the demand for hard drives in any given period. As a result, the
hard drive market tends to experience periods of excess capacity
which typically lead to intense price competition. If intense
price competition occurs, we may be forced to lower prices sooner
 and more than expected and transition to new products sooner
than expected.

Changes in the markets for hard drives require us to develop
	new products.

Over the past few years the consumer market for desktop computers
 has shifted significantly towards lower priced systems,
especially those systems priced below $1,000. We were late to
market with a value line hard drive to serve that market, and we
lost market share. If we are not able to offer a competitively
priced value line hard drive for the low-cost PC market our
market share will likely fall, which could harm our operating
results.

The PC market is fragmenting into a variety of computing devices
and products. Some of these products, such as Internet
appliances, may not contain a hard drive. On the other hand, many
 industry analysts expect, as do we, that as broadcasting and
communications are increasingly converted to digital technology
from the older, analog technology, the technology of computers
and consumer electronics and communication devices will converge,
 and hard drives will be found in many consumer products other
than computers. If we are not successful in using our hard drive
technology and expertise to develop new products for these
emerging markets, it will likely harm our operating results.

We depend on our key personnel.

Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key
employees, many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace.
Worldwide competition for skilled employees in the hard drive
industry is intense. We have lost a number of experienced hard
drive engineers over the past two years as a result of the loss
of retention value of their employee stock options (because of
the decrease in price of our common stock) and aggressive
recruiting of our employees. If we are unable to retain our
existing employees or hire and integrate new employees, our
operating results would likely be harmed.

Risk factors relating to Western Digital particularly

Loss of market share with a key customer could harm our
	operating results.

A majority of our revenue comes from a few customers. For
example, during 2000, sales to our top 10 customers accounted for
 approximately 57% of revenues. These customers have a wide
variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make
substantial demands on us. Even if we successfully qualify a
product with a customer, the customer generally is not obligated
to purchase any minimum volume of products from us and is able to
 terminate its relationship with us at any time. Our ability to
maintain strong relationships with our


principal customers is essential to our future performance. If we
 lose a key customer, or if any of our key customers reduce their
 orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before
 we are able to reduce costs, our operating results would likely
be harmed. For example, this occurred early in the third quarter
of 2000 in our enterprise hard drive market and is one of the
factors which led to our decision to exit the enterprise hard
drive market and close our Rochester, Minnesota facility.

Dependence on a limited number of qualified suppliers of
	components could lead to delays or increased costs.

Because we do not manufacture any of the components in our hard
drives, an extended shortage of required components or the
failure of key suppliers to remain in business, adjust to market
conditions, or to meet our quality, yield or production
requirements could harm us more severely than our competitors,
some of whom manufacture certain of the components for their hard
 drives. A number of the components used by us are available from
 only a single or limited number of qualified outside suppliers.
If a component is in short supply, or a supplier fails to qualify
 or has a quality issue with a component, we may experience
delays or increased costs in obtaining that component. This
occurred in September 1999 when we had to shut down our Caviar
product line production for approximately two weeks as a result
of a faulty power driver chip which was sole-sourced from a
third-party supplier.

To reduce the risk of component shortages, we attempt to provide
significant lead times when buying these components. As a result,
 we may have to pay significant cancellation charges to suppliers
 if we cancel orders, as we did in 1998 when we accelerated our
transition to magnetoresistive recording head technology, and as
we did in 2000 as a result of our decision to exit the enterprise
 hard drive market.

In April 1999, we entered into a three year volume purchase
agreement with Komag under which we buy a substantial portion of
our media components from Komag. This strategic relationship has
reduced our media component costs; however, it has increased our
dependence on Komag as a supplier. Our future operating results
will depend substantially on Komag’s ability to timely
qualify its media components in our new development programs and
to supply us with these components in sufficient volume to meet
our production requirements. Any disruption in Komag’s
ability to manufacture and supply us with media would likely harm
 our operating results.

To develop new products we must maintain effective partner
	relationships with our strategic component suppliers.

Under our “virtual vertical integration” business
model, we do not manufacture any of the parts used in our hard
drives. As a result, the success of our products depends on our
ability to gain access to and integrate parts that are “best
 in class” from reliable component suppliers. To do so we
must effectively manage our relationships with our strategic
component suppliers. We must also effectively integrate different
 products from a variety of suppliers and manage difficult
scheduling and delivery problems.

We have only one manufacturing facility, which subjects us to
	the risk of damage or loss of the facility.

Our volume manufacturing operations currently are based in one
facility in Malaysia. A fire, flood, earthquake or other disaster
 or condition affecting our facility would almost certainly
result in a loss of substantial sales and revenue and harm our
operating results.

Manufacturing our products abroad subjects us to numerous
	risks.

We are subject to risks associated with our foreign manufacturing
 operations, including:


We have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency
exchange rate changes by, among other things, entering into
short-term, forward exchange contracts. However, those contracts
do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the issuer
if currency controls are put in place, as occurred in Malaysia
during the first quarter of 1999. As a result of the Malaysian
currency controls, we are no longer hedging the Malaysian
currency risk.

Our plan to broaden our business in data and content
	management, storage and communication takes us into new markets.

We have recently entered the storage subsystem market through our
 Connex subsidiary. In this market we are facing the challenges
of building volume and market share in a market which is new to
us but which has several established and well-funded competitors.
 There is already significant competition for skilled engineers,
both in the hardware and software areas, in this market. Our
success will depend on Connex’s ability to develop,
introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products,
applications and product enhancements, and to attract and retain
skilled engineers. Additionally, our competitors in this market
have established intellectual property portfolios. Our success
will also depend on our ability to license existing intellectual
property or create new innovations. Moreover, our
competitors’ established intellectual property portfolios
increase our risk of intellectual property litigation.

We are also developing storage devices for the emerging
audio-visual market. We will be facing the challenge of
developing products for a market that is still evolving and
subject to rapid changes and shifting consumer preferences. There
 are several competitors which have also entered this emerging
market, and there is no assurance that the market for digital
storage devices for audio-visual content will materialize or
support all of these competitors.

We have recently entered the data warehouse software and services
 market through our SageTree subsidiary and are considering other
 initiatives related to data and content management, storage and
communication. In any of these initiatives we will be facing the
challenge of developing products and services for markets that
are still evolving and which have many current and potential
competitors. If we are not successful in these new initiatives it
 will likely harm our operating results.

Our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary
	information subjects us to the risk of significant litigation.

The hard drive industry has been characterized by significant
litigation. This includes litigation relating to patent and other
 intellectual property rights, product liability claims and other
 types of litigation. We are currently evaluating notices of
alleged patent infringement or notices of patents from patent
holders. We also are a party to several judicial and other
proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property
rights. If we conclude that a claim of infringement is valid, we
may be required to obtain a license or cross-license or modify
our existing technology or design a new non-infringing
technology. Such licenses or design modifications can be
extremely costly. We may also be liable for any past
infringement. If there is an adverse ruling against us in an
infringement lawsuit, an injunction could be issued barring
production or sale of any infringing product. It could also
result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost
profits or, if there is a finding of willful infringement, treble
 damages. Any of these results would likely increase our costs
and harm our operating results.


Our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary
	information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of
	 our business could be copied by competitors.

Our success depends, in significant part, on the proprietary
nature of our technology, including non-patentable intellectual
property such as our process technology. Despite safeguards, to
the extent that a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise
capitalize on our technology, it may be difficult, expensive or
impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection. Also, the
 laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual
property to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.
In addition to patent protection of intellectual property rights,
 we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be
proprietary and confidential. We rely upon employee, consultant
and vendor non-disclosure agreements and a system of internal
safeguards to protect our proprietary information. However, any
of our registered or unregistered intellectual property rights
may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry, which
might harm our operating results.

Inaccurate projections of demand for our product can cause
	large fluctuations in our quarterly results.

If we do not forecast total quarterly demand accurately, it can
have a material adverse effect on our quarterly results. We
typically book and ship a high percentage of our total quarterly
sales in the third month of the quarter, which makes it is
difficult for us to match our production plans to customer
demands. In addition, our quarterly projections and results may
be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of
 other factors including:

Rapidly changing market conditions in the
hard drive industry make it difficult to estimate actual results.

We have made and continue to make a number of estimates and
assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting. The
 rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that
 actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and
assumptions. Key estimates and assumptions for us include:


The market price of our common stock is volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue
to be, extremely volatile. Factors such as the following may
significantly affect the market price of our common stock:

In addition, the stock market in recent months has experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly
affected the stock price of many high technology companies. These
 fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of
 the companies.

Securities class action lawsuits are often brought against
companies after periods of volatility in the market price of
their securities. A number of such suits have been filed against
us in the past, and any of these litigation matters could result
in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and
management’s attention.

We may be unable to raise future capital through
debt or equity financing.

Due to our recent financial performance and the risks described
in this Report, in the future we may be unable to maintain
adequate financial resources for capital expenditures, working
capital and research and development. Our prior borrowing
agreement with our banks matured on March 31, 2000, and we
have signed an agreement for a new credit facility for our HDS
division. If we decide to increase or accelerate our capital
expenditures or research and development efforts, or if results
of operations do not meet our expectations, we could require
additional debt or equity financing. However, we cannot insure
that additional financing will be available to us or available on
 favorable terms. An equity financing could also be dilutive to
our existing stockholders.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk

Disclosure About Foreign Currency Risk

Although the majority of the Company’s transactions are in
U.S. Dollars, some transactions are based in various foreign
currencies. From time to time, the Company purchases short-term,
forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign
currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities
and commitments for operating expenses denominated in foreign
currencies. The purpose of entering into these hedge transactions
 is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on
the results of operations. A majority of the increases or
decreases in the Company’s local currency operating expenses
 are offset by gains and losses on the hedges. The contracts have
 maturity dates that do not exceed twelve months. The unrealized
gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized
in the results of operations in the period in which the hedged
transaction is consummated. The Company does not purchase
short-term forward exchange contracts for trading purposes.

Historically, the Company has focused on hedging its foreign
currency risk related to the Singapore Dollar, the British Pound
and the Malaysian Ringgit. With the establishment of currency
controls and the prohibition of purchases or sales of the
Malaysian Ringgit by offshore companies, the Company discontinued


hedging its Malaysian Ringgit currency risk in 1999. Future
hedging of this currency will depend on currency conditions in
Malaysia. The imposition of exchange controls by the Malaysian
government resulted in a $7.5 million realized loss on terminated
 hedging contracts in the first quarter of 1999. As a result of
the closure of the Company’s Singapore operations in 2000,
the Company has also discontinued its hedging program related to
the Singapore Dollar.

As of June 30, 2000, the Company had outstanding the
following purchased foreign currency forward exchange contracts
(in millions, except average contract rate):

In 1998, 1999, and 2000 total realized transaction and forward
exchange contract currency gains and losses (excluding the $7.5
million realized loss on the Malaysian Ringgits realized in
1999), were immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.
Based on historical experience, the Company does not expect that
a significant change in foreign exchange rates (up to
approximately 25%) would materially affect the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

Disclosure About Other Market Risks

Fixed Interest Rate Risk

At June 30, 2000, the market value of the Company’s
5.25% zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures due in 2018
 was approximately $111.6 million, compared to the related book
value of $225.5 million. The convertible debentures will be
repurchased by the Company, at the option of the holder, as of
February 18, 2003, February 18, 2008, or
February 18, 2013, or if there is a Fundamental Change (as
defined in the Debenture documents), at the issue price plus
accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption. The
payment on those dates, with the exception of a Fundamental
Change, can be in cash, stock or any combination, at the
Company’s option.

Between July 1, 2000 and September 26, 2000, the
Company issued 6.3 million shares of common stock in exchange for
 Debentures with a book value of $49.8 million and an aggregate
principal amount at maturity of $122.7 million. As of
September 26, 2000, the market value of the convertible
subordinated debentures was approximately $116.9 million,
compared to the related book value of $178.7 million.

The Company has various notes receivable from other companies.
All of the notes carry a fixed rate of interest. Therefore a
significant change in interest rates would not cause these notes
to impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Variable Interest Rate Risk

At the option of HDS, borrowings under the new Senior Credit
Facility would bear interest at either LIBOR (with option periods
 of one to three months) or a base rate, plus a margin determined
 by the borrowing base. This is the only debt which does not have
 a fixed-rate of interest. A change in interest rates resulting
in rates as high as 12% would not materially impact the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The new Senior Credit Facility requires HDS to maintain certain
amounts of tangible net worth, prohibits the payment of cash
dividends on common stock and contains a number of other
covenants. As of the date hereof, there were no borrowings under
the new Senior Credit Facility.


Fair Value Risk

The Company owned approximately 10.8 million shares of Komag,
Inc. common stock at June 30, 2000 (See Notes 1 and 8
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The stock is
restricted as to the percentage of total shares which can be sold
 in a given time period. The unrestricted portion of the total
Komag shares acquired represents the shares which can be sold
within one year. The Company determines, on a quarterly basis,
the fair market value of the unrestricted Komag shares and
records an unrealized gain or loss resulting from the difference
in the fair market value of the unrestricted shares as of the
previous quarter end and the fair market value of the
unrestricted shares on the measurement date. As of June 30,
2000, a $9.6 million total accumulated unrealized loss had been
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). If the
 Company sells all or a portion of this stock, any unrealized
gain or loss on the date of sale will be recorded as a realized
gain or loss in the Company’s results of operations. As of
June 30, 2000, the quoted market value of the Company’s
 Komag common stock holdings, without regard to discounts due to
sales restrictions, was $18.9 million and the aggregate book
value was $25.3 million.

Between July 1, 2000, and September 15, 2000, the
Company sold 4.9 million shares of the Komag common stock for
$15.0 million in cash. As of September 21, 2000, the quoted
market value of the Company’s remaining Komag common stock
holdings, without regard to discounts due to sales restrictions,
was $20.0 million. Due to market fluctuations, a decline in the
stock’s fair market value could occur.

The Company owns approximately 1.3 million shares of Vixel common
 stock. The Company determines, on a quarterly basis, the fair
market value of the Vixel shares and records an unrealized gain
or loss resulting from the difference in the fair market value of
 the shares as of the previous quarter end and the fair market
value of the shares on the measurement date. As of June 30,
2000, a $11.0 million total accumulated unrealized gain has been
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). If the
 Company sells all or a portion of this common stock, any
unrealized gain or loss on the date of sale will be recorded as a
 realized gain or loss in the Company’s results of
operations. As a result of market conditions, the market value of
 the shares had declined from $11.0 million as of June 30,
2000 to $9.9 million as of September 21, 2000. Due to market
 fluctuations, an additional decline in the stock’s fair
market value could occur.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.  Organization and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

Western Digital Corporation (“Western Digital” or the
“Company”) has prepared its consolidated financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and has adopted accounting policies
 and practices which are generally accepted in the industry in
which it operates. Following are the Company’s significant
accounting policies:

Fiscal Year

The Company has a 52 or 53-week fiscal year. In order to align
its manufacturing and financial calendars, effective during the
three months ended December 31, 1999, the Company changed
its fiscal calendar so that each fiscal month ends on the Friday
nearest to the last day of the calendar month. Prior to this
change, the Company’s fiscal month ended on the Saturday
nearest to the last day of the calendar month. The change did not
 have a material impact on the Company’s results of
operations or financial position. The 1998, 1999 and 2000 fiscal
years ended on June 27, July 3, and June 30,
respectively, and consisted of 52 weeks for the fiscal years
 1998 and 2000, and 53 weeks for the fiscal year 1999. All
general references to years relate to fiscal years unless
otherwise noted.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
 Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. The accounts of foreign subsidiaries have been
remeasured using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency.
 As such, foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from
remeasurement of these accounts are reflected in the results of
operations. These foreign exchange gains and losses were
immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. Monetary and
 nonmonetary asset and liability accounts have been remeasured
using the exchange rate in effect at each year end and using
historical rates, respectively. Income statement accounts have
been remeasured using average monthly exchange rates.

Cash Equivalents

The Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid
investments, primarily money market funds and commercial paper,
with original maturities of three months or less.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets hard
drives to personal computer manufacturers, resellers and
retailers throughout the world. The Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and
 generally requires no collateral. The Company maintains reserves
 for potential credit losses, and such losses have historically
been within management’s expectations. The Company also has
cash equivalent policies that limit the amount of credit exposure
 to any one financial institution or investment instrument, and
require that investments be made only with financial institutions
 or in investment instruments evaluated as highly credit-worthy.

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Cost is on a first-in, first-out basis for raw materials
and is computed on a currently adjusted standard basis (which
approximates first-in, first-out) for work in process and
finished goods.

The Company maintains a base stock of two to three weeks of
current finished goods inventory for certain key original
equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customers in facilities
located adjacent to their operations. Inventory at these
locations usually includes minor product customizations (such as
labeling) for the related


WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

OEM. If subsequent to its initial order the OEM changes its
requirements, inventory held at these facilities can be sold to
other OEM’s or distributors as is or with minor
modifications (such as a change in labeling) at little or no
additional cost.

Depreciation and Amortization

The cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Depreciation is
computed on a straight-line basis for financial reporting
purposes and on an accelerated basis for income tax purposes.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the
estimated useful lives of the assets or the related lease terms.
Goodwill and purchased technology, which are included in other
assets, are capitalized at cost and amortized on a straight-line
basis over their estimated lives of five to fifteen years. Other
intangible assets, including intangibles acquired from IBM
pursuant to a joint technology development agreement (See
Note 4), are amortized over their expected useful lives or
the lives of the related products.

The Company reviews identifiable intangibles, goodwill and other
long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances
 indicate the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the sum
 of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without
interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of an asset,
an impairment loss is recognized.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue at time of shipment, net of
pricing adjustments and estimated sales returns. In accordance
with standard industry practice, the Company’s agreements
with certain resellers provide price protection for inventories
held by the resellers at the time of published list price
reductions and, under certain circumstances, stock rotation for
slow-moving items. These agreements may be terminated upon
written notice by either party. In the event of termination, the
Company may be obligated to repurchase a certain portion of the
resellers’ inventory. The Company recognizes revenue at the
time of shipment on sales to resellers who have inventory
repurchase agreements due to the Company’s ability to
reasonably estimate future returns as well as the historically
low levels of actual repurchases. Revenue recognized on sales to
resellers with inventory repurchase agreements was $1,083, $841,
and $683 million for fiscal years 1998, 1999 and 2000,
respectively. Repurchases of inventory under such agreements were
 not material in 1998, 1999 and 2000.

Warranty

The Company records an accrual for estimated warranty costs when
revenue is recognized. Warranty covers cost of repair or
replacement of the hard drive and the warranty periods range from
 1 to 3 years for all hard drives, except enterprise drives,
 which had a warranty period of 5 years. The Company has
comprehensive processes with which to estimate accruals for
warranty, which include specific detail on hard drives in the
field by product type, historical field return rates and costs to
 repair. Although the Company believes that it has the continued
ability to reasonably estimate warranty reserves, unforeseeable
changes in factors used to estimate the accrual for warranty
could occur. These unforeseeable changes could cause a material
change in the Company’s warranty accrual estimate. Such a
change would be recorded in the period in which the change was
identified.

The Company increased warranty accruals from 1998 to 1999
primarily due to a normal increase in units under warranty and
the completion of the Company’s transition in its desktop
product line from thin-film to the newer magnetoresistive head
technology in the June 1998 quarter. This transition and
experience with thin film returns, which indicated a higher
return rate, higher cost of repair and longer duration of returns
 within the warranty period, resulted in an increase in warranty
accruals. Prior to 1999, the Company’s experience with
returns of older generation thin-film products was that a large
percentage of the products which were going to fail, failed in
the first six months after sale. However, with the advancements
in thin-film recording


WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

technology, the gaps between critical components (principally the
 recording heads and disks) within the drive became much smaller
until they were almost in contact with one another. This made the
 thin-film drives much more susceptible to environmental factors
which typically manifest themselves over longer periods of time,
such as gases released from the surrounding environment that may
permeate through or from other components in the drive. In early
1999, the Company began to see consistent data indicating a
higher percentage of advanced thin-film drives coming back after
the first six months. That, combined with the significant amount
of these drives that were in the field, led to a higher lifetime
return rate being applied to a larger base of products in the
field and an incremental warranty provision was recorded.

Advertising Expense

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Selling, general and
administrative expenses of the Company include advertising costs
of $17.4, $14.3, and $9.0 million in 1998, 1999 and 2000,
respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes”
(“SFAS 109”). This method generally provides that
deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary
differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax
basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities and expected
benefits of utilizing net operating loss (“NOL”)
carryforwards. The Company records a valuation allowance for
certain temporary differences for which it is more likely than
not that it will not receive future tax benefits. The impact on
deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and laws, if any, are
applied to the years during which temporary differences are
expected to be settled and reflected in the consolidated
financial statements in the period of enactment.

Per Share Information

The Company computes basic loss per share using the net loss and
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Dilutive loss per share is computed using the net
loss and the weighted average number of common shares and
dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.
Dilutive common shares include outstanding employee stock
options, employee stock purchase plan shares and common shares
issuable upon conversion of the convertible debentures. The
effects of these items were not included in the computation of
diluted loss per share for each period presented as their effect
would have been anti-dilutive (See Note 9).

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (“SFAS 123”). SFAS 123 establishes
the financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based
compensation plans. The Company elected to continue accounting
for stock-based employee compensation plans in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
 for Stock Issued to Employees” and related interpretations
(“APB Opinion No. 25”), as SFAS 123 permits, and
to follow the pro forma net income (loss), pro forma earnings
(loss) per share, and stock-based compensation plan disclosure
requirements set forth in SFAS 123. (See Note 6).

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates
fair value for all periods presented because of the short-term
maturity of these financial instruments. The fair value of the
Company’s convertible debentures is estimated by reference
to quoted information from market sources. At June 30, 2000,
 the market value of the Company’s convertible debentures
was approximately $111.6 million, compared to the related


WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

carrying value of $225.5 million. The carrying amounts of all
other financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheets,
with the exception of the Komag common stock classified as
long-term (discussed below), approximate fair values.

Investments

The Company’s investments in unrestricted, marketable equity
 securities have been classified as “available for
sale”, are included in other current assets, and are carried
 at fair value. The classification of a security is determined at
 the acquisition date and reviewed periodically. The Company
reviews, on a quarterly basis, the fair market value of the
available for sale securities and records an unrealized gain or
loss resulting from the difference between the fair market value
at the time of the acquisition and the fair market value on the
measurement date. The unrealized gains or losses are shown as a
component of shareholders’ deficiency. Securities that are
not classified as “available for sale” are carried at
cost. The Company periodically reviews its cost-basis investments
 for instances where fair value is less than cost to determine if
 the decline in value is other than temporary. If the decline in
value is judged to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the
 security is written down to fair value. The amount of any
write-down would be included in the results of operations as a
realized loss. Realized gains and losses resulting from the sale
of securities are determined using the specific identification
method.

The Company owned approximately 10.8 million shares of Komag
common stock at June 30, 2000, which when acquired on
April 8, 1999, had a fair market value of $34.9 million. The
 stock is restricted as to the number of shares which can be sold
 in a given time period. The restrictions lapse over a three and
one-half year period. As of June 30, 2000, approximately 60%
 of these shares could be sold within twelve months. Because the
Company has identified these shares as “available for
sale” under the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, “Investments in Certain
Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS 115”), the
 amount sellable within twelve months was marked to market value
using published closing prices of Komag stock as of June 30,
 2000. Accordingly, a total accumulated unrealized loss of $9.6
million was included in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss). The aggregate book value of the total Komag shares was
$25.3 million (market value of approximately $18.9 million) as of
 June 30, 2000, of which $11.3 million related to shares
sellable within twelve months and was classified as current.
Subsequent to June 30, 2000, the Company sold some of its
Komaq common stock holdings (see Note 11).

The Company owns approximately 1.3 million shares of Vixel
Corporation (“Vixel”) common stock. The Company has
identified these shares as “available for sale” under
the provisions of SFAS 115. During the three months ended
October 2, 1999, Vixel completed an initial public offering
and the shares were marked to market value. At June 30, 2000
 a total accumulated unrealized gain of $11.0 million is included
 in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The investment
 in Vixel common stock is classified as current. The aggregate
carrying value of the shares, which approximates market value, is
 $11.0 million as of June 30, 2000.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 130, “Reporting Comprehensive Income”
(“SFAS 130”), beginning with the Company’s
fourth quarter of 1999. Prior to the fourth quarter of 1999, the
Company did not possess any components of other comprehensive
income as defined by SFAS 130. SFAS 130 separates
comprehensive income into two components: net income (loss) and
other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income
(loss) refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that are
recorded as an element of shareholders’ equity (deficiency)
but are excluded from net income (loss). While SFAS 130
establishes new rules for the reporting and display of
comprehensive income (loss), SFAS 130 has no impact on the
Company’s net loss or total shareholders’ deficiency.
The Company’s other


WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of unrealized gains and
losses on marketable securities categorized as “available
for sale” under SFAS 115.

Minority Interest in Subsidiary

In June 2000, the Company’s subsidiary, Sagetree, Inc.
(“Sagetree”), received cash proceeds of $10.0 million
from NCR Corporation in exchange for a minority voting interest
in Sagetree at June 30, 2000. The Company reflects the
portion of the earnings or losses of Sagetree which are
applicable to the minority interest as an adjustment to minority
interest on the consolidated balance sheets, and as a component
of other income (expense) on the consolidated statements of
operations. For the year ended June 30, 2000, the amount of
minority interest in Sagetree’s losses was not material to
the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Foreign Exchange Contracts

Although the majority of the Company’s transactions are in
U.S. Dollars, some transactions are based in various foreign
currencies. From time to time, the Company purchases short-term,
forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign
currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities
and commitments for operating expenses denominated in foreign
currencies. The purpose of entering into these hedge transactions
 is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on
the results of operations. The contracts have maturity dates that
 do not exceed twelve months. The unrealized gains and losses on
these contracts are deferred and recognized in the results of
operations in the period in which the hedged transaction effects
the results of operations. Costs associated with entering into
such contracts are typically amortized over the life of the
instrument. The Company does not purchase short-term forward
exchange contracts for trading purposes.

In response to the Company’s underlying foreign currency
exposures, the Company may, from time to time, adjust its foreign
 currency hedging position by taking out additional contracts or
by terminating or offsetting existing foreign currency forward
exchange contracts. Gains or losses on terminated contracts and
offsetting contracts are recognized in the results of operations
in the periods in which the hedged transactions effect the
results of operations.

The Company had outstanding forward exchange contracts with
commercial banks with nominal values of $241.9, $66.4 and $13.5
million, at June 27, 1998, July 3, 1999 and
June 30, 2000, respectively. The total unrealized gains and
losses on outstanding forward exchange contracts and foreign
currency transactions were not material to the consolidated
financial statements as of and for the years ended June 27,
1998 and June 30, 2000. For the year ended July 3,
1999, the total net loss on foreign currency transactions and
forward exchange contracts was $10.3 million. Of this amount, a
realized loss of $7.5 million on terminated hedging contracts was
 recorded due to the imposition of exchange controls by the
Malaysian government. Historically, the Company has focused on
hedging its foreign currency risk related to the Singapore
Dollar, the British Pound and the Malaysian Ringgit. With the
establishment of currency controls and the prohibition of
purchases or sales of the Malaysian Ringgit by offshore
companies, the Company has discontinued hedging its Malaysian
Ringgit currency risk. Future hedging of this currency will
depend on currency conditions in Malaysia. As a result of the
closure of the Company’s Singapore operations in 2000, the
Company has also discontinued its hedging program related to the
Singapore Dollar.

Use of Estimates

Company management has made estimates and assumptions relating to
 the reporting of certain assets and liabilities in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. Actual results
could differ from these estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior years’ amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the current year presentation.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“SFAS 133”). SFAS 133 was effective for all
fiscal quarters for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
1999. In August 1999, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 137, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities —
Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, an
 amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (“SFAS
137”), which defers the effective date of SFAS 133 to all
fiscal quarters for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2000. In June 2000, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 138, “Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, an
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”. SFAS 133, as
amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for
hedging activities. The application of these statements is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or
liquidity, and the Company does not anticipate recording a
significant adjustment as a result of the transition to these
statements.

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 101
(“SAB101”) “Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements”. This Staff Accounting Bulletin summarizes
certain of the staff’s views in applying generally accepted
accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial
statements. The Company will be required to follow the guidance
in SAB101 no later than its fourth quarter of 2001, with
restatement of earlier quarters in 2001 required, if necessary.
The SEC has recently indicated it intends to issue further
guidance with respect to adoption of specific issues addressed by
 SAB101. Until such time as this additional guidance is issued,
the Company is unable to assess the impact, if any, SAB101 may
have on its consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

In March 2000, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 44
“Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation — an interpretation of APB Opinion
No. 25” (“FIN 44”). This Interpretation
clarifies the definition of an employee for purposes of applying
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
 for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”), the
criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a
noncompensatory plan, the accounting consequence of various
modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or
award, and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation
awards in a business combination. This Interpretation is
effective July 1, 2000, but certain conclusions in this
Interpretation cover specific events that occur after either
December 15, 1998 or January 12, 2000. The adoption of
FIN 44 is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

Convertible Debentures

In February 1998, the Company received gross proceeds of
$460.1 million (before the Initial Purchasers’ discount)
from an offering of zero coupon convertible subordinated
debentures due February 18, 2018 (“the
Debentures”). The Debentures are subordinated to all senior
debt; are redeemable at the option of the Company any time after
February 18, 2003 at the issue price plus accrued original
issue discount to the date of redemption; and at the
holder’s option, will be repurchased by the Company, as of
February 18, 2003, February 18, 2008 or February 18,
2013, or if there is a Fundamental Change (as defined in the
Debenture documents), at the issue price plus accrued original
issue discount to the date of repurchase. The repurchase price
may be paid in cash or common stock, at the Company’s
option. The Debentures are convertible into shares of the
Company’s common stock at the rate of 14.935 shares per
$1,000 principal amount at maturity. The principal amount at
maturity of the Debentures when issued was $1.3 billion. During
2000, the Company issued 26.7 million shares of common stock in
exchange for Debentures with a book value of $284.1 million, and
an aggregate principal amount at maturity of $735.6 million.
These redemptions were private, individually negotiated
transactions with certain institutional investors and resulted in
 extraordinary gains of $166.9 million. As of June 30, 2000,
 the book value of the remaining outstanding Debentures was
$225.5 million and the aggregate principal amount at maturity was
 $561.6 million. Included in other assets is the amount of
unamortized Debenture issuance costs. The Debenture issuance
costs totaled approximately $14.5 million at origination and
 are being amortized over 10 years. During 2000,
approximately $7.1 million of unamortized costs were netted
against the extraordinary gain in connection with the
redemptions. As of June 30, 2000, the balance of unamortized
 Debenture issuance costs was approximately $4.7 million and
 is included in other assets. Subsequent to June 30, 2000,
the Company redeemed additional Debentures (see Note 11).

Note 4.  Commitments, Agreements and Contingent
Liabilities

Operating Leases

The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under
long-term, non-cancelable operating leases which expire at
various dates through 2010. Rental expense under these leases,
including month-to-month rentals, was $39.3, $36.2 and $17.8
million in 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively. Leases with terms
through 2003 for which the Company is contingently liable,
totaling $42.0 million, are not included in the table below. See
Note 8 for further discussion.

Future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating
leases as of June 30, 2000 are as follows (in thousands):

IBM License Agreement

In June of 1998, the Company entered into a broad based
technology licensing and component supply agreement with IBM (the
 “Agreement”) involving the design and manufacture of
desktop hard disk drives


WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

using IBM’s giant magnetoresistive (“GMR”) heads
and other components. The terms of the Agreement included a $20.0
 million non-refundable initial payment in June 1998, which
was fully expensed in 1998 as in-process research and
development. Additional payments of $30.0 million and $10.0
million were made in 1999 and 2000, respectively, upon the
achievement of certain product development milestones. These
additional payments were capitalized and amortized to cost of
sales as the related product was sold (generally within one
year). As of June 30, 2000 the payments had been fully
amortized. The Agreement also required the Company to make
supplemental per unit payments as the related product was sold.
These amounts were recorded to cost of sales as the product was
sold. The Agreement also included a supply arrangement for the
purchase of GMR heads at negotiated market prices.

Legal Proceedings

In 1992 Amstrad plc (“Amstrad”) brought suit against
the Company in California State Superior Court, County of Orange,
 alleging that disk drives supplied to Amstrad by the Company in
1988 and 1989 were defective and caused damages to Amstrad of not
 less than $186 million. The suit also sought punitive damages.
The Company denied the material allegations of the complaint and
filed cross-claims against Amstrad. The case was tried, and in
June 1999 the jury returned a verdict in favor of Western
Digital. Amstrad has appealed the judgment and the Company has
filed motions to recover a portion of its legal and other costs
of defense. The Company does not believe that the outcome of this
 matter will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
financial position, results of operation or liquidity.

In 1994 Papst Licensing (“Papst”) brought suit against
the Company in federal court in California alleging infringement
by the Company of five of its patents relating to disk drive
motors that the Company purchased from motor vendors. Later that
year Papst dismissed its case without prejudice, but it has
notified the Company that it intends to reinstate the suit if the
 Company does not enter into a license agreement with Papst.
Papst has also put the Company on notice with respect to several
additional patents. The Company does not believe that the outcome
 of this matter will have a material adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position, results of operation or
liquidity.

On October 23, 1998, Censtor Corporation
(“Censtor”) initiated an arbitration proceeding against
 the Company in California, alleging that it is owed royalties
under a license agreement between Censtor and the Company. In
response, the Company filed a complaint in federal court in
California seeking a determination that the patents at issue are
invalid. The federal court action has been stayed pending
completion of the arbitration procedures. The Company does not
believe that the outcome of this matter will have a material
adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of
 operation or liquidity.

On June 9, 2000 a suit was brought against the Company in
California State Superior Court on behalf of a class of former
employees of the Company who were terminated as a result of a
reduction in force in December 1999. The complaint asserts
claims for unpaid wages, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, breach
of contract, and unfair business practices. The Company has
removed the suit to federal court in California on the ground
that all of the claims are preempted by the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974. The Company denies the material
allegations of the complaint and intends to vigorously defend
this action. The Company does not believe that the outcome of
this matter will have a material adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position, results of operation or
liquidity.

In the normal course of business, the Company receives and makes
inquiries regarding possible intellectual property matters,
including alleged patent infringement. Where deemed advisable,
the Company may seek or extend licenses or negotiate settlements.
 Although patent holders often offer such licenses, no assurance
can be given that in a particular case a license will be offered
or that the offered terms will be acceptable to the Company. One
such matter currently pending involves Discovision Associates,
which has recently brought patents it holds to the Company’s
 attention. The Company does not believe that the ultimate


WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

(Continued)

resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect
on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.

From time to time the Company receives claims and is a party to
suits and other judicial and administrative proceedings
incidental to its business. Although occasional adverse decisions
 (or settlements) may occur, the Company does not believe that
the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material
adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of
 operations or liquidity.

Note 5.  Income Taxes

The domestic and international components of income (loss) before
 income taxes are as follows (in thousands):

The components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes are as
 follows (in thousands):

The tax benefits associated with employee exercises of
non-qualified stock options, disqualifying dispositions of stock
acquired with incentive stock options, and disqualifying
dispositions of stock acquired under the employee stock purchase
plan reduced taxes currently payable in 1998 by $2.3 million.
Such benefits were credited to additional paid-in capital. No
amounts were recorded to additional paid-in capital in 1999 and
2000 because their realization was not more likely than not to
occur and, consequently, a valuation allowance was recorded
against the entire benefit.

During 2000, the Company reversed $19.5 million of tax accruals
and certain deferred tax amounts. These accruals were previously
established over time and primarily related to unremitted income
of foreign subsidiaries. However, based upon a review of the
Company’s tax positions after the substantial international
operations restructurings in 2000, and due to the significant
balances of net operating losses in recent years, the Company
believes these accruals are no longer necessary.

Income tax payments amounted to $16.9 million, $5.5 million and
$4.6 million in 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively.


WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —

Temporary differences and carryforwards which give rise to a
significant portion of deferred tax assets and liabilities at
July 3, 1999 and June 30, 2000 are as follows (in
thousands):

Reserves and accrued expenses not currently deductible include
the following:

SFAS 109 requires deferred taxes to be determined for each
tax paying component of an enterprise within each tax
jurisdiction. The deferred tax assets indicated above are
attributable primarily to tax jurisdictions where a history of
earnings has not been established. The taxable earnings in these
tax jurisdictions are also subject to volatility. Therefore, the
Company believes a valuation allowance is needed to reduce the
deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to
be realized.

Reconciliation of the United States Federal statutory rate to the
 Company’s effective tax rate is as follows:

Certain income of selected subsidiaries is taxed at substantially
 lower income tax rates as compared to local statutory rates. The
 lower rates reduced income taxes and increased net earnings or
reduced the net loss

by $17.1 million ($.20 per share, diluted), $25.2 million ($.28
per share, diluted), and by $19 million ($.15 per share, diluted)
 in 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively. These lower rates are in
effect through fiscal year 2004.

At June 30, 2000, the Company had Federal and state net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $820 million and
$385 million, respectively. In addition, the Company had various
Federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $35.3
 million. The loss carryforwards expire in fiscal years 2008
through 2020 and the credit carryforwards expire in fiscal years
2001 through 2013.

Net undistributed earnings from international subsidiaries at
June 30, 2000, on which no U.S. tax has been provided,
amounted to approximately $450 million. The net undistributed
earnings are intended to finance local operating requirements.
Accordingly, an additional United States tax provision has not
been made on these earnings.

Note 6.  Shareholders’ Equity

Equity Facility

Under an existing shelf registration (“equity
facility”), the Company may issue for cash, shares of common
 stock to institutional investors. The equity facility provides
for up to $190.0 million in cash proceeds of which $111.8 million
 had been utilized during 2000. Shares sold under the equity
facility are at the market price of the Company’s common
stock less a discount ranging from 2.75% to 4.25%. During 2000,
the Company issued 24.6 million shares of common stock under the
equity facility for net cash proceeds of approximately $111.8
million. Subsequent to June 30, 2000, the Company sold
additional shares under the equity facility (see Note 11).

Stock Reserved for Issuance

The following table summarizes all shares of common stock
reserved for issuance at June 30, 2000 (in thousands):

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has an employee stock purchase plan
(“ESPP”) that operates in accordance with
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code whereby eligible
employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their
salary to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at
85% of the fair market value of common stock on the date of grant
 or the exercise date, whichever is less. Approximately 4.1
million shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance
under this plan. Approximately 1,231,000, 1,002,000 and 1,236,556
 shares were issued under this plan during 1998, 1999 and 2000,
respectively.

Stock Option Plans

Western Digital’s Employee Stock Option Plan (“Employee
 Plan”) is administered by the Compensation Committee of the
 Board of Directors (“Compensation Committee”), which
determines the vesting provisions, the form of payment for the
shares and all other terms of the options. Terms of the Employee
Plan require that the exercise price of options be not less than
the fair market value of the common stock on the


WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —

date of grant. Options granted generally vest 25% one year from
the date of grant and in twelve quarterly increments thereafter
and have a ten-year term. As of June 30, 2000, options to
purchase 7,533,074 and 11,734,723 shares of common stock were
exercisable and available for grant, respectively, under this
plan. Pursuant to the terms of the Employee Plan, participants
are permitted to utilize previously purchased common stock as
consideration to purchase additional common stock upon exercise
of options or to exercise on a cashless basis.

On September 30, 1999, the Company’s Board of Directors
 approved the Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan (the
“Broad-Based Plan”) under which options to purchase
shares of common stock may be granted to employees of the Company
 and others. This plan is intended to qualify as
“broadly-based” under the New York Stock Exchange
shareholder approval policy. The Compensation Committee
determines the vesting provisions and other terms of the options.
 To date, the options granted vest either 100% one year from the
date of grant or 25% every six months beginning six months from
the date of grant. As of June 30, 2000, options to purchase
792,648 and 12,515,448 shares of common stock were exercisable
and available for grant, respectively, under this plan.

The Company has a Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors
(“Director Plan”) and has reserved 1.6 million shares
for issuance thereunder. The Director Plan provides for initial
option grants to new directors of 75,000 shares per director and
additional grants of options to purchase 10,000 shares of common
stock per director each year upon their reelection as a director
at the annual shareholders’ meeting. Terms of the Director
Plan require that options have a ten-year term and that the
exercise price of options be not less than the fair market value
at the date of grant. Options granted generally vest 25% one year
 from the date of grant and in twelve quarterly increments
thereafter and have a ten-year term. As of June 30, 2000,
options to purchase 243,131 shares of common stock were
exercisable and options to purchase 237,839 shares of common
stock were available for grant.

The following table summarizes activity under the Employee,
Broad-Based and Director Plans (in thousands, except per share
amounts):

The significant increase in the number of shares canceled or
expired in 2000 is a result of terminations relating to
restructuring and other attrition.

The following tables summarize information about options
outstanding and exercisable under the Employee, Broad-Based and
Director Plans at June 30, 2000 (in thousand, except per
share amounts):

Some of the Company’s new venture subsidiaries maintain
stock option plans for their own employees and directors. The
terms of these plans are similar to those of the Company’s
Employee Plan. These new ventures have reserved up to
approximately 30% of their stock for existing and future option
grants to their employees and directors.

Pro Forma Information

Pro forma information regarding net income (loss) and
earnings (loss) per share is required by SFAS 123. This
 information is required to be determined as if the Company had
accounted for its stock options (including shares issued under
the Stock Option Plans and the ESPP, collectively called
“options”) granted subsequent to July 1, 1995,
under the fair value method of that statement.

The fair value of options granted in 1998, 1999 and 2000 reported
 below has been estimated at the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions:

The following is a summary of the per share weighted average fair
 value of stock options granted in the years listed below:

The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its
 stock option and ESPP plans and, accordingly, no compensation
expense has been recognized for the options in the consolidated
financial statements. Had the Company determined compensation
expense based on the fair value at the grant date for


WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

its options under SFAS 123, the Company’s net loss and net
loss per share would have been increased to the amounts indicated
 below:

Pro forma net loss and net loss per share reflects only options
granted after 1995. Therefore, the full impact of calculating
compensation expense for options under SFAS 123 is not
reflected in the pro forma net loss amounts presented above
because compensation expense is reflected over the options’
vesting period and compensation expense for options granted
before 1996 is not considered. The pro forma net loss information
 appearing above excludes the effects on pro forma compensation
expense of options granted under the new venture plans, as the
amounts are not material.

Stock Purchase Rights

In 1989, the Company implemented a plan to protect
shareholders’ rights in the event of a proposed takeover of
the Company. Under the plan, each share of the Company’s
outstanding common stock carries one Right to Purchase
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the
“Right”). The Right enables the holder, under certain
circumstances, to purchase common stock of Western Digital or of
the acquiring company at a substantially discounted price ten
days after a person or group publicly announces it has acquired
or has tendered an offer for 15% or more of the Company’s
outstanding common stock. On September 10, 1998 the
Company’s Board of Directors approved the adoption of a new
Rights plan to replace the previous plan, which expired in
September of 1998. The Rights under the new plan are similar to
the rights under the 1989 plan except they are redeemable by the
Company at $.01 per Right and expire in 2008.

Note 7.  Business Segment, International Operations and
Major Customer

Segment Information

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information” (“SFAS 131”) in
1999. SFAS 131 establishes standards for reporting financial
 and descriptive information about an enterprise’s operating
 segments in its annual financial statements and selected segment
 information in interim financial reports.

In 1998, the Company operated in one industry segment, the hard
drive industry (hard drive solutions, “HDS”), and in
accordance with SFAS 131, has provided enterprise-wide
disclosures. During 1999, the Company acquired Connex, which is a
 separate operating segment as defined under SFAS 131.
Connex is an early-stage business which did not meet the separate
 disclosure requirements under SFAS 131 in 1999 and in 2000.
 The Company also has other new venture businesses which it began
 developing in 2000 and which did not meet the separate
disclosure requirements under SFAS 131. In accordance with
SFAS 131, the Company has combined the results of Connex and
 other new ventures in an “all other” category in order
 to report the HDS segment results separately which is consistent
 with the segment information used by the chief operating
decision maker in 2000 to assess performance and evaluate how to
allocate resources. General and corporate expenses of the Company
 are included in the HDS segment.

International Operations

The Company’s operations outside the United States include a
 manufacturing facility in Malaysia as well as sales offices
throughout Europe and Asia. During 1998, 1999 and the first half
of 2000, the Company also had manufacturing facilities in
Singapore. The following table summarizes operations by
geographic areas for the past three years. United States revenues
 to unaffiliated customers include export sales to various
countries in Europe and Asia of $606.7, $482.5, and $546.5
million in 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively.

Transfers between geographic areas are accounted for at prices
comparable to normal sales through outside distributors. General
and corporate expenses of $77.6, $82.7 and $66.3 million in 1998,
 1999, and 2000 respectively, have been excluded in determining
operating income (loss) by geographic region.

Note 8.  Restructurings, Acquisitions and Dispositions

1999 Restructuring Actions

In January 1999, the Company initiated a restructuring
program which resulted in the combination of its personal storage
 and enterprise storage divisions into a single hard drive
operating unit. Accordingly, design, manufacturing, materials,
business and product marketing resources to address both the
desktop and enterprise markets were combined. In connection with
the combination, the Company’s Tuas, Singapore facility was
closed and production of enterprise drives was moved to the
Company’s facility in Chai-Chee, Singapore. This
restructuring program, which was substantially completed by the
end of the third quarter of 1999, resulted in a reduction of
worldwide employee headcount of 934 employees, approximately
 250 of which were direct and indirect labor and the remainder
were management, professional and administrative personnel. A
$41.0 million restructuring charge was recorded consisting of
$19.6 million for the write-down of the Tuas building and
equipment to its estimated fair value of $7.8 million, based on a
 valuation done by an independent party, $14.3 million for
severance and other incremental costs related to the closure of
the facility, $5.7 million for the write-off of duplicate
warranty repair and engineering supplies and $1.4 million for
renovation related costs of the Tuas facility. Of the severance
and other related charges, approximately $11.0 million was paid
in 1999, and the remainder was paid in 2000. The write-off of
duplicate warranty repair and engineering supplies, including
base replacement stock for warranty repairs and engineering
materials, was


WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

necessary due to the reduced requirements of a single combined
repair facility. Tuas facility renovation and related costs
consisted of costs incurred to ready the facility for sale.

In April 1999, the Company completed the sale of its Santa
Clara disk media operations to Komag. The components of the sale
are summarized below (in millions):

The Company received, as a component of the total consideration,
an unsecured note (the “Note”) in the amount of $30.1
million, which is included in other assets. The Note matures in
April 2002 and has an annual interest rate of 4.9%,
compounded quarterly. The outstanding principal balance and
accrued interest is due and payable in full upon maturity. The
Note contains a principal and accrued interest reduction
provision which is based on the excess, if any, of proceeds
received upon sale of Komag stock over a predetermined floor.

In conjunction with the sale of Company assets, Komag assumed
certain liabilities, mainly leases related to production
equipment and facilities. The Company is contingently liable for
these leases. If Komag were unable to meet its payment
obligations on the remaining leases, totaling approximately $42.0
 million as of June 30, 2000, the Company would be
ultimately liable to make the payments.

The transaction with Komag included a three-year volume purchase
agreement under which the Company must purchase a significant
percentage of its media requirements from Komag. The agreement
does not require the Company to purchase a fixed minimum amount
of media from Komag. The Company also entered into a License
Agreement and Joint Development Agreement. The License Agreement
grants Komag a fully paid-up license to utilize certain of the
Company’s technology in the development of future media
products for the Company. The Joint Development Agreement
provides the basis for determining the ownership of any media
manufacturing related technology developed by Komag and/or the
Company in the future. There is no additional consideration
related to the sale inherent in these other agreements.
Therefore, no portion of the sales proceeds was allocated to
them.

The April 1999 sale of the media business resulted in a
reduction of employee headcount of 1,106 employees, approximately
 650 of which were direct labor, with the rest being technicians,
 management and other professionals. Of the severance and
outplacement charge of $3.0 million, approximately $1.9 million
was paid in 1999, and the balance was paid in 2000. The sale of
the Company’s media assets to Komag and the related
transition and restructuring program were substantially completed
 by the end of the fourth quarter of 1999.

Following is a summary of the 1999 restructuring charges, the
amounts paid and the ending accrual balances (in thousands) for
the years ended July 3, 1999 and June 30, 2000:

The accrual balance at July 3, 1999 after remaining cash
obligations paid in 2000, was reversed through the restructuring
charges line item on the consolidated statement of operations in
2000 (see table below).

2000 Restructuring Actions

During the first half of 2000, the Company initiated
restructuring actions to improve operational effectiveness and
efficiency and reduce operational expenses worldwide. Charges
related to these restructuring actions were accrued in the
periods in which executive management committed to execute such
actions. Actions taken in 2000 included reorganization of
operational and management responsibilities, transfer of hard
drive production from Singapore to the Company’s
manufacturing facility in Malaysia, closure of the Company’s
 Singapore operations, and removal of property and equipment from
 service. These actions resulted in a net reduction of worldwide
headcount of approximately 1,600, of which approximately 140 were
 management, professional and administrative personnel and the
remainder were manufacturing employees. In Asia, approximately
3,800 employees were reduced from the Company’s Singapore
operation, while employees were added in Malaysia in connection
with the transfer of production. Restructuring charges recorded
in connection with these actions totaled $52.6 million and
consisted of severance and outplacement costs of $18.0 million,
the write-off of manufacturing equipment and information systems
assets of $28.8 million (taken out of service and held for
disposal), and net lease cancellation and other costs of $5.7
million.

In January 2000, the Company announced plans to exit the
enterprise hard drive market and shift its strategic focus and
resources in the enterprise storage market to Internet-related
data content management systems and management software. In
connection with this decision, the Company closed its Rochester,
Minnesota enterprise hard drive design center, and approximately
402 employees in the design center were laid off and given
legally required notification and outplacement services. The
Company sold its Rochester,


WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

Minnesota facility for cash proceeds of approximately
$29.7 million. The exit from the enterprise market resulted
in a restructuring charge of $38.1 million. The
restructuring charge consisted of $27.5 million for
equipment write-offs (equipment taken out of service and held for
 disposal), including a loss recognized on the sale of the
Rochester facility of $1.9 million, and $10.7 million for
severance, outplacement and other incremental costs associated
with the closure. Reducing these charges was the favorable
settlement of lease commitments in Singapore of $5.3 million,
favorable settlement of 1999 restructuring accruals of $1.8
million and a gain realized on the sale of the Tuas facility of
$3.1. The restructuring effort was substantially completed by
June 30, 2000.

The following table summarizes the restructuring charges, the
amounts paid and the ending accrual balances (in thousands) for
the year ended June 30, 2000:

The Company expects that the remaining restructuring accrual
balance will be paid during the first six months of 2001.

Acquisition of Connex

On February 1, 1999, the Company acquired Connex, a San
Jose-based startup company formed to develop storage solutions
for the Windows NT and Unix server environments, at a cost
of approximately $12.0 million. The purchase price included
575,662 shares of Western Digital common stock valued at
$7.9 million, forgiveness of amounts advanced to Connex
prior to the acquisition totaling $2.0 million and the
assumption of certain liabilities of approximately $2.1 million.
The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. At the time of
the acquisition, Connex was a development stage operation with no
 commercial products yet available for sale. Connex had, at the
time of acquisition, several in-process research and development
projects which were approximately 40% complete. The major
projects acquired include: industry standard storage systems and
storage management software solutions for both Windows NT and
UNIX server environments. The Company’s primary purpose for
the acquisition was to acquire these in-process projects and
complete the development efforts as the Company believed they had
 economic value but had not yet reached technological feasibility
 and had no alternative future uses. Therefore, the Company
allocated substantially all


WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

of the purchase price as a one-time charge for in-process
research and development of $12.0 million to the
Company’s results of operations in 1999. Approximately
$0.4 million of assets were acquired in the acquisition. The
 Company continued the development efforts of Connex after the
acquisition and the Consolidated Statements of Operations for
1999 and 2000 include development and administrative expenses in
the results of operations associated with these efforts. Connex
began shipping products during the third quarter of 2000.

Service Center Operations

During the quarter ended June 30, 2000, the Company entered
into an agreement with Magnetic Data Technologies Pte Ltd., a
Singapore private limited company (“MDTPL”), for the
outsourcing of the Company’s customer service center. As a
result of the agreement, the Company transferred to MDTPL, fixed
assets, inventory and other assets totaling $11.7 million in
exchange for notes receivable of $11.7 million due over
3 years, bearing interest at 9%. The agreement contains
certain cancellation provisions. No gain or loss was recorded on
the transaction. The note receivable is classified in other
assets on the consolidated balance sheets. As of June 30,
2000, the outstanding balance on the note was $7.8 million.

Note 9.  Loss Per Share

The following table illustrates the computation of basic and
diluted loss per share:

As of June 27, 1998, July 3, 1999 and June 30,
2000, 12.4 million, 17.8 million and 20.9 million
shares, respectively, relating to the possible exercise of
outstanding stock options were not included in the computation of
 diluted loss per share. Also, for the same periods, an
additional 19.4, 19.4 and 8.4 million shares, respectively,
issuable upon conversion of the Debentures were excluded from the
 computation of diluted loss per share. The effects of these
items were not included in the computation of diluted loss per
share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

Note 10.  Savings and Profit Sharing Plan

Effective July 1, 1991, the Company adopted a Savings and
Profit Sharing Plan, the Western Digital Corporation Retirement
Savings and Profit Sharing Plan (“the Plan”). The Plan
includes an employee 401(k) plan. The Plan covers substantially
all domestic employees, subject to certain eligibility
requirements. The Company may make annual contributions to the
401(k) plan at the discretion of the Board of Directors.

Investments

During the period July 1, 2000 through September 15,
2000, the Company sold 4.9 million shares of its Komag
common stock holdings for $15.0 million.

Line of Credit

On September 20, 2000, the Company’s hard drive solutions
division (“HDS”) entered into a new three-year Senior
Credit Facility replacing a previous facility that had matured on
 March 31, 2000. The new Senior Credit Facility provides up
to $125 million in revolving credit (subject to a borrowing base
calculation), is secured by HDS’s accounts receivable,
inventory, 65% of its stock in its foreign subsidiaries and other
 assets. At the option of HDS, borrowings bear interest at either
 LIBOR (with option periods of one to three months) or a base
rate, plus a margin determined by the borrowing base. The new
Senior Credit Facility requires HDS to maintain certain amounts
of tangible net worth, prohibits the payment of cash dividends on
 common stock and contains a number of other covenants.

Convertible Debentures

During the period July 1, 2000 through September 26,
2000, the Company issued 6.3 million shares of common stock
in exchange for Debentures with a book value of
$49.8 million and an aggregate principal amount at maturity
of $122.7 million. As of September 26, 2000, the
aggregate principal amount at maturity of the remaining
Debentures was $438.9 million.

Equity Facility

During the period July 1, 2000 through September 5,
2000, the Company issued 6.1 million shares of common stock
for net cash proceeds of $27.6 million under its existing
equity facility.
