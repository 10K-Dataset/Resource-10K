PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

We design, develop, manufacture and sell hard drives. A hard
    drive is a device that uses one or more rotating magnetic disks
    (“magnetic media”) to store and allow fast access to
    data. Hard drives are key components of computers, including
    desktop and notebook computers (“PCs”), data storage
    subsystems and many consumer electronic (“CE”) devices.

We sell our products worldwide to original equipment
    manufacturers (“OEMs”) and original design
    manufacturers (“ODMs”) for use in computer systems,
    subsystems or CE devices, and to distributors, resellers and
    retailers. Our hard drives are used in desktop computers,
    notebook computers, and enterprise applications such as servers,
    workstations, network attached storage, storage area networks
    and video surveillance equipment. Additionally, our hard drives
    are used in CE applications, such as digital video recorders
    (“DVRs”), and satellite and cable set-top boxes
    (“STBs”). We also sell our hard drives as stand-alone
    storage products by integrating them into finished enclosures,
    embedding application software and offering the products as
    WD

®

-branded

    external storage appliances for personal data backup and
    portable or expanded storage of digital music, photographs,
    video and other digital data.

Hard drives provide non-volatile data storage, which means that
    the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the
    device. Our hard drives currently include 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch
    form factor drives, having capacities ranging from 80 gigabytes
    (“GB”) to 2 terabytes (“TB”), nominal
    rotation speeds up to 10,000 revolutions per minute
    (“RPM”), and offer interfaces including Enhanced
    Integrated Drive Electronics (“EIDE”), Serial Advanced
    Technology Attachment (“SATA”) and Serial Attached
    SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) (“SAS”). We
    also embed our hard drives into
    WD

®

-branded

    external storage appliances using interfaces such as Universal
    Serial Bus (“USB”) 2.0, USB 3.0, external SATA,
    FireWire

tm

and Ethernet network connections with capacities of 160 GB up to
    8 TB. In addition, we offer a family of hard drives specifically
    designed to consume substantially less power than standard
    drives, utilizing our WD GreenPower
    Technology

tm

.

We also design, develop, manufacture and sell solid-state drives
    and media players. A solid-state drive is a storage device that
    uses semiconductor, non-volatile media, rather than magnetic
    media and magnetic heads, to store and allow fast access to
    data. We sell our solid-state drives worldwide to OEMs and
    distributors for use in the embedded systems and client PC
    markets. A media player is a device that connects to a
    user’s television, the Internet

and/or

home
    theater system and plays digital movies, music and photos from
    any of our
    WD

®

-branded

    external hard drives, other USB mass storage devices or content
    services accessed over the Internet. We sell our media players
    worldwide to resellers and retailers under the
    WD

®

brand.

In November 2009, we entered the traditional enterprise market
    with our WD S25, which is a 2.5-inch, SAS interface hard drive.
    The WD S25 drive provides up to 300 GB of storage suitable for
    both mission-critical enterprise server and enterprise storage
    applications, as well as data centers and large data arrays.

Business
    Strategy

Our business strategy is to provide a broad selection of
    reliable, high quality hard drives at a low total cost of
    ownership and with high efficiency and speed. We believe this
    strategy helps accomplish the following:

•

distinguishes us in the dynamic and competitive hard drive
    industry;

•

provides great value to our customers;

•

allows us to better achieve consistent financial performance,
    including strong returns on invested capital; and

•

provides continued diversification of our hard drive product set
    and entry into additional markets such as solid-state drives and
    media players.

We have designed our business strategy to accommodate
    significant unit and revenue growth with relatively small
    increases in operating expenses and to consistently achieve high
    asset utilization.



Industry

We design, develop and manufacture hard drives for the desktop
    and mobile PC, enterprise, CE and external hard drive markets.
    We believe that growth in the sales of hard drives has continued
    to outpace the growth in the sales of all PCs as there were
    approximately 86% more hard drives sold in the market than PCs
    in calendar 2009, based on industry data. We believe the
    following factors continue to drive the growth of hard drive
    sales in addition to PC applications:

•

consumer use of hard drives for the playing, retention and
    creation of digital content for personal use in the rapidly
    growing CE market;

•

growth of the external hard drive market, permitting the easy
    storage, portability and backup of digital data such as music,
    photographs or video;

•

increased use of multiple hard drives in PCs for data backup and
    expanded storage capacity; and

•

increased use of multiple cost-optimized high performance hard
    drives in data-intensive applications such as Internet-based
    search engines and social media, as well as in hard drive
    intensive hosts for handheld computing devices.

Additionally, we believe that the demand for 2.5-inch hard
    drives has grown from approximately 16% of the overall hard
    drive market in calendar 2003 to 48% of the overall hard drive
    market in calendar 2009, driven by the growing markets for
    notebook and netbook computers, game consoles and external
    storage.

We design, develop and manufacture solid-state drives for the
    embedded systems market. We also develop products with
    solid-state drive technology for emerging consumer and
    commercial computing markets.

We also design, develop and manufacture
    WD

®

-branded

    media players for the retail channel. We believe there is a
    growing need for consumers to play their personal stored digital
    content and premium content from the Internet on their
    television and home theater system in connection with the
    growing trend in the digitization of rich content and data.

These factors and our product expansion strategy have gradually
    increased our percentage of net revenue derived from non-desktop
    sources. In 2010, 64% of our net revenue was from non-desktop
    sources compared to 62% in 2009 and 56% in 2008.

For an additional discussion of risks relating to the hard drive
    industry, please see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Desktop
    PC Market

The desktop PC market consists of personal computers in a form
    intended for regular use at a single location. Individuals use
    desktop computers in homes, businesses and multi-user networks.
    Desktop computers use software applications for word processing,
    spreadsheet, desktop publishing, database management,
    multimedia, entertainment and for other needs. Hard drives store
    the desktop computer operating system and application software,
    as well as the data used by the applications.

We believe that the demand for hard drives in the desktop PC
    market has grown in part due to:

•

growth in emerging markets;

•

recovery in the commercial market;

•

the overall growth of desktop computer sales;

•

the increasing needs of businesses and individuals for increased
    storage capacity on their desktop computers;

•

the continuing development of software applications to manage
    and create multimedia content; and

•

the increasing use of broadband Internet, including content
    downloaded from the Internet onto desktop computer hard drives.

We believe several other factors affect the rate of desktop
    computer unit growth, including growth of notebook and netbook
    computers, an increase in first-time buyers of desktop computers
    in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America,



maturing desktop PC markets in North America and Western Europe,
    and the lengthening of desktop computer replacement cycles.

Mobile PC
    Market

The mobile PC market consists primarily of notebook and netbook
    computers. Individuals use mobile computers both in and away
    from homes and businesses. Like desktop computers, mobile
    computers use software applications for various needs. Hard
    drives store the mobile computer operating system and
    application software, as well as the data used by the
    applications.

We believe that the demand for hard drives in the mobile PC
    market has grown in part due to:

•

the overall growth of mobile sales, including increased
    transition from desktop computers to mobile computers;

•

the increased mobility of the workforce;

•

the increasing needs of businesses and individuals for increased
    storage capacity on their mobile computers;

•

the continuing development of software applications to manage
    multimedia content; and

•

the increasing use of broadband Internet, including content
    downloaded from the Internet onto mobile hard drives.

We expect the mobile PC market to continue to grow faster than
    the desktop or enterprise markets in the next five years. As the
    mobile PC market continues to evolve to a higher volume market,
    we believe customers are placing increased emphasis on
    attributes such as quality, availability, reliability,
    execution, flexibility, capacity, performance, power and the
    competitive cost structures of their hard drive suppliers. These
    are the same attributes that have been emphasized for many years
    by customers in the high-volume desktop PC market.

Enterprise
    Market

The enterprise market for hard drives includes workstations,
    servers, network attached storage, storage area networks, other
    computing systems or subsystems, network-communications and
    video surveillance. Hard drives for this market utilize three
    principal interfaces; Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop
    (“FC-AL”); SAS interface technology; or SATA. SATA
    hard drives typically cost customers less than SAS or FC-AL hard
    drives while offering higher capacities and maintaining similar
    reliability, scalability and performance.

We believe that enterprise uses of SATA hard drives will
    continue to increase. During the past few years, a new
    application has emerged with high-capacity SATA hard drives
    augmenting FC-AL and SAS hard drives, tape and optical media.
    This application, popularly referred to as “near-line”
    storage, has created a growth market because SATA hard drives
    access data more quickly than tape or optical solutions, quickly
    retrieve critical

back-up

or
    near-line data and are more cost effective than FC-AL and SAS
    hard drives. The low price per capacity of SATA drives has
    stimulated applications such as video surveillance, video
    editing/broadcasting and medical imaging. These applications
    represent segments of a growing market for high capacity storage
    in non-computing imaging and multimedia professions.

Enterprise-class SATA drives are becoming commonplace for
    IT infrastructure applications such as databases, scientific
    computing, surveillance, web content, web caching, web search
    engines and electronic mail. These applications have become an
    important market for high-capacity SATA hard drives. We believe
    that this market will consume a growing portion of the highest
    capacity hard drives in the next three years.

SATA technology is compatible with SAS technology, enabling
    customers the flexibility of incorporating SATA hard drives in
    SAS storage systems. We believe the units shipped in the
    enterprise-class SATA market was approximately 36% of the
    enterprise hard drive market in calendar 2009.

High-performance server applications, including blade servers,
    are increasingly using 2.5-inch form factor hard drives,
    supplanting traditional 3.5-inch drives. Smaller form factors
    enable more drives per physical space for increased performance,
    higher capacity per square foot and lower power consumption.
    This trend demonstrates the fragmentation of the enterprise hard
    drive market and the need for application-specific
    enterprise-class hard drives.



There is a trend towards centralization of information storage
    and delivery of Internet-based services through cloud computing.
    Cloud computing delivers shared resources, software and
    information to users on demand on a multitude of devices, such
    as client PCs and handheld computing devices. Most cloud
    computing models consist of services delivered through common
    data centers that utilize servers and hard drives designed for
    the enterprise market. The infrastructure to support cloud
    computing storage needs is driving the demand for both SAS and
    SATA enterprise-class hard drives.

Consumer
    Electronics Market

The use of hard drives in CE products has been a major growth
    area in recent years. Currently, the two largest segments of
    this market are:

•

video content in applications such as DVRs; and

•

hard drives in game consoles.

DVRs are available for use in home entertainment systems and
    offer enhanced capabilities such as pausing live television,
    simplifying the process of recording and cataloging recorded
    television programs and quickly forwarding or returning to any
    section of a recorded television program. Additionally, digital
    video disk (“DVD”) recorders increasingly incorporate
    hard drives to allow for DVR functionality and faster recording
    of content onto removable DVDs. The market for these products
    favors larger capacity hard drives and continues to grow
    globally. We believe growth in this market will continue to
    build demand for higher capacity hard drives.

Game consoles are increasingly incorporating hard drives to
    improve the user experience. Hard drive technology enables users
    to save games, movies, music, pictures and other user generated
    content.

The proliferation in the CE market of more sophisticated mobile
    devices, including smartphones, portable media players and
    tablet computers, is driving the delivery of diverse content
    from hard drive intensive hosts. We believe this is one of the
    factors influencing increased sales of
    enterprise-class SATA drives. We also believe that
    multimedia handheld devices, such as video cameras and
    high-resolution still cameras, are enabling consumer production
    of expansive digital content that requires increasing amounts of
    small form-factor hard drive storage, as well as high-capacity
    desktop-class hard drives for editing, manipulation and
    long-term storage of such content.

External
    Hard Drive Market

Most new PC systems include high-speed external interfaces, such
    as USB 2.0, USB 3.0, external SATA,
    FireWire

tm

or Ethernet network connections, that permit users to supplement
    the storage space of their PC systems or home and small office
    networks with the use of external hard drives. Users store
    additional programs or multimedia content, and back up internal
    hard drives with external hard drives, as well as use mobile
    external hard drives for portability and security. External
    storage can often be the easiest, quickest or only way of adding
    additional storage capacity to either a desktop or notebook
    computer. We believe there is an increasing consumer awareness
    of the need and value of securely storing personal digital
    content through backup applications and devices. We believe
    there is a growing need for external storage as a way of
    expanding storage capacity in CE devices such as DVRs. We also
    believe there is a growing need for media players that enable
    consumers to play digital movies and music, view photos, and
    access the Internet, otherwise limited to being viewed on
    computer screens, from USB mass storage devices on their
    television or home theater system.

Solid-State
    Drive Market

The solid-state drive market consists primarily of solid-state
    drives which use semiconductor, non-volatile media that retains
    data even when power is not applied using either single-level
    cell or multilevel cell NAND media.

We believe that the demand for solid-state drives in certain
    markets has grown in part due to:

•

the increasing performance, measured by input/output per second,
    in enterprise applications;

•

the increasing premium performance applications in the desktop
    and notebook markets; and

•

the increasing requirements of the embedded systems market for
    high durability and long life cycles.



We expect the solid-state drive market to grow faster on a
    compounded annual growth rate basis than the hard drive market
    over the next four years, but will still remain a small portion
    of the total storage market on a unit basis.

Other
    Market Opportunities

We regularly review opportunities to apply our knowledge of data
    storage technology to markets that we do not currently serve.
    Based on significant investments we made over the last six
    years, we believe we have the technology building blocks to
    increase our overall market penetration and be a full-line hard
    drive supplier. Consistent with our measured and deliberate
    approach to new market entries in the recent past, our approach
    to additional new markets will be based on a careful assessment
    of the risks, rewards, requirements and profit potential of such
    actions.

Desktop
    Hard Drive Products

The hard drives we design for the desktop PC market currently
    consist of 3.5-inch form factor products with capacities ranging
    from 80 GB to 2 TB. These products utilize either the EIDE or
    SATA interfaces, providing high performance while retaining ease
    of use and overall low cost of connection. The type of EIDE
    interface currently used in our hard drives is ATA/100, which
    signifies a burst data transfer rate of 100 megabytes per
    second, which is the maximum specified data transition that can
    be sustained under ideal conditions. The SATA interface
    available in the majority of our hard drives enables burst
    transfer rates of up to 6 gigabits (Gb) per second.

Mobile
    Hard Drive Products

Our hard drives used in mobile products typically include
    2.5-inch form factor products with capacities ranging from 80 GB

Research
    and Development

We devote substantial resources to development of new products
    and improvement of existing products. We focus our engineering
    efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing
    processes to bring our products to market in a cost-effective
    and timely manner. Research and development expenses totaled
    $611 million, $509 million and $464 million in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Fiscal 2010 represented the ninth consecutive year of
    substantial growth in our research and development spending to
    support the significant broadening of our product and technology
    portfolios. Consistently over that nine-year period, we grew our
    research and development spending 441% from $113 million in
    fiscal 2001 to $611 million in fiscal 2010. As a result of
    this investment activity, we continue to expand our business
    beyond the desktop PC market into newer markets or markets in
    which we have not previously participated. Such investments have
    allowed us to execute against our strategic objective of revenue
    diversification to address the growth of new applications for
    hard drives and fast-growing new market opportunities.

Technology
    and Product Development

Hard drives record, store and retrieve digital data. Performance
    attributes of hard drives, such as their ability to access and
    transmit data and storage capacity, are currently better than
    removable disks, optical hard drives and tapes, and they are
    more cost-effective than semiconductor technology. The primary
    measures of hard drive performance include:

•

“Acoustics” — which is the sound power
    emitted during hard drive operation, commonly expressed in
    decibels, and perceived loudness due to sound pressure, commonly
    expressed in sones.

•

“Data transfer rate” — which is the
    sustained rate of data transfer to and from the disk, commonly
    expressed in gigabits per second. One gigabit equals one billion
    bits.

•

“Seek time” — which is the time needed to
    position the heads over a selected track on the disk surface,
    commonly expressed in milliseconds.

•

“Spindle rotation speed” — which is the
    nominal rotation speed of the disks inside the hard drive,
    commonly expressed in RPM or latency. Spindle rotation speeds
    commonly stated as 5,400, 7,200 and 10,000 RPM are sometimes
    approximations.

•

“Storage capacity” — which is the amount of
    data that can be stored on the hard drive, commonly expressed in
    GB or TB. As defined in the hard drive industry, one GB equals
    one billion bytes and one TB equals one trillion bytes. A byte
    is a digital character, typically comprised of eight bits. A bit
    is a binary digit, the smallest unit of information in a digital
    system.

•

“Power Consumption” — which is the amount of
    electricity required to operate the drive, measured in watts.

All of our hard drive products employ similar technology. The
    main components of the hard drive are a Head-Disk-Assembly
    (“HDA”) and a Printed Circuit Board Assembly
    (“PCBA”).

HDA: The HDA includes heads, magnetic media, head positioning
    mechanism (“actuator”) and spindle motor. A rigid base
    and top cover contain these components in a
    contamination-controlled environment. One or more disks
    positioned around a motor-driven spindle hub that rotates the
    disks comprise the disk-pack assembly. The disk is made



up of a smooth substrate on which thin layers of magnetic
    materials are deposited. The head stack assembly
    (“HSA”) is comprised of a magnetic positioner, a
    pivot-arm module, on which the individual heads are mounted.
    Each disk has a head suspended directly above it, which can read
    data from or write data to the spinning disk.

PCBA: The PCBA includes both standard and custom integrated
    circuits, an interface connector to the host computer and a
    power connector. The integrated circuits on the printed circuit
    board typically include a drive interface and a controller. The
    drive interface receives instructions from the host computer,
    while the controller directs the flow of data to or from the
    disks and controls the heads. The location of data on each disk
    is logically maintained in concentric tracks divided into
    sectors. The host computer sends instructions to the controller
    to read data from or write data to the disks, based on logical
    track and sector locations. Guided by instructions from the
    controller, the HSA pivots in an arc across the disk until it
    reaches the selected track of a disk, where the data is recorded
    or retrieved.

Industry-standard interfaces allow the hard drive to communicate
    with the computer. Currently, the primary interfaces for PCs are
    PATA and SATA. The primary interfaces for enterprise systems are
    SATA, and the following, which we refer to as traditional
    enterprise: SCSI, SAS and FC-AL. As computer performance
    continues to improve, the hard drive will need to deliver
    information faster. We believe this will continue to drive the
    transition of the PC industry to higher speed interfaces, such
    as SATA and SAS, to facilitate the higher data transfer rates.
    We currently offer the SATA interface on our WD
    Caviar

    hard drive families; and the SAS interface on the WD S25 hard
    drive family.

The number of disks and each disk’s areal density (track
    density multiplied by bit density), which is a measure of the
    amount of data that can be stored on the recording surface of
    the disk per unit area, determines storage capacity of the hard
    drive. The higher the areal density, the more information can be
    stored on a single platter. Achieving a given drive capacity
    requires fewer disks and heads as the areal density increases,
    potentially reducing product costs over time through reduced
    component requirements. In September 2009, we began shipping our
    WD
    Caviar

®

Black

tm

3.5-inch 2 TB drives at 500 GB per platter areal density. In
    March 2010, we began shipping our WD
    Scorpio

®

Blue

tm

2.5-inch 750 GB drives at 375 GB per platter areal density.

Head technology is one of the key components affecting areal
    density. The hard drive industry has transitioned from the use
    of longitudinal magnetic recording (“LMR”) head
    technology for the head writer function to perpendicular
    magnetic recording (“PMR”) technology, which allows
    for significantly higher storage capacities. In addition, the
    industry has made the transition to tunnel-junction magneto
    resistive (“TMR”) technology for the head reader
    function. We have completed the transition to PMR and TMR across
    all of our product platforms.

With the transition to PMR, magnetic media plays a much more
    important role in achieving higher areal density. PMR demands a
    much tighter interaction and matching between head and magnetic
    media designs. We are vertically integrated in the two most
    important technology components of hard drives (heads and
    magnetic media), which has enabled us to achieve a more optimum
    design and utilization of these components.

We invest considerable resources in research and development,
    manufacturing infrastructure and capital equipment of head and
    magnetic media components, in order to secure our competitive
    position and cost structure.

Solid-state drives record, store and retrieve digital data
    without any moving parts. Attributes, such as fast read/write
    speeds, low power consumption and robust durability offer
    greater performance than hard drives in some storage
    applications but are currently much more costly per GB and are
    available in much lower capacity points than hard drives. The
    main components of a solid-state drive are the

system-on-chip

and semiconductor media. The capacity of a solid-state drive is
    based on the total number of MB or GB of semiconductor media in
    the solid-state drive. Industry-standard storage interface
    protocols, such as SATA, PATA/CF and USB 2.0, allow the
    solid-state drive to communicate with the host system.

The
    WD

®

product lines generally leverage a common platform for various
    products within product families with different capacities to
    serve differing market needs. This platform strategy results in
    commonality of components across different products within
    product families and, in some cases, across product families,
    which reduces exposure to changes in demand, facilitates
    inventory management and allows us to achieve lower costs
    through purchasing economies. This platform strategy also
    enables our customers to leverage their qualification efforts
    onto successive product models.

Sales and
    Distribution

We sell our products globally to OEMs, ODMs, distributors and
    retailers. OEMs purchase our products, either directly or
    through a contract manufacturer such as an ODM, and assemble
    them into the computer or CE systems they build. Distributors
    typically sell our products to non-direct customers such as
    small computer and CE manufacturers, dealers, systems
    integrators, online retailers and other resellers. Retailers
    typically sell our products directly to end-users through their
    storefront or online facilities.

Original
    Equipment Manufacturers

Sales to OEMs, which include sales through ODMs, accounted for
    51%, 54% and 51% of our net revenue in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. For 2010 and 2008, no single customer accounted
    for 10% or more of our net revenue. For 2009, sales to Dell Inc.
    accounted for 10% of our net revenue. We believe that our
    success depends on our ability to maintain and improve our
    strong relationships with the leading OEMs.

OEMs evaluate and select their hard drive and solid-state drive
    suppliers based on a number of factors, including quality and
    reliability, storage capacities, performance characteristics,
    price, service and support, ease of doing business and the
    supplier’s long-term financial stability. OEMs typically
    seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of
    products, and once an OEM has chosen its qualified vendors for a
    given product, it generally will purchase products from those
    vendors for the life of that product. To achieve success with
    OEM qualifications, a supplier must consistently offer products
    featuring leading technology, quality and reliability at
    acceptable capacity. Suppliers must quickly achieve volume
    production of each new generation of high quality and reliable
    hard drives or solid-state drives, requiring access to flexible,
    high-capacity, high-quality manufacturing capabilities.

Many of our OEM customers utilize

just-in-time

inventory management processes or supply chain business models
    that combine

“build-to-order,”

in which they do not build until there is a firm order, and
    “contract manufacturing,” in which the OEM contracts
    assembly work to a contract manufacturer, such as an ODM, who
    purchases components and assembles the computer based on the
    OEM’s instructions. For certain OEMs, we maintain a base
    stock of finished goods inventory in facilities located near or
    adjacent to the OEM’s operations.

For an additional discussion of risks related to our need to
    adapt to our customers’ business models and maintain
    customer satisfaction, refer to Item 1A of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Distributors

We use a broad group of distributors to sell our products to
    non-direct customers such as small computer and CE
    manufacturers, dealers, systems integrators, online retailers
    and other resellers. Distributors accounted for approximately
    31%, 26% and 31% of our net revenue for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Distributors generally enter into non-exclusive
    agreements for specific territories with us for the purchase and
    redistribution of our products in those territories. We grant
    our distributors limited price protection.

Retailers

We sell our branded products directly to a select group of major
    retailers such as computer superstores, warehouse clubs, online
    retailers, and computer electronics stores, and authorize sales
    through distributors to smaller retailers. Retailers accounted
    for approximately 18%, 20% and 18% of our net revenue for 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The retail channel complements our
    other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for
    WD and our products. Retailers supply end-users with our
    products to upgrade their computers, externally store their data
    for backup or mobility purposes and play their stored digital
    content or content accessed over the Internet on their
    television or home theater systems. We grant our retailers
    limited price protection. We also sell our branded products
    through our Web site.



Sales and
    Marketing

We maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world
    including the major geographies of the Americas, Asia Pacific,
    Europe and the Middle East. Our international sales, which
    include sales to foreign subsidiaries of United States
    (“U.S.”) companies but do not include sales to
    U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies, represented 81%,
    80% and 76% of our net revenue for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Sales to international customers may be subject to
    certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations,
    including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations. For
    an additional discussion regarding the risks related to sales to
    international customers, see Item 1A of this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

For additional information concerning revenue recognition, sales
    by geographic region and major customer information, see
    Part II, Item 8, Notes 1 and 6 in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

We perform our marketing and advertising functions internally
    and through outside firms. We target advertising, worldwide
    packaging and marketing materials to various reseller and
    end-user categories. We utilize both consumer media and trade
    publications. We have programs under which we reimburse
    qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing
    expenditures. We also maintain customer relationships by
    communicating with our resellers and providing end-users with
    information and support through our Web site.

Competition

We compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives for use
    in desktop, notebook, enterprise, CE and external storage
    products. Our competitors in the hard drive market include
    companies such as Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, Samsung
    Electronics Co. Ltd., Seagate Technology and Toshiba Corporation.

The hard drive industry is intensely competitive, with hard
    drive suppliers competing for sales to a limited number of major
    customers. Hard drives manufactured by different competitors are
    highly substitutable due to the industry mandate of technical
    form, fit and function standards. Hard drive manufacturers
    compete on the basis of product quality and reliability, storage
    capacity, unit price, product performance, production volume
    capabilities, delivery capability, leadership in

time-to-market,

time-to-volume

and

time-to-quality,

service and support and ease of doing business. The relative
    importance of these factors varies by customer and market. We
    believe that we are generally competitive in all of these
    factors.

We believe that there are no substantial barriers for existing
    competitors to offer competing products. Therefore, we believe
    that we cannot differentiate
    WD

®

hard drive products solely on attributes such as storage
    capacity, buffer size or

time-to-market.

Accordingly, we differentiate WD by focusing on operational
    excellence, high product quality and reliability, and designing
    and incorporating into our hard drives desirable product
    performance attributes. Such performance attributes include seek
    times, data transfer rates, intelligent caching, failure
    prediction, remote diagnostics, acoustics, error recovery, low
    operating temperature, low power consumption and optimized
    streaming capabilities.

In addition, we differentiate WD by emphasizing non-product
    related attributes, including rapid response to our customers.
    Rapid response requires accelerated design cycles, customer
    delivery, production flexibility and timely service and support,
    which contribute to customer satisfaction. We also rely on the
    strength of the WD brand name with value-added resellers,
    retailers and solution providers to whom we sell our hard drive
    products directly and indirectly. We believe that trust in a
    manufacturer’s reputation, its execution track record and
    the establishment of strategic relationships have become
    important factors in the selection of a hard drive, particularly
    in a rapidly changing technology environment.

Advances in magnetic, optical or other data storage technologies
    could result in competitive products with better performance or
    lower cost per unit of capacity than our products. We monitor
    the advantages, disadvantages and advances of the full array of
    storage technologies on an ongoing basis.

High-speed semiconductor media competes with hard drive products
    in some applications, such as consumer handheld devices and
    portable external storage. Semiconductor media is much faster in
    some applications than magnetic hard drives, but currently is
    not competitive in most applications using 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch
    form factor hard drives from a cost standpoint. Flash memory, a
    non-volatile semiconductor media, is currently much more costly
    and, while it



has higher “read” performance attributes than hard
    drives, it has lower “write” performance attributes.
    Flash memory could become more competitive in the near future
    for additional applications requiring less storage capacity than
    that provided by hard drives. However, we believe that the
    traditional high-volume computing markets will remain the domain
    of 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch hard drives based on the hard drive
    industry’s attributes of reliability, availability, storage
    capacity and cost.

Our competitors in the external hard drive market include
    companies such as EMC Corporation, Hitachi Global Storage
    Technologies, LaCie S.A., Melco Holdings Inc. and Seagate
    Technology. Our competitors in the solid-state drive market
    include companies such as Intel Corporation, Micron Technology,
    Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., Smart Modular Technologies,
    Inc. and STEC, Inc. Our competitors in the media player retail
    market include companies such as Apple Inc., EMC Corporation,
    LaCie S.A., Roku, Inc. and Seagate Technology.

    see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Seasonality

We have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in our
    business with higher levels of demand in the first and second
    quarters of our fiscal year. This seasonality is a result of
    consumer spending at the beginning of the school year and during
    the holiday season.

Service
    and Warranty

We generally warrant our newly manufactured products against
    defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from
    the date of manufacture depending on the type of product. Our
    warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or
    replacement. We have engaged third parties in various countries
    in multiple regions, including Africa, Asia Pacific, Australia,
    Europe, India, Latin America, the Middle East and North America,
    to provide various levels of testing, processing

and/or

recertification of returned products for our customers.

Manufacturing

We believe that we have significant know-how, unique product
    manufacturing processes, execution skills and human resources to
    continue to be successful and have the ability to grow, as
    necessary, our manufacturing operations. To be competitive, we
    must manufacture high quality hard drives with industry leading

time-to-volume

production at competitive unit costs. We strive to maintain
    manufacturing flexibility, high manufacturing yields, reliable
    products, and high-quality components that we manufacture
    ourselves, while insisting that our suppliers provide
    high-quality components at competitive prices. The critical
    elements of our hard drive production are high volume and
    utilization, low cost assembly and testing, and establishment
    and maintenance of key supplier relationships. By establishing
    close relationships with our strategic component suppliers, we
    believe we access

best-of-class

technology and manufacturing quality. In addition, we believe
    that our sourcing strategy currently enables us to have the
    business flexibility needed to select the highest quality, low
    cost of ownership suppliers as product designs and technologies
    evolve.

Hard drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the
    assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and
    thorough testing. The assembly process occurs in a “clean
    room” environment that demands skill in process engineering
    and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs
    of this manufacturing environment. Our clean room manufacturing
    process consists of modular production units, each of which
    contains a number of work cells.

We manufacture hard drives in Malaysia and Thailand. We
    continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to
    increase productivity, sustain and improve quality and decrease
    manufacturing costs. We continually evaluate which steps in the
    manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how
    automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and
    reduce manufacturing costs.

We use our wafer fabrication facilities in Fremont, California
    and our slider fabrication facility in Bang Pa-In, Thailand, to
    design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and
    head gimbal assemblies (“HGAs”) we include in the hard
    drives we manufacture.



We have magnetic media and substrate design and manufacturing
    facilities in Malaysia. We also have a magnetic media design and
    manufacturing facility in Singapore. We use these facilities to
    design and manufacture most of the magnetic media and substrates
    that we use in our products.

We leverage the efficiencies of contract manufacturers when
    strategically advantageous.

For an additional discussion of risks related to manufacturing,
    see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Materials
    and Supplies

The following products are the major components currently used
    in the manufacture of our hard drives:

•

magnetic heads and magnetic media;

•

suspensions with related HGAs and HSAs;

•

spindle motors;

•

custom and standard electronics such as

system-on-chip,

magnetic media, motor controllers,

pre-amps

and
    printed circuit boards;

•

base and top covers; and

•

magnets and related voice coil motors.

We also use several other components in our hard drives such as
    seals, filters, plastic molded parts, capacitors, resistors,
    connectors and cables.

We design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and
    magnetic media required for the hard drives we manufacture. We
    purchase a portion of these components from third party
    suppliers. We acquire all of the remaining components for our
    products from third party suppliers.

The major components used in the manufacture of our solid-state
    drives (the semiconductor media and

system-on-chip)

and in our media player (the controller) are acquired from third
    party suppliers.

We generally retain multiple suppliers for each of our component
    requirements but in some instances use sole sources for business
    reasons. We believe that components are generally available.

For an additional discussion of risks related to our component
    supplies, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Backlog

A substantial portion of our orders are generally for shipments
    within 30 to 60 days of the placement of the order. We
    generally negotiate pricing, order lead times, product support
    requirements and other terms and conditions before receiving a
    customer’s first purchase order for a product.
    Customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with
    relatively short notice to us, with little or no cost to the
    customer, or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a
    later date. In addition, we make many of our sales to OEMs under

just-in-time

delivery contracts that do not generally require firm order
    commitments by the customer until the time of sale. Instead, we
    receive a periodic forecast of requirements from the customer
    and invoice the customer upon shipment of the product from the

just-in-time

warehouse. Therefore, backlog information as of the end of a
    particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels
    of our revenue and profit and may not be comparable to earlier
    periods.

Patents,
    Licenses and Proprietary Information

We own numerous patents and have many patent applications in
    process. We believe that, although our patents and patent
    applications have considerable value, the successful
    manufacturing and marketing of our products depends primarily
    upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff.
    Accordingly, the patents held and applied for do not ensure our
    future success.



In addition to patent protection of certain intellectual
    property rights, we consider elements of our product designs and
    processes to be proprietary and confidential. We believe that
    our non-patented intellectual property, particularly some of our
    process technology, is an important factor in our success. We
    rely upon non-disclosure agreements and contractual provisions
    and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary
    information. Despite these safeguards, there is a risk that
    competitors may obtain and use such information. The laws of
    foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide
    less protection for confidential information than the U.S.

We rely on certain technology that we license from other parties
    to manufacture and sell WD products. We believe that we have
    adequate cross-licenses and other agreements in place in
    addition to our own intellectual property portfolio to compete
    successfully in the hard drive industry. For additional
    discussion of risks related to our ownership and use of
    intellectual property, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Environmental
    Regulation

We are subject to a variety of regulations in connection with
    our operations. We believe that we have obtained or are in the
    process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our
    operations. For additional discussion of risks related to
    environmental regulation, see Item 1A of this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

Employees

As of July 2, 2010, we employed a total of approximately
    62,500 employees worldwide. This represents an increase in
    headcount of approximately 36% since July 3, 2009 and an
    increase of approximately 25% since June 27, 2008. Many of
    our employees are highly skilled, and our continued success
    depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such
    employees. Accordingly, we offer employee benefit programs,
    which we believe are, in the aggregate, competitive with those
    offered by our competitors. We and most of our competitors
    nevertheless have difficulty at times hiring and retaining
    certain skilled employees. We have engaged consultants and
    contract personnel to fill these needs until full-time employees
    could be recruited. We consider our employee relations to be
    good. For additional discussion of risks related to our skilled
    employees, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Negative
    or uncertain global economic conditions could result in a
    decrease in our sales and revenue and an increase in our
    operating costs, which could adversely affect our business and
    operating results.

Negative or uncertain global economic conditions could cause
    many of our direct and indirect customers to delay or reduce
    their purchases of our products and systems containing our
    products. In addition, many of our customers in each of the OEM,
    distribution and retail channels rely on credit financing in
    order to purchase our products. If negative conditions in the
    global credit markets prevent our customers’ access to
    credit, product orders in these channels may decrease, which
    could result in lower revenue. Likewise, if our suppliers face
    challenges in obtaining credit, in selling their products or
    otherwise in operating their businesses, they may be unable to
    offer the materials we use to manufacture our products. These
    actions could result in reductions in our revenue, increased
    price competition and increased operating costs, which could
    adversely affect our business, results of operations and
    financial condition.

If
    industry demand slows significantly as a result of negative or
    uncertain global economic conditions or otherwise, we may have
    to take steps to align our cost structure with demand, which
    could result in impairment charges and have a negative impact on
    our operating results.

If demand slows significantly as a result of a deterioration in
    economic conditions or otherwise, we may need to execute
    restructuring activities to realign our cost structure with
    softening demand. The occurrence of restructuring activities
    could result in impairment charges and other expenses, which
    could adversely impact our results of operations or financial
    condition.

Negative
    or uncertain global economic conditions increase the risk that
    we could suffer unrecoverable losses on our customers’
    accounts receivable, which would adversely affect our financial
    results.

We extend credit and payment terms to some of our customers. In
    addition to ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’
    financial condition, we traditionally seek to mitigate our
    credit risk by purchasing credit insurance on certain of our
    accounts receivable balances; however, as a result of the recent
    uncertainty and volatility in global economic conditions, we may
    find it increasingly difficult to be able to insure these
    accounts receivable. We could suffer significant losses if a
    customer whose accounts receivable we have not insured, or have
    underinsured, fails and is unable to pay us.



Additionally, negative or uncertain global economic conditions
    increase the risk that if a customer whose accounts receivable
    we have insured fails, the financial condition of the insurance
    carrier for such customer account may have also deteriorated
    such that it cannot cover our loss. A significant loss of an
    accounts receivable that we cannot recover through credit
    insurance would have a negative impact on our financial results.

If our
    long-lived assets or goodwill become impaired, it may adversely
    affect our operating results.

Negative or uncertain global economic conditions could result in
    circumstances, such as a sustained decline in our stock price
    and market capitalization or a decrease in our forecasted cash
    flows such that they are insufficient, indicating that the
    carrying value of our long-lived assets or goodwill may be
    impaired. If we are required to record a significant charge to
    earnings in our consolidated financial statements because an
    impairment of our long-lived assets or goodwill is determined,
    our results of operations will be adversely affected.

Declines
    in average selling prices (“ASPs”) in the hard drive
    industry could adversely affect our operating results.

Historically, the hard drive industry has experienced declining
    ASPs. Our ASPs tend to decline when competitors lower prices as
    a result of decreased costs or to absorb excess capacity,
    liquidate excess inventories, restructure or attempt to gain
    market share. Our ASPs also decline when there is a shift in the
    mix of product sales, and sales of lower priced products
    increase relative to those of higher priced products. When ASPs
    in the hard drive industry decline, our ASPs are also likely to
    decline, which adversely affects our operating results.

If we
    fail to anticipate or timely respond to changes in the markets
    for hard drives, our operating results could be adversely
    affected.

The PC industry, which comprises a substantial portion of our
    revenue, is experiencing a shift in demand from 3.5-inch to
    2.5-inch form factor disk drives. As a result, the market for
    2.5-inch form factor drives is becoming increasingly dominated
    by large brand OEM customers. These OEM customers may be able to
    command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms
    of sale. If we are not successful in responding to these changes
    in the market for smaller form factor drives, our business may
    suffer.

In addition, during past economic downturns, as well as over the
    past few years, the consumer market for computers has shifted
    significantly towards lower priced systems, and we therefore
    expect this trend to continue in light of current global
    economic conditions. If we are not able to continue to offer a
    competitively priced hard drive for the low-cost PC market, our
    share of that market will likely fall, which could harm our
    operating results.

The market for hard drives is also fragmenting into a variety of
    devices and products. Many industry analysts expect, as do we,
    that as content increasingly converts to digital technology from
    the older analog technology, the technology of computers and
    consumer electronics will continue to converge, and hard drives
    may be found in many products other than computers, such as
    various CE devices. However, there has also been a recent rapid
    growth in CE devices that do not contain a hard drive (such as
    tablet computers and smartphones). If device-makers are
    successful in achieving customer acceptance of these devices as
    a replacement for traditional computing applications that
    contain hard drives, or if we are not successful in adapting our
    product offerings to include alternative storage solutions that
    address these devices, then demand for our products may
    decrease, which could adversely affect our operating results.

Moreover, some devices such as personal video recorders and
    digital video recorders, or some new PC operating systems which
    allow greater consumer choice in levels of functionality and
    therefore greater market differentiation, may require attributes
    not currently offered in our products, resulting in a need to
    develop new interfaces, form factors, technical specifications
    or product features, increasing our overall operational expense
    without corresponding incremental revenue at this stage. If we
    are not successful in continuing to deploy our hard drive
    technology and expertise to develop new products for emerging
    markets such as the CE market, or if we are required to incur
    significant costs in developing such products, it may harm our
    operating results.

Our
    prices and margins are subject to declines due to unpredictable
    end-user demand and oversupply of hard drives.

Demand for our hard drives depends on the demand for systems
    manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to
    existing systems. The demand for systems has been volatile in
    the past and often has had an exaggerated effect



on the demand for hard drives in any given period. As a result,
    the hard drive market has experienced periods of excess capacity
    which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories and intense
    price competition. If intense price competition occurs, we may
    be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected, which
    could result in lower revenue and gross margins.

Our
    failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for
    our products could adversely affect our business and financial
    results or operating efficiencies.

The data storage industry faces difficulties in accurately
    forecasting market and customer demand for its products.
    Accurately forecasting demand has become increasingly difficult
    for us, our customers and our suppliers in light of the
    volatility in global economic conditions. The variety and volume
    of products we manufacture is based in part on these forecasts.
    If our forecasts exceed actual market demand, or if market
    demand decreases significantly from our forecasts, then we could
    experience periods of product oversupply and price decreases,
    which could impact our financial performance. If our forecasts
    do not meet actual market demand, or if market demand increases
    significantly beyond our forecasts or beyond our ability to add
    manufacturing capacity, then we may not be able to satisfy
    customer product needs, which could result in a loss of market
    share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands.

Although we receive forecasts from our customers, they are not
    generally obligated to purchase the forecasted amounts. Sales
    volumes in the distribution and retail channels are volatile and
    harder to predict than sales to our OEM or ODM customers. We
    consider these forecasts in determining our component needs and
    our inventory requirements. If we fail to accurately forecast
    our customers’ product demands, we may have inadequate or
    excess inventory of our products or components, which could
    adversely affect our operating results.

In order to efficiently and timely meet the demands of many of
    our OEM customers, we position our products in multiple
    strategic locations based on the amounts forecasted by such
    customers. If an OEM customer’s actual product demands
    decrease significantly from its forecast, then we may incur
    additional costs in relocating the products that have not been
    purchased by the OEM. This could result in a delay in our
    product sales and an increase in our operating costs, which may
    negatively impact our operating results.

Our entry
    into additional storage markets increases the complexity of our
    business, and if we are unable to successfully adapt our
    business processes as required by these new markets, we will be
    at a competitive disadvantage and our ability to grow will be
    adversely affected.

As we expand our product line to sell into additional storage
    markets, the overall complexity of our business increases at an
    accelerated rate and we must make necessary adaptations to our
    business model to address these complexities. For example, as we
    have previously disclosed, we entered the traditional enterprise
    market in November 2009. In addition to requiring significant
    capital expenditures, our entry into the traditional enterprise
    market adds complexity to our business that requires us to
    effectively adapt our business and management processes to
    address the unique challenges and different requirements of the
    traditional enterprise market, while maintaining a competitive
    operating cost model. If we fail to gain market acceptance in
    the traditional enterprise storage market, we will remain at a
    competitive disadvantage to the companies that succeed in this
    market and our ability to continue our growth will be negatively
    affected.

Our
    customers’ demand for storage capacity may not continue to
    grow at current industry estimates, which may lower the prices
    our customers are willing to pay for new products or put us at a
    disadvantage to competing technologies.

Our customers’ demand for storage capacity may not continue
    to grow at current industry estimates as a result of
    developments in the regulation and enforcement of digital rights
    management, the emergence of processes such as cloud computing,
    data deduplication and storage virtualization, or otherwise.
    These factors could lead to our customers’ storage capacity
    needs being satisfied at lower prices with lower capacity hard
    drives or solid-state storage products that we do not offer,
    thereby decreasing our revenue or putting us at a disadvantage
    to competing storage technologies. As a result, even with
    increasing aggregate demand for storage capacity, our ASPs could
    decline, which could adversely affect our operating results.



Expansion
    into new hard drive markets may cause our capital expenditures
    to increase, and if we do not successfully expand into new
    markets, our business may suffer.

To remain a significant supplier of hard drives, we will need to
    offer a broad range of hard drive products to our customers. We
    currently offer a variety of 3.5-inch or 2.5-inch hard drives
    for the desktop, mobile, enterprise, CE and external storage
    markets. However, demand for hard drives may shift to products
    in form factors or with interfaces that our competitors offer
    but which we do not. Expansion into other hard drive markets and
    resulting increases in manufacturing capacity requirements may
    require us to make substantial additional investments in part
    because our operations are largely vertically integrated now
    that we manufacture heads and magnetic media for use in many of
    the hard drives we manufacture. If we fail to successfully
    expand into new hard drive markets with products that we do not
    currently offer, we may lose business to our competitors who
    offer these products.

If we
    fail to successfully manage our new product development or new
    market expansion, or if we fail to anticipate the issues
    associated with such development or expansion, our business may
    suffer.

While we continue to develop new products and look to expand
    into new markets, the success of our new product introductions
    depends on a number of factors, including our ability to
    anticipate and manage a variety of issues associated with these
    new products and new markets, such as:

•

difficulties faced in manufacturing ramp;

•

market acceptance;

•

effective management of inventory levels in line with
    anticipated product demand; and

•

quality problems or other defects in the early stages of new
    product introduction that were not anticipated in the design of
    those products.

Further, we need to identify how any of the new markets into
    which we are expanding may have different characteristics from
    the markets in which we currently exist and properly address
    these differences. These characteristics may include:

•

demand volume requirements;

•

demand seasonality;

•

product generation development rates;

•

customer concentrations;

•

warranty expectations and product return policies; and

•

cost, performance and compatibility requirements.

Our business may suffer if we fail to successfully anticipate
    and manage these issues associated with our product development
    and market expansion. For example, our branded products are
    designed to attach to and interoperate with a wide variety of PC
    and CE devices, and therefore their functionality relies on the
    manufacturer of such devices, or the associated operating
    systems, enabling the manufacturer’s devices to operate
    with our branded products. If our branded products are not
    compatible with a wide variety of devices, or if device
    manufacturers design their devices so that our branded products
    cannot operate with them, and we cannot quickly and efficiently
    adapt our branded products to address these compatibility
    issues, our business could suffer.

Expanding
    into new markets exposes our business to different seasonal
    demand cycles, which in turn could adversely affect our
    operating results.

The CE and retail markets have different seasonal pricing and
    volume demand cycles as compared to the PC market. By expanding
    into these markets, we became exposed to seasonal fluctuations
    that are different from, and in addition to, those of the PC
    market. For example, because the primary customer for our
    branded products are individual consumers, this market has
    historically experienced a dramatic increase in demand during
    the winter holiday season. If we do not



properly adjust our supply to these new demand cycles, we risk
    having excess inventory during periods of low demand and
    insufficient inventory during periods of high demand, which
    could adversely affect our operating results.

Selling
    to the retail market is an important part of our business, and
    if consumer spending decreases, or if we fail to maintain and
    grow our market share or gain market acceptance of our branded
    products, our operating results could suffer.

Selling branded products is an important part of our business,
    and as our branded products revenue increases as a portion of
    our overall revenue, our success in the retail market becomes
    increasingly important to our operating results. If consumer
    spending decreases as a result of the recent uncertainty and
    volatility in global economic conditions, our operating results
    could suffer because of the increased importance of our branded
    products business.

We sell our branded products directly to a select group of major
    retailers, such as computer superstores and CE stores, and
    authorize sales through distributors to other retailers and
    online resellers. Our current retail customer base is primarily
    in the U.S., Canada and Europe. We are facing increased
    competition from other companies for shelf space at a small
    number of major retailers that have strong buying power and
    pricing leverage. If we are unable to maintain effective working
    relationships with major retailers and online resellers, or if
    we fail to successfully expand into multiple channels, our
    competitive position in the branded product market may suffer
    and our operating results may be adversely affected.

Our success in the retail market also depends on our ability to
    maintain our brand image and corporate reputation. Adverse
    publicity, whether or not justified, or allegations of product
    quality issues, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish our
    reputation and cause our customers to choose products offered by
    our competitors. In addition, the proliferation of new methods
    of mass communication facilitated by the Internet makes it
    easier for false or unfounded allegations to adversely affect
    our brand image and reputation. If customers no longer maintain
    a preference for
    WD

brand

    products, our operating results may be adversely affected.

Additionally, we face strong competition in maintaining and
    trying to grow our market share in the retail market,
    particularly because of the relatively low barriers to entry in
    this market. For example, several additional hard drive
    manufacturers have recently disclosed plans to expand into the
    external storage market. As these companies attempt to gain
    market share, we may have difficulty in maintaining or growing
    our market share and there may be increased downward pressure on
    pricing. There can be no assurance that any new products we
    introduce into the retail market will gain market acceptance,
    and if they do not, our operating results could suffer.

Loss of
    market share with or by a key customer, or consolidation among
    our customer base, could harm our operating results.

During the year ended July 2, 2010, a large percentage of
    our revenue, 53%, came from sales to our top 10 customers. These
    customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and
    therefore can make substantial demands on us, including demands
    on product pricing and on contractual terms, which often results
    in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier. Even if we
    successfully qualify a product with a customer, the customer is
    not generally obligated to purchase any minimum volume of
    products from us and may be able to cancel an order or terminate
    its relationship with us at any time. Our ability to maintain
    strong relationships with our principal customers is essential
    to our future performance. If we lose a key customer, if any of
    our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require
    us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs, if a
    customer is acquired by one of our competitors or if a key
    customer suffers financial hardship, our operating results would
    likely be harmed.

Additionally, if there is consolidation among our customer base,
    our customers may be able to command increased leverage in
    negotiating prices and other terms of sale, which could
    adversely affect our profitability. In addition, if, as a result
    of increased leverage, customer pressures require us to reduce
    our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished, we could
    decide not to sell our products to a particular customer, which
    could result in a decrease in our revenue. Consolidation among
    our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our
    products, replacement of our products by the combined entity
    with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders, each
    of which could harm our operating results.



Current
    or future competitors may gain a technology advantage or develop
    an advantageous cost structure that we cannot match.

It may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain
    an advantage in product technology, manufacturing technology, or
    process technology, which may allow them to offer products or
    services that have a significant advantage over the products and
    services that we offer. Advantages could be in capacity,
    performance, reliability, serviceability, or other attributes.
    We may be at a competitive disadvantage to any companies that
    are able to gain these advantages.

Further
    industry consolidation could provide competitive advantages to
    our competitors.

The hard drive industry has experienced consolidation over the
    past several years. Consolidation by our competitors may enhance
    their capacity, abilities and resources and lower their cost
    structure, causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage.
    Additionally, continued industry consolidation may lead to
    uncertainty in areas such as component availability, which could
    negatively impact our cost structure.

Sales in
    the distribution channel are important to our business, and if
    we fail to maintain brand preference with our distributors or if
    distribution markets for hard drives weaken, our operating
    results could suffer.

Our distribution customers typically sell to small computer
    manufacturers, dealers, systems integrators and other resellers.
    We face significant competition in this channel as a result of
    limited product qualification programs and a significant focus
    on price and availability of product. If we fail to remain
    competitive in terms of our technology, quality, service and
    support, our distribution customers may favor our competitors,
    and our operating results could suffer. Additionally, if the
    distribution market weakens as a result of a slowing PC growth
    rate, technology transitions or a significant change in consumer
    buying preference, or if we experience significant price
    declines due to oversupply in the distribution channel, then our
    operating results would be adversely affected.

The hard
    drive industry is highly competitive and can be characterized by
    significant shifts in market share among the major
    competitors.

The price of hard drives has fallen over time due to increases
    in supply, cost reductions, technological advances and price
    reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess
    inventories or attempting to gain market share. In addition,
    rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and
    profitability of sales of existing products and increase the
    risk of inventory obsolescence. These factors, taken together,
    may result in significant shifts in market share among the
    industry’s major participants. In addition, product recalls
    can lead to a loss of market share, which could adversely affect
    our operating results.

Some of
    our competitors with diversified business units outside the hard
    drive industry may over extended periods of time sell hard
    drives at prices that we cannot profitably match.

Some of our competitors earn a significant portion of their
    revenue from business units outside the hard drive industry.
    Because they do not depend solely on sales of hard drives to
    achieve profitability, they may sell hard drives at lower prices
    and operate their hard drive business unit at a loss over an
    extended period of time while still remaining profitable
    overall. In addition, if these competitors can increase sales of
    non-hard drive products to the same customers, they may benefit
    from selling their hard drives at lower prices. Our operating
    results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully
    compete with the pricing by these companies.

If we
    fail to qualify our products with our customers or if product
    life cycles lengthen, it may have a significant adverse impact
    on our sales and margins.

We regularly engage in new product qualification with our
    customers. Once a product is accepted for qualification testing,
    failures or delays in the qualification process can result in
    delayed or reduced product sales, reduced product margins caused
    by having to continue to offer a more costly current generation
    product, or lost sales to that customer until the next
    generation of products is introduced. The effect of missing a
    product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited
    number of high volume OEMs, which continue to consolidate their
    share of the storage markets. Likewise, if product life cycles
    lengthen, we may have a significantly longer period to wait
    before we have an



opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer, which
    could reduce our profits because we expect declining gross
    margins on our current generation products as a result of
    competitive pressures.

We are
    subject to risks related to product defects, which could result
    in product recalls or epidemic failures and could subject us to
    warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which
    are greater than anticipated.

We warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to
    five years. We test our hard drives in our manufacturing
    facilities through a variety of means. However, there can be no
    assurance that our testing will reveal defects in our products,
    which may not become apparent until after the products have been
    sold into the market. Accordingly, there is a risk that product
    defects will occur, which could require a product recall.
    Product recalls can be expensive to implement and, if a product
    recall occurs during the product’s warranty period, we may
    be required to replace the defective product. Moreover, there is
    a risk that product defects may trigger an epidemic failure
    clause in a customer agreement. If an epidemic failure occurs,
    we may be required to replace or refund the value of the
    defective product and to cover certain other costs associated
    with the consequences of the epidemic failure. In addition, a
    product recall or epidemic failure may damage our reputation or
    customer relationships, and may cause us to lose market share
    with our customers, including our OEM and ODM customers.

Our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions
    of liability for consequential damages and for misuse, improper
    installation, alteration, accident or mishandling while in the
    possession of someone other than us. We record an accrual for
    estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. We
    may incur additional operating expenses if our warranty
    provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues
    related to defects in our products, whether as a result of a
    product recall, epidemic failure or otherwise. If these
    additional expenses are significant, it could adversely affect
    our business, financial condition and operating results.

A
    competitive cost structure is critical to our operating results,
    and increased costs may adversely affect our operating
    margin.

A competitive cost structure for our products, including
    critical components, labor and overhead, is critical to the
    success of our business, and our operating results depend on our
    ability to maintain competitive cost structures on new and
    established products. If our competitors are able to achieve a
    lower cost structure that we are unable to match, we could be at
    a competitive disadvantage to those competitors.

Shortages
    of commodity materials or commodity components, price
    volatility, or use by other industries of materials and
    components used in the hard drive industry, may negatively
    impact our operating results.

Increases in the cost for certain commodity materials or
    commodity components may increase our costs of manufacturing and
    transporting hard drives and key components. Shortages of
    commodity components such as DRAM and NAND flash, or commodity
    materials such as glass substrates, stainless steel, aluminum,
    nickel, neodymium, ruthenium or platinum, may increase our costs
    and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to
    find ways to mitigate these increased costs. Furthermore, if
    other high volume industries increase their demand for materials
    or components such as these, our costs may further increase,
    which could have an adverse effect on our operating margins. In
    addition, shortages in other commodity components and materials
    used in our customers’ products could result in a decrease
    in demand for our products, which would negatively impact our
    operating results. The volatility in the cost of oil also
    affects our transportation costs and may result in lower
    operating margins if we are unable to pass these increased costs
    through to our customers.

If we
    fail to maintain effective relationships with our major
    component suppliers, our supply of critical components may be at
    risk and our profitability could suffer.

While we make most of our own heads and magnetic media for some
    of our product families, we do, according to our sourcing
    strategy, purchase some percentage of our required heads and
    magnetic media from our external supply base. In addition, we
    purchase a majority of our other components, including all
    mechanical and electronic components, from our external supply
    base. For certain components, we use multiple suppliers that
    deploy different technology or processes, and we must
    successfully integrate components from these suppliers in our
    products. Accordingly, we must maintain effective relationships
    with our supply base to source our component needs, develop
    compatible technology, and maintain continuity of supply at
    reasonable costs. If we fail to maintain effective relationships
    with our supply base, or if we fail to



integrate components from our suppliers effectively, this may
    adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver the best
    products to our customers and our profitability could suffer.
    For example, in August 2003, we settled litigation with a
    supplier who previously was the sole source of read channel
    devices for our hard drives. As a result of the disputes that
    gave rise to the litigation, our profitability was at risk until
    another supplier’s read channel devices could be designed
    into our products. Similar disputes with other strategic
    component suppliers could adversely affect our operating results.

Violation
    of applicable laws, including labor or environmental laws, and
    certain other practices by our suppliers could harm our
    business.

We expect our suppliers,

sub-suppliers

and

sub-contractors

(collectively referred to as “suppliers”) to operate
    in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including
    labor and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required
    supplier standards of conduct. While our internal operating
    guidelines promote ethical business practices, we do not control
    our suppliers or their labor or environmental practices. The
    violation of labor, environmental or other laws by any of our
    suppliers, or divergence of a supplier’s business practices
    from those generally accepted as ethical in the U.S., could harm
    our business by:

•

interrupting or otherwise disrupting the shipment of our product
    components;

•

damaging our reputation;

•

forcing us to find alternate component sources;

•

reducing demand for our products (for example, through a
    consumer boycott); or

•

exposing us to potential liability for our supplier’s
    wrongdoings.

Dependence
    on a limited number of qualified suppliers of components and
    manufacturing equipment could lead to delays, lost revenue or
    increased costs.

Our future operating results may depend substantially on our
    suppliers’ ability to timely qualify their components in
    our programs, and their ability to supply us with these
    components in sufficient volumes to meet our production
    requirements. A number of the components that we use are
    available from only a single or limited number of qualified
    suppliers, and may be used across multiple product lines. In
    addition, some of the components (or component types) used in
    our products are used in other devices, such as mobile
    telephones and digital cameras. If there is a significant
    simultaneous upswing in demand for such a component (or
    component type) from several high volume industries resulting in
    a supply reduction, if a component is otherwise in short supply,
    or if a supplier fails to qualify or has a quality issue with a
    component, we may experience delays or increased costs in
    obtaining that component. If we are unable to obtain sufficient
    quantities of materials used in the manufacture of magnetic
    components, or other necessary components, we may experience
    production delays which could cause us loss of revenue. If a
    component becomes unavailable, we could suffer significant loss
    of revenue.

In addition, certain equipment and consumables we use in our
    manufacturing or testing processes are available only from a
    limited number of suppliers. Some of this equipment and
    consumables use materials that at times could be in short
    supply. If these materials are not available, or are not
    available in the quantities we require for our manufacturing and
    testing processes, our ability to manufacture our products could
    be impacted, and we could suffer significant loss of revenue.

Each of the following could also significantly harm our
    operating results:

•

an unwillingness of a supplier to supply such components or
    equipment to us;

•

consolidation of key suppliers;

•

failure of a key supplier’s business process;

•

a key supplier’s or

sub-supplier’s

inability to access credit necessary to operate its
    business; or

•

failure of a key supplier to remain in business, to remain an
    independent merchant supplier, or to adjust to market conditions.



Contractual
    commitments with component suppliers may result in us paying
    increased charges and cash advances for such components or may
    cause us to have inadequate or excess component
    inventory.

To reduce the risk of component shortages, we attempt to provide
    significant lead times when buying components, which may subject
    us to cancellation charges if we cancel orders as a result of
    technology transitions or changes in our component needs. In
    addition, we may from time to time enter into contractual
    commitments with component suppliers in an effort to increase
    and stabilize the supply of those components and enable us to
    purchase such components at favorable prices. Some of these
    commitments may require us to buy a substantial number of
    components from the supplier or make significant cash advances
    to the supplier; however, these commitments may not result in a
    satisfactory increase or stabilization of the supply of such
    components. Furthermore, as a result of the current global
    economic conditions, our ability to forecast our requirements
    for these components has become increasingly difficult,
    therefore increasing the risk that our contractual commitments
    may not meet our actual supply requirements, which could cause
    us to have inadequate or excess component inventory and
    adversely affect our operating results and increase our
    operating costs.

Failure
    by certain suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and
    manufacture components, technology or production equipment for
    our products may adversely affect our operations.

We rely on suppliers for various component parts that we
    integrate into our hard drives but do not manufacture ourselves,
    such as semiconductors, motors, flex circuits and suspensions.
    Likewise, we rely on suppliers for certain technology and
    equipment necessary for advanced development technology for
    future products. Some of these components, and most of this
    technology and production equipment, must be specifically
    designed to be compatible for use in our products or for
    developing and manufacturing our future products, and are only
    available from a limited number of suppliers, some of with whom
    we are sole sourced. We are therefore dependent on these
    suppliers to be able and willing to dedicate adequate
    engineering resources to develop components that can be
    successfully integrated with our products, and technology and
    production equipment that can be used to develop and manufacture
    our next-generation products efficiently. The failure of these
    suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture
    components that can be integrated into our products or
    technology and production equipment that can be used to develop
    or manufacture next generation products may cause us to
    experience inability or delay in our manufacturing and shipment
    of hard drive products, our expansion into new technology and
    markets, or our ability to remain competitive with alternative
    storage technologies, therefore adversely affecting our business
    and financial results.

There are
    certain additional capital expenditure costs and asset
    utilization risks to our business associated with our strategy
    to vertically integrate our operations.

Our vertical integration of head and magnetic media
    manufacturing resulted in a fundamental change in our operating
    structure, as we now manufacture heads and magnetic media for
    use in many of the hard drives we manufacture. Consequently, we
    make more capital investments and carry a higher percentage of
    fixed costs than we would if we were not vertically integrated.
    If the overall level of production decreases for any reason, and
    we are unable to reduce our fixed costs to match sales, our head
    or magnetic media manufacturing assets may face
    under-utilization that may impact our operating results. We are
    therefore subject to additional risks related to overall asset
    utilization, including the need to operate at high levels of
    utilization to drive competitive costs and the need for assured
    supply of components that we do not manufacture ourselves.

In addition, we may incur additional risks, including:

•

failure to continue to leverage the integration of our magnetic
    media technology with our head technology;

•

insufficient third party sources to satisfy our needs if we are
    unable to manufacture a sufficient supply of heads or magnetic
    media;

•

third party head or magnetic media suppliers may not continue to
    do business with us or may not do business with us on the same
    terms and conditions we have previously enjoyed;

•

claims that our manufacturing of heads or magnetic media may
    infringe certain intellectual property rights of other
    companies; and



•

difficulties locating in a timely manner suitable manufacturing
    equipment for our head or magnetic media manufacturing processes
    and replacement parts for such equipment.

If we do not adequately address the challenges related to our
    head or magnetic media manufacturing operations, our ongoing
    operations could be disrupted, resulting in a decrease in our
    revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating
    results.

If we are
    unable to timely and cost-effectively develop heads and magnetic
    media with leading technology and overall quality, our ability
    to sell our products may be significantly diminished, which
    could materially and adversely affect our business and financial
    results.

Under our business plan, we are developing and manufacturing a
    substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media used in the
    hard drive products we manufacture. Consequently, we are more
    dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and
    less able to take advantage of head and magnetic media
    technologies developed by other manufacturers. Technology
    transition for head and magnetic media designs is critical to
    increasing our volume production of heads and magnetic media.
    There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful
    in timely and cost-effectively developing and manufacturing
    heads or magnetic media for products using future technologies.
    We also may not effectively transition our head or magnetic
    media design and technology to achieve acceptable manufacturing
    yields using the technologies necessary to satisfy our
    customers’ product needs, or we may encounter quality
    problems with the heads or magnetic media we manufacture. In
    addition, we may not have access to external sources of supply
    without incurring substantial costs which would negatively
    impact our business and financial results.

Changes
    in product life cycles could adversely affect our financial
    results.

If product life cycles lengthen, we may need to develop new
    technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any particular
    product to maintain competitive pricing for that product. If
    product life cycles shorten, it may result in an increase in our
    overall expenses and a decrease in our gross margins, both of
    which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition,
    shortening of product life cycles also makes it more difficult
    to recover the cost of product development before the product
    becomes obsolete. Our failure to recover the cost of product
    development in the future could adversely affect our operating
    results.

If we
    fail to make the technical innovations necessary to continue to
    increase areal density, we may fail to remain
    competitive.

New products in the hard drive market typically require higher
    areal densities than previous product generations, posing
    formidable technical and manufacturing challenges. Higher areal
    densities require existing head and magnetic media technology to
    be improved or new technologies developed to accommodate more
    data on a single disk. In addition, our introduction of new
    products during a technology transition increases the likelihood
    of unexpected quality concerns. Our failure to bring high
    quality new products to market on time and at acceptable costs
    may put us at a competitive disadvantage to companies that
    achieve these results.

We make
    significant investments in research and development, and
    unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our
    business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Over the past several years, our business strategy has been to
    derive a competitive advantage by moving from being a follower
    of new technologies to being a leader in the innovation and
    development of new technologies. This strategy requires us to
    make significant investments in research and development. There
    can be no assurance that these investments will result in viable
    technologies or products, or if these investments do result in
    viable technologies or products, that they will be profitable or
    accepted by the market. Significant investments in unsuccessful
    research and development efforts could materially adversely
    affect our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

A
    fundamental change in recording technology could result in
    significant increases in our operating expenses and could put us
    at a competitive disadvantage.

Historically, when the industry experiences a fundamental change
    in technology, any manufacturer that fails to successfully and
    timely adjust its designs and processes to accommodate the new
    technology fails to remain competitive. There are some
    technologies, such as current-perpendicular-to-plane giant
    magnetoresistance, shingle magnetic



recording, energy assisted magnetic recording, patterned
    magnetic media, advanced signal processing, advanced format
    technology and other similar potentially breakthrough
    technologies, that will represent revolutionary recording
    technologies if they can be implemented by a competitor on a
    commercially viable basis ahead of the industry, which could put
    us at a competitive disadvantage. As a result of these
    technology shifts, we could incur substantial costs in
    developing new technologies, such as heads, magnetic media, and
    tools to remain competitive. If we fail to successfully
    implement these new technologies, or if we are significantly
    slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies, we
    may not be able to offer products with capacities that our
    customers desire. For example, new recording technology requires
    changes in the manufacturing process of heads and magnetic
    media, which may cause longer production times and reduce the
    overall availability of magnetic media in the industry.
    Additionally, the new technology requires a greater degree of
    integration between heads and magnetic media which may lengthen
    our time of development of hard drives using this technology.

Furthermore, as we attempt to develop and implement new
    technologies, we may become more dependent on suppliers to
    ensure our access to components, technology and production
    equipment that accommodate the new technology. For example,
    advanced wafer and magnetic media manufacturing technologies
    have historically been developed for use in the semiconductor
    industry prior to the hard drive industry. However, successful
    implementation of the use of patterned magnetic media with hard
    drive magnetic media currently presents a significant technical
    challenge facing the hard drive industry but not the
    semiconductor industry. Therefore, our suppliers may not be
    willing to dedicate adequate engineering resources to develop
    manufacturing equipment for patterned magnetic media prior to a
    need for the equipment in the semiconductor industry. We believe
    that if new technologies, such as energy assisted magnetic
    recording, are not successfully implemented in the hard drive
    industry, then alternative storage technologies like solid-state
    storage may more rapidly overtake hard drives as the preferred
    storage solution for higher capacity storage needs. This result
    would put us at a competitive disadvantage and negatively impact
    our operating results.

The
    difficulty of introducing hard drives with higher levels of
    areal density and the challenges of reducing other costs may
    impact our ability to achieve historical levels of cost
    reduction.

Storage capacity of the hard drive, as manufactured by us, is
    determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal
    density. Areal density is a measure of the amount of magnetic
    bits that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk.
    Generally, the higher the areal density, the more information
    can be stored on a single platter. Historically, we have been
    able to achieve a large percentage of cost reduction through
    increases in areal density. Increases in areal density mean that
    the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same
    capacity and, therefore, may result in a lower component cost.
    However, because increasing areal density has become more
    difficult in the hard drive industry, such increases may require
    increases in component costs, and other opportunities to reduce
    costs may not continue at historical rates. Additionally,
    increases in areal density may require us to make further
    capital expenditures on items such as new testing equipment
    needed as a result of an increased number of GB per platter. Our
    inability to achieve cost reductions could adversely affect our
    operating results.

If we do
    not properly manage the technology transitions of our products,
    our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively
    affected.

The storage markets in which we offer our products continuously
    undergo technology transitions which we must anticipate and
    adapt our products to address in a timely manner. For example,
    serial interfaces normally go through cycles in which their
    maximum speeds double. We must effectively manage the transition
    of the features of our products to address these faster
    interface speeds in a timely manner in order to remain
    competitive and cost effective. If we fail to successfully and
    timely manage the transition to faster interface speeds, we may
    be at a competitive disadvantage to other companies that have
    successfully adapted their products in a timely manner and our
    operating results may suffer.

If we
    fail to develop and introduce new hard drives that are
    competitive against alternative storage technologies, our
    business may suffer.

Our success depends in part on our ability to develop and
    introduce new products in a timely manner in order to keep pace
    with competing technologies. Alternative storage technologies
    like solid-state storage and flash memory technology have
    successfully served digital entertainment markets for products
    such as digital cameras, MP3 players, USB flash drives and
    mobile phones that require a relatively low amount of storage
    capacity that cannot be economically



serviced using hard drive technology. Typically, storage needs
    for higher capacity and performance, with lower

cost-per-gigabyte,

have been better served by hard drives. However, advances in
    semiconductor technology have resulted in solid-state storage
    emerging as a technology that is competitive with hard drives
    for niche high performance needs in advanced digital computing
    markets such as enterprise servers and storage, in spite of the
    associated challenges in the attributes of cost, capacity and
    reliability. Solid-state storage, which incorporates
    semiconductor media, is produced by large semiconductor
    companies who can then sell their storage products at lower
    prices while still remaining profitable overall. This can help
    them improve their market share at the expense of the
    competition. In addition, these semiconductor companies may
    choose to supply companies like us with semiconductor media at
    prices that make it difficult, if not impossible, for us to
    compete with them on a profitable basis. As a result, there can
    be no assurance that we will be successful in anticipating and
    developing new products for the desktop, mobile, enterprise, CE
    and external storage markets in response to solid-state storage,
    as well as other competing technologies. If our hard drive
    technology fails to offer higher capacity, performance and
    reliability with lower

cost-per-gigabyte

than solid-state storage for the desktop, mobile, enterprise, CE
    and external storage markets, we will be at a competitive
    disadvantage to companies using semiconductor technology to
    serve these markets and our business will suffer.

Spending
    to improve our technology and develop new technology to remain
    competitive may negatively impact our financial
    results.

In attempting to remain competitive, we may need to increase our
    capital expenditures and expenses above our historical run-rate
    model in order to attempt to improve our existing technology and
    develop new technology. Increased investments in technology
    could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with
    demand for our products which would have a negative impact on
    our financial results.

Our
    manufacturing operations are concentrated in a small number of
    large, purpose-built facilities, which subjects us to
    substantial risk of damage or loss if operations at any of these
    facilities are disrupted.

As a result of our cost structure and strategy of vertical
    integration, we conduct our manufacturing operations at large,
    high volume, purpose-built facilities. For example,
    approximately 80% of our requirement for heads is satisfied by
    wafers fabricated in our Fremont, California facility. Also, we
    manufacture the majority of our substrates for magnetic media in
    our Johor, Malaysia facility, and we finish a majority of our
    magnetic media in our facilities in Penang, Malaysia and Tuas,
    Singapore. A majority of our high volume hard drive
    manufacturing operations are conducted in two facilities in
    Thailand, with the balance conducted in our Kuala Lumpur,
    Malaysia facility. The manufacturing facilities of many of our
    suppliers are also in Asia near our facilities. A fire, flood,
    earthquake, tsunami or other disaster, condition or event such
    as political instability, civil unrest or a power outage that
    adversely affects any of these facilities would significantly
    affect our ability to manufacture hard drives, which would
    result in a substantial loss of sales and revenue and a
    substantial harm to our operating results. Similarly, a
    localized health risk affecting our employees at these
    facilities or the staff of our suppliers, such as the spread of
    the Influenza A (H1N1) or a new pandemic influenza, could impair
    the total volume of hard drives that we are able to manufacture,
    which would result in substantial harm to our operating results.

Our
    operating results will be adversely affected if we fail to
    optimize the overall quality,

time-to-market

and

time-to-volume

of new and established products.

To achieve consistent success with our customers, we must
    balance several key attributes such as

time-to-market,

time-to-volume,

quality, cost, service, price and a broad product portfolio. Our
    operating results will be adversely affected if we fail to:

•

maintain overall quality of products in new and established
    programs;

•

produce sufficient quantities of products at the capacities our
    customers demand while managing the integration of new and
    established technologies;

•

develop and qualify new products that have changes in overall
    specifications or features that our customers may require for
    their business needs;

•

obtain commitments from our customers to qualify new products,
    redesigns of current products, or new components in our existing
    products;



•

obtain customer qualification of these products on a timely
    basis by meeting all of our customers’ needs for
    performance, quality and features;

•

maintain an adequate supply of components required to
    manufacture our products; or

•

maintain the manufacturing capability to quickly change our
    product mix between different capacities, form factors and spin
    speeds in response to changes in customers’ product demands.

Manufacturing
    outside the U.S. and marketing our products globally subjects us
    to numerous risks.

We are subject to risks associated with our global manufacturing
    operations and global marketing efforts, including:

•

obtaining requisite U.S. and foreign governmental permits
    and approvals;

•

currency exchange rate fluctuations or restrictions;

•

political instability and civil unrest;

•

limited transportation availability, delays, and extended time
    required for shipping, which risks may be compounded in periods
    of price declines;

•

higher freight rates;

•

labor problems;

•

trade restrictions or higher tariffs;

•

copyright levies or similar fees or taxes imposed in European
    and other countries;

•

exchange, currency and tax controls and reallocations;

•

increasing labor and overhead costs; and

•

loss or non-renewal of favorable tax treatment under agreements
    or treaties with foreign tax authorities.

Terrorist
    attacks may adversely affect our business and operating
    results.

The continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war
    or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial and
    insurance markets and have significantly increased the
    political, economic and social instability in some of the
    geographic areas in which we operate. Additionally, it is
    uncertain what impact the reactions to such acts by various
    governmental agencies and security regulators worldwide will
    have on shipping costs. Acts of terrorism, either domestically
    or abroad, could create further uncertainties and instability.
    To the extent this results in disruption or delays of our
    manufacturing capabilities or shipments of our products, our
    business, operating results and financial condition could be
    adversely affected.

Sudden
    disruptions to the availability of freight lanes could have an
    impact on our operations.

We generally ship our products to our customers, and receive
    shipments from our suppliers, via air or ocean freight. The
    sudden unavailability or disruption of cargo operations or
    freight lanes, such as due to labor difficulties or disputes,
    severe weather patterns or other natural disasters, or political
    instability or civil unrest, could impact our operating results
    by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our
    products.

We are
    vulnerable to system failures or attacks, which could harm our
    business.

We are heavily dependent on our technology infrastructure, among
    other functions, to operate our factories, sell our products,
    fulfill orders, manage inventory and bill, collect and make
    payments. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption
    from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures,
    computer viruses, computer

denial-of-service

attacks and other events. Our business is also subject to
    break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by third
    parties as well as employees. Despite any precautions we may
    take, such problems could result in, among other consequences,
    interruptions in our business, which could harm our reputation
    and financial condition.



If we
    fail to identify, manage, complete and integrate acquisitions,
    investment opportunities or other significant transactions, it
    may adversely affect our future results.

As part of our growth strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of,
    investment opportunities in or other significant transactions
    with companies that are complementary to our business. In order
    to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify
    attractive acquisition or investment opportunities, successfully
    complete the transaction, some of which may be large and
    complex, and manage post-closing issues such as integration of
    the acquired company or employees. We may not be able to
    identify or complete appealing acquisition or investment
    opportunities given the intense competition for these
    transactions. Even if we identify and complete suitable
    corporate transactions, we may not be able to successfully
    address any integration challenges in a timely manner, or at
    all. If we fail to successfully integrate an acquisition, we may
    not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of the
    acquisition, and our future results of operations could be
    adversely affected.

If we are
    unable to retain or hire key staff and skilled employees our
    business results may suffer.

Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key
    staff and skilled employees, many of whom would be extremely
    difficult to replace. Global competition for skilled employees
    in the data storage industry is intense and, as we attempt to
    move to a position of technology leadership in the storage
    industry, our business success becomes increasingly dependent on
    our ability to retain our key staff and skilled employees as
    well as attract, integrate and retain new skilled employees.
    Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price
    and the overall markets may adversely affect our ability to
    retain key staff or skilled employees who have received equity
    compensation. Additionally, because a substantial portion of our
    key employees’ compensation is placed “at risk”
    and linked to the performance of our business, when our
    operating results are negatively impacted by global economic
    conditions, we are at a competitive disadvantage for retaining
    and hiring key staff and skilled employees versus other
    companies that pay a relatively higher fixed salary. If we are
    unable to retain our existing key staff or skilled employees, or
    hire and integrate new key staff or skilled employees, or if we
    fail to implement succession plans for our key staff, our
    operating results would likely be harmed.

The
    nature of our business and our reliance on intellectual property
    and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk of
    significant litigation.

The data storage industry has been characterized by significant
    litigation. This includes litigation relating to patent and
    other intellectual property rights, product liability claims and
    other types of litigation. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy
    and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the
    results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in
    adverse rulings or decisions. We may enter into settlements or
    be subject to judgments that may, individually or in the
    aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition or operating results.

We evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices
    of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to
    time. If claims or actions are asserted against us, we may be
    required to obtain a license or cross-license, modify our
    existing technology or design a new non-infringing technology.
    Such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly.
    In addition, we may decide to settle a claim or action against
    us, which settlement could be costly. We may also be liable for
    any past infringement. If there is an adverse ruling against us
    in an infringement lawsuit, an injunction could be issued
    barring production or sale of any infringing product. It could
    also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or
    lost profits or, if there is a finding of willful infringement,
    treble damages. Any of these results would increase our costs
    and harm our operating results.

Our
    reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary
    information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients
    of our business could be copied by competitors.

Our success depends, in significant part, on the proprietary
    nature of our technology, including non-patentable intellectual
    property such as our process technology. If a competitor is able
    to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology despite
    the safeguards we have in place, it may be difficult, expensive
    or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection. Also,
    the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our
    intellectual property to the same extent as do U.S. laws.
    In addition to patent protection of intellectual property
    rights, we consider elements of our product designs and
    processes to be proprietary and confidential. We rely upon
    employee, consultant and vendor non-disclosure agreements and
    contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to
    protect our proprietary information.



However, any of our registered or unregistered intellectual
    property rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the
    industry, which might harm our operating results.

The costs
    of compliance with state, federal and international legal and
    regulatory requirements, such as environmental, labor, trade and
    tax regulations, and customers’ standards of corporate
    citizenship could cause an increase in our operating
    costs.

We may be or become subject to various state, federal and
    international laws and regulations governing our environmental,
    labor, trade and tax practices. These laws and regulations,
    particularly those applicable to our international operations,
    are or may be complex, extensive and subject to change. We will
    need to ensure that we and our component suppliers timely comply
    with such laws and regulations, which may result in an increase
    in our operating costs. For example, the European Union
    (“EU”) has enacted the Restriction of the Use of
    Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic
    Equipment (“RoHS”) directive, which prohibits the use
    of certain substances in electronic equipment, and the Waste
    Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”)
    directive, which obligates parties that place electrical and
    electronic equipment onto the market in the EU to put a clearly
    identifiable mark on the equipment, register with and report to
    EU member countries regarding distribution of the equipment, and
    provide a mechanism to take back and properly dispose of the
    equipment. Similar legislation may be enacted in other locations
    where we manufacture or sell our products. In addition, climate
    change legislation in the U.S. is a significant topic of
    discussion and may generate federal or other regulatory
    responses in the near future. If we or our component suppliers
    fail to timely comply with applicable legislation, our customers
    may refuse to purchase our products or we may face increased
    operating costs as a result of taxes, fines or penalties, which
    would have a materially adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and operating results.

In connection with our compliance with such environmental laws
    and regulations, as well as our compliance with industry
    environmental initiatives, the standards of business conduct
    required by some of our customers, and our commitment to sound
    corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business, we could
    incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject
    to disruptions to our operations and logistics. In addition, if
    we were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliant
    with these initiatives or standards of conduct, we could be
    subject to governmental fines, liability to our customers and
    damage to our reputation and corporate brand which could cause
    our financial condition or operating results to suffer.

Fluctuations
    in currency exchange rates as a result of our international
    operations may negatively affect our operating
    results.

Because we manufacture and sell our products abroad, our
    revenue, margins, operating costs and cash flows are impacted by
    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. If the
    U.S. dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most
    foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar equivalents of unhedged
    manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion
    of our production costs are foreign-currency denominated.
    Conversely, there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues
    since revenues are substantially U.S. dollar denominated.
    Additionally, we negotiate and procure some of our component
    requirements in U.S. dollars from Japanese and other

non-U.S. based

vendors. If the U.S. dollar continues to weaken against
    other foreign currencies, some of our component suppliers may
    increase the price they charge for their components in order to
    maintain an equivalent profit margin. If this occurs, it would
    have a negative impact on our operating results.

Prices for our products are substantially U.S. dollar
    denominated, even when sold to customers that are located
    outside the U.S. Therefore, as a substantial portion of our
    sales are from countries outside the U.S., fluctuations in
    currency exchanges rates, most notably the strengthening of the
    U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, contribute to
    variations in sales of products in impacted jurisdictions and
    could adversely impact demand and revenue growth. In addition,
    currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our
    products in countries outside the U.S.

We have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency
    exchange rate changes by, among other things, entering into
    short-term, foreign exchange contracts. However, these contracts
    do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the
    counterparty if currency controls are put in place. Currently,
    we hedge the Thai Baht, Malaysian Ringgit, Euro and British
    Pound Sterling with foreign exchange contracts.



Increases
    in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses
    and an increase in our operating costs.

Some of our OEM customers have adopted a subcontractor model
    that requires us to contract directly with companies, such as
    ODMs, that provide manufacturing services to our OEM customers.
    Because these subcontractors are generally not as well
    capitalized as our direct OEM customers, this subcontractor
    model exposes us to increased credit risks. Our agreements with
    our OEM customers may not permit us to increase our product
    prices to alleviate this increased credit risk. Additionally, as
    we attempt to expand our OEM and distribution channel sales into
    emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India and China, the
    customers with the most success in these regions may have
    relatively short operating histories, making it more difficult
    for us to accurately assess the associated credit risks. Any
    credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased
    risks, or as a result of credit losses from any significant
    customer, would increase our operating costs, which may
    negatively impact our operating results.

Inaccurate
    projections of demand for our product can cause large
    fluctuations in our quarterly results.

We often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in
    the third month of the quarter, which makes it difficult for us
    to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter.
    In addition, our quarterly projections and results may be
    subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of
    other factors including:

•

the timing of orders from and shipment of products to major
    customers;

•

our product mix;

•

changes in the prices of our products;

•

manufacturing delays or interruptions;

•

acceptance by customers of competing products in lieu of our
    products;

•

variations in the cost of and lead times for components for our
    products;

•

limited availability of components that we obtain from a single
    or a limited number of suppliers;

•

competition and consolidation in the data storage industry;

•

seasonal and other fluctuations in demand for PCs often due to
    technological advances; and

•

availability and rates of transportation.

Rapidly
    changing conditions in the hard drive industry make it difficult
    to predict actual results.

We have made and continue to make a number of estimates and
    assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting.
    The highly technical nature of our products and the rapidly
    changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual
    results may differ significantly from our estimates and
    assumptions. These changes have impacted our financial results
    in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Key
    estimates and assumptions for us include:

•

price protection adjustments and other sales promotions and
    allowances on products sold to retailers, resellers and
    distributors;

•

inventory adjustments for write-down of inventories to lower of
    cost or market value (net realizable value);

•

reserves for doubtful accounts;

•

accruals for product returns;

•

accruals for warranty costs related to product defects;

•

accruals for litigation and other contingencies;

•

liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits; and

•

expensing of stock-based compensation.



The
    market price of our common stock is volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue
    to be, extremely volatile. Factors such as the following may
    significantly affect the market price of our common stock:

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;

•

announcements of technological innovations by us or our
    competitors which may decrease the volume and profitability of
    sales of our existing products and increase the risk of
    inventory obsolescence;

•

new products introduced by us or our competitors;

•

periods of severe pricing pressures due to oversupply or price
    erosion resulting from competitive pressures or industry
    consolidation;

•

developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights;

•

conditions and trends in the hard drive, computer, data and
    content management, storage and communication industries;

•

contraction in our operating results or growth rates that are
    lower than our previous high growth-rate periods;

•

changes in financial estimates by securities analysts relating
    specifically to us or the hard drive industry in
    general; and

•

macroeconomic conditions that affect the market generally.

In addition, general economic conditions may cause the stock
    market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from
    time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many
    high technology companies. These fluctuations often appear to be
    unrelated to the operating performance of the companies.

Securities class action lawsuits are often brought against
    companies after periods of volatility in the market price of
    their securities. A number of such suits have been filed against
    us in the past, and should any new lawsuits be filed, such
    matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of
    resources and management’s attention.

Current
    economic conditions have caused us difficulty in adequately
    protecting our increased cash and cash equivalents from
    financial institution failures.

The uncertain global economic conditions and volatile investment
    markets have caused us to hold more cash and cash equivalents
    than we would hold under normal circumstances. Since there has
    been an overall increase in demand for low-risk,
    U.S. government backed securities with a limited supply in
    the financial marketplace, we face increased difficulty in
    adequately protecting our increased cash and cash equivalents
    from possible sudden and unforeseeable failures by banks and
    other financial institutions. A failure of any of these
    financial institutions in which deposits exceed FDIC limits
    could have an adverse impact on our financial position.

If our
    internal controls are found to be ineffective, our financial
    results or our stock price may be adversely affected.

Our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of
    July 2, 2010, in compliance with Section 404 of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective. We believe that we currently have
    adequate internal control procedures in place for future
    periods; however, if our internal control over financial
    reporting is found to be ineffective or if we identify a
    material weakness or significant deficiency in our financial
    reporting, investors may lose confidence in the reliability of
    our financial statements, which may adversely affect our
    financial results or our stock price.

From time
    to time we may become subject to income tax audits or similar
    proceedings, and as a result we may incur additional costs and
    expenses or owe additional taxes, interest and penalties that
    may negatively impact our operating results.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and certain
    foreign jurisdictions, and our determination of our tax
    liability is subject to review by applicable domestic and
    foreign tax authorities. For example, as we have previously
    disclosed, we are under examination of certain of our fiscal
    years by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the
    “IRS”).



Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, the
    outcomes and timing of these audits are subject to significant
    uncertainty and could result in our having to pay amounts to the
    applicable tax authority in order to resolve examination of our
    tax positions, which could result in an increase or decrease of
    our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits and may
    negatively impact our financial position, results of operations,
    net income or cash flows.

Properties

Our corporate headquarters are located in Lake Forest,
    California. The Lake Forest facilities consist of approximately
    270,000 square feet of leased space and house our
    management, research and development, administrative and sales
    staff. We lease one facility in Irvine, California, consisting
    of approximately 60,000 square feet, which we use to house
    research and development, administrative and customer support
    staff. In addition, we lease one facility in Aliso Viejo,
    California, consisting of approximately 34,000 square feet,
    which we assumed in connection with our acquisition of
    SiliconSystems, Inc. and which we use to house research and
    development, administrative and sales staff. We have entered
    into a new lease agreement whereby we will relocate our Lake
    Forest corporate headquarters and consolidate our existing
    Irvine and Aliso Viejo, California functions to approximately
    365,000 square feet of leased space in Irvine, California.
    The relocation and consolidation of our corporate headquarters
    is expected to occur in various phases beginning in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2011 and continuing through the second quarter
    of fiscal 2012.

In Fremont, California, we own facilities consisting of
    approximately 286,000 square feet, which we use for head
    wafer fabrication, research and development and warehousing. In
    San Jose, California, we lease facilities consisting of
    approximately 401,000 square feet, which we use for
    research and development. In Phoenix, Arizona, we own wafer
    fabrication facilities consisting of approximately
    545,000 square feet, which we presently lease to a third
    party but plan to occupy in late fiscal 2011. In Longmont,
    Colorado, we lease one facility consisting of approximately
    43,000 square feet, which we use for research and
    development. We also lease office space in various other
    locations throughout the world primarily for research and
    development and sales and technical support.

We own manufacturing facilities in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,
    consisting of approximately 1,054,000 square feet (which
    includes a facility of approximately 479,000 square feet
    acquired during fiscal 2010), which we use for assembly of hard
    drives, printed circuit boards and HSAs. We also own
    manufacturing facilities in Penang and Johor, Malaysia,
    consisting of approximately 800,000 and 243,000 square
    feet, respectively, and we own and lease manufacturing
    facilities in Tuas, Singapore, consisting of approximately
    311,000 square feet, all of which we use for our magnetic
    media operations. We also own manufacturing facilities in
    Navanakorn, Thailand, consisting of approximately
    226,000 square feet, which we use for assembly of hard
    drives and HSAs, and facilities in Bang Pa-In, Thailand,
    consisting of approximately 901,000 square feet, which we
    use for slider fabrication, the assembly of hard drives, HGAs
    and HSAs, and research and development.

We believe our present facilities are adequate for our current
    needs, although the process of upgrading our facilities to meet
    technological and market requirements is expected to continue.
    New manufacturing facilities, in general, can be developed and
    become operational within approximately nine to eighteen months
    should we require such additional facilities.

Our
    Company

We design, develop, manufacture and sell hard drives. A hard
    drive is a device that uses one or more rotating magnetic disks
    (“magnetic media”) to store and allow fast access to
    data. Hard drives are key components of computers, including
    desktop and notebook computers (“PCs”), data storage
    subsystems and many consumer electronic (“CE”) devices.

We sell our products worldwide to original equipment
    manufacturers (“OEMs”) and original design
    manufacturers (“ODMs”) for use in computer systems,
    subsystems or CE devices, and to distributors, resellers and
    retailers. Our hard drives are used in desktop computers,
    notebook computers, and enterprise applications such as servers,
    workstations, network attached storage, storage area networks
    and video surveillance equipment. Additionally, our hard drives
    are used in CE applications such as digital video recorders
    (“DVRs”) and satellite and cable set-top boxes
    (“STBs”). We also sell our hard drives as stand-alone
    storage products by integrating them into finished enclosures,
    embedding application software and offering the products as
    WD

®

-branded

    external storage appliances for personal data backup and
    portable or expanded storage of digital music, photographs,
    video and other digital data.



Hard drives provide non-volatile data storage, which means that
    the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the
    device. Our hard drives currently include 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch
    form factor drives, having capacities ranging from 80 gigabytes
    (“GB”) to 2 terabytes (“TB”), nominal
    rotation speeds up to 10,000 revolutions per minute
    (“RPM”), and offer interfaces including Enhanced
    Integrated Drive Electronics (“EIDE”), Serial Advanced
    Technology Attachment (“SATA”) and Serial Attached
    SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) (“SAS”). We
    also embed our hard drives into
    WD

®

-branded

    external storage appliances using interfaces such as Universal
    Serial Bus (“USB”) 2.0, USB 3.0, external SATA,
    FireWire

tm

and Ethernet network connections with capacities of 160 GB up to
    8 TB. In addition, we offer a family of hard drives specifically
    designed to consume substantially less power than standard
    drives, utilizing our WD GreenPower
    Technology

tm

.

We also design, develop, manufacture and sell solid-state drives
    and media players. A solid-state drive is a storage device that
    uses semiconductor, non-volatile media, rather than magnetic
    media and magnetic heads, to store and allow fast access to
    data. We sell our solid-state drives worldwide to OEMs and
    distributors for use in the embedded systems and client PC
    markets. A media player is a device that connects to a
    user’s television, the Internet or home theater system and
    plays digital movies, music and photos from any of our
    WD

®

-branded

    external hard drives, other USB mass storage devices or content
    services accessed over the Internet. We sell our media players
    worldwide to resellers and retailers under the
    WD

®

brand.

In November 2009, we entered the traditional enterprise market
    with the WD S25, 2.5-inch, SAS interface hard drives. The WD S25
    drive provides up to 300 GB of storage suitable for both
    mission-critical enterprise server and enterprise storage
    applications, as well as data centers and large data arrays.

Results
    of Operations

Fiscal
    2010 Overview

In 2010, our net revenue increased by 32% to $9.8 billion
    on hard drive shipments of 194 million units as compared to
    $7.5 billion and 146 million units, respectively, in
    2009. In 2010, 64% of our hard drive net revenue was derived
    from non-desktop markets, including notebook computers, CE
    products, enterprise applications, and WD-branded product sales,
    as compared to 62% in 2009. Hard drive average selling price
    (“ASP”) decreased to $50 in 2010 from $51 in 2009.
    Gross margin percentage increased to 24.4% in 2010 from 17.9% in
    2009. Operating income increased by $1.0 billion to
    $1.5 billion in 2010. Operating income was
    $519 million in 2009, which included a $14 million
    in-process research and development charge related to the
    acquisition of SiliconSystems, Inc.
    (“SiliconSystems”), $112 million of restructuring
    charges and an $18 million gain on the sale of assets from
    our substrate manufacturing facility in Sarawak, Malaysia. As a
    percentage of net revenue, operating income was 15.5% in 2010
    compared to 7.0% in 2009. Net income in 2010 was
    $1.4 billion, or $5.93 per diluted share, compared to
    $470 million, or $2.08 per diluted share, in 2009.

On June 30, 2010, we acquired the facilities, equipment,
    intellectual property and working capital of the magnetic media
    sputtering operations of Hoya Corporation and Hoya Magnetics
    Singapore Pte. Ltd. (“Hoya”). The acquisition is
    intended to augment our existing magnetic media operations,
    strengthening our ability to meet anticipated growth in demand
    for hard drives. The cost of the acquisition was approximately
    $233 million and was funded with available cash.

For the September quarter, we expect our revenue to be
    relatively flat with the June quarter as a result of lower than
    historical demand growth rates and competitive pricing
    conditions.

Fiscal
    Year 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year 2009

Net Revenue.

Net revenue was $9.8 billion
    for 2010, an increase of 32% from 2009. Total hard drive
    shipments increased to 194 million units as compared to
    146 million units for the prior year. The increase in net
    revenue resulted primarily from an increase in unit shipments
    due to the strong demand for hard drives, particularly in the
    mobile PC market. We shipped 80 million mobile drives in
    2010 as compared to 55 million units in 2009. The increase
    in mobile



unit shipments was driven by continued strength in notebook and
    netbook PC demand, coupled with increased customer preference
    for our product offerings.

Changes in revenue by geography generally reflect normal
    fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics, as well
    as demand strength in Asia, which continues to be driven by the
    concentration of global manufacturing in that region. Changes in
    revenue by channel are a result of normal fluctuations in market
    demand and competitive dynamics.

In accordance with standard industry practice, we have sales
    incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with
    price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are
    recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. For 2010, these
    programs represented 8% of gross revenues compared to 11% in
    2009. These amounts generally vary according to several factors
    including industry conditions, seasonal demand, competitor
    actions, channel mix and overall availability of product.

Gross Margin.

Gross margin for 2010 was
    $2.4 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 80% over
    the prior year. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue
    increased to 24.4% in 2010 from 17.9% in 2009. This increase was
    primarily due to higher volume, lower costs, a favorable product
    mix and a moderate pricing environment.

Operating Expenses.

Total research and
    development (“R&D”) expense and selling, general
    and administrative (“SG&A”) expense decreased to
    8.9% of net revenue in 2010 compared to 9.5% in 2009. R&D
    expense was $611 million in 2010, an increase of
    $102 million, or 20% over the prior year. This increase in
    R&D expense was primarily due to a $68 million
    increase relating to product development to support new programs
    and a $34 million increase in variable incentive
    compensation. As a percentage of net revenue, R&D expense
    decreased to 6.2% in 2010 compared to 6.8% in 2009 primarily due
    to an increase in net revenue in 2010 compared to 2009.
    SG&A expense was $265 million in 2010, an increase of
    $64 million, or 32%, as compared to 2009. This increase in
    SG&A expense was primarily due to $27 million of
    expense related to litigation settlements, a $19 million
    increase in variable incentive compensation and an
    $18 million increase in the expansion of our sales and
    marketing presence into new regions. SG&A expense as a
    percentage of net revenue remained consistent at 2.7% in 2010
    and 2009.

During 2009, we recorded a $14 million in-process research
    and development charge related to the acquisition of
    SiliconSystems. This charge relates to projects that were not
    ready for commercial production and had no alternative future
    use and, therefore, the fair value of the development effort did
    not qualify for capitalization and was immediately expensed.
    During 2009, we also recorded $112 million in restructuring
    charges and an $18 million gain on the sale of our
    substrate manufacturing facility, and related assets, in
    Sarawak, Malaysia.

Other Income (Expense).

Other expense, net was
    $5 million in 2010 compared to $18 million in 2009.
    This decrease was primarily due to no impairment charges related
    to our auction-rate securities in 2010, compared to
    $10 million in

other-than-temporary

losses in 2009, as well as decreases in the variable interest
    rate on a lower amount of debt.

Income Tax Provision.

Income tax expense was
    $138 million in 2010 as compared to $31 million in
    2009. Tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 9%
    in 2010 compared to 6% for 2009. In 2009, income tax expense
    included a provision of $42 million offset by
    $6 million in tax benefits related to the extension of the
    U.S. Federal research and development tax credit enacted
    into law in October 2008, and a favorable adjustment of
    $5 million to previously recorded tax accruals and credits.
    Differences between the effective tax rate and the
    U.S. Federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax
    holidays in Malaysia and Thailand that expire at various dates
    through 2022 and the current year generation of income tax
    credits.

We recognized a net $94 million increase in the liability
    for unrecognized tax benefits during 2010. As of July 2,
    2010, we had approximately $230 million of unrecognized tax
    benefits which, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax
    rate in subsequent years.

Fiscal
    Year 2009 Compared to Fiscal Year 2008

Net Revenue.

Net revenue was $7.5 billion
    for 2009, a decrease of 8% from 2008. Total unit shipments of
    hard drives increased to 146 million as compared to
    133 million for the prior year. The decrease in revenue
    primarily resulted from a decline in our ASPs which reflected a
    more competitive pricing environment, particularly in the
    notebook and



branded markets. The decline in our ASPs was partially offset by
    an increase in unit shipments of mobile drives. We shipped
    56 million mobile drives in 2009 as compared to
    37 million units in 2008. The increase in mobile unit
    shipments was driven by continued strength in notebook and
    netbook PC demand, coupled with increased customer preference
    for our product offerings.

Changes in revenue by geography and by channel generally reflect
    normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics as
    well as demand strength in Asia, which continued to be driven by
    the concentration of global manufacturing in that region.
    Changes in revenue by channel are a result of increases in sales
    of mobile hard drives to OEMs.

In accordance with standard industry practice, we have sales
    incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with
    price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are
    recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. For 2009, these
    programs represented 11% of gross revenues compared to 10% in
    2008. These amounts generally vary according to several factors
    including industry conditions, seasonal demand, competitor
    actions, channel mix and overall availability of product.

Gross Margin.

Gross margin for 2009 was
    $1.3 billion, a decrease of $402 million, or 23% over
    the prior year. Gross margin percentage decreased to 17.9% in
    2009 from 21.5% in 2008. This decrease is due to a more
    competitive pricing environment primarily resulting from an
    increase in product offerings in the mobile and branded markets.

Operating Expenses.

Total R&D expense and
    SG&A expense increased to 9.5% of net revenue in 2009
    compared to 8.5% in 2008. R&D expense was $509 million
    in 2009, an increase of $45 million, or 10% over the prior
    year. This increase in R&D expense includes
    $76 million relating to product development to support new
    programs offset by a $31 million decrease in variable
    incentive compensation. As a percentage of net revenue, R&D
    expense increased to 6.8% in 2009 compared to 5.7% in 2008
    primarily due to continued investment in product development.
    SG&A expense was $201 million in 2009, a decrease of
    $19 million, or 8.6%, as compared to 2008. This decrease in
    SG&A expense primarily resulted from a $19 million
    decrease in variable incentive compensation and a
    $6 million insurance recovery, offset by a $6 million
    net increase in the expansion of our sales and marketing
    presence into new regions. SG&A expense was 2.7% as a
    percentage of net revenue in both 2009 and 2008.

During 2009, we recorded a $14 million in-process research
    and development charge related to the acquisition of
    SiliconSystems. During 2008, we recorded a $49 million
    in-process research and development charge related to the
    acquisition of Komag. These charges relate to projects that were
    not ready for commercial production and had no alternative
    future use and, therefore, the fair value of the development
    effort did not quality for capitalization and was immediately
    expensed. During 2009, we also recorded $112 million in
    restructuring charges and an $18 million gain on the sale
    of our substrate manufacturing facility, and related assets, in
    Sarawak, Malaysia.

Other Income (Expense).

Net interest and other
    expense was $18 million in 2009 compared to
    $25 million in 2008. This change was primarily due to a
    decrease in the variable interest rate on our debt and a
    $3 million decrease in losses on our auction-rate
    securities.

Income Tax Provision.

Income tax expense was
    $31 million in 2009 compared to $114 million in 2008.
    Tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 6% in
    2009 compared to 12% for 2008. In 2009, income tax expense
    included a provision of $42 million offset by
    $6 million in tax benefits related to the extension of the
    U.S. Federal research and development tax credit, enacted
    into law in October 2008, and a favorable adjustment of
    $5 million to previously recorded tax accruals and credits.
    In 2008, tax expense included net charges of $60 million
    for taxes incurred upon the license of certain intellectual
    property to a foreign subsidiary in our first fiscal quarter.
    Differences between the effective tax rate and the
    U.S. Federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax
    holidays in Malaysia and Thailand that expire at various dates
    through 2022 and the current year generation of income tax
    credits.

We recognized a $29 million increase in the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits during 2009. As of July 3, 2009,
    we had approximately $136 million of unrecognized tax
    benefits which, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax
    rate in subsequent years.



Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

We ended 2010 with total cash and cash equivalents of
    $2.7 billion, an increase of $940 million from
    July 3, 2009. The following table summarizes our statements
    of cash flows for the three years ended July 2, 2010:

Our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to
    preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing return through
    the full investment of available funds. We believe our current
    cash, cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will
    be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital
    expenditure needs through the foreseeable future. Our ability to
    sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of
    risks that we discuss in Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities during 2010 was
    $1.9 billion as compared to $1.3 billion for 2009 and
    $1.4 billion for 2008. Cash flow from operating activities
    consists of net income, adjusted for non-cash charges, plus or
    minus working capital changes. This represents our principal
    source of cash. Net cash used to fund working capital was
    $37 million for 2010 as compared to net cash provided by
    working capital changes of $198 million for 2009 and
    $22 million for 2008.

Our working capital requirements primarily depend on the
    effective management of our cash conversion cycle, which
    measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash
    through sales. The average quarterly cash conversion cycles for
    the three years ended 2010 were as follows:

For 2010, our average days sales outstanding (“DSOs”)
    decreased by 1 day, days in inventory (“DIOs”)
    decreased by 3 days, and days payables outstanding
    (“DPOs”) increased by 5 days. The decreases in
    average DSOs and DIOs were primarily the result of the strong
    demand environment that existed during the first three quarters
    of 2010, which led to better sales linearity and faster
    inventory turns during the corresponding period. DSOs and DIOs
    for the fourth quarter were 48 and 28, respectively. Changes in
    DPOs are generally related to production volume and the timing
    of purchases during the period. From time to time, we modify the
    timing of payments to our vendors. We make modifications
    primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our
    cash flows, including our cash balances. Generally, we make the
    payment modifications through negotiations with our vendors or
    by granting to, or receiving from, our vendors’ payment
    term accommodations.

Investing
    Activities

Net cash used in investing activities for 2010 was
    $986 million as compared to $551 million for 2009 and
    $1.3 billion for 2008. During 2010, cash used in investing
    activities consisted primarily of $737 million for capital
    expenditures, $233 million used for the acquisition of the
    magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya and
    $20 million



used for the acquisition of a semiconductor wafer fabrication
    facility. During 2009, cash used in investing activities
    consisted primarily of $519 million for capital
    expenditures and $63 million for the acquisition of
    SiliconSystems, net of cash acquired, partially offset by
    $29 million in proceeds from the sale of property and
    equipment. During 2008, cash used in investing activities
    consisted of $927 million for the acquisition of Komag, net
    of cash acquired, and $615 million for capital
    expenditures, partially offset by net cash provided by
    short-term investment activity of $221 million. Capital
    expenditures in 2010 primarily consisted of the expansion of our
    head wafer fabrication facilities, continued investment in
    advanced head technologies and increased capacity for our
    broadening and growing product portfolio.

For fiscal 2011, we expect capital expenditures to be between 7%
    and 8% of revenue, plus approximately $200 million related
    to the conversion of our head wafer fabrication facilities to
    utilize

8-inch

wafers from

6-inch

wafers and expenditures to optimize the output from our recently
    acquired magnetic media sputtering operations. We expect
    depreciation and amortization to be approximately
    $650 million for fiscal 2011.

Our cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid money market
    funds which are invested in U.S. Treasury securities,
    U.S. Treasury bills and U.S. Government agency
    securities. We also have auction-rate securities that are
    classified as long-term investments as they are expected to be
    held until secondary markets become available. These investments
    are currently accounted for as

available-for-sale

securities and recorded at fair value within other non-current
    assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The estimated market
    values of these investments are subject to fluctuation. During
    the year ended July 2, 2010, we sold $3 million of
    auction-rate securities, reducing the carrying value of these
    investments to $15 million.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash used by financing activities for 2010 was
    $16 million as compared to $64 million for 2009. Net
    cash provided by financing activities was $326 million for
    2008. Net cash used by financing activities in 2010 consisted of
    $82 million used to repay long-term debt, partially offset
    by a net $66 million provided by employee stock plans. Net
    cash used by financing activities in 2009 consisted of
    $36 million used to repurchase our common stock,
    $27 million used to repay long-term debt and a net
    $1 million used by employee stock plans. Net cash provided
    by financing activities in 2008 consisted of $500 million
    in net proceeds from debt and a net $149 million provided
    by employee stock plans, offset by a $250 million repayment
    of convertible debentures assumed in the acquisition of Komag,
    $60 million used to repurchase our common stock and
    $13 million used to repay other long-term debt.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Other than facility lease commitments incurred in the normal
    course of business and certain indemnification provisions (see
    “Contractual Obligations and Commitments” below), we
    do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or
    liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent
    interests in transferred assets, or any obligation arising out
    of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. We
    do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not
    included in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally,
    we do not have an interest in, or relationships with, any
    special-purpose entities.

Long-Term
    Debt

In February 2008, Western Digital Technologies, Inc.
    (“WDTI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
    entered into a five-year Credit Agreement that provided for a
    $500 million term loan facility. As of July 2, 2010,
    the remaining balance of the term loan facility was
    $400 million, which requires principal payments totaling
    $106 million in 2011, $144 million in 2012 and
    $150 million in 2013. See Part II, Item 8,
    Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Purchase
    Orders

In the normal course of business, we enter into purchase orders
    with suppliers for the purchase of hard drive components used to
    manufacture our products. These purchase orders generally cover
    forecasted component supplies needed for production during the
    next quarter, are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the
    components, and generally may be changed or canceled at any time
    prior to shipment of the components. We also enter into purchase
    orders with suppliers for capital equipment that are recorded as
    a liability upon receipt of the equipment. Our ability to change
    or cancel a capital equipment purchase order without penalty
    depends on the nature of the equipment being ordered. In some
    cases, we may be obligated to pay for certain costs related to
    changes to, or cancellation of, a purchase order, such as costs
    incurred for raw materials or work in process of components or
    capital equipment.

We have entered into long-term purchase agreements with various
    component suppliers, which contain minimum quantity
    requirements. However, the dollar amount of the purchases may
    depend on the specific products ordered, achievement of
    pre-defined quantity or quality specifications or future price
    negotiations. The estimated related minimum purchase
    requirements are included in “Purchase obligations” in
    the table above. We have also entered into long-term purchase
    agreements with various component suppliers that carry fixed
    volumes and pricing which obligate us to make certain future
    purchases, contingent on certain conditions of performance,
    quality and technology of the vendor’s components. These
    arrangements are included under “Purchase obligations”
    in the table above.

We enter into, from time to time, other long-term purchase
    agreements for components with certain vendors. Generally,
    future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and
    determinable as they depend on our overall unit volume
    requirements and are contingent upon the prices, technology and
    quality of the supplier’s products remaining competitive.
    These arrangements are not included under “Purchase
    obligations” in the table above. Please see Item 1A of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for a discussion of risks related to these commitments.

Foreign
    Exchange Contracts

We purchase short-term, foreign exchange contracts to hedge the
    impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying
    assets, revenue, liabilities and commitments for operating
    expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies.
    See Part II, Item 7A, under the heading
    “Disclosure About Foreign Currency Risk,” for a
    description of our current foreign exchange contract commitments
    and Part II, Item 8, Notes 1 and 11 in the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, we may provide
    indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers,
    vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with
    respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to,
    losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, products or
    services to be provided by us, or from intellectual property
    infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have
    entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and
    certain of our officers that will require us, among other
    things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may
    arise by reason of their status or service as directors or
    officers. We maintain director and officer insurance, which may
    cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to
    indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances.

It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount
    under these indemnification agreements due to the limited
    history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and
    circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such
    indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss
    clauses. Historically, we have not incurred material costs as a
    result of obligations under these agreements.



Unrecognized
    Tax Benefits

As of July 2, 2010, our total cash liability representing
    unrecognized tax benefits was $135 million. We estimate the
    timing of the future payments of these liabilities to be within
    the next two to five years. See Part II, Item 8, Note
    9 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for information regarding our tax liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits.

Stock
    Repurchase Program

Our Board of Directors previously authorized us to repurchase
    $750 million of our common stock in open market
    transactions under a stock repurchase program through
    March 31, 2013. Since the inception of this program in
    2005, through July 2, 2010, we have repurchased
    18 million shares for a total cost of $284 million. We
    expect stock repurchases to be funded principally by operating
    cash flows. We may continue to repurchase our stock as we deem
    appropriate and market conditions allow. We did not make any
    repurchases of common stock under the authorized stock
    repurchase program during 2010. Subsequent to July 2, 2010
    through August 13, 2010, we repurchased 1.8 million
    shares for a total cost of $50 million.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of
    the financial statements requires the use of judgments and
    estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues,
    expenses, assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity. We
    have adopted accounting policies and practices that are
    generally accepted in the industry in which we operate. We
    believe the following are our most critical accounting policies
    that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates
    made by us. If these estimates differ significantly from actual
    results, the impact to the consolidated financial statements may
    be material.

Revenue
    and Accounts Receivable

In accordance with standard industry practice, we provide
    distributors and retailers (collectively referred to as
    “resellers”) with limited price protection for
    inventories held by resellers at the time of published list
    price reductions, and we provide resellers and OEMs with other
    sales incentive programs. At the time we recognize revenue to
    resellers and OEMs, we record a reduction of revenue for
    estimated price protection until the resellers sell such
    inventory to their customers and we also record a reduction of
    revenue for the other programs in effect. We base these
    adjustments on several factors including anticipated price
    decreases during the reseller holding period, resellers’
    sell-through and inventory levels, estimated amounts to be
    reimbursed to qualifying customers, historical pricing
    information and customer claim processing. If customer demand
    for hard drives or market conditions differ from our
    expectations, our operating results could be materially
    affected. We also have programs under which we reimburse
    qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing
    expenditures which are recorded as a reduction of revenue. These
    amounts generally vary according to several factors including
    industry conditions, seasonal demand, competitor actions,
    channel mix and overall availability of product. Since 2008,
    total sales incentive and marketing programs have ranged from 7%
    to 12% of gross revenues per quarter. Changes in future customer
    demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our
    incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue from the
    current range. Adjustments to revenues due to changes in
    accruals for these programs related to revenues reported in
    prior periods have averaged 0.1% of quarterly gross revenue
    since the first quarter of fiscal 2008.

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing
    specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based
    on insolvency, disputes or other collection issues. In addition,
    we routinely analyze the different receivable aging categories
    and establish reserves based on a combination of past due
    receivables and expected future losses based primarily on our
    historical levels of bad debt losses. If the financial condition
    of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its
    inability to pay its accounts when due, or if our overall loss
    history changes significantly, an adjustment in our allowance
    for doubtful accounts would be required, which could materially
    affect operating results.

We establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for
    sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is
    recognized. We base these provisions on existing product return
    notifications. If actual sales returns exceed expectations, an
    increase in the sales return accrual would be required, which
    could materially affect operating results.



Warranty

We record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue
    is recognized. We generally warrant our products for a period of
    one to five years. Our warranty provision considers estimated
    product failure rates and trends, estimated repair or
    replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory
    claims related to product quality issues, if any. We use a
    statistical warranty tracking model to help prepare our
    estimates and assist us in exercising judgment in determining
    the underlying estimates. Our statistical tracking model
    captures specific detail on hard drive reliability, such as
    factory test data, historical field return rates, and costs to
    repair by product type. Our judgment is subject to a greater
    degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products
    because of limited field experience with those products upon
    which to base our warranty estimates. We review our warranty
    accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and
    which are still under warranty. Any changes in the estimates
    underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact
    current period gross margin and income. Such changes are
    generally a result of differences between forecasted and actual
    return rate experience and costs to repair. If actual product
    return trends, costs to repair returned products or costs of
    customer compensatory claims differ significantly from our
    estimates, our future results of operations could be materially
    affected. For a summary of historical changes in estimates
    related to pre-existing warranty provisions, refer to
    Part II, Item 8, Note 4 in the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

Inventory

We value inventories at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out and weighted average methods) or net realizable value.
    We use the

first-in,

first-out method to value the cost of the majority of our
    inventories, while we use the weighted-average method to value
    precious metal inventories. Weighted-average cost is calculated
    based upon the cost of precious metals at the time they are
    received by us. We have determined that it is not practicable to
    assign specific costs to individual units of precious metals
    and, as such, we relieve our precious metals inventory based on
    the weighted-average cost of the inventory at the time the
    inventory is used in production. The weighted average method of
    valuing precious metals does not materially differ from a

first-in,

first-out method. We record inventory write-downs for the
    valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable
    value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future
    sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory
    balances.

We evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and
    obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand,
    inventory on hand, sales levels and other information, and
    reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and
    obsolete inventory based on this analysis. Unanticipated changes
    in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in
    demand for one or more of our products, which may require a
    write down of inventory that could materially affect operating
    results.

Litigation
    and Other Contingencies

We disclose material contingencies deemed to be reasonably
    possible and accrue loss contingencies when, in consultation
    with our legal advisors, we conclude that a loss is probable and
    reasonably estimable. The ability to predict the ultimate
    outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates and
    inherent uncertainties. The actual outcome of such matters could
    differ materially from management’s estimates. Refer to
    Part II, Item 8, Note 5 in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Income
    Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability
    method, which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities
    be recognized for temporary differences between the financial
    reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities
    and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss
    (“NOL”) and tax credit carryforwards. We record a
    valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the
    deferred tax assets will not be realized. Each quarter we
    evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax
    assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record
    net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it
    is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be
    realized.

We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a
    two-step process. To the extent a tax position does not meet a
    more-likely-than-not level of certainty, no benefit is
    recognized in the financial statements. If a position meets the



more-likely-than-not level of certainty, it is recognized in the
    financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater
    than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
    Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are
    recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions
    and are recorded in our provision for income taxes. The actual
    liability for unrealized tax benefit in any such contingency may
    be materially different from our estimates, which could result
    in the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized
    tax benefits or potentially adjust previously-recorded
    liabilities for unrealized tax benefits and materially affect
    our operating results.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We account for all stock-based compensation at fair value.
    Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date
    based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense
    over the vesting period. The fair values of all stock options
    granted are estimated using a binomial model, and the fair
    values of all Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)
    purchase rights are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton
    option-pricing model. Both the binomial and the
    Black-Scholes-Merton models require the input of highly
    subjective assumptions. We are required to use judgment in
    estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to
    be forfeited. If actual forfeitures differ significantly from
    the original estimate, stock-based compensation expense and our
    results of operations could be materially affected.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Codification
    (“ASC”) 820, “Fair Value Measurements and
    Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), which establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurement. In February
    2008, FASB issued

ASC 820-10-65-1,

“Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures —
    Transition and Open Effective Date Information,” which
    delayed the effective date of ASC 820 for all non-financial
    assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are
    recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis, until fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2008 and interim periods within those
    years, which for us was the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Our
    adoption of the provisions of ASC 820 for non-financial
    assets and non-financial liabilities in the first quarter of
    fiscal 2010 had no impact on our consolidated financial
    statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC 805, “Business
    Combinations” (“ASC 805”). ASC 805
    establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of
    a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements
    the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and
    any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. ASC 805 also
    provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill
    acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain
    purchase and determines what information to disclose to enable
    users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and
    financial effects of the business combination. ASC 805
    applies prospectively to business combinations for which the
    acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2008, which for us was the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
    ASC 805 impacted our consolidated financial statements for
    business combinations with an acquisition date on or after
    adoption in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. For business
    combinations in which the acquisition date was before the
    adoption date, the provision of ASC 805 requires changes in
    the amount of income tax uncertainties to be recognized in
    earnings rather than as an adjustment to the accounting for
    prior business combinations. Our adoption of ASC 805 in the
    first quarter of fiscal 2010 did not have a material impact on
    our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2008, the FASB issued

ASC 350-30-65-1,

“General Intangibles Other than Goodwill —
    Transition and Open Effective Date Information” (“ASC

350-30-65-1”),

which amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
    life of a recognized intangible asset under ASC 350,
    “Intangibles — Goodwill and Other.”

ASC 350-30-65-1

is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008, which for us was the first quarter of
    fiscal 2010. Our adoption of

ASC 350-30-65-1

in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 had no impact on our
    consolidated financial statements.

In September 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
    (“ASU”)

2009-13,

“Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements” (“ASU

2009-13”),

and ASU

2009-14,

“Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software
    Elements” (“ASU

2009-14”).

ASU

2009-13

amends the revenue guidance under Subtopic

605-25,

“Multiple Element Arrangements,” and addresses how to
    determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables
    contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement
    consideration shall be measured and allocated to the separate
    units of



accounting in the arrangement. ASU

2009-14

excludes tangible products containing software components and
    non-software components that function together to deliver the
    product’s essential functionality from the scope of
    Subtopic

985-605,

“Revenue Recognition.” ASU

2009-13

and
    ASU

2009-14

are effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after
    June 15, 2010, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal
    2011. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU

2009-13

and
    ASU

2009-14

will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Disclosure
    About Foreign Currency Risk

Although the majority of our transactions are in
    U.S. dollars, some transactions are based in various
    foreign currencies. We purchase short-term, foreign exchange
    contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange
    fluctuations on certain underlying assets, revenue, liabilities
    and commitments for operating expenses and product costs
    denominated in foreign currencies. The purpose of entering into
    these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign
    currency fluctuations on our results of operations. The contract
    maturity dates do not exceed 12 months. We do not purchase
    forward exchange contracts for trading purposes. Currently, we
    focus on hedging our foreign currency risk related to the Thai
    Baht, Malaysian Ringgit, Euro and British Pound Sterling.
    Malaysian Ringgit contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.
    Euro and British Pound Sterling contracts are designated as fair
    value hedges. Thai Baht contracts are designated as either cash
    flow or fair value hedges. See Part II, Item 8,
    Notes 1 and 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

As of July 2, 2010, we had outstanding the following

Disclosure
    About Other Market Risks

Variable
    Interest Rate Risk

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate
    equal to, at the option of WDTI, either (a) a LIBOR rate
    determined by reference to the cost of funds for Eurodollar
    deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing,
    adjusted for certain additional costs (the “Eurocurrency
    Rate”); or (b) a base rate determined by reference to
    the higher of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and
    (ii) the prime rate as announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank,
    N.A. (the “Base Rate”); in each case plus an
    applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under
    the term loan facility ranges from 1.25% to 1.50% with respect
    to borrowings at the Eurocurrency Rate and 0.0% to 0.125% with
    respect to borrowings at the Base Rate. The applicable margins
    for borrowings under the Credit Facility are determined based
    upon a leverage ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries
    calculated on a consolidated basis. If the federal funds rate,
    prime rate or LIBOR rate increases, our interest payments could
    also increase. A one percent increase in the variable rate of
    interest on the Credit Facility would increase interest expense
    by approximately $4 million annually.

REPORT
    OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors

Western Digital Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries as of July 2,
    2010 and July 3, 2009, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, shareholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended July 2, 2010. In connection
    with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we
    have also audited the related financial statement schedule.
    These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    July 2, 2010 and July 3, 2009, and the results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in

    in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

REPORT
    OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors

Western Digital Corporation:

We have audited Western Digital Corporation and
    subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as
    of July 2, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of July 2, 2010, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Western Digital Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of July 2, 2010 and July 3, 2009, the
    related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’
    equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended July 2, 2010, and the
    related financial statement schedule, and our report dated
    August 13, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule.

WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.

Organization
    and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Western Digital Corporation (the “Company” or
    “Western Digital” or “WD”) designs,
    develops, manufactures and sells hard drives. A hard drive is a
    device that stores data on one or more rotating magnetic disks
    (“magnetic media”) to allow fast access to data. The
    Company sells its products worldwide to original equipment
    manufacturers (“OEMs”) and original design
    manufacturers for use in computer systems, subsystems or
    consumer electronics (“CE”) devices, and to
    distributors, resellers and retailers. The Company’s hard
    drives are used in desktop computers, notebook computers,
    external storage appliances, enterprise applications, such as
    servers, workstations, network attached storage, storage area
    networks and video surveillance equipment, and CE applications,
    such as digital video recorders and satellite and cable set-top
    boxes.

The Company also designs, develops, manufactures and sells
    solid-state drives and media players. A solid-state drive is a
    storage device that uses semiconductor, non-volatile media,
    rather than magnetic media and magnetic heads, to store and
    allow fast access to data. The Company sells its solid-state
    drives worldwide to OEMs and distributors for use in the
    embedded systems and client PC markets. A media player is a
    device that connects to a user’s television, the Internet
    or home theater system and plays digital movies, music and
    photos from any of the Company’s
    WD

®

-branded

    external hard drives, other USB mass storage devices or content
    services accessed over the Internet. The Company sells its media
    players worldwide to resellers and retailers under the
    WD

®

brand.

The Company has prepared its consolidated financial statements
    in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and has adopted
    accounting policies and practices which are generally accepted
    in the industry in which it operates. The Company’s
    significant accounting policies are summarized below.

Fiscal
    Year

The Company has a 52 or 53-week fiscal year. The 2010 fiscal
    year which ended on July 2, 2010 consisted of
    52 weeks. The 2009 and 2008 fiscal years, which ended on
    July 3, 2009 and June 27, 2008, respectively,
    consisted of 53 and 52 weeks each, respectively.

Basis of
    Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
    intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
    consolidation. The accounts of foreign subsidiaries have been
    remeasured using the U.S. dollar as the functional
    currency. As such, gains or losses resulting from remeasurement
    of these accounts from local currencies into U.S. dollars
    are reflected in the results of operations. These gains and
    losses were immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.

On June 30, 2010, the Company acquired the magnetic media
    sputtering operations of Hoya Corporation and Hoya Magnetics
    Singapore Pte. Ltd (“Hoya”). On March 27, 2009,
    the Company acquired SiliconSystems, Inc.
    (“SiliconSystems”) and on September 5, 2007, the
    Company acquired Komag, Incorporated (“Komag”). The
    acquisitions are further described in Note 14. The results
    of operations of Hoya, SiliconSystems, and Komag since the dates
    of their acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial
    statements.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

The Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid
    investments in money market funds which are invested in
    U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Treasury bills and
    U.S. Government agency securities with original maturities
    when purchased of three months or less.



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Investments

The Company’s investments consist of auction-rate
    securities, which are primarily backed by insurance products
    with original maturities greater than three months. The Company
    has classified these investments as

available-for-sale

securities and they are carried at fair value within other
    non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
    investments, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate
    fair value for all periods presented because of the short-term
    maturity of these assets and liabilities or, in the case of
    investments, these are recorded using appropriate market
    information. The carrying amount of debt approximates fair value
    because of its variable interest rate.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company sells its products to computer manufacturers,
    resellers and retailers throughout the world. The Company
    performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’
    financial condition and generally requires no collateral. The
    Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses, and
    such losses have historically been within management’s
    expectations. At any given point in time, the total amount
    outstanding from any one of a number of its customers may be
    individually significant to the Company’s financial
    results. At July 2, 2010 and July 3, 2009, the Company
    had reserves for potential credit losses of $6 million and
    $14 million, respectively, and net accounts receivable of
    $1.3 billion and $926 million, respectively. The
    Company also has cash equivalent and investment policies that
    limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial
    institution or investment instrument and requires that
    investments be made only with financial institutions or in
    investment instruments evaluated as highly credit-worthy.

Inventory

The Company values inventory at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first out and weighted average methods) or net realizable value.
    The

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method is used to value the cost of
    the majority of the Company’s inventories, while the
    weighted-average method is used to value precious metal
    inventories. Weighted-average cost is calculated based upon the
    cost of precious metals at the time they are received by the
    Company. The Company has determined that it is not practicable
    to assign specific costs to individual units of precious metals
    and, as such, precious metals are relieved from inventory based
    on the weighted-average cost of the inventory at the time the
    inventory is used in production. The weighted average method of
    valuing precious metals does not materially differ from a

first-in,

first-out method. As of July 2, 2010 and July 3, 2009,
    82% of the inventory was valued using the FIFO method with the
    remainder valued using the weighted average method. Inventory
    write-downs are recorded for the valuation of inventory at the
    lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market
    conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to
    inventory costs and inventory balances.

The Company evaluates inventory balances for excess quantities
    and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated
    demand, inventory on hand, sales levels and other information,
    and reduces inventory balances to net realizable value for
    excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis.
    Unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could
    result in a decrease in demand for one or more of the
    Company’s products, which may require a write down of
    inventory that could materially affect operating results.

Property
    and Equipment

The cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the
    estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The
    Company’s buildings are being depreciated over periods
    ranging from fifteen to thirty years. The majority of the
    Company’s equipment is being depreciated over periods of
    three to seven years. Depreciation is computed on a
    straight-line basis. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
    the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the
    related lease terms.



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Goodwill
    and Other Long-Lived Assets

The total purchase price in a business combination is allocated
    to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    based on their fair values at the acquisition date, with amounts
    exceeding the fair values being recorded as goodwill. Goodwill
    is not amortized. Instead, it is tested for impairment on an
    annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The
    Company did not record any impairment of goodwill during 2010,
    2009 or 2008.

Other intangible assets consist primarily of technology acquired
    in business combinations. Acquired intangibles are amortized on
    a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful
    lives. Long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying
    amounts may not be recoverable. The Company did not record any
    impairments to long-lived assets during 2010 or 2008. The
    Company recorded impairments to certain long-lived assets during
    2009. See Note 13.

Revenue
    and Accounts Receivable

Revenue is recognized when the title and risk of loss have
    passed to the customer, there is persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement, delivery has occurred, or services have been
    rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
    collectability is reasonably assured. The Company establishes
    provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated
    sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is
    recognized based on existing product return notifications. If
    actual sales returns exceed expectations, an increase in the
    sales return accrual would be required, which could materially
    affect operating results.

In accordance with standard industry practice, the Company
    provides distributors and retailers (collectively referred to as
    “resellers”) with limited price protection for
    inventories held by resellers at the time of published list
    price reductions, and the Company provides resellers and OEMs
    with other sales incentive programs. At the time the Company
    recognizes revenue to resellers and OEMs, a reduction of revenue
    is recorded for estimated price protection until the resellers
    sell such inventory to their customers and the Company also
    records a reduction of revenue for the other programs in effect.
    The Company bases these adjustments on several factors,
    including anticipated price decreases during the reseller
    holding period, reseller’s sell-through and inventory
    levels, estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying
    customers, historical pricing information and customer claim
    processing. If customer demand for hard drives or market
    conditions differ from the Company’s expectations, the
    Company’s operating results could be materially affected.
    The Company also has programs under which it reimburses
    qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing
    expenditures which are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Sales
    incentive and marketing programs are recorded as a reduction of
    revenue.

The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts by
    analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of
    loss based on insolvency, disputes or other collection issues.
    In addition, the Company routinely analyzes the different
    receivable aging categories and establishes reserves based on a
    combination of past due receivables and expected future losses
    based primarily on its historical levels of bad debt losses. If
    the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates
    resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due, or if
    the Company’s overall loss history changes significantly,
    an adjustment in the Company’s allowance for doubtful
    accounts would be required, which could materially affect
    operating results.

The Company establishes provisions against revenue and cost of
    revenue for sales returns in the same period that the related
    revenue is recognized. These provisions are based on existing
    product return notifications. If actual sales returns exceed
    expectations, an increase in the sales return accrual would be
    required, which could negatively affect operating results.

Warranty

The Company records an accrual for estimated warranty costs when
    revenue is recognized. The Company generally warrants its
    products for a period of one to five years. The warranty
    provision considers estimated product failure rates



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and trends, estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated
    costs for customer compensatory claims related to product
    quality issues, if any. A statistical warranty tracking model is
    used to help prepare estimates and assist the Company in
    exercising judgment in determining the underlying estimates. The
    statistical tracking model captures specific detail on hard
    drive reliability, such as factory test data, historical field
    return rates, and costs to repair by product type.
    Management’s judgment is subject to a greater degree of
    subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because
    of limited field experience with those products upon which to
    base warranty estimates. Management reviews the warranty accrual
    quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are
    still under warranty. Any changes in the estimates underlying
    the accrual may materially affect operating results. Such
    changes are generally a result of differences between forecasted
    and actual return rate experience and costs to repair. If actual
    product return trends, costs to repair returned products or
    costs of customer compensatory claims differ significantly from
    estimates, future results of operations could be materially
    affected.

Litigation
    and Other Contingencies

The Company discloses material contingencies deemed to be
    reasonably possible and accrues loss contingencies when, in
    consultation with legal advisors, the Company concludes that a
    loss is probable and reasonably estimable. The ability to
    predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments,
    estimates and inherent uncertainties. The actual outcome of such
    matters could differ materially from management’s
    estimates. See Note 5.

Advertising
    Expense

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Selling, general and
    administrative expenses of the Company included advertising
    costs of $7 million, $5 million, and $3 million
    in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Income
    Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and
    liability method, which provides that deferred tax assets and
    liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the
    financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and
    liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating
    loss (“NOL”) and tax credit carryforwards. The Company
    records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not
    that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Each period,
    the Company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance for its
    deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowance so that
    the Company records net deferred tax assets only to the extent
    that it has concluded it is more likely than not that these
    deferred tax assets will be realized.

The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions
    based on a two-step process. To the extent a tax position does
    not meet a more-likely-than-not level of certainty, no benefit
    is recognized in the financial statements. If a position meets
    the more-likely-than-not level of certainty, it is recognized in
    the financial statements at the largest amount that has a
    greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
    settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
    benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain
    tax positions and are recorded in the provision for income
    taxes. The actual liability for unrealized tax benefit in any
    such contingency may be materially different from the
    Company’s estimates, which could result in the need to
    record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or

Income
    per Common Share

The Company computes basic income per common share using net
    income and the weighted average number of common shares
    outstanding during the period. Diluted income per common share
    is computed using net income and the weighted average number of
    common shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding
    during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares include
    certain dilutive outstanding employee stock options, rights to
    purchase shares of common stock under the Company’s
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) and restricted
    stock unit awards.

For purposes of computing diluted income per common share,
    certain potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from
    the calculation because their effect would have been
    anti-dilutive.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date
    based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense
    over the vesting period. The fair values of all stock options
    granted are estimated using a binomial model, and the fair
    values of all ESPP purchase rights are estimated using the
    Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. Both the binomial and
    the Black-Scholes-Merton models require the input of highly
    subjective assumptions. The Company is required to use judgment
    in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected
    to be forfeited. If actual forfeitures differ significantly from
    the original estimate, stock-based compensation expense and the
    results of operations could be materially affected.

Other
    Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to revenue, expenses,
    gains and losses that are recorded as an element of
    shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net income. The
    Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of
    unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts.

Foreign
    Exchange Contracts

Although the majority of the Company’s transactions are in
    U.S. dollars, some transactions are based in various
    foreign currencies. The Company purchases short-term, foreign
    exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency
    exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets, revenue,
    liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product
    costs denominated in foreign currencies. The purpose of entering
    into these hedging transactions is to minimize the impact of
    foreign currency fluctuations on the Company’s results of
    operations. These contract maturity dates do not exceed
    12 months. All forward exchange contracts are for risk
    management purposes only. The Company does not purchase forward
    exchange contracts for trading purposes.

The Company had outstanding forward exchange contracts with
    commercial banks for Thai Baht, Malaysian Ringgit, Euro and
    British Pound Sterling with aggregate notional amounts of
    $1.1 billion and $583 million at July 2, 2010 and
    July 3, 2009, respectively. Malaysian Ringgit contracts are
    designated as cash flow hedges. Euro and British



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Pound Sterling contracts are designated as fair value hedges.
    Thai Baht contracts are designated as either cash flow or fair
    value hedges.

If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the
    effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative
    is initially deferred in other comprehensive income (loss), net
    of tax. These amounts are subsequently recognized into earnings
    when the underlying cash flow being hedged is recognized into
    earnings. Recognized gains and losses on foreign exchange
    contracts entered into for manufacturing related activities are
    reported in cost of revenues. Hedge effectiveness is measured by
    comparing the hedging instrument’s cumulative change in
    fair value from inception to maturity to the underlying
    exposure’s terminal value. The Company determined the
    ineffectiveness associated with its cash flow hedges to be
    immaterial.

A change in the fair value of fair value hedges is recognized in
    earnings in the period incurred and is reported as a component
    of operating expenses. All fair value hedges were determined to
    be effective. The fair value and the changes in fair value on
    these contracts were not material to the consolidated financial
    statements for all years presented. See Notes 10 and 11 for
    additional disclosures related to foreign exchange contracts.

Use of
    Estimates

Company management has made estimates and assumptions relating
    to the reporting of certain assets and liabilities in conformity
    with U.S. GAAP. These estimates and assumptions have been
    applied using methodologies which are consistent throughout the
    periods presented. However, actual results could differ
    materially from these estimates.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Codification
    (“ASC”) 820, “Fair Value Measurements and
    Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), which establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurement. In February
    2008, FASB issued

ASC 820-10-65-1,

“Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures —
    Transition and Open Effective Date Information,” which
    delayed the effective date of ASC 820 for all non-financial
    assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are
    recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis, until fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2008 and interim periods within those
    years, which for the Company was the first quarter of fiscal
    2010. The Company’s adoption of the provisions of
    ASC 820 for non-financial assets and non-financial
    liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 had no impact on
    its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC 805, “Business
    Combinations” (“ASC 805”). ASC 805
    establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of
    a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements
    the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and
    any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. ASC 805 also
    provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill
    acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain
    purchase and determines what information to disclose to enable
    users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and
    financial effects of the business combination. ASC 805
    applies prospectively to business combinations for which the
    acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2008, which for the Company was the first quarter of fiscal
    2010. ASC 805 impacted the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements for business combinations with an
    acquisition date on or after adoption in the first quarter of
    fiscal 2010. For business combinations in which the acquisition
    date was before the adoption date, the provision of ASC 805
    requires changes in the amount of income tax uncertainties to be
    recognized in earnings rather than as an adjustment to the
    accounting for prior business combinations. The Company’s
    adoption of ASC 805 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 did
    not have a material impact on its consolidated financial
    statements.

In April 2008, the FASB issued

ASC 350-30-65-1,

“General Intangibles Other than Goodwill —
    Transition and Open Effective Date Information” (“ASC

350-30-65-1”),

which amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
    life of a recognized intangible asset under ASC 350,
    “Intangibles — Goodwill and Other.”

ASC 350-30-65-1

    quarter of fiscal 2010. The Company’s adoption of

ASC 350-30-65-1

in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 had no impact on its
    consolidated financial statements.

In September 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update

Credit
    Facility

In February 2008, Western Digital Technologies, Inc.
    (“WDTI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
    entered into a five-year Credit Agreement that provided for a
    $750 million unsecured loan consisting of a
    $500 million term loan facility (“Term Loan”) and
    a $250 million revolving credit facility. The Company
    voluntarily terminated the $250 million revolving credit
    facility during its fourth fiscal quarter of 2010. As of
    July 2, 2010, the Term Loan had a variable interest rate of
    1.63% and a remaining balance of $400 million, which
    requires principal payments totaling $106 million in 2011,
    $144 million in 2012 and $150 million in 2013. The
    Term Loan has a maturity date of February 11, 2013. The
    Credit Facility requires WDTI to comply with a leverage ratio
    and an interest coverage ratio calculated on a consolidated
    basis for the Company and its subsidiaries. In addition, the
    Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including
    covenants that limit or restrict WDTI’s and its
    subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness,
    make certain restricted payments, merge or consolidate and enter
    into certain speculative hedging arrangements. As of

Long-term
    Purchase Agreements

The Company has entered into long-term purchase agreements with

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company discloses material loss contingencies deemed to be
    reasonably possible and accrues for loss contingencies when, in
    consultation with the Company’s legal advisors, the Company
    concludes that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. The
    ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves
    judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. The actual
    outcome of such matters could differ materially from
    management’s estimates.

Intellectual
    Property Litigation

On December 8, 2008, plaintiffs MagSil Corporation and the
    Massachusetts Institute of Technology filed a complaint in the
    District of Delaware against the Company and seven other
    companies in the disk drive industry alleging infringement of
    U.S. Patent Nos. 5,629,922 and 5,835,314. The complaint
    sought unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. The
    asserted patents allegedly relate to tunneling magneto resistive
    technology. MagSil and the Company executed a Confidential
    Settlement Agreement on June 22, 2010. The parties filed a
    Stipulation of Dismissal in July 2010. The financial impact of
    the settlement was not material to the Company.

On June 20, 2008, plaintiff Convolve, Inc.
    (“Convolve”) filed a complaint in the Eastern District
    of Texas against the Company and two other companies alleging
    infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,314,473 and 4,916,635.
    Plaintiff is seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive
    relief. On October 10, 2008, Convolve amended its complaint
    to allege infringement of only the ‘473 patent. The
    ‘473 patent allegedly relates to interface technology to
    select between certain modes of a disk drive’s operations
    relating to speed and noise. The Company intends to defend
    itself vigorously in this matter.

On April 7, 2009, plaintiff Gregory Bender filed a
    complaint in the Northern District of California against the
    Company and Seagate Technology LLC alleging infringement of
    U.S. Patent No. 5,103,188. Plaintiff is seeking
    unspecified monetary damages. The asserted patent allegedly
    relates to buffered transconductance amplifier technology. The
    Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter.

On July 15, 2009, plaintiffs Carl B. Collins and Farzin
    Davanloo filed a complaint in the Eastern District of Texas
    against the Company and ten other companies alleging
    infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,411,797 and 5,478,650.
    Plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief and unspecified
    monetary damages, fees, and costs. The asserted patents
    allegedly relate to nanophase diamond films. The Company intends
    to defend itself vigorously in this matter.

On December 7, 2009, plaintiff Nazomi Communications filed
    a complaint in the Eastern District of Texas against the Company
    and seven other companies alleging infringement of
    U.S. Patent Nos. 7,080,362 and 7,225,436. Plaintiffs are
    seeking injunctive relief and unspecified monetary damages,

Employment
    Litigation

On March 20, 2009, plaintiff Ghazala H. Durrani, a former
    employee of the Company, filed a putative class action complaint
    in the Alameda County (California) Superior Court. The complaint
    alleges that certain of the Company’s engineers have been
    misclassified as exempt employees under California state law and
    are, therefore, due unspecified amounts for unpaid hourly
    overtime wages and other amounts, as well as penalties for
    allegedly missed meal and rest periods. By court order dated
    April 24, 2009, the case was transferred to the Orange
    County (California) Superior Court, where it is now pending. On
    or about June 16, 2009, the Company was dismissed from the
    case without prejudice by stipulation, leaving WDTI as the sole
    remaining defendant. On or about June 4, 2009, WDTI filed
    its answer to the complaint, denying the substantive allegations
    thereof and raising several affirmative defenses. Formal
    discovery has commenced, and the court has set October 18,
    2010, as the last date for the parties to schedule a hearing on
    whether the case should be certified as a class action. The
    parties participated in a mediation of the case on June 3,
    2010 before a former federal magistrate, which may lead to a
    settlement of the case. No formal settlement agreement has been
    entered into, however, and there is no assurance that settlement
    will be reached. Any such settlement would require court
    approval before it can become final. If the matter is settled on
    the terms presently under consideration, the Company expects
    that the financial impact of the settlement would not be
    material to the Company. If the matter is not settled, and the
    Company is unsuccessful in its defense of this matter, potential
    liability could include unpaid wages, interest, penalties,
    attorneys’ fees and costs. Absent settlement, the Company
    intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in this matter.

Other
    Matters

In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to
    other legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. Although the
    ultimate aggregate amount of probable monetary liability or
    financial impact with respect to these other matters is subject
    to many uncertainties and is therefore not predictable with
    assurance, management believes that any monetary liability or
    financial impact to the Company from these other matters,
    individually and in the aggregate, would not be material to the
    Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
    cash flows. However, there can be no assurance with respect to
    such result, and monetary liability or financial impact to the
    Company from these other matters could differ materially from
    those projected.

    Employee Stock Option Plan, the Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan
    and the Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors. No new
    awards may be granted under the Employee Stock Option Plan, the
    Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan or the Stock Option Plan for
    Non-Employee Directors (collectively referred to as the
    “Prior Stock Plans”). As of July 2, 2010, options
    to purchase 1.7 million shares of the Company’s common
    stock remain outstanding and exercisable under the Prior Stock
    Plans. Options granted under the Prior Stock Plans vested over
    periods from one to four years. Options granted under the Prior
    Stock Plans expire

either five or ten years from the date of grant. There are no
    outstanding restricted stock awards under the Prior Stock Plans.

The types of awards that may be granted under the 2004
    Performance Incentive Plan include stock options, stock
    appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock bonuses and other
    forms of awards granted or denominated in the Company’s
    common stock or units of the Company’s common stock, as
    well as cash bonus awards. Persons eligible to receive awards
    under the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan include officers or
    employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, directors
    of the Company and certain consultants and advisors to the
    Company or any of its subsidiaries. The vesting of awards under
    the Performance Incentive Plan is determined at the date of
    grant. Each award expires on a date determined at the date of
    grant; however, the maximum term of options and stock
    appreciation rights under the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan is
    ten years after the grant date of the award.

As of July 2, 2010, the maximum number of shares of the
    Company’s common stock that was authorized for award grants
    under the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan was 37.2 million
    shares. Any shares subject to awards under the Prior Stock Plans
    that are canceled, forfeited or otherwise terminate without
    having vested or been exercised, as applicable, will become
    available for other award grants under the 2004 Performance
    Incentive Plan. The 2004 Performance Incentive Plan will
    terminate on September 20, 2014 unless terminated earlier
    by the Company’s Board of Directors.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

During 2006, the Company adopted the ESPP whereby eligible
    employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their
    eligible compensation to purchase shares of the Company’s
    common stock at 95% of the fair market value of common stock on
    either the date of grant or on the exercise date, whichever is
    less. The date of grant of each offering period is
    June 1st or December 1st, except for the initial
    offering period, which began on December 15, 2005. Each
    offering period is 24 months and consists of four exercise
    dates. If the fair market value of the common stock is less on a
    given exercise date than on the date of grant, employee
    participation in that offering period is terminated and
    re-enrollment in the new offering period occurs automatically.
    The Company’s ESPP operates in the U.S. in accordance
    with Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.

Stock-Based
    Compensation Expense

The Company charged to expense $37 million,
    $24 million and $18 million for stock-based
    compensation related to options issued under stock option plans
    and the ESPP in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of
    July 2, 2010, total compensation cost related to unvested
    stock options and ESPP rights issued to employees but not yet
    recognized was $52 million and will be amortized on a
    straight-line basis over a weighted average service period of
    approximately 2.1 years.

The Company granted approximately 1.2 million,
    0.9 million and 0.9 million restricted stock units
    during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which are payable in
    an equal number of shares of the Company’s common stock at
    the time of vesting of the units. Restricted stock unit awards
    vest over periods ranging from one to five years from the date
    of grant. The aggregate market value of the shares underlying
    the restricted stock awards at the date of grant was
    $45 million, $19 million and $23 million in 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. These amounts are being recognized
    to expense over the corresponding vesting periods. For purposes
    of valuing these awards, the Company has assumed a forfeiture
    rate of 1.55% based on a historical analysis indicating
    forfeitures for these types of awards. The Company charged to
    expense $23 million, $23 million and $19 million
    related to restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards
    that vested during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of
    July 2, 2010, the aggregate unamortized fair value of all
    unvested restricted stock unit awards was $51 million,
    which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over a
    weighted average vesting period of approximately 1.6 years.

Fair
    Value Disclosure — Binomial Model

The fair value of stock options granted during 2010, 2009 and
    2008 was estimated using a binomial option-pricing model. The
    binomial model requires the input of highly subjective
    assumptions including the expected stock price volatility, the
    expected price multiple at which employees are likely to
    exercise stock options and the expected employee termination
    rate. The Company uses historical data to estimate option
    exercise, employee termination, and expected stock price
    volatility within the binomial model. The risk-free rate for
    periods within the contractual life of the option is based on
    the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of
    grant. The fair value of stock options granted during the three
    years ended July 2, 2010 was estimated using the following
    weighted average assumptions:

    Model

The fair value of ESPP purchase rights issued is estimated at
    the date of grant of the purchase rights using the
    Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The
    Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model was developed for use
    in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no
    vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The
    Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model requires the input of
    highly subjective assumptions such as the expected stock price
    volatility and the expected period until options are exercised.
    Purchase rights under the current ESPP provisions are granted on
    either June 1 or December 1 of each year.

The fair values of all ESPP purchase rights granted on or prior
    to July 2, 2010 have been estimated at the date of grant
    using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the

    Repurchase Program

The Company’s Board of Directors previously authorized the
    repurchase of $750 million of common stock in open market
    transactions under a stock repurchase program through
    March 31, 2013. Since the inception of this program in
    2005, through July 2, 2010, the Company has repurchased
    18 million shares for a total cost of $284 million.
    The Company expects stock repurchases to be funded principally
    by operating cash flows. The Company may continue to repurchase
    stock as the Company deems appropriate and market conditions
    allow. The Company did not make any repurchases of common stock
    under the authorized stock repurchase program during 2010.
    Subsequent to July 2, 2010 through August 13, 2010,
    the Company repurchased 1.8 million shares for a total cost
    of $50 million.

    Purchase Rights

On April 6, 2001, the Company adopted a plan to protect
    shareholders’ rights in the event of a proposed takeover of
    the Company. Under the plan, each share of the Company’s
    outstanding common stock carries one Right to Purchase
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the
    “Right”). The Right enables the holder, under certain
    circumstances, to purchase Series A Junior Participating
    Preferred Stock of Western Digital at an exercise price of
    $50.00 per share ten days after a person or group publicly
    announces it has acquired or has tendered an offer for 15%, or
    more, of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The Rights
    are redeemable by the Company at $0.001 per Right. The 2001

In addition to the deferred tax assets presented above, the

    $76 million at July 2, 2010 and July 3, 2009,
    respectively. The increase in NOL benefits relates to the
    current year stock based compensation deductions which will
    result in a future benefit of $25 million, current year
    utilization of the stock based NOL of $4 million, and a
    reduction in the estimate of the prior year NOL utilization
    related to stock based compensation of $4 million. This
    $93 million will be recorded as a credit to shareholders
    equity when an incremental benefit is recognized after
    considering all other tax attributes available to the Company.

Tax
    Holidays and Carryforwards

A substantial portion of the Company’s manufacturing
    operations in Malaysia and Thailand operate under various tax
    holidays and tax incentive programs which will expire in whole
    or in part at various dates through 2022. Certain of the
    holidays may be extended if specific conditions are met. The net
    impact of these tax holidays and tax incentives was to increase
    the Company’s net earnings by $560 million ($2.40 per
    diluted share), $241 million ($1.07 per diluted share), and
    $391 million ($1.73 per diluted share) in 2010, 2009, and
    2008, respectively.

As of July 2, 2010, the Company had federal and state NOL
    carryforwards of approximately $249 million and
    $73 million, respectively. In addition, the Company had
    various federal and state tax credit carryforwards of
    approximately $204 million combined. The loss carryforwards
    available to offset future federal and state taxable income
    expire at various dates from 2020 to 2029 and 2015 to 2019,
    respectively. Approximately $105 million of the credit
    carryforwards available to offset future taxable income expire
    at various dates from 2011 to 2028. The remaining amount is
    available indefinitely. NOLs and credits relating to Komag,
    which was acquired by the Company on September 5, 2007, are
    subject to limitations under Section 382 and 383 of the
    Internal Revenue Code. The Company does not expect these
    limitations to result in a reduction in the total amount of NOLs
    and credits ultimately realized.

Uncertain
    Tax Positions

The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions
    based on a two-step process. First, the tax position is
    evaluated for recognition by determining if it is more likely
    than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including
    resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
    If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be
    sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the
    amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements.
    The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest
    amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
    upon ultimate settlement. With the exception of certain
    unrecognized tax benefits that are directly associated with the
    tax position taken, unrecognized tax benefits are presented
    gross in the Company’s balance sheet. Interest and
    penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as
    liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are
    recorded in the provision for income taxes. As of July 2,
    2010, such interest and penalties were not material.

As of July 2, 2010, the Company had approximately
    $230 million of unrecognized tax benefits.

The entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits at July 2,

The Company files U.S. Federal, U.S. state, and
    foreign tax returns. For both federal and state tax returns,
    with few exceptions, the Company is subject to examination for
    fiscal years 2006 through 2009. In foreign jurisdictions, with
    few exceptions, the Company is subject to examination for all
    years subsequent to fiscal 2005. The Company is no longer
    subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service
    (“IRS”) for periods prior to 2006, although carry
    forwards generated prior to those periods may still be adjusted
    upon examination by the IRS or state taxing authority if they
    either have been or will be used in a subsequent period.

The IRS is currently examining fiscal years 2006 and 2007 for
    the Company and calendar years 2005 and 2006 for Komag. In the
    year ended July 2, 2010, the local tax authorities
    completed, with no material adjustment, their examination of the
    Company’s French subsidiary for fiscal years 2003 through
    2005.

Due to the risk that audit outcomes and the timing of audit
    settlements are subject to significant uncertainty, the
    Company’s current estimate of the total amounts of
    unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease for all
    open tax years. As of July 2, 2010, it is not possible to
    estimate the amount of change, if any, in the unrecognized tax
    benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve
    months. Any significant change in the amount of the
    Company’s unrecognized tax benefits would most likely
    result from additional information or settlements relating to
    the examination of the Company’s uncertain tax positions.

U.S. Government Agency Securities.

The
    Company’s U.S. Government agency securities are fixed
    income securities sponsored by the U.S. Government, have
    original maturities of three months or less and are recorded
    within cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance
    sheets. At July 3, 2009, the Company had $1 million in
    U.S. Government agency securities classified as

    consolidated balance sheets. U.S. Government agency
    securities are valued using a market approach which is based on
    observable inputs including market interest rates from multiple
    pricing sources.

Auction-Rate Securities.

The Company’s
    auction-rate securities have maturity dates through 2050, are
    primarily backed by insurance products and are accounted for as

available-for-sale

securities. These investments are expected to be held until
    secondary markets become available and as a result, are
    classified as long-term investments and recorded within other
    non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
    Auction-rate securities are valued using an income approach
    which is based on a discounted cash flow model or a credit
    default model. The inputs to the discounted cash flow model
    include market interest rates and a discount factor to reflect
    the illiquidity of the investments. The inputs to the credit
    default model include market interest rates, yields of similar
    securities, and probability-weighted assumptions related to the
    creditworthiness of the underlying assets.

Foreign Exchange Contracts.

The Company’s
    foreign exchange contracts are short-term contracts to hedge the
    Company’s foreign currency risk related to the Thai Baht,
    Malaysian Ringgit, Euro and British Pound Sterling. Foreign
    exchange contracts are classified within other current assets in
    the consolidated balance sheets. Foreign exchange contracts are
    valued using an income approach which is based on a present
    value of future cash flows model. The market-based observable
    inputs for the model include forward rates and credit default
    swap rates.

Other
    Intangible Assets

Other intangible assets consist primarily of technology acquired
    in business combinations and are amortized on a straight-line
    basis over the respective estimated useful lives of the assets.
    In 2010, the Company acquired $11 million of intangibles as
    a result of the Hoya acquisition, primarily related to a glass
    substrate supply agreement and existing technology. Intangible
    assets as of July 2, 2010 were as follows:

    respectively. As of July 2, 2010, estimated future
    amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately
    $17 million for 2011, $16 million for 2012,
    $13 million for 2013, $12 million for 2014, and
    $12 million for 2015.

Note 13.

Restructuring
    and Sale of Facility

During 2009, the Company announced and completed a restructuring
    plan to realign its cost structure as a result of a softer
    demand environment. This resulted in the closure of one of the
    Company’s hard drive manufacturing facilities in Thailand,
    the disposal of its substrate manufacturing facility in Sarawak,
    Malaysia, and headcount reductions throughout the world of
    approximately 3,300 people. Restructuring costs totaled
    $112 million and consisted of $81 million of asset
    impairment charges, $27 million of employee termination
    benefits and $4 million of contract termination and other
    exit costs. Total cash expenditures related to the restructuring
    activities were approximately $31 million. The asset
    impairment charge of $81 million consisted of
    $76 million primarily related to the land, buildings,
    machinery and equipment at the manufacturing facilities in
    Thailand and Malaysia and $5 million related to a customer
    relationship intangible asset acquired from Komag. The
    impairment charge is based on the excess of the carrying values
    over the

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

estimated fair values of the assets. The fair values of the
    land, buildings, and equipment were estimated using the market
    approach. The intangible asset was valued using the income
    approach.

During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company sold its
    substrate manufacturing facility, and related assets, in
    Sarawak, Malaysia for net proceeds of approximately
    $29 million, resulting in a gain of $18 million. The
    closure and disposal of the Company’s manufacturing
    facilities was to realign its manufacturing capacity with the
    Company’s expectations regarding demand at that time. Total
    restructuring charges of $112 million, partially offset by
    the $18 million gain on sale of assets, is included in
    restructuring and other, net within operating expenses in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Acquisitions

Magnetic
    Media Operations

On June 30, 2010, the Company acquired the facilities,
    equipment, intellectual property and working capital of the
    magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya. The acquisition is
    intended to augment the Company’s existing magnetic media
    operations, strengthening its ability to meet anticipated growth
    in demand for hard drives. The cost of the acquisition was
    approximately $233 million and was funded with available
    cash. The Company has identified and recorded the assets,
    including specifically identifiable intangible assets, and
    liabilities assumed from Hoya at their estimated fair values as
    of the date of acquisition, and has allocated the remaining
    value to goodwill. The values assigned to certain acquired
    assets and liabilities are preliminary, are based on information
    available as of July 2, 2010, and may be adjusted as
    further information becomes available during the allocation
    period of up to 12 months from the date of the acquisition.
    The purchase price was based on preliminary estimates of the
    working capital assets acquired and liabilities assumed and
    therefore, may be adjusted when finalized. The preliminary
    allocation is as follows (in millions):

Intangible assets of $11 million primarily relate to a
    glass substrate supply agreement and existing technology. These
    intangibles will be amortized to cost of revenue over the
    weighted average useful life of 3 years. Pro forma
    financial information has not been presented as the acquisition
    did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended
    July 2, 2010.

Semiconductor
    Wafer Fabrication Facility

On May 25, 2010, the Company agreed to purchase a
    semiconductor wafer fabrication facility consisting of land, a
    building, equipment and certain intangible assets for a total
    acquisition cost of approximately $35 million. The land and
    building were acquired for $20 million during the fourth
    fiscal quarter of 2010. The Company is expecting to acquire the
    equipment and certain intangible assets for approximately
    $15 million and convert the facility from a semiconductor
    fabrication facility to a head wafer fabrication facility in
    late fiscal 2011.

SiliconSystems

On March 27, 2009, the Company acquired SiliconSystems, a
    supplier of solid-state drives for the embedded systems market.
    The total acquisition cost of SiliconSystems was
    $66 million, consisting of $65 million in cash paid to
    SiliconSystems shareholders and $1 million of other direct
    acquisition costs. The Company identified and recorded the
    assets, including specifically identifiable intangible assets,
    and liabilities assumed from SiliconSystems at their estimated
    fair values as of the acquisition date, and allocated the
    remaining value to goodwill. The allocation was as follows (in

Intangible assets of $24 million primarily relates to

    the weighted average useful life of 6 years. In-process
    research and development of $14 million relates to projects
    that had not reached technological feasibility and had no
    alternative future use, and therefore, did not qualify for
    capitalization and was recorded as an operating expense during
    2009 in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Komag

On September 5, 2007, the Company acquired Komag, a media
    manufacturer, which was followed by a merger of State M, the
    Company’s indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, and Komag
    whereby Komag became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the
    Company and changed its name to WD Media. The aggregate purchase
    price for Komag was $1.0 billion, consisting of cash paid
    for outstanding shares, transaction fees, severance and other
    employee-related equity payments.

Komag had an in-process research and development project
    associated with technology for higher recording densities on
    advanced perpendicular recording media. As these advanced
    products were not ready for commercial production and had no
    alternative future use, the development effort did not qualify
    for capitalization. Accordingly, the Company recorded
    $49 million as a charge to operating expenses at the time
    of the acquisition.

In connection with the acquisition, the Company assumed
    $250 million face value of additional debt in the form of
    Convertible Subordinated Notes (the “Notes”) issued by
    Komag on March 28, 2007. The holders of the Notes tendered
    their Notes to the Company and on December 5, 2007, the
    Company paid $250 million plus accrued and unpaid interest
    to purchase the Notes.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As required by SEC

Rule 13a-15(b)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”), we carried out an evaluation, under
    the supervision and with the participation of our management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
    disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period
    covered by this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over
    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in
    reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
    and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable
    assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to
    permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts
    and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
    authorizations of our management and our directors; and
    (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
    of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial
    statements.

Our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework.

Based on this evaluation, our management
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm,
    which audited the consolidated financial statements included in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

has issued an audit report on our internal control over
    financial reporting. See page 53 herein.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended July 2,
    2010 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations of Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our
    Chief Financial Officer, does not expect our internal controls
    over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A
    control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
    provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
    objectives of the control system are met. Further, the benefits
    of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
    of the inherent limitations in a system of internal control over
    financial reporting, no evaluation of controls can provide
    absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
    fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations
    include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be
    faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or
    mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the
    individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
    people, or by management override of the control. The design of
    any system of controls is also based in part upon certain
    assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
    be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving



its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because
    of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
    misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
    detected.
